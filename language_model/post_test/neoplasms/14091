The capacity of a cell to repair damage is the first step in preventing the deleterious consequences of DNA structural zzso induced by the exposure to zzso zzso zzso cells, having complex genetic organization, have evolved sophisticated mechanisms for the maintenance of integrity of their zzso and normal cell function zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso However, many DNA repair processes in zzso cells are similar to those in zzso zzso For example, the unique damage reversal mechanism by zzso specific for the repair of zzso results in the restoration of intact zzso base in both bacteria and zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The proteins involved, however, are different and vary in their zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso more closely resembles the bacterial zzso gene product zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso The main zzso specific zzso activity in zzso coli resides in the product of the zzso gene zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso This protein possesses multiple activities including a specificity for the transfer of zzso group from zzso in zzso Such a zzso activity specific for zzso has not been detected in zzso cells either as an individual activity or part of a zzso protein (Brent et zzso zzso Nevertheless, there is tangible evidence for the active removal of zzso in zzso cells, particularly human zzso The nature, level, and mode of the zzso repair activity has not been fully zzso Whether the repair occurs by the well known or some novel zzso has yet to be zzso Recently Boyle et zzso zzso has provided genetic evidence for an alternate mode of repair of zzso in zzso zzso The human cells, that lack zzso activity were able to repair zzso in cellular zzso Additional experiments, with zzso zzso cell lines, indicated a differential specificity for various zzso zzso It has been suggested that in these cells the repair occurs by an zzso process, which is known to recognize the zzso of the DNA duplex rather than the zzso itself zzso and zzso zzso Support for the zzso mechanism is also provided by in zzso experiments, showing repair of zzso by zzso zzso coli ABC zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso It is quite likely that the repair of zzso in zzso cells occurs by a similar zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
