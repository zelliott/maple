zzso of zzso cassette (ABC) zzso is a major zzso advantage used by tumor cells to evade the zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso highly expressed in the cells of the nervous and zzso systems, is associated with zzso transport and drug resistance in cancer cells, including tumor stem zzso Recently, a single zzso zzso zzso in zzso was linked to early onset Alzheimer's disease zzso The characterization of two independent knockout mouse models has shed light on putative in zzso functions of this zzso in the development and maintenance of zzso membrane lipids in the zzso 

The objective of this review is to guide the reader through the existing scope of literature on the zzso zzso focusing on its potential as a future target in human zzso specifically cancer and neurological zzso 

An zzso zzso literature search was conducted to address the growing body of zzso literature that, at the time of publication, included 39 zzso From these, we focused on papers that provided insight into the functional importance of this zzso in tumor stem cells, cancer, drug resistance, Alzheimer's disease and zzso 

These studies have implicated zzso as a therapeutic target in modulating the drug resistance zzso prevalent in human zzso and in the treatment of zzso including Alzheimer's disease and zzso zzso
