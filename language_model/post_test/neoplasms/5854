zzso growth factor zzso is a member of the zzso zzso growth factor family zzso with a distinctive pattern of zzso zzso Studies performed in cell culture suggested that zzso was zzso active only on zzso cells, though from a variety of zzso In contrast, zzso was produced solely by cells of zzso origin, leading to the hypothesis that it might function as a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis and molecular cloning established that the zzso zzso zzso was a zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Many detailed investigations of zzso and zzso expression in whole tissue and cell lines largely substantiated the pattern initially perceived in zzso of zzso and zzso distribution, zzso Moreover, functional zzso in organ culture and in zzso and analysis of agents regulating zzso expression reinforced the idea that zzso acts predominantly on zzso zzso While the data do not zzso a zzso zzso loop in zzso zzso sources of factor or zzso signaling by the zzso might contribute to zzso zzso because of its zzso effects, zzso may zzso processes that culminate in uncontrolled cell zzso
