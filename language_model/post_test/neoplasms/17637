Although zzso is a well-known consequence of long-term total zzso nutrition zzso its zzso as well as the duration of zzso necessary to induce it are still zzso The purpose of this study is to review the changes in serum copper level in 25 patients receiving zzso for a period longer than 2 zzso zzso duration 6 zzso at the zzso zzso zzso of Milan and to evaluate the possible relationship of zzso with the basic zzso Main indications for zzso included zzso zzso (11 zzso cancer zzso (10 zzso radiation zzso zzso zzso and severe zzso zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean value of serum copper at the beginning of the study was 143 zzso zzso zzso value zzso zzso zzso and the zzso analysis showed a mean fall of zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred in four patients (three with zzso zzso and one with radiation zzso zzso at 5th, 6th, 9th, and 6th zzso of zzso zzso No patient with cancer zzso developed zzso No patient with zzso had clinical evidence of a copper zzso zzso We conclude that 1) zzso does not occur within the first month of zzso 2) its zzso is about zzso in patients zzso fed for period longer than 2 zzso 3) it is more frequent in patients with zzso zzso whereas it never occurs in patients with cancer zzso and 4) it is not necessarily associated to a zzso syndrome of copper zzso Finally, the zzso meaning of serum copper should be questioned in cancer patients since it could represent a zzso zzso
