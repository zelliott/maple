zzso clinical trials designed to explore the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso for different zzso sites use large doses per fraction zzso 20, 30 zzso or even zzso The question of whether the zzso zzso model is appropriate to describe radiation response for such large fraction doses has been raised and has not been answered zzso It has been proposed that zzso models, such as the zzso lethal zzso model, could be more appropriate for such large zzso zzso However, such models are not well characterized with clinical data and they are generally not easy to zzso The purpose of this work is to modify the zzso model to more accurately describe radiation response for high zzso zzso A new zzso is introduced in the modified zzso zzso zzso The new zzso introduced is characterized based both on in zzso cell survival data of several human zzso cell lines and in zzso animal zzso zzso The zzso model produces a better fit to the zzso data than the zzso zzso For a high single dose zzso the prediction of the zzso is consistent with that from the zzso zzso Unlike the zzso model, the zzso model retains the simplicity of the zzso model and uses the zzso alpha and beta zzso This work indicates that the standard zzso model can lead to erroneous results when used to calculate zzso with large fraction doses, such as those used for zzso We present a solution to this zzso
