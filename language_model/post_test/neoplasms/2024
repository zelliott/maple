We have studied zzso B zzso in zzso of 13 cancer patients who died after having received 75 to 1,110 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for suspected or proven zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso were measured by zzso liquid zzso zzso and by zzso the latter being done on tissue zzso as well as on tissue zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of the tissue zzso were also tested against three strains of zzso zzso and one strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso B measured by zzso varied with the tested zzso as well as with the total dose of zzso zzso administered and ranged from zzso to zzso zzso A mean of zzso zzso zzso to zzso of the total dose was recovered by zzso from all of the tested zzso zzso of tissue zzso extracts reached 58 to zzso of the concentration measured by zzso whereas only 15 to zzso was recovered from the zzso Overall, zzso of the total dose was recovered from the liver, zzso was recovered from the zzso zzso was recovered from the zzso and zzso was recovered from the zzso The median concentration in zzso was zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso could contribute to zzso B elimination to an estimated range of zzso to zzso of the daily zzso zzso zzso were seldom measured in zzso but zzso zzso were observed and were zzso correlated with zzso B concentration measured by zzso In conclusion, only a small proportion of the zzso B administered as zzso zzso to patients seems zzso and zzso
