Although zzso zzso is clearly related to the cumulative dose zzso zzso cardiac dysfunction has been reported across a wide range of treatment regimens, and its clinical significance is still zzso Purpose of this study is to investigate by exercise zzso for zzso cardiac dysfunction in survivors of pediatric cancer treated with zzso zzso doses, and to evaluate whether it may alter the response of the cardiovascular system to dynamic zzso 

zzso left zzso zzso wall stress zzso left zzso zzso wall dimension and percent zzso at end zzso and zzso exercise zzso indexes of cardiac function were examined in 55 apparently healthy patients zzso age zzso zzso zzso years, median zzso cumulative dose 240 zzso and in 63 zzso 

zzso cardiac dysfunction was identified in 17 patients zzso presenting reduced left zzso zzso wall dimension or percent zzso or increased values of left zzso zzso as compared to controls zzso zzso while the remaining patients formed group zzso zzso oxygen consumption at peak exercise in both groups of patients was the only zzso exercise test variable resulting significantly different between patients and zzso no differences were found among the groups of zzso 

Our results confirm that even patients treated with a median zzso dose of 240 zzso zzso zzso are at considerable risk of exhibiting zzso cardiac dysfunction that, however, does not seem to alter the zzso response of the cardiovascular system to dynamic zzso
