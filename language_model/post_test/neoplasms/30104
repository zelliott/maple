Our aim was to compare pharmacological aspects of two switching strategies from zzso to zzso the stop and go zzso strategy in which zzso is started directly after the initial zzso has been stopped, and the zzso switch zzso in which zzso is gradually changed to zzso by zzso over 3 zzso 

zzso cancer patients with pain and/or zzso side effects were assessed in this zzso zzso zzso serum zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and zzso zzso outcome was number of patients with zzso zzso in apparent zzso on day zzso Secondary outcomes were exposure to zzso during the first 3 days, zzso variation of zzso zzso and correlation between zzso zzso and pain intensity zzso day zzso 

Thirty-five patients received zzso (16 in the zzso group, 19 in the zzso zzso The median zzso zzso equivalent doses were zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group and 800 zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso reached zzso for zzso in the zzso group on day 4 compared with zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso The zzso group was significantly less exposed to zzso and significantly more exposed to zzso in the first 3 zzso zzso showed a low correlation with zzso More patients dropped out after intervention in the zzso group than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso One zzso patient suffered from respiratory depression on day zzso 

The zzso group was initially more exposed to zzso and less to the replaced zzso but without observed clinical benefit and with a higher dropout zzso Patients switched to zzso should be followed closely for the first 5 days, regardless of switching zzso
