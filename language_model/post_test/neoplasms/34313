A theoretical model of zzso control, in a preliminary form, is zzso The model has a critical boundary between a region of values in which the system is stable and essentially zzso and a region in which the essential zzso tend to disappear and not to be zzso The possibility of the transition results from cell zzso Variation in the values of kinetic parameters or fluctuation in the partition of the zzso between the daughter cells of a division subject some cells in the population to the zzso zzso on the wrong side of the critical boundary may accumulate in zzso and will eventually die, at rates and zzso depending on the specific peculiarities of various cell types zzso zzso Such phenomena, in association with the characteristic division patterns predicted by the theory, have been observed in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso in zzso may be an zzso zzso in the future development of the theory are zzso The significance of zzso selection for zzso and perhaps zzso is zzso The theory is briefly contrasted with zzso and zzso zzso and the eventual possibility of constructive intervention in zzso at the molecular level is zzso
