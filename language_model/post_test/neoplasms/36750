The zzso gene is involved in zzso deletions in several types of cancer, including zzso melanoma, zzso and prostate zzso The zzso gene product is a zzso zzso with putative tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso have been reported in approximately zzso of zzso zzso zzso raising the possibility of zzso involvement in these zzso In order to address this question, we analyzed a panel of zzso zzso zzso zzso representative of the main zzso zzso for zzso and zzso deletions of zzso We report zzso zzso site zzso in zzso (2 of 10) of zzso zzso cell lines and in zzso (2 of zzso of primary NHL cases zzso No zzso deletions were found in these zzso Interestingly, this study showed that zzso characterized NHL cases zzso zzso 6) with zzso abnormalities displayed neither zzso deletions nor zzso of zzso These results suggest that a tumor zzso gene distinct from zzso may be involved in zzso deletions in this zzso of NHL zzso
