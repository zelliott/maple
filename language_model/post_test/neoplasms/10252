After zzso cancer risk varies from no increase for several common zzso to a zzso increase for a number of, chiefly zzso zzso The smaller excess of cancer in dialysis has been less well zzso but two studies suggested that impaired immunity might be zzso 

In a zzso cohort study of 28 855 patients who received zzso replacement therapy zzso we zzso incident zzso as zzso kidney disease zzso zzso immune zzso zzso not related to immune zzso or of uncertain status, according to whether they were, or were not, increased in published reports of cancer in zzso prior to starting zzso organ transplantation or human zzso virus zzso zzso zzso ratios for, and excess burdens of, cancer were calculated for all persons normally resident in Australia starting treatment by dialysis or zzso transplantation from 1982 to zzso 

The risk for zzso zzso was increased zzso in dialysis and during transplant zzso For immune zzso zzso the increase was zzso zzso zzso zzso times in dialysis, and zzso after zzso zzso or immune zzso zzso contributed to approximately zzso of the excess burden of cancer, zzso and zzso respectively, in dialysis, and zzso and zzso after zzso The remaining excess zzso was contributed by zzso whose relationship with zzso and immune zzso is not yet zzso 

In zzso the increase in cancer is zzso largely if not zzso to zzso with origins in zzso or related to immune zzso For the former, the cancer risk is similar in dialysis and zzso but for immune zzso zzso the relative risk is much greater after zzso
