We hypothesized that hidden zzso could be detected in patients with zzso stroke without active cancer when they showed the distinctive characteristics of zzso zzso 

Among zzso consecutive patients with acute zzso stroke, patients with zzso stroke were analyzed and zzso into two groups according to the presence of active zzso zzso stroke with active cancer zzso stroke, zzso group and without active cancer zzso zzso Patients with active lung cancer without stroke were also recruited for comparison purposes zzso Clinical factors, zzso patterns on zzso zzso zzso and laboratory findings were analyzed among zzso A total of 348 patients with zzso stroke were enrolled in this zzso Among them, 71 zzso patients had active cancer at the time of zzso The zzso levels were significantly higher in patients with zzso than those with zzso or zzso (both zzso Regarding zzso patterns, patients with zzso mostly had multiple zzso in multiple vascular territories, while more than zzso of patients with zzso had zzso zzso in a single vascular territory zzso zzso levels zzso zzso per 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso patterns zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were independently associated with zzso zzso for hidden zzso was performed during hospitalization in 10 patients who showed elevated zzso levels and multiple zzso involving multiple vascular territories but had no known cancer, and it revealed hidden zzso in all the zzso 

Patients with zzso have distinctive zzso levels and zzso zzso These characteristics can serve as clues to zzso cancer in patients with zzso zzso
