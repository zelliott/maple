zzso zzso from patients with cancer, zzso and zzso heart failure and from a patient with zzso tuberculosis contain measurable levels of tissue zzso zzso zzso Only the cancer patients had levels higher than zzso zzso zzso per zzso The average zzso levels of 29 cancer patients was zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso for the zzso zzso of 22 cancer zzso zzso and 7 of 9 zzso from patients with liver disease were zzso as measured by the zzso of zzso incorporation into zzso zzso zzso from a patient with zzso heart failure and a patient with zzso tuberculosis were not zzso We were unable to obtain a significant correlation zzso between zzso and zzso levels in these zzso In addition, zzso levels remained constant over a period of 18 months of testing, whereas the in zzso zzso activity was lost in 9 to 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso fluid resulted in the zzso and zzso activity zzso in the first large molecular weight peak from the zzso Although the 2 activities zzso together in this zzso the data suggest that zzso is not responsible for the zzso
