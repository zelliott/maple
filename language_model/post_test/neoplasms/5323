zzso human zzso beta zzso zzso was evaluated in a phase 1 clinical trial in which patients with zzso or zzso solid tumors received zzso and zzso in cycle 1 and zzso zzso and zzso beta in cycle zzso zzso zzso beta was given zzso for 5 days in one of three zzso zzso immediately zzso zzso delayed for 5 days after chemotherapy, or zzso zzso with zzso Four dose levels of zzso beta were zzso 20, 50, 100, and 200 zzso The doses of zzso and zzso were not changed between cycle 1 and cycle 2 so that the effect of zzso beta on zzso zzso was zzso 54 patients were entered on study and 42 patients received at least two cycles of therapy and were thus zzso for zzso beta toxicity and for the effect of zzso beta on zzso of zzso and zzso The major zzso of zzso beta were zzso zzso headache, fatigue, and zzso The maximum tolerated dose of zzso beta was not determined since the zzso at all dose levels were zzso However, only zzso patients at the 200 zzso level received all 5 zzso beta zzso We compared the effect of zzso beta on zzso of zzso by comparing peripheral blood count parameters between cycles 1 and zzso zzso beta given zzso significantly increased absolute zzso count zzso zzso and improved zzso recovery times regardless of zzso beta dose zzso zzso count parameters were also improved when zzso beta was given zzso although these changes did not reach statistical zzso Thus, zzso beta exhibited extensive zzso effects but the usefulness of this agent in clinical practice will be limited by extensive toxicity at all tested dose zzso
