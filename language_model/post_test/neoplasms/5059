Although high quality zzso communication is recognized as fundamental to effective cancer care, less attention has been paid to developing an evidence basis for communications surrounding the stage of the cancer journey when primary cancer treatment concludes, management responsibilities shift from zzso specialist services into the zzso care domain, and the patient transitions beyond zzso and into zzso 

Using applied qualitative methodology, we analyzed a database of multiple interviews with 14 Canadian cancer patients from a larger study of changing communication needs and preferences across the cancer zzso Through constant comparative analysis, we generated a zzso summary of interpretive zzso from the patient perspective of communication patterns across the transition from active treatment to zzso 

The accounts illuminate the complexities of the communication environment in which the transition to zzso zzso Communication gaps and zzso by clinicians contributed to the confusion, zzso vulnerability, loss, and abandonment associated with this transition when they failed to accurately and sensitively respond to individual zzso 

Despite increasing recognition of the importance of this transition, communication gaps occur in relation to attending to cues, giving prior zzso avoiding zzso sensitivity to context, managing zzso surfacing zzso and clarifying roles and zzso These findings expand upon previous reports to explain mechanisms zzso interactions between clinicians and patients may significantly shape the transitional experience and set the stage for zzso 

From the perspective of cancer survivors, the transition beyond initial treatment warrants zzso anticipatory and supportive zzso zzso
