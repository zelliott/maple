The cardiovascular impact of cancer therapies on the heart is one of the major concerns in the long-term follow-up of childhood cancer survivors zzso zzso cardiovascular effects include the development of left zzso dysfunction resulting in zzso heart failure and zzso heart disease, as well as zzso and zzso zzso This is mainly ascribed to the cardiotoxic side effects of zzso agents (especially zzso and zzso but other factors such as radiation and inflammation play a role in the effect of childhood cancer on the cardiovascular zzso The most concerning effect is the high zzso of symptomatic heart failure in zzso patients treated with zzso More than 50 % of zzso treated with zzso develop zzso left zzso dysfunction after cancer therapy, with approximately 5 % developing clinical signs of heart failure during long-term zzso Once zzso patients develop zzso heart failure, prognosis is poor and is not influenced by current medical treatment zzso To reduce the long-term burden of cardiovascular disease in pediatric cancer patients, a diversified approach will be zzso In the acute phase, prevention of cardiac damage through the use of zzso agents zzso zzso or by administering less cardiotoxic zzso agents is to be zzso A recent zzso trial suggested that the use of zzso reduced cardiac toxicity without affecting cancer zzso Especially patients requiring high doses of zzso agents could benefit from this zzso Recent data suggest that genetic testing might identify patients at higher risk for zzso This seems mainly related to genes involved in drug zzso This would allow personalized approach adjusting chemotherapy based on cardiovascular risk zzso This could be combined with newer monitoring strategies in the acute phase using newer zzso techniques and zzso screening to identify patients with early damage to the zzso For the long-term zzso zzso early detection and treatment of early dysfunction prior to the development of zzso heart failure could potentially improve long-term zzso zzso healthy lifestyles and controlling additional cardiovascular risk factors zzso zzso diabetes, zzso zzso is an important task for every physician involved in the care of this growing zzso
