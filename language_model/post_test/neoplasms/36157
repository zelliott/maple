Cancer zzso zzso and the emergence of therapeutic resistance are evolutionary phenomena of zzso zzso cell zzso Studies in microbial experimental evolution and the theoretical work inspired by such studies are yielding deep insights into the evolutionary dynamics of zzso zzso yet there has been little explicit consideration of the relevance of this rapidly growing field to cancer zzso Here, we examine how the understanding of zzso selection, and spatial structure in zzso populations that is emerging from experimental evolution may be zzso to zzso Along the way, we discuss some significant ways in which cancer differs from the model systems used in experimental zzso Despite these differences, we argue that enhanced prediction and control of cancer may be possible using ideas developed in the context of experimental evolution, and we point out some prospects for future research at the interface between these traditionally separate zzso
