zzso absorbed dose calculations in zzso therapy are presently based on the assumption of zzso tumor zzso This work examines the effect of dynamic tumor mass zzso and/or zzso on the absorbed zzso 

zzso mass kinetic characteristics were modeled with the zzso equation to simulate tumor growth and an additional exponential term to accommodate tumor shrinkage that may result as a consequence of zzso 

Correction factors, defined as the ratio of the absorbed dose, which was calculated by considering tumor mass zzso to the absorbed dose, which was calculated by assuming zzso mass, are presented for zzso and zzso tumors with different tumor mass zzso The dependence of the correction factor on the effective zzso zzso of the zzso in the tumor and the tumor shrinkage zzso zzso was zzso The correction factors for the zzso tumor were zzso 1 for short zzso and zzso In contrast, the correction factor was less than 1 for long zzso ( zzso 9 zzso The dose correction factors for the zzso tumor were zzso 1 for all zzso and zzso Finally, the zzso method for dynamic masses is illustrated with experimental data on Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso that were treated with zzso 

Correction factors as high as about 10 are likely when zzso and zzso are zzso As zzso increases beyond 20 days, the importance of dynamic mass diminishes because most of the activity zzso before the mass changes zzso In some cases, mass dynamics should be taken into account when the absorbed dose to tumors is zzso
