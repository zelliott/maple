zzso tumor cells zzso can be detected in the peripheral blood of patients with a variety of solid zzso Because of their very low frequency, these tumor cells are not easily detected using conventional zzso zzso In the past decade, numerous groups have attempted to detect zzso of solid zzso using the highly sensitive reverse zzso zzso chain reaction, which has been shown to be superior to conventional zzso However, the biological significance of zzso and the therapeutic relevance of their detection are still zzso This article reviews the most recent findings on this subject, and discusses the potential of identification and molecular characterization of the subset of zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso the zzso value of zzso would provide clinicians with a unique tool for better zzso of patients' risk and provide basic researchers with a new target for the development of novel therapeutic zzso
