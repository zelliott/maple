To define zzso parameters for limiting zzso toxicity with concurrent zzso zzso for zzso cell lung cancer zzso 

A retrospective analysis of patients treated with concurrent zzso at the zzso and Women's Hospital Cancer Center was done with zzso zzso All patients were treated with concurrent zzso All patients underwent 3-D zzso zzso planned with zzso zzso Palo Alto, zzso treatment planning zzso Patients had their esophagus contoured in two ways: the entire esophagus zzso and esophagus zzso zzso Together with clinical zzso dose volume metrics including mean dose, zzso of both structures zzso and zzso were analyzed for correlation with acute zzso zzso grade 3) and late zzso zzso The analyses and graphics were completed using R (R Development Core Team, zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to assess the relationships between zzso factors and swallowing complications while controlling for zzso zzso 

109 patients were studied between 2000 and zzso zzso of patients had grade 3 or greater acute zzso zzso zzso had late zzso zzso with a six-month zzso risk of zzso of zzso zzso zzso Mean dose and zzso for both zzso and zzso significantly correlated with development of acute zzso zzso and zzso for both zzso and zzso significantly correlated with development of zzso On zzso analysis zzso of the zzso and zzso was most zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso to 50% was the best zzso for acute zzso 

In the setting of concurrent zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso is the best predictor of acute zzso
