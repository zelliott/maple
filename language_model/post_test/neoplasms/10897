As a viral gene delivery zzso the zzso zzso zzso particles zzso can be easily generated in large quantities and at low zzso zzso genes of interest can be packaged by the zzso without the involvement of viral genetic material and then delivered into any tissue susceptible to zzso virus zzso to allow gene zzso zzso it should be possible in the future to develop a gene delivery zzso using the human zzso zzso that will allow gene zzso 

Development of a gene delivery zzso using the zzso zzso is reviewed in this zzso The advantages and disadvantages of using zzso zzso for gene delivery are zzso 

Human zzso zzso are readily produced and can be engineered with zzso they allow specific targeting without the presence of any viral genetic zzso For therapeutic purposes, zzso of interest or other compounds can be packaged into the zzso and delivered to zzso cells at high zzso
