The application of zzso zzso zzso of non human origin in the treatment of human diseases is hampered by the zzso of those molecules in zzso The development of molecular biology provides us with the opportunity to overcome the problem of zzso and even allows the development of new zzso zzso These approaches use the zzso as carriers to deliver certain properties zzso + zzso to a specific site in the zzso These properties can be toxic principles like zzso or zzso active zzso zzso activities or specific zzso zzso In addition to the molecular biology of zzso a detailed analysis of the zzso zzso of molecules of zzso size zzso zzso and of small molecules (less than zzso in solid zzso gave rise to a new zzso concept called two phase zzso This concept is based on the separation of the zzso phase, the phase in which the zzso + X zzso zzso at the position where therapy is zzso from the toxic zzso During the toxic phase, a zzso zzso develops a toxic activity by the action of the zzso + X only at the desired zzso This concept is presently converted into practice in numerous different approaches, for example in a two phase tumor zzso in a immune specific zzso zzso chemotherapy zzso and in a concept using Major zzso zzso zzso specific zzso as toxic agents to destroy zzso class I labeled target zzso
