The immediate assistance of a zzso during zzso zzso is not zzso The optimal number of fine needle passes during zzso zzso has not been determined in a prospective zzso The aim of this study was to determine the optimal number of passes required to obtain a correct zzso 

Seven or more passes were made with a fine needle into a variety of zzso during zzso zzso zzso of the zzso diagnosis, and a zzso zzso were recorded after each pass and interpreted zzso by a zzso zzso zzso and zzso clinical follow-up were used as reference zzso The percentage of correctly diagnosed cases was calculated and zzso according to organ, disease group, and zzso characteristics of the zzso 

zzso from 95 patients were zzso into the following locations: zzso zzso zzso and zzso The sensitivity and specificity for 7 passes from the zzso and zzso zzso groups were, respectively, zzso and zzso The sensitivity and specificity for 5 passes from the zzso zzso group were, respectively, zzso and zzso 

During zzso zzso at least 7 passes with a fine needle into pancreatic and zzso zzso and 5 passes into zzso zzso are needed to ensure a high degree of certainty for making a correct zzso
