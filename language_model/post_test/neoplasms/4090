Cancer is a disease that begins with zzso of critical zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso Our research on zzso aromatic zzso indicates that zzso zzso zzso generate zzso zzso found in mouse skin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso These zzso arise by zzso of zzso zzso sites derived from the loss of zzso zzso This relationship led us to zzso that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso results in zzso zzso that zzso bind to DNA to form zzso zzso The zzso zzso sites in critical genes can generate zzso that may initiate various human zzso The zzso zzso zzso are oxidized to zzso and form only stable DNA zzso As reported here, the zzso were bound to DNA in zzso to form the zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso whereas the level of stable zzso was zzso zzso zzso In female zzso rats treated by zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso at four zzso zzso the zzso tissue contained zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso were activated by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso After treatment with zzso rat zzso tissue contained zzso zzso of zzso zzso In each case, the level of stable zzso was zzso These results, zzso by other data, strongly support the hypothesis that zzso are zzso tumor zzso
