The zzso receptors play a key role in protein synthesis and maintain the zzso in normal and diseased state, including zzso at the target zzso when zzso Thus zzso receptors may act as potential targets for selective delivery of different therapeutic agents as they are zzso by a number of zzso zzso The selective delivery of these agents may be a better treatment strategy for zzso cancer as it may also result in zzso and nuclear delivery of zzso zzso In this review, the targeting potential of zzso receptors for the drug or zzso delivery is zzso The zzso that have been proven to be effective for specific zzso receptors can be used as zzso for carrying the drug or zzso system to the desired site of drug action in an optimum zzso This strategy will not only minimize the zzso side effects associated with zzso delivery of drug, but will also maximize the drug zzso zzso zzso as a carrier of zzso prevent passive diffusion of the zzso drug to normal cells, increase the time of circulation and reduce the zzso side effects of a zzso
