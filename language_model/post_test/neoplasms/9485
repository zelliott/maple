zzso gene expression resulting from changes in the zzso modification patterns of the zzso and DNA is collectively termed zzso Such changes are inherited albeit there are no zzso in the DNA zzso zzso regulation of gene expression is implemented by a wide repertoire of zzso and DNA zzso zzso including the zzso and zzso the zzso and zzso among zzso zzso a regulation of these zzso activities zzso a tighter regulation of gene zzso zzso zzso zzso activities lead to zzso gene zzso resulting in several diseases such as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and Spinal and zzso muscular zzso zzso and zzso apart from several forms of zzso particularly zzso leukemia zzso or zzso fusion proteins resulting in the zzso of zzso Thus these zzso have emerged as novel targets for the design of zzso In this direction, several small zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are being reported in zzso This chapter introduces the different zzso zzso zzso involved in gene regulation, their connection to disease manifestation and focuses on the role of small zzso zzso in understanding zzso function and also the design and the evolution of zzso zzso
