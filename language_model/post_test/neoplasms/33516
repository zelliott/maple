zzso bone zzso transplantation is a potentially zzso approach to the treatment of various tumors that are zzso to conventional zzso A major problem associated with the procedure is the possibility of tumor cell contamination in the zzso graft used to zzso the patient's immune system after zzso zzso A variety of different approaches to eliminating tumor cells from bone zzso have been proposed and zzso These include destruction of tumor cells with zzso and complement, use of zzso zzso to drugs or zzso and the physical separation of zzso tumor cells by attachment to magnetic zzso Each of these approaches has different limitations and technical zzso One problem common to all, however, is that the tumor cells most likely to avoid removal are those demonstrating a low level of surface zzso In this paper we have offered a practical approach to amplifying the unique surface zzso expression in order to enable this elusive tumor cell population to be zzso The approach proposed is adaptable to all the techniques currently being zzso since it is designed to add additional zzso to tumor cells which can then be used as targets at which to direct the various zzso zzso
