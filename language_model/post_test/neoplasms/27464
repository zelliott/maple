zzso contributes to the rejection of zzso tumors and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso by different zzso In most tumor transplantation models, tumor rejection requires zzso zzso expression by host cells, but not by tumor zzso zzso produced by either zzso or zzso T cells acts on zzso tumor zzso cells and, either directly or zzso zzso zzso This prevents rapid tumor burden and allows residual tumor cells to be zzso In some models, zzso also contributes to the destruction of existing tumor blood zzso During zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso diffusion by zzso and reduction of DNA zzso This mechanism may primarily protect tissue from damage and simultaneously inhibit tumor zzso
