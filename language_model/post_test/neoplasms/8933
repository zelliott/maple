A wide variety of chemotherapy and zzso agents are available for treating cancer, but a critical challenge is to deliver these agents locally to cancer cells and tumors while minimizing side effects from systemic zzso zzso uses zzso with diameters in the range of zzso zzso to zzso drugs and target them to zzso The zzso enhances local drug delivery efficiency to the tumors via zzso in leaky tumor zzso molecular targeting to cells expressing cancer zzso and/or magnetic zzso In addition, the zzso can be enhanced using triggered release in tumors via chemical, zzso or optical zzso In order to zzso these zzso drug delivery strategies, it is important to be able to image where the zzso distribute and how rapidly they release their drug zzso This Review aims to evaluate the current state of zzso platforms for cancer zzso zzso and diagnostic zzso that are capable of zzso measurement of release zzso
