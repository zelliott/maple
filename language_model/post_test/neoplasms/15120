It has been observed that certain cancer symptoms frequently occur zzso Prior research on symptom patterns has focused mainly on zzso early stage zzso or a single cancer type or zzso zzso Our aim was to explore symptom clusters among zzso with different advanced zzso 

zzso scores by the Edmonton zzso Assessment zzso zzso were routinely collected for patients attending the Oncology zzso Care zzso at Princess Margaret Hospital from January 2005 to October zzso Principal component analysis zzso was performed for the entire patient cohort and within specific disease sites to determine zzso of the nine zzso zzso 

A total of zzso patients was zzso zzso zzso were male and 684 zzso were zzso The median age was 64 years zzso 18 to 74 zzso The most common primary cancer sites were gastrointestinal zzso lung zzso and breast zzso The three most zzso symptoms were fatigue, poor general well-being, and decreased zzso zzso of symptoms for the entire patient cohort revealed two major symptom zzso cluster 1 included fatigue, zzso zzso decreased zzso and zzso which accounted for zzso of the total zzso cluster 2 included anxiety and depression, which accounted for zzso of the total zzso There was high internal reliability in the clusters zzso alpha zzso approximately zzso zzso of symptoms within the various primary cancer sites revealed differences in the pattern of symptom zzso 

In patients with advanced zzso distinct symptom clusters can be identified, which are influenced by primary cancer zzso zzso directed at symptom clusters rather than individual symptoms may provide greater therapeutic zzso Further prospective studies are warranted in order to develop more effective targeted zzso interventions for the advanced cancer patient zzso
