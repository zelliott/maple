The values for zzso zzso sensitivity, or recovery zzso for early and late reactions in human normal zzso are consistent with results from experimental zzso For breast treatments direct analysis indicates that for early reactions zzso is in the range 7 to 11 zzso while for late effects it is in the range 2 to 4 zzso Data on recovery zzso in human zzso is limited but these indicate that recovery may be slower in humans than in zzso For early skin reactions the halftime of recovery is about 1 zzso while for late zzso it is more than 3 zzso zzso values for human tumors are more variable than in zzso some are high zzso and neck, zzso skin, zzso and similar to those for early reacting normal zzso Others are low, including zzso where zzso was estimated at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso where direct analysis of cases surveyed from the literature suggested that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is faster in the zzso of the soft zzso and zzso pillars zzso zzso than in head and neck tumors (up to 1 zzso
