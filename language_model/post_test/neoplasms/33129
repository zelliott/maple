zzso proteins are a large family of zzso zzso that activate signal zzso pathways to control a wide variety of cellular processes such as determination of cell fate, zzso migration, and zzso zzso are capable of signaling through several zzso the zzso being the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stabilize zzso zzso which has implications in the genesis of many human zzso like zzso cell lung cancer, zzso zzso prostate cancer, breast cancer and many zzso In all of these zzso the common zzso is the zzso of target zzso Although detailed mechanisms are not well understood of why zzso are zzso in one tumor and down regulated in another, the zzso of zzso signaling is zzso The zzso itself offers ample targeting zzso points for cancer drug zzso The identification of many important regulatory genes and the mechanism of their function offer an opportunity to develop new therapies targeting this zzso In this review, we describe the roles of several zzso of the zzso signaling zzso in the development of zzso and discuss few strategies that are already developed or can be explored to target key components of the zzso zzso signaling zzso in finding of zzso zzso
