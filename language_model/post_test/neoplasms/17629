zzso cells from eight patients with abdominal zzso and six patients undergoing major surgery for a variety of disease entities were zzso for natural zzso towards zzso K zzso target zzso Patients with abdominal cancer were shown to have relatively weak zzso natural zzso compared with the zzso of zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells from cancer patients showed reduced zzso capacity compared with zzso cells prepared from the zzso of other patients or peripheral blood zzso cells zzso obtained from healthy individuals, whereas the zzso zzso of zzso patients showed the same nylon zzso separation profile as zzso high zzso activity being associated with nylon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso from cancer and zzso patients was enhanced following exposure to human zzso and inhibited by treatment with zzso toxin and simple zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso cells on zzso zzso density zzso demonstrated natural zzso activity to reside predominantly in the low density cell zzso similar to that found with zzso cells from peripheral zzso Thus the properties described here for human zzso zzso cells are similar to those described for peripheral blood zzso cells, suggesting these two zzso cell populations to be closely zzso if not zzso
