zzso production during three different protocols for adoptive zzso for human cancer was zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso zzso was carried out for 13 patients with zzso zzso eight with zzso zzso cell zzso and three with zzso colon zzso The authors estimated total zzso in plasma and zzso zzso killer cells zzso from these patients before and during various treatment zzso to determine if increased zzso production reflects zzso zzso by zzso or zzso zzso They noted an increased synthesis of total zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells and plasma which correlated with zzso zzso Mean plasma zzso were normal zzso zzso zzso zzso before zzso in contrast, zzso increased significantly to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso and zzso + zzso treatment each, zzso Similar zzso zzso were noted irrespective of the different adoptive zzso protocols zzso zzso zzso decreased to normal levels zzso zzso zzso zzso when zzso treatment was zzso zzso zzso with adoptive zzso did not correlate with increased plasma zzso Increased zzso production was also associated with increase in plasma zzso after zzso treatment during adoptive zzso zzso increased zzso induced by zzso zzso of a zzso population, is a zzso consequence not necessarily serving as a signal for the zzso effect associated with adoptive zzso
