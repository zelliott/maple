The interplay among zzso binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso turnover together determines the depth of penetration of zzso zzso into zzso tumor zzso cell zzso A sharp boundary between an outer shell of bound zzso zzso and an inner zzso core has been previously observed and zzso modeled and was termed the zzso site zzso We show here that this process is well described by a simplified shrinking core model wherein binding zzso is much more rapid than zzso This analysis provides the following zzso testable zzso zzso the binding site barrier is a moving boundary whose zzso is zzso to the time integral of zzso concentration at the zzso surface zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso the zzso of this moving boundary is independent of binding zzso if the affinity is sufficiently high to strongly favor zzso complex formation at prevailing zzso zzso and zzso maximum tumor retention is achieved when the zzso zzso rate approaches the rate of zzso zzso zzso The consistency of these predictions with published experimental results is zzso The shrinking core model provides a simple zzso relationship predicting the effects of altered zzso zzso zzso molecular weight, zzso turnover rate, zzso expression level, and zzso size on zzso penetration and zzso For example, a formula is provided for predicting the zzso dose necessary to accomplish tumor zzso as a function of zzso and tumor zzso Furthermore, this analysis indicates certain attributes necessary for an optimal tumor targeting zzso
