Nuclear medicine procedures are the methods of choice for the assessment of the zzso zzso in a volume over zzso zzso zzso zzso is primarily a marker of tumor viability and the zzso of zzso reflects major biological factors like zzso and zzso The correct interpretation of zzso zzso zzso zzso demands the knowledge about the association of quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso data and gene zzso The use of gene zzso is helpful to obtain expression data for a large number of genes from tissue zzso However, limited data are available about quantitative zzso data and gene array zzso Studies in primary liver cancer patients revealed that the zzso zzso was associated with genes related to tumor cell zzso and tumor zzso We noted in patients with giant cell tumors a correlation of the zzso zzso as measured by the standardized zzso value zzso and the cell division cycle 2 zzso gene zzso The effect of therapeutic interventions is dependent on the agent used for zzso In gastrointestinal zzso tumors the change in zzso zzso is most likely due to an zzso zzso However, this may be different in other tumor types and for other treatment zzso therefore dedicated studies of the zzso zzso and gene expression are zzso Based on the recent data available in zzso tumors and gene zzso we were able to demonstrate that at least two key genes of the zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso and zzso have a major impact on the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso functions for the zzso zzso and gene expression data facilitate the calculation of zzso images of the gene zzso reflecting the spatial distribution of zzso in a zzso zzso Currently the development of information management systems for the prediction of clinical relevant information in individual patients is in progress to retrieve the optimum on information from individual zzso patient examinations to support zzso of treatment zzso
