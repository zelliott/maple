In 2002, the National Cancer Institute created the Initiative for Chemical zzso zzso to enable public research using small molecules to accelerate the discovery of zzso zzso zzso The zzso is a zzso research facility consisting of a tightly integrated team of synthetic and zzso zzso zzso developers, zzso screening and automation engineers, zzso scientists, and software zzso The zzso seeks to facilitate the zzso of synthetic chemistry and cancer biology by creating a research environment in which new scientific zzso are zzso To date, the zzso has zzso with 76 biology laboratories from 39 institutions and more than a dozen organic synthetic chemistry laboratories around the country and in zzso All chemistry and screening data are deposited into the zzso web site zzso and are available to the entire research community within a year of zzso zzso is both a data zzso and a data analysis environment, zzso the exploration of chemical and biological information across many different zzso and small zzso This report outlines how the zzso functions, how researchers can take advantage of its zzso chemistry and zzso capabilities, and provides a brief summary of some of the many important research zzso
