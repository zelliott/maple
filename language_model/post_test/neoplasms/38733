zzso regarding tissue organization and radiation response were described and, on the basis of simple zzso tentative conclusions were drawn regarding the influence on zzso doses of tissue organization and the volume of an organ zzso zzso A functional zzso zzso may be defined structurally zzso as in a zzso or only zzso as the largest unit of cells capable of being zzso from a surviving zzso cell without loss of the specified zzso zzso zzso zzso may be arranged in parallel or in zzso in parallel they give rise to graded dose responses, whereas in series, they give rise to threshold zzso or quantum zzso zzso zzso doses are a function of the number and zzso of target cells in an zzso tissue organization and the functional reserve zzso the proportion of functional zzso necessary for adequate organ zzso zzso An influence of treatment volume on zzso doses is more likely to depend upon tissue organization than upon differences in cellular zzso zzso The volume of tissue zzso would be expected to be irrelevant to the zzso of zzso showing a graded dose response zzso skin zzso except when the injury becomes zzso when tolerance for a large severe wound is likely to be less than for a small volume of injury, for zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso arranged in series, for example, spinal zzso or zzso sheath along small zzso should show a zzso zzso zzso dose response zzso should have a lower threshold and be steeper the larger the treatment zzso The effect of increase in volume is greatest with changes in small zzso once a large number of zzso are being zzso a further increase in volume has little effect on the position or slope of the probability curve for such zzso zzso Because their zzso zzso zzso are step, zzso zzso are sensitive to small increases in zzso zzso zzso For example, when the spinal zzso is treated with large dose zzso the biological effectiveness per unit of dose increases zzso Thus, using a large volume together with large dose zzso as could happen in zzso prescriptions, could augment the danger of zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
