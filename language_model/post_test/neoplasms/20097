In a prospective study CT scanning was used to evaluate the precision of zzso zzso placement in zzso in the head and neck or on the chest wall in 30 consecutive patients prior to zzso zzso Patients had zzso zzso from several primary zzso zzso zzso placement was guided by zzso with or without a prior CT zzso zzso placement was confirmed by zzso All zzso were less than 8 zzso 8 zzso 6 zzso zzso zzso W zzso zzso in zzso A mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso range zzso closed-end zzso zzso were inserted zzso by the same experienced radiation zzso zzso zzso zzso were intended to traverse the zzso and base of the zzso mass, and a vertical zzso was often inserted to intersect a horizontal zzso After zzso placement, wire cables with 1 zzso zzso were inserted into the zzso and positions determined using zzso films and CT zzso The success of zzso placement was judged on the following criteria: zzso zzso distribution factor zzso zzso proportion of zzso CT slices zzso by at least one zzso zzso zzso hit ratio zzso zzso average number of zzso in zzso per CT zzso zzso zzso miss factor zzso zzso average number of zzso out of zzso per CT zzso zzso zzso placement index, zzso zzso zzso and zzso distance of nearest zzso from the visually estimated zzso of zzso in the most central zzso CT zzso In the first seven zzso with 3-6 zzso depth zzso zzso was guided by zzso zzso In the next 23 zzso zzso zzso was guided by a prior CT zzso In the latter group, 15 zzso had depth 3-6 zzso while eight zzso had depth zzso or zzso 3 zzso zzso placement by zzso only, without the benefit of CT zzso was much less accurate in terms of the nearest zzso to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the proportion of CT slices with zzso in zzso zzso p zzso zzso and the probability of a zzso being outside the zzso zzso p zzso zzso The zzso placement index zzso was a good measure of the accuracy and zzso of zzso placement in large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of normal tissue structures by zzso precluded accurate zzso placement and led to a low zzso It was difficult to accurately instrument zzso zzso or zzso 3 zzso depth even with the benefit of a prior CT zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
