Plasma levels of selected zzso zzso zzso 3 ( zzso stem cell factor zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso and the tumor marker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso patients were investigated and compared to control groups: benign breast tumor patients and healthy zzso 

zzso levels were determined by zzso CA zzso - using the zzso zzso 

A significant differences in the concentration of zzso (with the exception of zzso and zzso between the groups of BC patients, benign breast tumor patients and the healthy controls have been zzso zzso has demonstrated higher or equal to CA zzso values of diagnostic sensitivity, specificity and the zzso values of positive and negative test zzso The zzso area under the zzso curve zzso was the largest from all the zzso tested and marginally lower than the zzso of CA zzso 

These findings suggest the usefulness of zzso in diagnosing breast cancer, especially when discriminating between cancer and zzso zzso
