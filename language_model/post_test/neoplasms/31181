Winter is energetically zzso zzso and behavioral adaptations have evolved among zzso animals to cope with winter because zzso demands increase when food availability zzso Seasonal breeding is central within the suite of winter adaptations among small zzso Presumably, zzso zzso during winter zzso energy at a time when the adds of producing viable young are zzso In addition to the well-studied seasonal cycles of mating and birth, there are also significant seasonal cycles of illness and death among many populations of zzso and birds in the zzso zzso winter zzso such as low ambient temperatures and decreased food zzso can directly induce death via hypothermia, zzso or zzso In some cases, survival in demanding winter conditions puts individuals under great zzso stress, defined here as an zzso process that results in elevated blood levels of zzso The stress of coping with energetically demanding conditions can also indirectly cause illness and death by compromising immune zzso Presumably, the increased blood zzso of zzso steroids in response to winter zzso compromise immune function and accelerate zzso mechanisms in the field, although the zzso effects of elevated zzso induced by artificial zzso have been investigated primarily in the zzso However, zzso environmental zzso could reduce survival if they evoke persistent zzso zzso The working hypothesis of this article is that mechanisms have evolved in some animals to combat seasonal zzso zzso as a zzso adaptation to promote zzso Furthermore, we zzso that mechanisms have evolved that allow individuals to anticipate periods of zzso challenging conditions, and to cope with these seasonal zzso zzso The primary environmental cue that permits zzso anticipation of season is the daily zzso however, other environmental factors may interact with zzso to affect immune function and disease zzso The evidence for seasonal fluctuations in zzso organ size, structure, immune function, and disease zzso and their possible interactions with zzso environmental zzso is zzso Seasonal zzso of zzso organ size and structure generally occur in late autumn or early winter and seasonal zzso are observed prior to the onset of zzso Although many of the field data suggest that immune function and disease processes are also enhanced during the winter, the opposite seasonal pattern is also observed in some zzso We propose that compromised immune function may be observed in some populations during particularly harsh winters when zzso override the enhancement of immune function evoked by short day zzso Because so many factors zzso in field studies, assessment of our proposal that zzso mediates seasonal changes in immune function requires laboratory studies in which only zzso is zzso A review of the effects of zzso on immune function in laboratory studies reveals that exposure to short day lengths enhances immune function in every species zzso Short day exposure in small zzso causes zzso zzso and zzso reduction in plasma levels of zzso and steroid hormones, as well as zzso in the zzso pattern of zzso zzso zzso These hormones affect immune function, and influence the development of opportunistic diseases, including zzso however, it appears that either zzso or zzso zzso is responsible for zzso the effects of zzso on immune zzso Taken together, day length appears to affect immune function in many species, including animals that typically do not exhibit zzso responsiveness to day zzso
