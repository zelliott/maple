To expand applications for zzso zzso in cancer, we designed a zzso that binds the zzso portion of human zzso and delivers zzso zzso The construct included the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso along with signaling zzso from zzso and zzso zzso forming a zzso zzso termed zzso After zzso expression in human T cells, zzso bound humanized zzso with higher affinity than a control zzso containing the more common zzso zzso zzso of zzso provoked zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and sustained zzso with a mean cell recovery after zzso zzso with zzso zzso cells and zzso of nearly zzso relative to input zzso In contrast, zzso zzso alone produced no zzso zzso T cells specifically killed zzso cells and primary chronic zzso leukemia cells in combination with zzso at a low zzso ratio, even when zzso on zzso zzso zzso triggered zzso killing of zzso zzso breast and gastric cancer zzso similar results were obtained with an zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso T cells with zzso zzso exerted considerable zzso activity in zzso Signaling zzso by zzso induced higher zzso zzso zzso and zzso than zzso or zzso and the zzso was expressed effectively after zzso zzso without viral zzso zzso clinical zzso Our results offer zzso proof of concept for zzso as a universal, next-generation zzso zzso with the potential to augment the efficacy of zzso therapies for zzso
