zzso zzso are key players in shaping zzso structure, and, thus, in regulating fundamental cellular processes such as zzso segregation and gene zzso Emerging evidence points towards a role for zzso zzso in contributing to tumor zzso and, recently, the first zzso zzso in a zzso zzso gene was zzso In addition, genetic zzso of the zzso zzso that specifically regulate zzso incorporation of zzso zzso are rapidly being uncovered in numerous zzso zzso these findings zzso zzso zzso as potential drivers of cancer initiation and/or zzso and, therefore, targeting zzso deposition or the zzso zzso machinery may be of therapeutic zzso Here, we review the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso families in their respective cellular functions, and their involvement in tumor zzso
