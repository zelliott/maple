A model is presented in this paper to describe how the contrast of a reconstructed object and slice sensitivity profile are affected by zzso the table speed or zzso pitch, zzso the zzso zzso zzso the size of the object, zzso the alignment between the reconstructed slice and the object, zzso the distance of the object from the axis of zzso and zzso the zzso CT reconstruction zzso zzso This contrast model is validated by both computer simulations and zzso With this model, the contrast of a reconstructed object, slice sensitivity profile, and the zzso zzso can be accurately zzso The optimal scan strategy and the point of diminishing returns can be determined prior to zzso Several conclusions can be drawn from this zzso First, overlapping reconstruction significantly improves overall scan contrast sensitivity of zzso zzso Second, with a given zzso zzso low pitch zzso scans provide better zzso zzso Third, with a given volume coverage rate zzso a given table zzso narrow zzso high pitch zzso scans provide better zzso resolutions than wide zzso low pitch ones and therefore are recommended for zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso model is also zzso
