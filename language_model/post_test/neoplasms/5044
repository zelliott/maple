In cancer, genetic and zzso zzso ultimately culminate in zzso zzso of signal zzso pathways driving the zzso zzso zzso or biological zzso of such pathways holds significant promise with respect to devising rational therapy for zzso Thus, technical concepts pursuing robust characterization of zzso activity in tissue samples from cancer patients have been subject of zzso In the present review we provide a comprehensive overview of these techniques and discuss their advantages and disadvantages for systems biology approaches to identify zzso targets in zzso zzso Recent advances in the development and application of zzso zzso zzso activity screens show great promise in overcoming the zzso between the evaluation of zzso cell signaling in specific zzso or even individual patients and the currently available ensemble of highly specific targeted treatment zzso These developments have the potential to result in a more effective selection of zzso zzso and thus zzso zzso zzso therapeutic zzso Given the results from current research on the tumor zzso generating network views on zzso tumor cell signaling is critical to meet this zzso
