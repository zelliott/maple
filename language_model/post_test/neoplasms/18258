Identification of the cell surface zzso and comparison of their expression between cells with different zzso characteristics is crucial to the discovery of novel cancer drug targets as well as zzso the basic zzso processes of zzso However, cell surface zzso are complex and technologically challenging, and no ideal method is currently zzso Here, we describe a strategy that allows scanning of the entire cell surface and identification of molecules that exhibit altered expression between two cell zzso zzso this method gives rise to valuable zzso for further characterization of the identified zzso The strategy is based on zzso zzso of mice, and we used the two zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso derived from the zzso cancer cell line, as a model zzso Although the two cell lines are equally zzso only zzso has zzso zzso Our results yielded a large panel of zzso zzso zzso that recognized cell surface markers zzso or exclusively expressed on zzso vs zzso cancer zzso Four zzso and their corresponding zzso were further zzso zzso analysis on an extended panel of breast cancer cell lines demonstrated that the four zzso bound zzso to cell lines known to be zzso in zzso suggesting that these markers have general zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso reacted zzso with neuroendocrine tumors while exhibiting no or very weak zzso with normal zzso zzso zzso stained a variety of zzso as well as some normal zzso zzso and was subsequently identified to react with zzso A third zzso zzso that also specifically recognized zzso was capable of zzso the growth of zzso melanoma cells in zzso Further, we found that the reduced expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells of this model was not regulated by class II zzso but by zzso zzso The study demonstrates the advantage of using the exquisitely discriminating recognition system of the immune system itself to scan the cell surface zzso for zzso expressed zzso The zzso zzso strategy should be broadly zzso as a quantitative and comparative zzso approach for screening the cell surface and also allow generation of zzso to study these cell surface zzso in more zzso
