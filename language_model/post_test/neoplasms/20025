zzso and zzso are zzso zzso that belong to the zzso family and are involved in zzso In our screen for small molecules zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity in in zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was also inhibited by zzso less zzso than zzso in zzso zzso in zzso zzso exhibited growth zzso of various cancer cell lines including zzso lung cancer cells with a zzso of 48 zzso zzso treatment in zzso cells increased the zzso form of zzso which is a zzso of zzso The zzso levels of zzso a zzso zzso were also increased by zzso treatment zzso Several zzso derivatives were zzso to determine the preliminary zzso relationship of zzso Some of the zzso derivatives showed highly selective zzso against zzso In conclusion, this study presented zzso as a potent zzso inhibitor with zzso zzso
