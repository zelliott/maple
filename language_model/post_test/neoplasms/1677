To assess mortality associated with hormone replacement in younger and older zzso zzso 

A comprehensive search of zzso zzso and zzso databases was performed to identify zzso controlled trials of hormone replacement therapy from 1966 to September zzso The search was zzso by scanning selected journals through April 2003 and references of identified zzso zzso trials of greater than 6 months' duration were included if they compared hormone replacement with zzso or no treatment, and reported at least 1 zzso 

Outcomes measured were total deaths and deaths due to cardiovascular disease, cancer, or other zzso zzso ratios zzso for total and zzso mortality were reported separately for trials with mean age of participants less than and greater than 60 years at zzso 

zzso data from 30 trials with zzso participants showed that the OR for total mortality associated with hormone replacement was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso replacement reduced mortality in the younger age group zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but not in the older age group zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso For all ages combined, treatment did not significantly affect the risk for cardiovascular or cancer zzso but reduced mortality from other causes zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso replacement therapy reduced total mortality in trials with mean age of participants under 60 zzso No change in mortality was seen in trials with mean age over 60 zzso
