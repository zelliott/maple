zzso zzso therapy zzso is expected to improve treatment results with fewer side effects than other zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the tumor sites for which zzso was effective under the same beam calculation conditions by planning zzso for typical cases treated with passive scattering zzso therapy zzso We selected 16 cases of zzso zzso zzso liver or prostate zzso as typical tumor sites receiving zzso The dose zzso and dose volume zzso zzso by the zzso were compared with those zzso by the zzso We took particular note of the doses to the skin and zzso at risk zzso when zzso was replaced by zzso Furthermore, an improvement of the beam angles was also performed to obtain better dose zzso in the zzso The zzso with the same beam angles resulted in zzso doses to the skin of average zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso doses for zzso zzso zzso liver, and prostate zzso zzso However, it was difficult to improve the dose zzso of the target zzso The change of the zzso beam angles could reduce the doses to zzso and skin in the case of the zzso zzso while it had limited effect in the other zzso We concluded that zzso was effective for reducing the doses to some zzso when treating zzso zzso zzso liver and prostate zzso The selection of beam angles was important in the zzso zzso especially for zzso cavity zzso
