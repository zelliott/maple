The establishment of cancer in a host involves at least two major events: the escape of tumor cells from normal growth control and their escape from zzso zzso Because of this nature of their development, cancer cells seem to be zzso poorly zzso In contrast to the previous idea that cancer cells express no recognizable zzso recent progress in the identification and characterization of tumor zzso as well as the expansion of knowledge on the cellular and molecular mechanisms of zzso recognition by the immune system, have raised the possibility of using zzso to treat certain zzso Information on these mechanisms has been obtained in three crucial zzso 1) the role of zzso in the regulation of the immune response, 2) the molecular characterization of tumor zzso in both mouse and human tumors, and 3) the molecular mechanisms of T cell zzso and zzso zzso Such information has provided new insight into tumor zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso DNA technology allows for modification of the zzso of zzso cells for therapeutic purposes in several zzso Several novel strategies have been developed to derive genetically modified tumor cells and use them as cellular vaccines to induce zzso immunity in animal tumor zzso This combined zzso of genetically modified tumor cells and zzso has been termed zzso therapy of zzso zzso to this approach has been the ability to transfer into normal or zzso cells genes known to increase the zzso of cells, which subsequently can be used to augment immune reactions in zzso mice or cancer zzso While there has been success in inducing zzso immunity in some tumor models, there are difficulties and limitations in the application of these zzso tumor cells for the treatment of zzso zzso In this review, recent progress in cancer zzso therapy is zzso
