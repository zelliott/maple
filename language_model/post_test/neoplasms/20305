There is, at present, considerable interest in the possible role for the zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of cancer zzso zzso evidence for such a role is based on the observation that chronic administration of many of these zzso either alone or in zzso can reproduce the myriad of host responses seen in experimental and human cancer zzso zzso plasma levels of tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso have rarely been detected in patients or experimental animals with cancer, although zzso levels appear to correlate with tumor progression in animal zzso The strongest evidence for a zzso role for zzso has come from zzso studies in which zzso animals have been passively zzso with zzso directed against individual zzso Several groups have shown modest but significant improvements in food intake and lean tissue retention with zzso directed against tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, there has been no consistent finding that one zzso is universally involved in cancer zzso in zzso distinct tumor zzso One ominous finding in several tumor models has been that the zzso production of zzso appears to support tumor zzso Such findings raise the intriguing possibility that these zzso although contributors to tissue wasting and zzso may also serve the tumor as either direct or indirect cell growth zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
