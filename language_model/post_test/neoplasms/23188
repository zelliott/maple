To analyze the relationship of ideal cardiovascular health to zzso zzso 

We used data from the zzso Center zzso Study from October 9, 1987, to March 3, 1999, to estimate the prevalence of ideal cardiovascular health in zzso individuals zzso zzso and to examine its relationship with deaths from all causes, cardiovascular disease zzso and zzso 

During a mean follow-up of zzso years, zzso deaths zzso 70 zzso from zzso and zzso zzso from zzso In the entire zzso only 29 individuals zzso had 7 ideal zzso After adjusting for age, sex, examination year, alcohol zzso and parental history of zzso risk of death due to zzso was zzso lower in those participants who met 3 or 4 ideal metrics zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and zzso lower in those with 5 to 7 ideal metrics zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso compared with those who met 0 to 2 ideal zzso Although not zzso there was also a trend toward lower risk of death due to all causes across incremental numbers of ideal zzso No association was observed for deaths due to zzso 

The prevalence of ideal cardiovascular health was extremely low in a middle-aged cohort of men and women recruited between 1987 and zzso The American Heart Association construct reflects well the subsequent risk of zzso as reflected by graded zzso mortality in relation to the number of ideal zzso
