PET and zzso are molecular imaging techniques that use zzso molecules to image molecular interactions of biological processes in zzso PET imaging technologies have been developed to provide a zzso to the patient from the experimental zzso of biological and pharmaceutical sciences in genetically engineered and tissue transplanted mouse models of zzso PET provides a novel way for molecular therapies and molecular zzso to come together in the discovery of molecules that can be used in low mass amounts to image the function of a target and, by zzso the mass, to zzso modify the function of the zzso In both cases, the molecules are the same or zzso of each zzso PET can be used to zzso drugs to their sites of action within organ systems in zzso and to zzso biological outcomes of the processes being modified in the mouse and the zzso The goal is to provide a novel way to improve the rates of discovery and approval of zzso and zzso zzso this relationship into clinical practice can improve drug use by providing molecular zzso in concert with molecular zzso Diseases are biological zzso and molecular imaging with PET is sensitive and zzso to these zzso This sensitivity is exemplified by the detection of disease with PET without evidence of zzso changes on CT and zzso These biological changes are seen early in the course of disease, even in zzso zzso as illustrated by the zzso abnormalities detected with PET and zzso in zzso and familial Alzheimer's diseases 7 and 5 zzso respectively, before symptoms zzso zzso of viable from zzso tissue is fundamentally a zzso question, as shown by the use of PET to differentiate patients with coronary artery disease who will benefit from zzso from those who will zzso Although beginning within a specific organ, cancer is a systemic disease the most devastating consequences of which result from zzso zzso PET imaging with zzso enables inspection of zzso metabolism in all organ systems in a single examination to improve the detection and staging of cancer, selection of therapy, and assessment of therapeutic zzso In lung and zzso zzso melanoma, and lymphoma, PET zzso improves the accuracy of detection and staging from zzso to zzso over conventional zzso and results in treatment changes in zzso of the patients, depending on the clinical zzso zzso zzso are upstaged because zzso zzso are zzso and zzso are zzso because a structural diagnosis of zzso is changed from zzso to zzso Similar results are now being shown for other zzso The main difference between CT, zzso zzso and PET or zzso is not zzso but, rather, a difference between detecting and characterizing a disease by its zzso features as opposed to its zzso The importance and success of developing new molecular imaging zzso is increasing as PET becomes integral to the study of the zzso zzso biology of disease and as molecular therapies targeting the biological processes of disease are zzso
