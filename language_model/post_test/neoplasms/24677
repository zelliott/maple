The completion of the Human Genome Project and the achievement of similar goals in other organisms have generated a huge amount of free available information with high potential in biomedical zzso However, the identification of the DNA sequence was only a starting point for zzso zzso This research has been facilitated by the development of new powerful zzso tools that allow the use of the wide amount of zzso information generated to address new biological and biomedical zzso One of these widely accepted and accessible technologies is DNA zzso Although the most popular use of DNA zzso is gene expression zzso due to the continuous advances in zzso technologies, scientists have also successfully used them for multiple applications, including zzso zzso DNA copy number analysis and DNA zzso In short, DNA zzso are changing the way cancer research scientists are addressing different biological questions and will allow the translation of zzso research to clinical zzso
