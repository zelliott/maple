Several methods for the recruitment of circulating zzso cells zzso to be used for zzso rescue after zzso therapy have been zzso The present study was designed to verify the effectiveness and zzso of one of such procedures, involving the administration of high-dose zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso 

Eight tumor patients were treated with zzso (7 zzso followed by zzso (7 zzso continuous zzso from day zzso to the completion of zzso recovery, when zzso for zzso harvesting were zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso for zzso zzso units zzso zzso zzso units zzso and zzso zzso units zzso before therapy as well as during the zzso zzso 

In each patient, a significant increase of zzso zzso was observed, at a mean of 14 days from zzso with peak zzso of zzso 268 and zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The mean duration of zzso count zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso days, with severe zzso zzso 4 zzso lasting zzso days in 5 zzso zzso infusion was well tolerated without any need for dose reduction or zzso 

The administration of zzso and zzso zzso a significant enhancement of zzso including zzso other than zzso and zzso The procedure is suitable for the recruitment of zzso in patients with zzso sensitive zzso
