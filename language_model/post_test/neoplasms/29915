Studies were completed to establish the comparative zzso of zzso zzso and other zzso in human bone zzso stem cells and several cultured human tumor cell lines zzso zzso and zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso colon zzso zzso pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso were used to measure zzso following a zzso drug zzso zzso was less potent than was zzso or zzso in all cells zzso exhibiting its best activity against the zzso zzso that prevented 50% zzso growth compared to zzso control zzso zzso 32 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 35 zzso breast zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 41 zzso Intermediate activity was observed against zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 150 zzso gastrointestinal zzso zzso had very poor activity against the zzso leukemia zzso zzso 470 zzso The suppression of the zzso growth of human bone zzso stem cells required the greatest amount of zzso zzso zzso 580 zzso With use of these studies, a therapeutic ratio zzso that prevented zzso zzso growth compared to zzso control of bone zzso divided by zzso of zzso was calculated for each drug in each zzso zzso had values ranging from zzso to zzso for the solid tumors and zzso in zzso zzso This was in marked contrast to zzso or zzso which failed in all cases to have ratios greater than or equal to zzso The results indicate that zzso can exhibit a zzso selectivity for human tumor cells compared to human bone zzso stem cells that does not exist for zzso or zzso This suggests that zzso may be of greater therapeutic benefit in the treatment of certain human zzso than the zzso used zzso
