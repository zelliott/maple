The effectiveness of zzso aspiration biopsy zzso for rendering a specific diagnosis can be improved by applying several ancillary zzso This review details several applications of molecular techniques using zzso specimens with an emphasis on those used for patient zzso A detailed search of the literature was conducted to collect all reports that used zzso for different types of molecular zzso Several types of molecular tests, including zzso zzso zzso chain reaction, Southern zzso and gene zzso using zzso specimens have been zzso These tests have been used with different organ systems and different zzso including the detection of cancer cells, diagnosis, distinction of benign and zzso disease, prediction of response to chemotherapy, risk assessment, and selection of patients for targeted zzso Except for a few tests such as assessment of zzso for gene amplification in breast cancer, detection of zzso in zzso zzso and specific zzso zzso in the former and in the diagnosis of soft tissue zzso most of the molecular tests using zzso specimens are currently zzso The reported literature indicates the excellent potential of using material procured from zzso for almost any type of molecular zzso Whereas few of these tests alone are used for patient care, some of them have the potential for clinical use in the near zzso
