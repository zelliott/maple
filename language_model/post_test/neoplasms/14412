The appearance of clinically zzso zzso is the zzso of a complex set of biological processes only few cancer cells are capable to zzso zzso colonization comprises the most inefficient zzso steps as it requires a fine-tuned zzso between the zzso cancer zzso cells and their host zzso The origin of the cancer cell and its intrinsic properties are factors that together with the organ zzso and circulation patterns determine the site of zzso spread, the dormancy period and the extent of zzso zzso Recent advances provide novel insights into the molecular components required for zzso zzso the composition of zzso zzso niches in different zzso and the cancer zzso zzso
