zzso zzso is an zzso agent targeted specifically against zzso We have investigated the zzso effects of zzso against human cancer cell lines and freshly zzso human tumor zzso Ten human cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso and human tumor specimens from 72 patients were used for in zzso studies in a cloning zzso zzso Cell lines and primary tumor cells were exposed to zzso for either 1 h or 7 days, or for 1 h or 21 zzso At clinically achievable zzso of zzso zzso of cell growth was observed for zzso zzso and zzso cancer cell lines in a concentration dependent zzso Patient specimens exposed 1 h or 21 days to 1,400 zzso zzso demonstrated zzso rates of 24 and zzso zzso zzso zzso effects were observed in breast, zzso zzso zzso cell lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, and zzso In addition to its established zzso effects, zzso has direct zzso activity against established human cancer cell lines and primary tumor zzso This warrants further clinical development in tumors which have been identified to be potentially sensitive to zzso
