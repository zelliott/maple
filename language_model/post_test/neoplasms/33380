zzso zzso represent a class of small, zzso zzso These small zzso are involved in diverse biological zzso and it has been predicted that about one third of human zzso zzso zzso appear to be zzso targets, underlying the major influence of zzso on almost all cellular zzso zzso from the normal pattern of zzso expression has been implicated in several zzso Among human diseases, it has been shown that changes in zzso expression correlate with various human zzso Thus, zzso profiling could contribute to more precise tumor zzso and better prediction of the therapeutic zzso This chapter summarizes these recent findings and highlights the technical advances in zzso probe preparation, zzso expression profiling and target zzso
