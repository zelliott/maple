To develop and provide initial validation for zzso zzso prediction model for disability status zzso a zzso of performance status zzso among older zzso The model was designed to augment information on health status at the point of cancer diagnosis in studies using insurance claims to examine cancer treatment and zzso 

We used data from the zzso Medicare Current zzso zzso zzso with observations randomly split into zzso and validation zzso We developed an zzso linking zzso functional status measures to a zzso scale, a proxy for the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group zzso zzso zzso The zzso measure was zzso to focus on good zzso zzso versus poor zzso zzso zzso We identified potential zzso zzso and estimated zzso zzso zzso models, with poor zzso as the dependent measure, using a zzso approach to select the optimal zzso zzso zzso was tested by determining whether the predicted zzso measure generated by the model was a significant predictor of survival within a validation sample from the zzso 

zzso of the beneficiaries met the definition for poor zzso The base model yielded high sensitivity zzso and specificity zzso positive zzso zzso and negative zzso zzso zzso and good model zzso zzso poor zzso zzso was associated with an increased hazard of death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The ability to assess zzso should improve zzso control and reduce indication bias in zzso studies of cancer treatment and outcomes based on insurance zzso
