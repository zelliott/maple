Amsterdam Airport zzso is a major source of complaints about aircraft noise, safety risks and concerns about long term adverse health effects, including zzso We investigated whether residents of the area around zzso are at higher risk of developing cancer than the general Dutch zzso 

In a zzso study using the regional cancer registry, we estimated the cancer zzso during zzso in residents of the area surrounding zzso We defined a study area based on aircraft noise contours and zzso postal code areas, since historical data on ambient air pollution were not available and recent zzso data did not differ from the background urban air zzso 

In residents of the study area 13 zzso cancer cases were zzso which was close to the expected number, using national zzso rates as a reference zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso We found a statistically significantly increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso mainly due to high rates for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of cancer of the respiratory system was statistically significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso due to the low rate in males zzso zzso In the core zone of the study area, cancer zzso was slightly higher than in the remaining ring zone zzso ratio of the core zone compared to the ring zone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This was caused by the higher zzso of cancer of the respiratory system, prostate and the female zzso zzso in the core zone in comparison to the ring zzso 

The overall cancer zzso in the zzso area was similar to the national zzso The moderately increased risk of zzso zzso could not be explained by higher levels of ambient air pollution in the zzso zzso This observation warrants further research, for example in a study with focus on substances in urban ambient air pollution, as similar findings were observed in Greater zzso
