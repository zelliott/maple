The metabolism of cancer cells is zzso both by zzso signaling and by zzso of zzso zzso The resulting altered metabolism supports cellular proliferation and survival but leaves cancer cells dependent on a continuous supply of zzso Thus, many zzso zzso have become targets for new cancer zzso Recently, two zzso of specific zzso of zzso zzso and zzso been shown to be crucial for the adaptation of tumor cells to changes in zzso zzso An increasing number of approved and experimental zzso target these two zzso A better understanding of the molecular basis of zzso zzso changes may lead to improved cancer zzso
