The combination of zzso low plasma zzso and zzso levels, low natural killer zzso cell activity, skeletal muscle wasting or muscle fatigue, and increased rates of zzso production defines a complex of abnormalities that is tentatively called zzso zzso zzso These symptoms are found in patients with zzso infection, cancer, major injuries, zzso Crohn's disease, zzso zzso chronic fatigue syndrome, and to some extent in zzso zzso The coincidence of these symptoms in diseases of different zzso origin suggests a zzso zzso The low zzso cell activity in most cases is not zzso but may be disastrous in zzso infection because it may compromise the initially stable balance between the immune system and virus, and trigger disease zzso This hypothesis is supported by the coincidence observed between the decrease of zzso T cells and a decrease in the plasma zzso zzso In addition, recent studies revealed important clues about the role of zzso and zzso in the development of skeletal muscle zzso Evidence suggests that 1) the zzso level is regulated primarily by the normal zzso skeletal muscle protein zzso 2) the zzso level itself is a zzso regulator of nitrogen balance and body cell mass, 3) the zzso regulatory circuit is compromised in various zzso conditions, including old age, and 4) zzso supplementation may be a useful therapy if combined with zzso treatments such as zzso therapy in zzso zzso
