The zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso is a member of zzso zzso zzso functioning as a link between the zzso zzso shock protein zzso and zzso systems, playing a vital role in maintaining the protein zzso in the zzso zzso has been demonstrated to be involved in zzso proliferation and invasion in several zzso regulating a number of zzso zzso However, zzso has also been implicated in the zzso of tumor zzso zzso The zzso mechanism of zzso expression in human zzso is not yet clear, and a number of studies have suggested that zzso may have opposing roles in different zzso zzso many studies have focused on the relationship between zzso and zzso 

A literature search focusing on regulation network, biological function and clinical significance of zzso in connection with its role in cancer development was performed on the zzso zzso 

zzso may be a potential diagnostic zzso and therapeutic target for human cancer, and may play different roles in different human zzso This zzso might be induced by the diversity of zzso downstream targeting zzso zzso the zzso determined by zzso should be dependent on the function of its specific targets in a specific type of cancer zzso Whether zzso contributes to tumor progression or suppression in various human zzso remains zzso suggesting the necessity of further extensive investigation of its role in zzso
