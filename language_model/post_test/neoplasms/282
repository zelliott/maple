It has been shown that the mathematical evaluation of data from many cell kinetic experiments, published up to 1977, was rather zzso The discrepancies between published values of growth fraction zzso and the cell loss factor zzso and the results of new calculations based on the same values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are sometimes zzso Using a suitable approximation of zzso the known zzso for zzso and zzso are replaced by simpler ones of sufficient zzso This may help to avoid zzso errors in future cell kinetic studies of zzso
