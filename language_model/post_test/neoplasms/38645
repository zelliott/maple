The zzso Physics Center zzso under contract with the National Cancer Institute zzso has conducted zzso quality assurance zzso zzso at the five zzso Equipment zzso Centers involved in evaluating the clinical efficacy of a variety of devices for delivering heat treatments to zzso human zzso A summary of the zzso zzso results, testing procedures, standards, criteria, conclusions and recommendations are presented in this zzso The zzso review zzso indicate zzso that zzso per cent of temperatures surveyed were within the zzso degrees C zzso criterion zzso per cent were within zzso degrees zzso zzso that only 66 per cent of power indications were within the 10 per cent zzso zzso that the heat patterns in a phantom produced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had significant zzso zzso that each treatment facility had at least a few potentially zzso locations where the maximum permissible American National zzso Institute standards of electromagnetic leakage were zzso and zzso that these levels of accuracy and safety were achieved only after stringent zzso zzso zzso From the combined data, it is concluded that the temperature accuracy in this cooperative trial was sufficient to justify a common analysis of clinical data as presented in this zzso Also, stringent quality control of every zzso must continue to be stressed in all future zzso zzso
