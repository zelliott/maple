zzso zzso and their zzso zzso from zzso such as zzso zzso lentil and zzso are a class of zzso zzso zzso which have potential zzso properties within the gastrointestinal zzso zzso can resist both zzso conditions and the action of zzso zzso and transit through the stomach and small zzso without major degradation, permitting significant amounts to reach the large zzso in active form to exert their reported zzso and zzso zzso These potential pharmacological benefits have been linked recently to the intrinsic ability of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso and the data suggest that both zzso and zzso zzso involved in zzso should be considered as potential targets of zzso However, the therapeutic targets and the action mechanisms of zzso remain zzso Their zzso will provide insights into the properties of these plant zzso zzso as zzso zzso agents, providing a strong base for the development of zzso crops and their products as zzso zzso zzso The deployment of modern zzso tools and zzso sequence information are underpinning studies of natural and induced zzso in zzso zzso markers for zzso zzso with improved properties can be exploited ultimately in zzso breeding zzso to assist the zzso of such zzso genes and the development of superior zzso for human zzso
