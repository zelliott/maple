Protection from cancer and ensured longevity are tightly linked in zzso One of the fundamental mechanisms contributing to both is the cellular response to DNA zzso The appropriate response is an initial attempt at repair, but if the damage is too extensive or compromises DNA zzso a zzso cascade triggers cellular zzso or zzso Evidence in mice and humans suggests a division of tasks amongst DNA repair zzso zzso repair and zzso zzso repair of zzso zzso are predominantly responsible for longevity zzso whereas zzso repair of zzso zzso provides protection against zzso Similarly, the zzso component of the zzso response might contribute zzso to zzso outcomes depending on its set point: an inadequate response to DNA damage sanctions zzso but might limit local zzso whereas zzso zzso provides cancer protection but zzso zzso
