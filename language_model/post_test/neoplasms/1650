The biotechnology revolution offers unprecedented opportunities for identification of zzso zzso that report and predict cancer and other zzso The combination of zzso technologies with a knowledge of gene sequence and sequence conservation has made available markers that facilitate the correlation of genetic variation with biological zzso and zzso technologies allow efficient zzso characterization of functional zzso new markers of the zzso of individuals to cancer development, and of tumor zzso to specific zzso New therapeutic agents targeted to individuals with specific genetic or zzso characteristics already zzso The powerful zzso technologies allow efficient monitoring of gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso making it possible to monitor a large number of key cellular pathways zzso This has enabled the identification of key zzso and signaling molecules associated with cell growth, cell death, and cellular zzso These new markers are zzso monitoring of functional zzso molecular and cellular damage, and zzso zzso imaging technologies have made it feasible to image some of these molecular events zzso To meet the challenge of evaluating and developing consensus criteria for the application of these new technologies and zzso consortium approaches are being increasingly undertaken to share resources and to build a common understanding among the research, industry, and regulatory zzso These developments promise more efficient pharmaceutical product development, safer and more zzso drugs, and provide clinical practitioners with new and better zzso for cancer zzso patient monitoring, and choice of zzso
