The demonstration that Ras requires zzso for its zzso activity led several groups of investigators to an intense search for zzso and zzso zzso as potential zzso zzso zzso design of small organic molecules that mimic the zzso terminal zzso zzso site on Ras resulted in pharmacological agents capable of zzso Ras processing and selectively zzso zzso zzso and suppressing human tumor growth in mouse models without side zzso These agents presently are undergoing advanced zzso zzso This review describes the efforts of several groups to design, zzso and evaluate the biological activities of several classes of zzso zzso Several important issues, such as mechanism of action of zzso zzso and potential mechanisms of resistance to zzso of zzso zzso are also zzso
