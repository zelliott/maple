An international collaboration was organized to undertake a zzso exchange to enable the future combination of clinical data from different centers conducting zzso capture therapy zzso As a first step zzso I) the zzso group from the Americas, represented by zzso visited the clinical centers at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the Nuclear Research Institute zzso at zzso zzso zzso A combined zzso group zzso with a visit to zzso Each participant performed a series of zzso zzso under equivalent zzso conditions using methods appropriate to their clinical zzso This entailed zzso zzso and dose versus depth zzso in a large water zzso zzso zzso flux as well as fast zzso and zzso absorbed dose rates were zzso zzso agreement in determining absorbed dose within the experimental uncertainties was obtained between the different groups although the measurement uncertainties are large, ranging between zzso and zzso depending upon the dose component and the depth of zzso To improve the precision in the zzso of absorbed dose amongst the participants, the individually measured dose components were zzso to the results from a single zzso Assuming a zzso concentration of 15 zzso zzso that is typical of zzso realized clinically with the zzso delivery compound zzso systematic discrepancies in the zzso of the total biologically weighted dose of up to zzso were apparent between the different zzso The results from these zzso will be used in future to zzso treatment plan calculations between the different clinical zzso protocols as Part II of this zzso
