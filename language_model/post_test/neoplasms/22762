zzso interactions between zzso and their zzso play an essential role during cancer zzso zzso of these proteins by zzso or zzso is critical for their zzso Using quantitative zzso we demonstrated that zzso and zzso are the zzso zzso expressed in zzso cell line, while zzso is heavily expressed by multiple cancer cell lines including the prostate cancer cell line zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso cells by small interference zzso zzso significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso Lewis zzso were largely zzso Cell zzso and cell rolling on the blood vessel wall were simulated by zzso cancer cells through zzso coated with zzso human zzso At zzso levels of wall zzso stress, the number of flowing cancer cells recruited to the zzso surface was dramatically reduced by zzso zzso Higher rolling zzso was also observed, which is consistent with reduced zzso binding zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso treatment also significantly reduced the cell growth zzso Combined with the novel zzso delivery platform recently developed in our laboratory, zzso zzso could be a promising zzso therapy aiming at reducing the zzso zzso of circulating zzso cancer zzso
