There are 15 different DNA zzso zzso in zzso zzso which are specialized for zzso repair or the tolerance of DNA zzso New evidence is emerging for zzso and zzso functions of DNA zzso Many point zzso that occur in cancer cells arise from the zzso activities of DNA zzso However, the ability of some of these zzso to bypass DNA damage may actually defend against zzso instability in cells, and at least one DNA zzso Pol zzso is a zzso of spontaneous zzso Because DNA zzso can help cancer cells tolerate DNA damage, some of these zzso might be viable targets for therapeutic zzso
