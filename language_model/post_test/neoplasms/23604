The zzso nature of many human zzso to zzso chemotherapy is termed zzso resistance zzso In the past several decades, a major focus of clinical and basic research has been to characterize the genetic and zzso mechanisms zzso this zzso To provide model systems in which to study mechanisms of zzso resistance, in zzso studies have established zzso cultured cell lines expressing resistance to a broad spectrum of unrelated zzso In many of these cell lines, the expression of high levels of zzso resistance developed in parallel to the appearance of zzso zzso anomalies resulting from gene zzso This review describes zzso and zzso studies that have characterized DNA amplification structures in zzso cell lines and describes the important role gene amplification played in the cloning and characterization of the zzso zzso resistance genes zzso In addition, this review discusses the genetic selection generally used to establish the zzso cell lines, and how drug selections performed in transformed cell lines generally favor the genetic process of gene amplification, which is still exploited to identify drug resistance genes that may play an important role in clinical zzso
