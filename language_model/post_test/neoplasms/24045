zzso to ascertain whether mortality among workers of the former Spanish Nuclear Energy Board zzso de zzso zzso was higher than that for the Spanish population zzso and zzso if this were so, to ascertain whether this difference was associated with exposure to zzso zzso 

A retrospective follow up of a cohort of zzso workers was carried out for the period zzso zzso mortality was compared with that for the Spanish population overall, with zzso mortality ratios zzso adjusted for sex, age, and calendar zzso Also, zzso models were used to zzso mortality from lung cancer in the cohort by level of exposure to zzso zzso 

Workers' median and mean cumulative zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso Mean annual exposure was zzso zzso Excess mortality due to bone zzso was found for the cohort as a whole (six deaths zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Among miners, excess mortality was found for zzso respiratory diseases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and for lung cancer bordering on statistical significance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso Relative risks of dying of lung cancer from zzso radiation in the dose zzso 2, 3, and 4 versus the lowest dose zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Excess mortality from lung cancer was found among JEN zzso Nevertheless, no clear relation was found between mortality from lung cancer and level of exposure to zzso radiation in the JEN zzso zzso follow up of the cohort is required to confirm excess mortality from bone zzso
