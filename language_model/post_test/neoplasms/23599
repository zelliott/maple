zzso zzso related to a zzso in drug zzso has now been documented in a number of different cell lines exposed to certain zzso zzso In studies conducted thus far most zzso have been obtained after selection in either zzso or zzso The work in this area is in its early stages and very little is known about the molecular events which contribute to this mode of drug zzso At the present time no protein with drug binding properties comparable to zzso has been identified in zzso zzso zzso Evidence based on the finding that all zzso do not respond in the same way to reversal agents such as zzso suggests the possibility that more than one mechanism may exist for zzso zzso Future studies may thus reveal that cells contain a zzso of genes which upon zzso zzso can function to alter drug transport processes and thus contribute to the development of zzso zzso and characterizing these genes will be important since they may function in transport systems of normal zzso The exact identify of proteins which contribute to zzso zzso remains to be zzso One protein designated zzso has been found to be zzso in cell lines of human zzso zzso lung and zzso treated with zzso The protein also is increased in some clinical samples from patients undergoing zzso zzso which has a minor sequence zzso with zzso can bind zzso and may thus contribute to the energy dependent drug zzso systems found in cells containing this zzso zzso studies with a zzso zzso should determine whether this protein actually contributes to drug zzso Many other protein changes have been detected in zzso zzso cells but the importance of these in resistance also remains to be zzso In some systems a particular protein change can be identified in multiple independent zzso suggesting a correlation between the development of resistance and the presence of this cellular zzso zzso conducted thus far on the mechanism of zzso zzso are zzso Studies utilizing zzso zzso to follow the fate of zzso suggests that the drug passes to the interior of the cell and eventually zzso in the zzso zzso Drug located at this site may move directly into an zzso zzso for rapid zzso from the zzso Evidence also indicates that as drug leaves the zzso some may be zzso into other zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
