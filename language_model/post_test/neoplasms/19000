Patients with cancer have an increased risk of zzso We compared zzso rates and bleeding complications in 1) cancer patients receiving zzso or zzso and 2) patients with or without zzso 

zzso zzso patients zzso 70 years with zzso zzso zzso or without cancer zzso zzso zzso received zzso 3,000 zzso zzso or zzso 5,000 zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

1) zzso events in cancer patients zzso zzso symptomatic zzso zzso and zzso zzso occurred at zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Major bleeding was comparable and minor zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso less zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso treated patients experienced serious adverse zzso 2) zzso event rates were comparable in patients with or without cancer zzso zzso zzso as were bleeding zzso All cause death was increased in cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of patients with and zzso of those without cancer experienced serious adverse events zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso 3,000 zzso zzso and 5,000 zzso zzso zzso were equally effective and safe with respect to bleeding complications in patients with zzso There were no statistically significant differences in the risk of zzso events in patients with or without cancer receiving adequate zzso
