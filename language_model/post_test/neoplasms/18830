Response zzso zzso in Solid zzso zzso and World Health Organization zzso zzso have been traditionally used for the evaluation of therapeutic response to zzso treatment zzso They determine zzso criteria for patients response to zzso therapy based on zzso zzso of each target zzso While this assessment is justified for zzso zzso drugs, it is now recognized that zzso imaging protocols are poorly suited to the evaluation of the efficacy of novel signal zzso zzso zzso which exhibit zzso rather than zzso zzso New imaging technologies are now designed to zzso in a functional manner, modifications in tumor zzso activity, zzso and zzso before a reduction in tumor volume can be zzso Introduction of zzso imaging zzso derived from dynamic zzso zzso imaging zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso and ultrasound zzso for early assessment of disruption in tumor zzso and zzso for targeted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso provides another zzso imaging zzso since tumor necrosis and zzso are seen early in response to zzso zzso Changes in zzso and zzso zzso based on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso provide reliable markers for therapeutic response to novel zzso zzso Finally, novel molecular imaging techniques of protein and gene expression have been developed in animal models followed by a successful human application for gene zzso zzso
