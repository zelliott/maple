The Love Canal was a zzso zzso zzso chemical waste landfill situated in a residential neighborhood in Niagara Falls, New zzso This seriously contaminated site came to public attention in zzso Only one prior study examined cancer zzso in former residents of the Love Canal neighborhood zzso 

In this study we aimed to describe cancer zzso in former zzso residents from 1979 to 1996 and to investigate whether it differs from that of New York State zzso and Niagara County zzso 

From 1978 to 1982, we interviewed zzso former residents, and zzso were eligible to be included in this zzso In 1996, we identified 304 cancer diagnoses in this cohort using the NYS Cancer zzso We compared zzso cancer zzso with that of NYS and NC using standardized zzso ratios zzso and we compared risks within the zzso group by potential exposure to the landfill using survival zzso 

zzso were elevated for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso included zzso other studies have linked these zzso to chemicals similar to those found at Love zzso We also found higher rates of zzso cancer among residents exposed as children, based on two zzso 

In explaining these excess risks, the role of exposure to the landfill is unclear given such limitations as a relatively small and incomplete study zzso imprecise exposure zzso and the exclusion of zzso diagnosed before zzso Given the relatively young age of the zzso further surveillance is zzso
