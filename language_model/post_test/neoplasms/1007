We developed an approach using zzso disease genes to find function pairs whose zzso might induce a zzso zzso cancer zzso we found many zzso coordinated function pairs zzso by dysfunction of zzso genes and other molecular changes in zzso zzso two zzso of zzso we found they show certain consistency at the functional coordination zzso Our approach can also provide important information for finding novel disease genes as well as their mechanisms in zzso
