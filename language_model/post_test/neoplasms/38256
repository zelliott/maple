This report presents updated National Academy of Clinical zzso Laboratory Medicine zzso zzso zzso quality requirements for the use of tumor zzso 

One subcommittee developed guidelines for zzso quality relevant to serum and zzso tumor markers in current clinical zzso Two other zzso formulated recommendations particularly relevant to the developing technologies of zzso and mass zzso 

zzso for optimal use of tumor markers in routine practice include zzso of the correct clinical questions to ensure selection of the appropriate test, adherence to good clinical and laboratory practices zzso zzso of the risk of incorrect patient and/or zzso zzso tube type, or zzso use of internationally standardized and zzso methods, careful adherence to manufacturer zzso and proactive and timely reactions to information derived from both internal zzso and zzso zzso zzso desirable procedures include those designed to minimize the risk of the reporting of erroneous results attributable to zzso such as zzso zzso or hook effects, to facilitate the provision of zzso clinical reports zzso cumulative and/or zzso reports, appropriately derived reference zzso and zzso zzso and when possible to integrate these reports with other patient information through electronic health zzso Also mandatory is extensive validation encompassing all stages of analysis before introduction of new technologies such as zzso and mass zzso zzso of high-quality tumor marker services is facilitated by dialogue involving researchers, diagnostic companies, clinical and laboratory users, and regulatory zzso 

Implementation of these recommendations, adapted to local practice, should encourage zzso of the clinical use of tumor zzso
