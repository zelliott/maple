In larger size zzso tumors it is necessary to raise a dose of zzso and to increase field sizes whereas tolerant doses for normal zzso and zzso are reduced with an increase in the volume of zzso The adjustment of these two alternative requirements can be achieved with the help of grid zzso creating more sparing conditions of the zzso of normal zzso and zzso as a result of zzso dose zzso The authors consider some mathematical models for assessment of the quality of an zzso dose field formed by using grid zzso In this case the sparing of normal zzso and zzso results only from a decrease in the volumes of zzso normal zzso The proposed mathematical models can be used for a choice of optimum parameters of grid zzso
