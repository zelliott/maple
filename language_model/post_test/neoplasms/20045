The preparation of several new truncated zzso of the natural zzso zzso is zzso They differ from the natural product mainly in the suppression of some of the zzso zzso in either the side chain or the zzso zzso Their zzso activity and their interactions with zzso have been zzso It has been found that all zzso are zzso towards two either sensitive or resistant zzso cell lines with similar zzso values in each case, thus strongly suggesting that, like natural zzso they also display a zzso mechanism of zzso Their zzso is, however, lower than that of the parent zzso This indicates that all zzso zzso are necessary for the full biological activity, with the zzso group at zzso seemingly being particularly zzso Most zzso the zzso groups cause a restriction in the zzso mobility of the zzso and reduce the number of available zzso This makes it more probable that the zzso zzso adopts a shape which fits better into the binding point in zzso
