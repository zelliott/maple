zzso receptors zzso are zzso nuclear hormone receptors residing in cell types of both cancer and zzso zzso It is not known whether cancer zzso zzso alone can be selectively manipulated for delivery of zzso genes to its nucleus for zzso zzso zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso zzso in association with zzso zzso zzso as targeted zzso could selectively manipulate zzso in cancer cells alone for the delivery of zzso in the nucleus, a phenomenon that remained zzso in normal zzso The targeted zzso zzso showed zzso zzso in all cancer cells experimented zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly diminished zzso in cancer cells when zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso specific nuclear zzso of targeted zzso in cancer cells, followed by zzso zzso of zzso response element zzso promoted zzso Using zzso zzso targeted zzso induced significant tumor growth zzso in mice in comparison to different control groups zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, cell zzso zzso in cancer cells assisted the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, selective zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso The current study discovers a zzso important, unique property of cancer cell zzso that may be linked to a compromised role of zzso zzso zzso 17 4, zzso zzso
