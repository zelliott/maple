To investigate serum levels of tumor markers in patients with zzso arthritis zzso and their association with disease activity or the presence of zzso 

We performed an zzso cohort study including 100 patients with zzso and control zzso zzso levels of tumor markers zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso CA zzso and CA zzso were evaluated along with clinical and zzso zzso zzso Association tests between tumor markers levels and zzso disease activity parameters were zzso Patients with abnormal tests were submitted to further investigation, including chest zzso colonoscopy, abdominal zzso upper gastrointestinal zzso and zzso depending on the type of tumor marker that was zzso 

Patients with zzso had high levels of zzso and CA zzso more frequently than controls zzso zzso zzso No correlation was found between tumor markers and zzso disease activity assessed by the Disease zzso zzso zzso Two zzso were found, but only one was related to high tumor marker (an zzso zzso with high CA 125 zzso 

High tumor markers were frequently found in zzso patients, even with controlled disease and were not related to actual zzso zzso small increases of these markers in zzso cases probably do not warrant a search for an zzso zzso
