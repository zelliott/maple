We present a new zzso antenna for zzso zzso zzso therapy, working at zzso zzso and endowed with a zzso sleeve choke in order to reduce back heating effects and make the system response less dependent on the antenna zzso depth into the zzso the way the choke is implemented makes the overall zzso size minimum and allows small adjustments of the choke section length even during zzso We describe the main technical features of the antenna and show experimental results clearly proving the choke zzso zzso simulations well agree with experimental data, confirming the suitability of the proposed device for minimally invasive medical zzso
