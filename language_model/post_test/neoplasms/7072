Under the direction and sponsorship of the National Cancer Institute, we report on the first zzso trial of the Comparative Oncology Trials zzso zzso The zzso is a novel infrastructure to integrate zzso that naturally develop in pet dogs into the development path of new human zzso Trials are designed to address questions challenging in conventional zzso models and early phase human zzso Large animal spontaneous cancer models can be a valuable addition to successful studies of cancer biology and novel therapeutic drug, imaging and device zzso 

Through this established infrastructure, the first trial of the zzso zzso evaluated a targeted zzso zzso delivering tumor necrosis factor zzso to zzso zzso on tumor zzso Trial progress and data was reviewed zzso using a zzso electronic reporting system developed for the zzso zzso in zzso of 3 dogs zzso zzso 24) determined an optimal safe dose zzso zzso units zzso of zzso This demonstrated selective targeting of zzso zzso and sparing of normal zzso assessed via serial biopsy of both tumor and normal zzso zzso dosing in a cohort of 14 dogs, at the defined optimal dose, was well tolerated and led to objective tumor zzso in two dogs zzso stable disease in six zzso and disease progression in six zzso via Response zzso zzso in Solid zzso zzso 

The first study of the zzso has demonstrated the utility and efficiency of the established infrastructure to inform the development of new cancer drugs within large animal naturally occurring cancer zzso The zzso evaluation of zzso within this network provided valuable and necessary data to complete the design of zzso zzso
