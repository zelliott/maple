The purpose of this study was to evaluate electronic portal imaging zzso as a means of identifying and correcting field displacement in patients with problematic external beam zzso zzso Fourteen patients with problematic zzso were identified for zzso daily zzso beam monitoring as part of a zzso therapist intervention zzso zzso zzso were used to zzso fields as necessary to bring the setup within the zzso tolerance zzso For comparison, daily zzso were available for 12 control patients who had no particular setup difficulties and for whom online beam realignment was not zzso zzso software was used to measure setup variation along zzso zzso and zzso zzso Online field realignment yielded a significant zzso zzso zzso improvement when comparing initial and final setup zzso The mean standard zzso of setup displacement averaged over three axes was reduced from zzso zzso to zzso zzso after zzso The final variation of protocol patients was comparable to that of control zzso In conclusion, zzso provided effective means to perform online beam realignment in a group of zzso zzso This procedure resulted in a reduction in setup displacement that was statistically zzso clinically relevant, and approached that of a more typical patient zzso
