zzso zzso is a true biological response zzso Unlike zzso which acts directly, zzso mediates its zzso effects through complex indirect effects on the immune zzso zzso used alone shows documented zzso activity, which is both dose and schedule zzso zzso activity may be increased by the use of either zzso in combination with other zzso or zzso zzso or both types of agents in combination with activated zzso zzso zzso In humans, data suggest that zzso rapid initial clearance is due to movement into an zzso compartment from which zzso returns more slowly to the zzso zzso appears to be due entirely to zzso rather than to zzso zzso zzso administered by continuous infusion is superior to zzso zzso However, at total zzso zzso continuous infusion of zzso is both more toxic and more biologically active than zzso administration, with respect to the height of zzso rebound zzso the generation of activated circulating zzso and zzso zzso zzso The question remains unresolved as to whether the toxicity of zzso therapy is necessary for the zzso of optimal clinical zzso From currently available data, it appears that a minority of patients treated with zzso show clinically significant responses, and only zzso to zzso achieve durable complete zzso Nevertheless, these zzso responses have occurred in tumors zzso to more conventional zzso The reasons for zzso are zzso but many avenues of investigation suggest that zzso therapy may be made both more active and more tolerable through the use of alternative doses and schedules and the use of zzso in combination with defined zzso zzso zzso with zzso or sequential administration of other zzso or together with zzso zzso
