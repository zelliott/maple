zzso is expressed in many zzso especially in zzso and zzso pancreatic and zzso zzso In the present study, we evaluate zzso labeled zzso zzso as an imaging zzso for the zzso imaging of zzso zzso 

We zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso using the zzso zzso The zzso affinity zzso and zzso properties of the resulting two zzso labeled zzso were evaluated in zzso using zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso imaging studies with zzso labeled zzso were performed in mice bearing both zzso positive zzso and zzso negative zzso zzso 

In zzso studies demonstrated that zzso bound with a higher affinity zzso zzso to the zzso zzso cells than did the zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso at a greater rate and extent into the zzso cells than was the zzso zzso studies showed that zzso was zzso localized in zzso tumors when compared to zzso zzso At the low dose, the peak zzso tumor zzso of zzso zzso zzso dose per zzso occurred at 48 zzso while at high dose tumor zzso peaked with zzso zzso at 72 zzso zzso zzso of zzso was mainly observed in zzso also showed superior zzso in zzso tumors than in zzso tumors, but the peak zzso was only zzso zzso at 24 zzso zzso studies confirmed better zzso of zzso tumors with zzso than with zzso 

zzso imaging of zzso expressing tumors was demonstrated zzso Our findings indicate that the zzso zzso zzso has the potential to be developed into a diagnostic agent for imaging zzso zzso
