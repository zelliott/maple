Previously, two zzso zzso generated by alternative zzso of the extra domain zzso and type III connecting segments zzso zzso have been described in a human transformed cell line and in human liver, zzso We now report on a family of zzso zzso identified by Northern zzso analysis in two normal human zzso strains zzso 299 and zzso zzso and five transformed cell lines zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Seven different zzso zzso forms with zzso zzso ranging between zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Each cell line contains three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso species with characteristic zzso In all cell lines we detected one zzso zzso form which lacks the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso and one or two zzso zzso containing it zzso zzso zzso These data show that the presence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a general feature of all cells zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso pattern is characteristic of the cell type zzso suggesting the occurrence of specifically programmed zzso mechanisms in each cell zzso
