A cohort mortality study has been performed on French uranium zzso having experienced more than 2 years of underground mining, with first zzso exposure between 1946 and zzso Vital status has been zzso from the date of entry to the 31 December 1985 for zzso of the members of this zzso causes of death are identified for zzso of the zzso The different causes of death are compared to the age specific national death rates by indirect zzso and expressed by zzso mortality ratios zzso A statistically significant excess has been observed for lung and zzso cancer zzso The zzso trend test shows a statistically significant trend for the risk of lung cancer death as a function of cumulative zzso exposure, assuming a lag time of 5 years; for zzso cancer no significant trend has been zzso zzso zzso zzso has been applied to the following exposure groups: zzso 10 zzso zzso Level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 300 zzso it indicates an increase in the zzso for lung cancer of zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso with an estimated intercept at 0 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The distinction of two working zzso differing by their annual zzso concentration zzso zzso does not modify this zzso zzso This zzso of risk per unit of exposure is lower than in most of the other uranium zzso studies but it lies in the range of the evaluation of the zzso 50 committee and the zzso zzso report of the zzso National Academy of zzso It is observed in a cohort having experienced low cumulative exposure to zzso zzso 70 zzso spread over a mean duration of zzso zzso Even though occupational exposure in mines differs in several particulars from domestic exposure, this study presents characteristics of low annual exposure comparable to zzso gas zzso in houses of zzso zzso and will contribute to the evaluation of cancer risk for the zzso
