zzso zzso cells contribute to the zzso of numerous human diseases by actively regulating the zzso inflammatory zzso however, little is known regarding the role of zzso inflammation in the growth of human tumors and its influence on the prognosis of human zzso 

Using an experimental model of tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso we characterized inflammatory gene expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso These genes formed the basis of a zzso molecular predictor of overall survival that was trained and validated in four types of human zzso 

We report that expression of zzso derived tumor zzso genes distinguished zzso tissue specimens from normal controls in several human diseases associated with chronic zzso We trained these genes in human cancer zzso and defined a zzso inflammatory signature that predicted significantly reduced overall survival in breast cancer, colon cancer, lung cancer, and zzso This zzso signature predicted outcome independently of, but zzso with, standard clinical and pathological zzso zzso zzso with these findings, zzso culture media from human zzso cells zzso by zzso zzso accelerated the growth of human colon and breast tumors in zzso mice as compared with zzso media from zzso zzso zzso 

This study provides the first zzso cancer gene signature derived from an experimental model of zzso zzso zzso These findings support the notion that zzso of inflammatory pathways in zzso zzso zzso cells contributes to tumor growth and progression in multiple human zzso zzso these results identify zzso factors that could serve as potential targets for therapy in diverse human zzso
