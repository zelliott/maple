zzso resistance zzso of cancer cells is an obstacle to effective chemotherapy of zzso The zzso cassette (ABC) zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play an important role in the development of this zzso An attractive approach to overcoming zzso is the zzso of the pumping action of these zzso Several zzso of ABC zzso have been developed, but zzso effects and adverse zzso have prohibited their zzso The ongoing search for such zzso that can be applied in the clinic has led to three generations of zzso The most recent zzso are more potent and less toxic than first-generation compounds, yet some are still prone to adverse effects, poor zzso and zzso changes in the zzso of the zzso zzso 

This review provides an update of the published work on the development of potent zzso to overcome zzso in cancer cells, their present status in clinical studies and suggestions for further improvement to obtain better zzso 

This review summarizes recent advances in the development of less toxic zzso including small molecules and natural zzso In addition, a brief overview of other novel approaches that can be used to inhibit ABC drug zzso zzso zzso has also been zzso 

The zzso nature of zzso indicates that it may be important to develop zzso that can simultaneously inhibit both the function of the drug zzso and key signaling zzso which are responsible for development of this zzso
