The zzso zzso plays a central role in the degradation of proteins involved in several pathways including the cell cycle, cellular proliferation and zzso zzso is the first zzso inhibitor to enter clinical use, and received approval by the Food and Drug Administration zzso for the treatment of patients with multiple zzso therefore zzso zzso of the zzso as an zzso zzso The approval of zzso was based on a large, zzso zzso phase III trial showing its efficacy and safety compared with conventional zzso zzso data also demonstrates the synergistic effect of zzso with other zzso agents and its ability to overcome drug zzso Since then several other zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso activities of zzso have been attributed to its effect on zzso pathways including the zzso of zzso and induction of zzso zzso zzso However, the molecular mechanisms are not fully zzso In this review, we will zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso by zzso
