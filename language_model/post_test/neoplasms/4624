We evaluated potential drug interactions in patients treated with zzso at a zzso care cancer center to determine if it affects resource zzso 

We identified a cohort of patients with continuous care at the study institution by tagging patients who received at least three prescriptions for zzso within a continuous zzso zzso Data collected included zzso cancer type and zzso resource zzso zzso and emergency room zzso and potential major drug zzso zzso statistics and zzso zzso were zzso in the zzso 

The study population, which included 297 patients, was zzso female and zzso zzso the mean age was 53 years zzso 12 zzso with a mean follow-up period zzso of zzso of zzso zzso Overall, 145 zzso of the patients had a drug combination that could result in a potential major drug interaction with zzso There were 118 zzso patients with a potential major drug interaction that could lead to zzso syndrome symptoms and 59 zzso patients with a potential major drug interaction with zzso Potential major drug interactions were associated with an increased number of hospital and zzso visits zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso This finding was consistent for the two zzso groups as well, zzso zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Potential drug interactions are frequent in patients receiving zzso in a zzso care cancer center and are associated with an increase in resource zzso
