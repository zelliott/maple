Previously, we proposed a new paradigm to explain the zzso role of zzso in tumor zzso In this model, zzso and zzso dysfunction in the tumor zzso promotes cellular zzso which results in the production of recycled zzso These chemical building blocks and zzso zzso would then drive the anabolic growth of tumors, via zzso resistance and zzso zzso metabolism in cancer zzso We have termed this new form of zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso Here, we zzso tested this zzso hypothesis, by genetically creating zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso dysfunction or zzso zzso cancer cells, with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated by zzso zzso key target genes that lead to zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso cancer cells were derived by zzso zzso which functionally promotes zzso zzso As predicted, zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso and effectively promoted tumor zzso We validated that zzso zzso showed zzso dysfunction, with increased production of zzso fuels zzso and zzso body zzso zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells were zzso and showed signs of increased zzso zzso and function, which resulted in increased tumor zzso Thus, zzso in the tumor zzso and zzso zzso metabolism zzso in cancer cells can both dramatically promote tumor growth, independently of tumor zzso For the first time, our current studies also link the DNA damage response in the tumor zzso with zzso cancer zzso as zzso is a DNA zzso target zzso
