In order to evaluate the effects of short exposure period using a simple methodology, a plain zzso approximation method to estimate loss of life expectancy zzso was devised and applied to evaluate cancer zzso The posed risk was expressed as the time of zzso which is zzso to the period and concentration of zzso This method assumes a zzso survival curve and a flat cancer risk for all zzso In the survival curve, the survival rate of the population studied declined due to the risk such that the new survival curve became a zzso The area difference between the initial rectangle and the trapezoid was converted to an zzso zzso Lifetime exposure to the acceptable level concentration zzso which is equivalent to a zzso lifetime cancer risk, gave the base zzso which was calculated to be 210 zzso Exposure to the zzso between the ages of 20 and 25 years resulted in an zzso of zzso zzso which is zzso of the base zzso One minute of exposure to zzso at 1000 zzso zzso is equivalent to an zzso of zzso zzso Considering that the zzso of zzso is 2 zzso 1 zzso of exposure to 267 zzso zzso is equal to 1 zzso of zzso which is as toxic as zzso zzso
