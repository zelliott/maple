zzso PET zzso imaging is a new technology in which one or more high-resolution detector zzso are integrated into a conventional PET scanner with lower resolution zzso It can locally enhance the spatial resolution and contrast recovery near the zzso zzso and depending on the zzso may also increase the sensitivity of the zzso This novel scanner geometry makes the reconstruction problem more challenging compared to the reconstruction of data from a zzso PET zzso as new techniques are needed to model and account for the zzso zzso In this paper, we present a general framework for fully zzso modeling of an arbitrary zzso insert zzso The model components are incorporated into a statistical reconstruction zzso to estimate an image from the zzso zzso For zzso we apply the proposed model and reconstruction approach to one of our zzso zzso zzso zzso insert device integrated into a clinical zzso zzso Details regarding the most important zzso issues are zzso We show that the proposed data model is consistent with the measured data, and that our approach can lead to reconstructions with improved spatial resolution and zzso zzso
