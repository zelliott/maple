The primary source of evidence that zzso zzso in drinking water is associated with increased mortality from cancer at internal sites zzso liver, zzso and other zzso is a large zzso study conducted in regions of Southwest Taiwan endemic to zzso zzso The zzso patterns for zzso liver, and zzso zzso display a zzso zzso relationship with zzso zzso The data do not appear zzso however, for the more refined task of zzso assessment, particularly for zzso of risk at the low zzso zzso found in some zzso water zzso The problem lies in variable zzso zzso between the zzso within a village, largely due to a mix of shallow zzso and deep zzso wells, and in having only one well test for 24 zzso of the 60 zzso The current analysis identifies 14 villages where the exposure appears most questionable, based on criteria described in the zzso The exposure values were then changed for seven of the villages, from the median well test being used as a default to some other point in the village's range of well tests that would contribute to smoothing the appearance of a zzso zzso The remaining seven villages, six of which had only one well test, were deleted as zzso The zzso zzso patterns showed no evidence of excess risk below zzso zzso of zzso zzso Of course, that outcome is dependent on manipulation of the data, as zzso zzso of the seven deleted villages would make estimates of risk much higher at low zzso In those seven villages, the cancer mortality rates are significantly high for their exposure levels, suggesting that their exposure values may be too low or that other zzso factors need to be taken into zzso
