A mathematical model which reconstructs the structure of existing zzso using zzso zzso functional and molecular imaging as input was zzso The vessel structure is zzso according to empirical vascular zzso such as the mean vessel branching zzso The model is zzso such that the zzso oxygen map zzso from the simulated zzso zzso matches the input oxygen map to a high degree of accuracy zzso zzso zzso The zzso model was successfully applied to zzso imaging zzso Starting from the anatomical zzso image zzso from zzso zzso zzso a representative map of the complete zzso was zzso simulated as determined by the oxygen map zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The simulated microscopic zzso and the calculated zzso map successfully represent the zzso zzso distribution zzso zzso zzso The model elicits the parameters required to simulate zzso consistent with imaging and provides a key mathematical relationship relating the vessel volume to the tissue oxygen zzso Apart from providing an excellent framework for visualizing the imaging gap between the microscopic and zzso zzso the model has the potential to be extended as a tool to study the dynamics between the zzso and the zzso in a zzso manner and has an application in the simulation of zzso zzso
