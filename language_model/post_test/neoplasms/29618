The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is a master regulator in energy metabolism and may be related to zzso In type 2 diabetes, low HDL cholesterol predicts cancer, whereas zzso usage is associated with reduced cancer zzso Both zzso and zzso A1 activate the zzso signaling zzso We zzso that the zzso effects of zzso may be particularly evident in type 2 diabetic patients with low HDL zzso 

In a consecutive cohort of zzso Chinese type 2 diabetic patients enrolled in the study between 1996 and 2005, who were free of cancer and not using zzso at enrollment or during zzso years before enrollment and who were followed until 2005, we measured biological interactions for cancer risk using relative excess risk as a result of interaction zzso and attributable proportion (AP) as a result of zzso A statistically significant zzso zzso or zzso zzso indicates biological zzso 

During zzso zzso of follow-up zzso zzso zzso 129 patients developed zzso HDL cholesterol zzso zzso was associated with increased cancer risk among those who did not use zzso but the association was not significant among those who zzso Use of zzso was associated with reduced cancer risk in patients with HDL cholesterol zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, in patients with HDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso HDL cholesterol zzso zzso plus zzso of zzso was associated with an adjusted hazard ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with HDL cholesterol zzso zzso zzso plus use of zzso with a significant interaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso effect of zzso was most evident in type 2 diabetic patients with low HDL zzso
