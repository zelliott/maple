zzso zzso zzso and zzso are used as zzso zzso These compounds are zzso in short-term tests and do not require zzso by zzso zzso zzso In zzso studies performed in rats and mice, zzso zzso zzso was given by zzso and zzso of DNA bases was zzso The compound did not lead to specific DNA zzso In particular, zzso of DNA bases was not zzso In contrast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso upon oral and inhalation administration to rats and mice, caused systemic DNA zzso Specifically, zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso inhalation zzso have been performed in rats and mice with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso tumors, but only in male mice at the highest concentration tested zzso zzso Under these special conditions, a number of secondary effects occur subsequent to zzso depletion in the target zzso resulting in DNA damage zzso zzso and probably DNA zzso zzso The particular coincidence of secondary high-dose effects zzso a risk zzso to zzso zzso zzso did not induce tumors in rats and mice when administered by zzso However, experimental data point to a possible local zzso effect on the rat zzso when the compound is given by zzso A factor that accounts for the zzso between systemic DNA zzso and apparent zzso upon inhalation might be the preference of zzso over zzso zzso of zzso An zzso of the negative zzso inhalation zzso of zzso zzso to man might be problematic because zzso metabolize zzso zzso very quickly whereas in humans there is a particular zzso that only poorly zzso the compound zzso Such individuals can be characterized by incubation of zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso and measurement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been tested, with positive outcome, in early zzso zzso not based on modern zzso However, these results, along with the proven systemic zzso potency of zzso zzso argue in favor of a zzso effect of the zzso
