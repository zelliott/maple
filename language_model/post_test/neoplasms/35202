zzso C zzso showed a wide zzso spectrum with zzso of various tumors and the optimal schedule of a single or intermittent administration against human tumor cells zzso to nude mice, confirming the early reports obtained in zzso tumor zzso The sensitivity of various human tumors zzso to nude mice has been tested to zzso agents to establish the system which could select the clinically active zzso The effectiveness of zzso against human stomach zzso zzso to nude mice clearly correlated to the clinical effect of zzso against gastric zzso The zzso zzso zzso between zzso and DNA were isolated in the zzso system of zzso C zzso and zzso and the major zzso was determined as zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated, and the structure was determined by zzso zzso zzso zzso formation was shown by alkaline zzso in cells treated with zzso The zzso of zzso has been characterized by the two electron transfer process, however, the one electron transfer process was proposed by zzso zzso zzso was effective against hypoxic zzso Several cell lines resistant to zzso were isolated, and some zzso derivatives showed in zzso and in zzso zzso activity against these resistant zzso
