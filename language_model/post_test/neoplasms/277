Clinical zzso of zzso zzso were studied in eight patients who received zzso labeled zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by continuous zzso zzso The drug and zzso were zzso by zzso and zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and curve stripping were used to characterize zzso and total zzso equivalent zzso zzso zzso in the plasma declined zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso hours and a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The total clearance of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso X zzso X zzso and the apparent volume of distribution, estimated from the area under the drug concentration versus time curve, was zzso zzso zzso L X zzso zzso the total zzso equivalent disappeared from the plasma in a zzso zzso Compared with the zzso parameters of unchanged zzso the terminal zzso of total zzso was zzso zzso zzso hours, zzso times zzso the total clearance was zzso zzso zzso zzso X zzso X zzso zzso times zzso but the volume of distribution by area was zzso zzso zzso L X zzso nearly the zzso The 72-hour cumulative urinary zzso of total zzso was zzso of the administered dose and only zzso of this resided in unchanged zzso Thus, urinary zzso was not a major route of elimination of zzso Moreover, zzso underwent extensive zzso one major and two minor unidentified products were detected in both plasma and zzso
