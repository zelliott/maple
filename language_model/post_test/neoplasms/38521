zzso zzso slide preparation of zzso zzso biopsy zzso specimens is necessary to maximize sensitivity and yield a tissue zzso We present a quality control review of our biopsy technique and results in 71 aspiration zzso done in 59 zzso Immediate zzso slide preparation in the zzso suite enabled us to increase our diagnostic yield from zzso to zzso and allowed us to preserve zzso rather than open zzso as the primary diagnostic zzso We recommend regular review of biopsy techniques to confirm adequate diagnostic yields of these zzso
