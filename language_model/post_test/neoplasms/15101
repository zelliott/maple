zzso producing killer zzso cells zzso were originally defined as zzso zzso (or zzso cells that exert a potent zzso activity in animals lacking B, zzso and conventional natural killer zzso zzso class II expression on tumor zzso zzso prompted us to investigate their putative zzso presenting zzso Here, we show that tumor cells license zzso to acquire the properties of zzso presenting cells, zzso expression of zzso class II and zzso zzso zzso We show that the zzso subset of zzso are able to prime zzso zzso T cells and zzso zzso zzso T zzso Licensing of zzso by tumor cells was mandatory for the full differentiation of T cells into polarized zzso zzso could engulf and process soluble zzso protein in a zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso is selectively endowed with zzso zzso presenting capacities and that targeting this subset with the zzso zzso zzso toxin of zzso zzso fused to zzso resulted in efficient zzso of zzso by zzso to specific zzso transgenic zzso cells in zzso zzso our data indicate that upon exposure to tumor cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso
