In many types of cancer, tumors zzso through the zzso system to draining zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso have gained increased attention as a zzso indicator for the severity of the disease, leading to the zzso zzso zzso mapping and biopsy procedure to be accepted as zzso for breast cancer and zzso However, many limitations exist with this procedure resulting in high false negative zzso In this review we highlight the new advances in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms of zzso and tumor zzso that may lead to improved strategies in the detection of the zzso zzso zzso and therapeutic interventions to prevent further tumor zzso In addition, advances in imaging technology are allowing new approaches for anatomical mapping of zzso drainage patterns and molecular imaging strategies that may improve detection of zzso tumor cells within zzso zzso zzso
