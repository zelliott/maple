zzso is a zzso zzso zzso localized in zzso regions and acting as a zzso for specific zzso zzso Although the role of zzso in zzso regulation has been well zzso the zzso consequences of its dysfunction in human disease have not been well zzso Here, we describe important roles of zzso in human zzso zzso levels of zzso are significantly elevated in human zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in real-time zzso chain reaction zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis also revealed its zzso in various types of zzso The reduction of zzso expression by small interfering zzso resulted in the suppression of the growth of cancer cells and possibly caused zzso cell death in cancer zzso zzso we show that zzso can suppress zzso of the zzso gene by binding to its promoter region zzso to zzso and by zzso zzso 9 of zzso zzso Furthermore, an zzso zzso zzso significantly suppressed the growth of cancer zzso Our results suggest that zzso of zzso plays an important role in the growth regulation of cancer cells, and further functional studies may affirm the importance of zzso as a promising therapeutic target for various types of zzso
