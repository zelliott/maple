The potential of zzso and protein zzso agents has yet to be realized zzso to the many unresolved problems concerning their delivery to the site of a tumor and into tumor zzso However, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the biological fate and zzso of protein and zzso drugs has advanced to the stage where methods that use or influence these mechanisms are now zzso There are different approaches that can improve the stability, longevity and targeting of peptides and proteins in the body, such as their modification with various soluble zzso incorporation into zzso drug carriers, enhanced zzso and retention zzso tumor targeting and the use of targeting zzso Furthermore, new approaches to zzso drug delivery, including the use of zzso proteins and zzso are being zzso These advances promise the delivery of a new generation of zzso zzso
