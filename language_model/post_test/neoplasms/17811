We describe an approach to produce an zzso therapeutic zzso vaccine using zzso zzso for zzso cancer zzso The novel approach involved zzso the zzso of part of the zzso zzso zzso using column zzso with zzso zzso the employ of zzso as a medium to attract zzso cells zzso to the vaccination site, and zzso the use of zzso as a zzso to present in zzso the tumor zzso and zzso to the patient's zzso The vaccine was prepared using and combining zzso zzso with at least 3 heat shock proteins zzso was one of them possibly with zzso zzso as shown in the slot zzso and with proteins from the cell membrane system (including zzso zzso and membrane zzso The timing of zzso degradation was tested in zzso the zzso particles administered under the skin attracted zzso and were zzso into smaller zzso and they were totally zzso within 1 zzso In patients zzso zzso zzso the vaccine was then administered weekly and showed very low zzso causing minor and tolerable local inflammation zzso zzso or local zzso only 1 patient who received a larger dose presented hot zzso and there were no systemic manifestations of toxicity or zzso diseases attributed to the zzso Our study suggests that this therapeutic vaccine has shown some efficacy producing a positive response in certain zzso zzso disease was noted in zzso of the patients zzso zzso breast zzso and zzso and a partial response was noted in zzso of the patients zzso zzso and zzso The most encouraging results were seen in patients with zzso zzso 4 patients in these conditions zzso are disease free following the vaccine zzso However, we do not want to overstate the clinical efficacy in this small number of zzso The therapeutic vaccine tested in our study is working by zzso the zzso response as was shown in the comparative zzso and zzso study performed in the zzso and zzso biopsy taken from a patient with inflammatory breast zzso However, we cannot ruled out that the vaccine could also be producing an zzso zzso In conclusion, this therapeutic vaccine based on zzso ceramic particles and zzso can be safely administered and is showing some encouraging clinical results in cancer zzso
