The purpose of this study was to increase the potential of dose zzso by incorporating estimates of oxygen zzso within imaging zzso for optimal dose zzso Cellular oxygen tension zzso zzso were estimated for zzso zzso by solving oxygen zzso equations around zzso placed at random zzso The zzso model was used to determine cell survival in the zzso as a function of zzso and zzso The dose distribution across the zzso was zzso to yield minimal survival after 30 zzso 2 zzso zzso by zzso the dose based on differences in oxygen zzso zzso data of a series of 69 zzso were used as a surrogate of what might be expected from oxygen imaging zzso zzso zzso were performed both taking into account cellular zzso in zzso within zzso and assuming a homogeneous cellular distribution of zzso Our simulations show that dose zzso based on derived cellular oxygen zzso within zzso result in dose zzso that require less total dose to obtain the same degree of cell kill as dose zzso that were zzso with a model that considered zzso as homogeneous with respect to zzso zzso hypoxic zzso are expected to gain most from dose zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso into zzso zzso theoretically improves the potential gains from dose zzso zzso
