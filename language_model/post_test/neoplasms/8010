Selective zzso zzso zzso zzso are compounds with a mixed zzso activity on zzso zzso An ideal zzso is a compound with an zzso zzso effect on the breast and zzso but zzso zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso a group of zzso zzso is represented by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso On an empirical basis, tamoxifen has been used to zzso treat zzso zzso Recently, zzso a second-generation zzso has been used in the treatment of familial zzso zzso patients affected by zzso zzso The mechanisms through which these molecules affect zzso zzso growth appear to be due, in part, to the fact that zzso may act independently of zzso zzso The knowledge of the molecular basis of zzso action will make the development of novel synthetic compounds with engineered tissue selectivity zzso
