Similar to growing and metabolically active zzso tumors require a dense zzso to gain access to oxygen and zzso However, blood vessels in tumors differ from vessels in normal zzso in many zzso In particular, the tumor zzso is in an active state of zzso or zzso and it is immature and zzso Blood vessels are zzso tubes formed by polarized zzso cells, which face the patent vascular zzso with their zzso cell surface, whereas their zzso cell surface faces zzso zzso on the outside of the zzso The same cell polarity can be found in other zzso structures, such as in the zzso tubes of the lung or the kidney zzso In contrast, blood vessels in zzso often have a vascular zzso lined by zzso cell zzso These vessels are often formed by a process named zzso vascular tube zzso Here, we discuss the hypothesis that the supply of tumors with blood can be achieved by both zzso zzso tubes as well as tubes formed by the tumor cells themselves using the ancestral vascular tube formation zzso We discuss this hypothesis with a particular focus on gastrointestinal zzso
