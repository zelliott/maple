Bid is the only known zzso family member that can function as an zzso of zzso zzso proteins such as zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso family protein Bid was assessed by zzso and zzso methods in normal zzso and human zzso and in several types of human zzso and tumor cell zzso Bid expression in normal zzso varied widely, with prominent Bid zzso occurring in several types of short-lived cells zzso zzso center B cells, peripheral blood zzso differentiated zzso and in zzso cells zzso adult zzso Analysis of Bid expression by zzso of 100 zzso 95 zzso and 254 prostate zzso as well as 59 brain tumors and 50 zzso revealed evidence of altered Bid regulation in some types of zzso zzso with clinical outcome data revealed association of higher levels of Bid with longer recurrence-free survival in men with locally advanced zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso analysis of Bid protein levels in the zzso panel of 60 human tumor cell lines revealed a correlation between higher levels of Bid and sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso drugs zzso zzso of Bid in a model tumor cell line by gene zzso resulted in increased sensitivity to zzso induction by a zzso zzso Taken together, these observations suggest a potential role for Bid in tumor responses to specific zzso drugs, and lay a foundation for future investigations of this member of the zzso family in healthy and diseased zzso
