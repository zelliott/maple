Several zzso compounds including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been shown to prevent zzso caused by zzso aromatic zzso zzso and zzso zzso in experimental zzso these chemical zzso are activated by human zzso 1 and 2A family zzso respectively, to zzso zzso In this study, we examined whether these zzso compounds interact with and inhibit human zzso 1 and 2A zzso in zzso Four zzso compounds induced reverse Type I binding zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and Type I binding zzso with zzso zzso and zzso The spectral zzso zzso zzso for the interaction of zzso zzso with these chemicals were zzso zzso the values were lower than those with seen with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso The zzso values for Type I binding of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso were both zzso zzso the values were very low compared to those for the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Four zzso compounds directly inhibited zzso zzso activities zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso values zzso zzso except for the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities of zzso zzso were more inhibited by four zzso compounds than those of zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of the interaction of four zzso compounds with human zzso zzso suggest that these chemicals can be zzso into the active sites of these human zzso zzso and that the sites of the zzso functional groups of these chemicals differ between the zzso 1 and 2A family zzso
