zzso zzso are circular fragments of membrane released from the zzso compartment as zzso or shed from the surface zzso of most cell zzso An increasing body of evidence indicates that they play a pivotal role in zzso zzso Indeed, they may directly stimulate target cells by zzso interactions or may transfer from the cell of origin to various zzso molecules including membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this review we discuss the zzso zzso effects of zzso that are relevant for communication among cells in zzso and pathological zzso In particular, we discuss their potential involvement in zzso zzso disease, and tumor zzso and the evidence supporting a zzso exchange of genetic information between stem and injured zzso The transfer of gene products from injured cells may explain stem cell functional and zzso changes without the need of zzso into tissue zzso On the other hand, transfer of gene products from stem cells may zzso injured cells to repair damaged zzso
