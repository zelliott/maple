To investigate the effect of calcium and temperature on zzso cell zzso 

zzso transformed rat lung cells zzso zzso were used as experimental group, and normal rat lung cells zzso zzso as normal zzso The cells were cultured under the condition of zzso with zzso and at 4 degrees C, 37 degrees C and 41 degrees C, and without zzso at 37 degrees zzso Cell zzso and zzso were zzso 

The average value of adhesive ability zzso of zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso at 37 degrees C, without zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso The value was zzso zzso zzso at 41 degrees C, significantly lower than that at 37 degrees C zzso zzso zzso 

zzso increase of zzso and high temperature will strengthen the adhesive ability of tumor zzso
