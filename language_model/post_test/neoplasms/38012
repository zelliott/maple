zzso is a member of the B group of zzso zzso zzso originally identified as an zzso protein for zzso Although zzso is expressed at low levels in most adult zzso it is highly zzso in tumor cell zzso Here, we show that zzso is also zzso in primary tumors, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso also leads to tumor formation in zzso mice, whereas deletion of zzso zzso zzso Although a zzso active zzso zzso was previously shown to promote zzso transformation in cultured cells, our results are the first to show that zzso also promotes zzso in experimental zzso Furthermore, these results show for the first time that not only zzso active zzso but also zzso zzso is zzso when experimental animals are zzso These results are highly significant because zzso zzso rather than activated zzso is zzso in tumor zzso Our results suggest that zzso or zzso of zzso is a key step in zzso zzso due to its ability to promote cell survival and subsequent uncontrolled zzso The finding that zzso is zzso in so many types of zzso indicates that zzso may play a vital role in a wide range of different types of zzso This makes it an attractive candidate for drug therapy for different types of zzso
