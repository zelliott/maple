Gene zzso zzso by zzso has been widely investigated as a potential therapeutic zzso The success of these therapies depends on effective systems capable of selectively and efficiently conveying zzso to targeted zzso with minimal zzso 

This review discusses current experimental approaches to zzso delivery strategies available for arthritis treatment and the management of other musculoskeletal zzso The review covers literature on the subject from 2000 to zzso 

In the last decade, extensive improvements have been made to zzso zzso gene therapy and have been tested on several arthritis and orthopedic zzso However, except for Phase I - II zzso gene therapy trials on arthritis, no clinical studies have reported zzso application in these zzso 

Most musculoskeletal disorders, such as zzso arthritis, zzso zzso zzso zzso cartilage and zzso disc zzso are zzso and age-related chronic inflammatory conditions, but represent significant morbidity and a zzso zzso zzso gene therapy offers treatment opportunities that are less zzso more effective and less expensive than existing zzso Future directions for zzso therapy include the development of safe and more efficient delivery systems and the selection of optimal gene targets for disease zzso
