zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso triggers downstream signaling pathways that regulate many cellular processes involved in zzso survival and zzso zzso zzso is an orally active zzso zzso inhibitor zzso targeted to the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso 

In this study we have used a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to measure the activity of zzso alone or in combination with different zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso and zzso against a variety of solid zzso zzso zzso zzso including breast, zzso zzso and zzso cancer, zzso of unknown primary site, zzso and zzso melanoma, zzso cell lung cancer zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso were calculated for each single agent or zzso To allow comparison between samples the zzso was calculated based on the percentage zzso growth zzso zzso at each test drug concentration zzso zzso was tested at zzso ranging from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This study represents the first use of a zzso in the zzso 

There was zzso in the degree of zzso observed when zzso were tested against single agent zzso zzso zzso of zzso exhibited considerable zzso but most showed a more modest response resulting in a low zzso The median zzso value for single agent zzso in all zzso tested was zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso had both positive and negative effects when used in combination with different zzso In 59% zzso of zzso tested, the addition of zzso appeared to zzso the effect of the zzso agent or combination (of these, zzso zzso had a zzso decrease in their zzso In 38% of zzso zzso the zzso was decreased when the combination of zzso + zzso was used in comparison to the zzso zzso In the remaining zzso zzso there was no change zzso 

The in zzso model suggests that zzso may have differential effects in response to zzso zzso chemotherapy with the agents tested during this zzso The mechanism involved may relate to the effect of zzso on growth rate versus their effect on the ability of the cell to survive the stimulus to zzso produced by zzso
