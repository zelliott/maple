The tumor zzso of transplanted and spontaneous mouse tumors is profoundly deprived of zzso as confirmed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso T zzso zzso of transplanted colon zzso zzso and spontaneous breast zzso are zzso zzso as opposed to their counterparts in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso on activated T zzso is markedly enhanced by zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso does not zzso zzso in zzso factor zzso T cells, and such zzso T cells remain zzso even when becoming zzso in clear contrast to zzso and zzso zzso T zzso The fact that zzso is selectively expressed on zzso was exploited to zzso the effects of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso to the tumor zzso As a result, zzso zzso injections avoid liver zzso achieve zzso systemic effects, and permit synergistic therapeutic effects with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is an important molecular target to augment zzso zzso zzso in the tumor zzso as sensed by the zzso system increases expression of zzso on zzso zzso that thereby become selectively responsive to the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso as those used in ongoing clinical zzso
