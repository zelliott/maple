The greatest public health benefit of advances in understanding the human zzso may be realized for common chronic diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes zzso and zzso Attempts to integrate such knowledge into clinical practice are still in the early zzso and as a result, many questions surround the current state of this zzso 

To zzso current information on genetic health services for common zzso conditions by examining studies that have addressed the zzso consumer information needs, delivery, and challenges in zzso these zzso 

zzso articles published between January 2000 and February zzso 

Original research articles and systematic reviews dealing with common chronic zzso conditions were zzso A total of zzso citations were zzso 170 articles zzso and 68 articles included in the zzso 

Data were independently extracted by one reviewer and checked by another with disagreement resolved by zzso zzso assessed included study design and 4 key zzso outcomes of zzso medicine, consumer information needs, delivery of zzso medicine, and challenges and barriers to integration of zzso zzso

Many gaps in knowledge about organization, clinician, and patient needs must be filled to translate basic and clinical science advances in zzso of common chronic diseases into zzso
