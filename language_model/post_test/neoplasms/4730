DNA damage plays a zzso role in numerous disease zzso zzso it is suggested that DNA repair zzso which maintain the integrity of the nuclear and zzso zzso play a critical role in reducing the onset of multiple diseases, including cancer, diabetes and zzso As the primary DNA zzso involved in base zzso repair, DNA zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in multiple cellular zzso including zzso maintenance and zzso processing and is suggested to play a role in zzso zzso cell viability following stress and the cellular response to radiation, chemotherapy and environmental zzso zzso zzso zzso may prove to be effective in cancer zzso However, zzso has a complex and highly regulated role in DNA zzso This zzso the development of effective zzso zzso useful for improving chemotherapy and radiation response without zzso normal cellular zzso With multiple zzso activities, numerous binding partners and complex modes of regulation from zzso zzso there are many opportunities for zzso zzso that have yet to be zzso To shed light on the varying possibilities and approaches of targeting zzso for potential therapeutic intervention, we zzso the reported small zzso zzso of zzso and discuss the zzso zzso and chemical studies that zzso additional options for zzso zzso Further, we offer suggestions on possible inhibitor zzso approaches and the potential for tumor specificity for zzso
