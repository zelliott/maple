The DNA mismatch repair system maintains zzso stability by correcting DNA sequence errors generated during DNA zzso during genetic exchanges between zzso zzso zzso and by correcting DNA zzso caused by zzso agents such as zzso zzso mismatch repair improves almost zzso the zzso of DNA zzso however, the functions of mismatch repair proteins extend well beyond DNA zzso Recent studies suggest that mismatch repair is part of the machinery that couples DNA damage and repair to cell cycle regulation and zzso These studies indicate that tolerance to certain DNA zzso (such as zzso and zzso zzso is associated with inefficient zzso of cell cycle checkpoints and inefficient zzso of zzso in mismatch repair deficient zzso zzso mismatch repair proteins regulate the survival threshold to DNA damage, and this function provides a novel platform for understanding the role of mismatch repair in B cells, in tumor formation, as well as in resistance to zzso In this communication, we review how mismatch repair may contribute to the physiology of cells and may be regulated by the zzso trafficking of mismatch repair zzso
