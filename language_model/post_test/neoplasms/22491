zzso research is about transforming progress in basic research into products that benefit zzso Here I discuss some of the key obstacles to effective zzso research in zzso that have previously received limited zzso Basic research often does not go far enough for straightforward clinical translation, and zzso high-risk zzso to fill these key gaps have not been adequately addressed either by industry or by the culture of zzso zzso These key gaps include the identification of zzso zzso zzso and new approaches to regulating currently zzso targets such as zzso zzso zzso Even where an inhibitor of a key target has been identified, new approaches to clinical development are zzso The current approach of treating broad populations of patients based primarily on primary cancer site is not well suited to the development of zzso targeted zzso Although developing drugs with zzso zzso makes drug development more complex, it can improve the success rate of development, as well as provide benefit to patients and the economics of zzso I review here some prospective Phase III designs that have been developed for transition from the era of zzso science to one of reliable zzso and zzso zzso
