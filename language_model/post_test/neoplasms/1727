To compare the hazards of cigarette smoking in men who formed their habits at different zzso and the extent of the reduction in risk when cigarette smoking is stopped at different zzso 

Prospective study that has continued from 1951 to zzso 

United zzso 

34 zzso male British zzso Information about their smoking habits was obtained in 1951, and periodically zzso cause specific mortality was monitored for 50 zzso 

zzso mortality by smoking zzso considering separately men born in different zzso 

The excess mortality associated with smoking chiefly involved zzso zzso and respiratory diseases that can be caused by zzso Men born in zzso who smoked only cigarettes and continued smoking died on average about 10 years younger than lifelong zzso zzso at age 60, 50, 40, or 30 years gained, respectively, about 3, 6, 9, or 10 years of life zzso The excess mortality associated with cigarette smoking was less for men born in the 19th century and was greatest for men born in the zzso The cigarette smoker versus zzso probabilities of dying in middle age zzso were zzso zzso zzso (a twofold death rate zzso for those born in zzso but were zzso zzso zzso (a zzso death rate zzso for those born in the zzso At older ages, the cigarette smoker versus zzso probabilities of surviving from age 70 to 90 were zzso zzso zzso at the death rates of the 1950s zzso is, among men born around the zzso but were zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso death rate zzso at the death rates of the 1990s zzso is, among men born around the zzso 

A substantial progressive decrease in the mortality rates among zzso over the past half century zzso to prevention and improved treatment of disease) has been wholly zzso among cigarette smokers, by a progressive increase in the smoker zzso zzso death rate ratio due to earlier and more intensive use of zzso Among the men born around 1920, prolonged cigarette smoking from early adult life tripled age specific mortality rates, but zzso at age 50 zzso the zzso and zzso at age 30 avoided almost all of zzso
