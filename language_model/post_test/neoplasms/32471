Major zzso of zzso immunity are zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso T zzso zzso In zzso animals, the zzso and zzso zzso immunity is zzso in multiple zzso Better understanding of negative regulatory pathways of tumor immunity is crucial for the development of zzso vaccines and zzso Since immune zzso toward zzso suppresses zzso development, it has been thought that induction affecting a zzso immune response is one of the mechanisms that zzso effective tumor immune zzso Recent studies using zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso zzso mice demonstrated that this hypothesis was the zzso zzso is one of the zzso zzso that has very similar features to zzso through sharing some zzso components and zzso signal zzso It has been thought that zzso is not as critical for immune zzso as zzso since it cannot directly act on T zzso However, recent studies of zzso reveal that this zzso plays a critical role in many aspects of immune zzso Studies from our lab and others indicate that zzso is central to a novel zzso zzso in which zzso cells suppress tumor zzso Here we will describe biological properties and functions of zzso its role in the negative regulation of zzso zzso and effects of zzso on tumor cells zzso
