The number of zzso cells in peripheral blood zzso is a guide to the optimal timing to harvest peripheral blood zzso cells zzso The objective was to determine the number of zzso cells in zzso that allows achieving a final zzso product containing zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso performing up to three zzso Between March 1999 and August 2003, patients with zzso and solid zzso who underwent zzso for zzso bone zzso transplantation were zzso zzso zzso zzso in 48 patients were performed zzso zzso per zzso range zzso zzso were mobilized with zzso plus zzso human zzso stimulating factor zzso zzso zzso zzso other chemotherapy drugs plus zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso alone zzso zzso zzso We found a strong correlation between the zzso cells count in peripheral blood and the zzso cells yielded zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Using zzso characteristic zzso curves, the minimum number of zzso cells in zzso to obtain zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the first zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso The best zzso point necessary to obtain the same target in the final harvest was zzso zzso performing up to three zzso zzso zzso specificity zzso In our experience, zzso or zzso zzso zzso is the best predictor to begin the zzso zzso Based on this threshold level, it is possible to achieve at least zzso zzso zzso zzso cells in the graft with zzso or zzso zzso
