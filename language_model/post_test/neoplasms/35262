In this paper we examine spending by privately insured patients with four conditions often treated with specialty drugs: cancer, kidney disease, zzso arthritis, and multiple zzso Despite having zzso health insurance, these patients face substantial risk for high out-of-pocket zzso In contrast to traditional zzso we find that specialty drug use is largely insensitive to cost sharing, with price zzso ranging from zzso to zzso Given the expense of many specialty drugs, care management should focus on making sure that patients who will most benefit receive zzso Once such patients are identified, it makes little economic sense to limit zzso
