zzso is invariably associated with poor proliferation of primary cells, but the specific contributions of abnormal zzso to cancer, a disease characterized by zzso and zzso zzso remain zzso In this study, I demonstrate that the zzso zzso caused by zzso in primary cells are also present in zzso unstable cancer cell lines, but the same zzso are not common to all zzso zzso zzso unstable cancer lines and zzso primary cells also share an increase in zzso and zzso cycle zzso The biological response to zzso is associated with cellular stress and slow zzso and a zzso signature derived from primary zzso cells was defined as a strong predictor of increased survival in several zzso zzso a zzso signature derived from zzso zzso in tumors correlated with high zzso activity and poor zzso Together, these findings suggested that there are two types of zzso in zzso one is zzso zzso which is selected during tumor evolution and associated with robust growth, and the other is zzso zzso caused by zzso instability zzso zzso zzso more closely resembles the stressed state of primary zzso cells, yet zzso is not zzso a subset of genes zzso in zzso zzso predict aggressive disease in human patients in a zzso zzso
