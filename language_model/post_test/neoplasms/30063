Little is known about engagement in multiple health zzso in childhood cancer zzso 

Using zzso class analysis, we identified health zzso patterns in zzso adult survivors of childhood cancer (age zzso zzso and 1670 zzso and zzso controls from the general zzso zzso groups were determined from replies to questions on smoking, drinking, zzso use, sporting activities, diet, sun protection and skin zzso 

The model identified four health zzso zzso zzso with a generally healthy zzso zzso zzso with higher levels of sporting activities, but moderate zzso zzso engaging in several risk zzso and zzso smoking but not zzso Similar proportions of survivors and controls fell into the zzso zzso vs zzso and the zzso cluster zzso vs zzso but more survivors were in the zzso zzso zzso vs zzso and fewer in the zzso cluster zzso vs zzso zzso of health zzso clusters were zzso migration background, income and zzso 

A comparable proportion of childhood cancer survivors as in the general population engage in multiple zzso zzso Because of increased vulnerability of survivors, multiple risk zzso should be addressed in targeted health zzso
