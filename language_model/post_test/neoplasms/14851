zzso moving zzso radiation therapy zzso has been proposed to account for tumor motions during zzso in prior zzso The basic idea of SMART is to zzso the moving radiation beam zzso formed by a dynamic zzso zzso zzso with the tumor motion induced by zzso In this paper, a two-dimensional zzso zzso leaf sequencing method is presented for zzso A leaf sequence zzso strategy was generated to assure the SMART delivery under realistic delivery zzso The study of delivery performance using the zzso zzso and the Millennium zzso showed that clinical factors such as zzso angle, dose rate, initial phase and machine tolerance affect the delivery accuracy and zzso An in-house leaf sequencing software was developed to implement the zzso zzso leaf sequencing method and zzso the zzso leaf sequence under realistic clinical zzso The analysis of dynamic log zzso files showed that zzso of the leaf sequence for various clinical factors can avoid beam zzso which break the synchronization of SMART and fail the SMART dose zzso Through comparison between the simulated delivered zzso map and the zzso zzso map, it was shown that the zzso leaf sequence can greatly reduce the dose zzso
