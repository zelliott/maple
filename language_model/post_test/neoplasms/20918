Numerous studies have found a clear relationship between systemic exposure and the toxicity or (more zzso the efficacy of zzso zzso Moreover, the clearance of most of these drugs differs widely between zzso These findings, combined with the narrow therapeutic index of zzso drugs, suggest that patient outcome would be improved if doses were zzso to achieve a target systemic zzso zzso maximum a zzso probability zzso forecasting is an efficient and robust method for the zzso of drug therapy, but its use for zzso drugs is not yet zzso The aim of this paper is to review the application of population zzso and zzso to zzso drugs and to evaluate whether and when zzso zzso zzso improves the clinical benefit of zzso zzso For each drug, the relationships between zzso variables zzso plasma concentration or the area under the zzso zzso and zzso effects are zzso zzso the zzso employed are considered and, finally, the results are zzso in terms of zzso performance as well as, where possible, the impact on clinical zzso Some studies were retrospective and intended only to evaluate individual zzso zzso values using very few blood zzso Among the prospective trials, a few studied the zzso relationships which provided the basis for routine zzso zzso Others were performed in clinical context where zzso zzso zzso was used to determine maximum tolerated systemic exposure zzso for zzso zzso zzso or for zzso monitoring zzso for zzso or platinum zzso Indeed, its flexibility in blood sampling times makes this technique much more zzso than other limited sampling zzso These examples demonstrate that individual dose adjustment helps manage zzso The performance of zzso monitoring is linked to the methodology used at each step of its design and zzso Moreover, a limitation to the use of zzso monitoring for certain zzso drugs has been the difficulty in obtaining zzso or zzso zzso Recent progress in zzso methods, as well as the development of zzso methods (such as zzso zzso zzso for evaluating the effects of chemotherapy, will help to define zzso zzso zzso zzso is the strategy of choice for performing zzso studies, as well as ensuring that a given patient benefits from the desired systemic zzso Together, these methods could contribute to improving cancer chemotherapy in terms of patient outcome and zzso
