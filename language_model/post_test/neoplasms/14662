zzso is effective in zzso the zzso and total number of tumors resulting from treatment with various chemical zzso This zzso occurs both at the initiation and promotion zzso of chemical zzso At least part of the zzso of the initiation stage is associated with changes in the metabolism of the parent zzso Studies with zzso suggest that zzso specifically blocks the zzso responsible for the formation of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso is also effective in reducing the in zzso and in zzso growth of numerous zzso zzso However, differences in the sensitivity to zzso are evident in the various tumor cell lines that have been zzso Continuous zzso intake appears to be necessary to zzso zzso in both models of zzso Evidence suggests that zzso or some other intermediate in zzso metabolism is responsible for the zzso and zzso properties of this trace zzso The mechanism by which zzso produces these effects is unknown, but it may relate to zzso in either zzso zzso or zzso These and other data strongly suggest that zzso is a naturally occurring zzso and zzso zzso
