zzso is a commonly used zzso agent in the treatment of many types of zzso Little is known about the interactions of zzso with cardiac zzso Serious zzso including zzso zzso often resulting in a fatal zzso heart failure may occur as a consequence of chemotherapy with zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of exposure to zzso on the changes in major zzso acids in tissue of cardiac muscle zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso An in zzso interaction study was performed as a comparison of zzso acid profiles in heart tissue before and after application of zzso We found that zzso directly influences zzso zzso acid representation even at low zzso In addition, we performed an interaction study that resulted in the determination of breaking points for each of analyzed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined as the most sensitive zzso zzso zzso we compared zzso acid profiles of zzso before and after exposure to zzso The amount of zzso acids after interaction with zzso was significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso This fact points at an ability of zzso to induce changes in quantitative composition of zzso acids in zzso Moreover, this confirms that the interactions between zzso and zzso acids may act as another factor most likely responsible for adverse effects of zzso on zzso
