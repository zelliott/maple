The quality of care provided to patients with cancer who are dying in hospital and their families is zzso The UK Liverpool Care zzso zzso for patients who are dying was developed with the aim of transferring the best practice of zzso to zzso We therefore assessed the effectiveness of zzso in the Italian context zzso in improving the quality of zzso care for patients with cancer in hospitals and for their zzso 

In this pragmatic cluster zzso trial, 16 Italian general medicine hospital zzso were randomly assigned to implement the zzso zzso or standard health-care zzso For each ward, we identified all patients who died from cancer in the 3 months before zzso zzso and in the 6 months after the completion of the zzso training zzso The primary zzso was the overall quality of care zzso zzso Analysis was by intention to zzso This study is registered with zzso number zzso 

During the zzso assessment, data were gathered for 308 patients who died from cancer zzso in zzso zzso zzso and 161 in control zzso 232 zzso of 308 family members were zzso 119 zzso of 147 with relatives cared for in the zzso zzso zzso cluster size zzso zzso eight to zzso and 113 zzso of 161 in the control zzso zzso zzso to zzso After zzso of the zzso zzso no significant difference was noted in the distribution of the overall quality of care zzso scores between the zzso in which the zzso zzso was implemented and the control zzso zzso zzso of 100 vs zzso of 100; zzso mean difference zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

The effect of the zzso zzso in our study is less than the effects noted in earlier phase 2 zzso However, if the zzso is implemented well it has the potential to reduce the gap in quality of care between zzso and zzso Further research is needed to ascertain what components of the zzso zzso might be effective and to develop and assess a wider range of approaches to quality improvement in hospital care for people at the end of their lives and for their zzso
