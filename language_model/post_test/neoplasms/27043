zzso viral integration zzso zzso is an zzso zinc finger zzso factor whose expression is frequently zzso in zzso leukemia and zzso zzso To better understand the mechanisms underlying zzso disease, we sought to define the zzso zzso in cancer zzso By using stable isotope labeling by zzso acids in cell culture zzso quantitative zzso we could confidently assign 78 proteins as zzso partners for zzso zzso zzso we showed that 22 of 27 tested interacting proteins could zzso with zzso zzso zzso which represented an zzso validation zzso Additionally, by comparing the stable isotope labeling by zzso acids in cell culture zzso data with zzso zzso two hybrid results, we showed that five of these proteins zzso directly with zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins revealed associations with cellular zzso zzso zzso of zzso components of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and proteins regulating DNA repair, zzso and zzso We also identified zzso zzso sites by zzso analysis and showed that zzso and zzso can be zzso and zzso by two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II and protein zzso Finally, zzso that impair zzso zzso at these sites reduced zzso DNA binding through its zzso zinc finger domain and induced cancer cell zzso zzso these zzso zzso approaches demonstrate that zzso interacts with large and complex networks of zzso which integrate signals from various different signaling pathways important for zzso Comprehensive analysis of the zzso zzso has thus provided an important resource for zzso the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso
