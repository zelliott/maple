Human cancer risks from zzso have been estimated from zzso data, with supporting evidence from animal zzso zzso This article zzso the zzso risk assessments using zzso based zzso zzso models of zzso metabolism in animals and zzso Internal doses zzso zzso zzso from oral zzso experiments in mice are well predicted by the zzso zzso Both the data and the zzso model zzso are also well described by a simple zzso zzso zzso model, as previously used by zzso and zzso zzso internal doses used in risk assessment of zzso zzso Health zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso model family to internal doses changes the zzso estimate zzso zzso curve for mice from zzso to purely zzso so that zzso risk estimates are smaller than in previous risk zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso findings using zzso dose conversion, the use of internal dose estimates for humans from a zzso model reduces estimated human risks at low zzso zzso analyses suggest that the finding of a zzso zzso zzso curve at low doses is robust to changes in internal dose definitions and more consistent with zzso data than earlier risk zzso A zzso uncertainty analysis based on zzso probabilities and zzso conditioning is used to develop an entire probability distribution for the true but unknown zzso zzso This allows the probability of a positive zzso slope to be zzso It is about zzso An upper zzso confidence limit on the zzso slope of excess risk is also obtained directly from the zzso distribution and is similar to previous zzso zzso This approach suggests that the excess risk due to zzso exposure may be nonexistent (or even zzso at sufficiently low zzso Two types of biological information about zzso zzso and zzso examined to test the zzso of this zzso A framework for incorporating zzso relevant biological information into zzso risk assessment is introduced, and it is shown that both zzso and zzso models appear to be consistent with the hypothesis that sufficiently low zzso of zzso zzso do not create and excess zzso
