zzso zzso zzso is an immune stimulating zzso recently tested in two Phase 1 trials for immune responsive zzso A secondary objective of these trials was to characterize zzso responses to zzso in zzso Here, we report the effects of systemic zzso on serum markers of immune zzso 

zzso zzso was administered by intravenous zzso injection at dose levels from 1 to 100 zzso using two distinct treatment zzso zzso weekly zzso for 6 zzso or once daily for five consecutive days followed by nine zzso days zzso + zzso In the absence of dose limiting zzso additional cycles of dosing were initiated immediately following the nine zzso zzso An array of 70 different proteins was zzso in subject serum samples from several time points during the course of the zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed on a zzso subset of these zzso 

zzso administration of zzso affected the serum levels of several zzso zzso zzso proteins and cell zzso zzso The magnitude and duration of response were dose dependent for a subset of these zzso The 5 + 9 dosing regimen generally produced zzso changes that were of greater zzso as compared to a more chronic stimulation with the zzso dosing zzso Despite these differences, zzso effects on many zzso were similar between regimens when averaged over the time of zzso Based on similar zzso zzso and dose response changes, groups of zzso were identified that exhibited distinct components of the zzso immune zzso zzso indicative of zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso acute phase response zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were strongly modulated in subjects treated with zzso 

Administration of zzso resulted in zzso of multiple cell types and immune response zzso The changes observed in serum proteins were consistent with zzso processes of zzso and zzso cell zzso and trafficking, and acute phase zzso
