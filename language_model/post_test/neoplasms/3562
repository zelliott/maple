We have recently shown that zzso zzso in zzso putative zzso zzso sites result in increased stability and zzso distribution of the zzso protein in a human lung cancer cell zzso In the present study, we showed that when zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 382 of zzso were zzso with zzso the resulting A4 protein was resistant to zzso zzso degradation but was highly sensitive to human zzso zzso zzso When A4 and zzso zzso were zzso into zzso zzso cells, A4 significantly reduced colony formation in zzso when compared with zzso zzso Our results suggest that A4 exerts a zzso effect more efficiently than zzso zzso does in cell lines that zzso zzso and may therefore be a better therapeutic tool than zzso zzso for certain zzso in which zzso is amplified or zzso
