Transfer of suicide genes into tumor cells renders them sensitive to zzso effects of specific zzso We show here that both the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suicide gene systems can induce cell death in tumor zzso zzso in mixed cultures of cells with and without the suicide zzso death occurred in both cell types, indicative of a bystander zzso We zzso in human and zzso cell lines, that the zzso bystander effect requires gap zzso zzso communication zzso Where cultures lack zzso no bystander effect was zzso In zzso cultures, no correlation between level of zzso and bystander effect was seen and this was due to high levels of zzso zzso Additionally, we demonstrate that transfer of toxic zzso from zzso to zzso cells occurs within 2 zzso of zzso application and, as no zzso could be detected until after this time, zzso is the result, not the cause, of the zzso bystander zzso In the zzso system, a zzso bystander effect, independent of zzso and zzso was zzso We demonstrated that combining zzso and zzso suicide gene systems in culture was more effective than either therapy zzso
