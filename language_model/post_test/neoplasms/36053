The impact of cancer scale version 1 zzso from 2006 has only been tested zzso in a zzso sample of 193 American long-term cancer survivors zzso The Norwegian version of zzso compares the zzso findings of that study with those observed in a zzso sample of zzso Norwegian zzso 

We performed exploratory zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso tests of internal consistency, zzso studies with various other tests and a change over time examination in order to test reliability and zzso of the zzso 

The American factor structure of the zzso with 10 dimensions showed adequate fit with zzso in the Norwegian sample, but internal consistency was insufficient in 2 zzso zzso of the Norwegian sample found a 9 factor solution that also showed adequate fit on zzso and with sufficient internal zzso for all zzso The zzso dimensions, anxiety, depression, zzso fatigue and body image all showed low correlations with the positive dimensions of the zzso but higher correlations with the zzso negative zzso The zzso dimensions showed considerable stability over zzso 

In our big zzso sample of zzso the Norwegian version of the zzso showed zzso and concurrent zzso and reliability was zzso
