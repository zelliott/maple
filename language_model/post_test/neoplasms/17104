To investigate the zzso expression of zzso zzso in benign and zzso zzso and to explore the difference in zzso zzso expression among different zzso 

A total of 36 samples were collected from the Fifth zzso Hospital of Sun zzso University and divided into two experimental groups: benign zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso 10) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer of colon zzso zzso zzso cancer of the liver zzso zzso zzso gastric cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso in zzso was examined with reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso technology, and the positive rate of zzso zzso was compared between different zzso 

The positive rate of zzso zzso in zzso zzso was zzso zzso which was significantly higher than in benign zzso zzso zzso difference being significant between these two groups zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The proportion of the positive rate in the zzso zzso was as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso colon cancer zzso zzso liver cancer zzso zzso gastric cancer zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso zzso However, there was no significant difference in zzso zzso expression among various tumors with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Among the benign zzso zzso zzso levels were different between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but there was no significant difference zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso detected by zzso is useful in the differential diagnosis of benign and zzso zzso which also has potential value in the clinical diagnosis of zzso
