We developed a zzso zzso imaging system for the whole body in order to evaluate the spatial distribution of zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso scanner with ring detectors was modified to provide 54 directional zzso images with a three-dimensional appearance by using cinematic zzso The initial clinical evaluation was performed on two normal volunteers and 17 cancer patients with 32 zzso Images were obtained approximately one hour after the intravenous administration of zzso In all 19 subjects, good quality images with a three-dimensional appearance were zzso We were able to zzso 16 of 20 zzso zzso that were three zzso or more in greatest zzso In contrast, only seven of 12 zzso zzso less than three zzso in greatest diameter were zzso The overall zzso of zzso was zzso These results suggest that this system will be useful for tumor zzso
