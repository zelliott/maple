Despite improvements in surgical technique, organ preservation, zzso and management of infection, the long term survival following lung transplantation remains low, mainly due to immune zzso complications such as acute and chronic zzso Almost all zzso agents used in the prophylaxis and treatment of rejection following lung transplantation are targets of T cell zzso function or zzso which in theory should cause sufficient disruption of the zzso immune system to prevent graft zzso However the five year survival rate of only 50% suggests this is not the zzso More recent evidence suggests that zzso cells may play a significant role in immune processes following lung zzso This article reviews the literature on the potential function of zzso cells in zzso infection, zzso and tolerance following lung zzso
