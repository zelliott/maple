zzso zzso of cellular zzso and zzso content (with or without incubation in the presence of zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso was studied in cells from zzso peripheral blood, bone zzso zzso and zzso and zzso fluid of solid tumor zzso zzso examples are presented to show that zzso in cellular zzso retention as well as sensitivity to zzso zzso is seen in human tumor zzso Several tumor zzso differing in their cellular retention of zzso or sensitivity to zzso were zzso In serial tumor samples from patients zzso and zzso with zzso zzso initial drug retention and sensitivity to zzso zzso was followed by lack of drug retention and zzso to zzso The present study shows that in view of the variables encountered in zzso characteristics and sensitivity to zzso zzso one needs to screen tumor samples before recommending use of any particular transport zzso to enhance drug retention and sensitivity of drug-resistant zzso
