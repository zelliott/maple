A number of zzso compounds zzso are available for use in gasoline to reduce vehicle exhaust emissions, reduce the aromatic compound content, and avoid the use of zzso compounds, while maintaining high zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one such zzso The current use of zzso in gasoline or petrol is modest but zzso with consequently similar trends in the potential for human zzso zzso is the most likely mode of exposure, with about zzso of zzso zzso being retained by the lungs and distributed around the zzso Following zzso of exposure, the blood concentration of zzso falls zzso largely as a result of its metabolism to zzso alcohol zzso and zzso zzso may be further zzso first to zzso and then to zzso the two dominant zzso found in urine of volunteers and zzso The rapid zzso of zzso suggests that its blood concentration is unlikely to rise above normal as a result of human exposure to sources of zzso zzso toxicity tests show that zzso has low toxicity and is essentially zzso to eyes and zzso it did not cause zzso in a zzso test in guinea zzso Neurological effects have been observed only at very high exposure zzso There is evidence for an effect of zzso on the kidney of zzso zzso in kidney weight were seen in both zzso but protein zzso zzso (with zzso zzso and sustained increases in cell proliferation occurred only in zzso In liver, zzso necrosis was induced in mice, but not rats, after exposure by zzso although this zzso was reported in some rats exposed to very high oral doses of zzso The proportion of liver cells engaged in zzso DNA synthesis was increased in mice of both sexes exposed by zzso zzso has no specific effects on zzso development, or genetic zzso zzso studies have been conducted with zzso zzso and ethanol zzso in this review as an zzso precursor of zzso in the absence of zzso A single experiment with zzso in rats and several experiments with ethanol in rats and mice were not considered adequate for an evaluation of zzso zzso In male rats only, zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These are generally considered to have no human zzso In addition, increases in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso were associated with zzso treatment in female zzso This result lacks independent confirmation and is not supported by experiments in which similar or higher internal doses of zzso were zzso
