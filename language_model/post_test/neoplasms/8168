Cancer develops through the successive zzso and selection of genetic and zzso zzso enabling cells to survive, replicate and evade zzso control mechanisms such as zzso and zzso zzso This transformation process, however, may create vulnerabilities since the zzso of zzso can expose synthetic lethal gene interactions and zzso cellular zzso zzso giving rise to new therapeutic zzso With the completion of the human zzso project, it is anticipated that the identification and characterization of genetic networks that regulate cell growth, zzso zzso and transformation will be fundamental to decoding the complexity of these zzso and ultimately, cancer zzso zzso zzso such as large-scale zzso profiling using zzso have already begun to reveal the molecular basis of cancer zzso and the clinical behavior of zzso The combination of traditional cell culture techniques with zzso screening approaches has given rise to new zzso zzso that enable the simultaneous interrogation of thousands of genes in live cells, zzso true functional profiling of biological zzso Among these, zzso interference zzso has the potential to enable rapid zzso zzso zzso screens in zzso systems, which until recently has been the sole domain of lower zzso Here, we present a broad overview of this maturing technology and explore how, within current technical constraints, large-scale zzso use of zzso can be exploited to uncover the molecular basis of zzso the zzso of synthetic zzso and zzso cellular addiction to the acquisition of zzso cellular zzso
