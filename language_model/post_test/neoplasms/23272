The field of synthetic biology is rapidly expanding and has over the past years evolved from the development of simple gene networks to complex zzso zzso The zzso of cell fate with zzso or zzso synthetic control circuits along with biologically implemented logical functions have fostered applications spanning over a wide range of disciplines, including artificial zzso personalized medicine and the treatment of cancer and zzso zzso In this review we describe several applications of interactive gene networks, a synthetic zzso approach for future gene therapy, as well as the zzso of synthetic gene circuits as zzso for the design of zzso zzso zzso The recent progress in synthetic biology, including the zzso of zzso devices with the body's zzso network as well as novel therapeutic approaches originating from interdisciplinary work, generates numerous opportunities for future biomedical zzso
