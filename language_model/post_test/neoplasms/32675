The zzso branch point sequence zzso is crucial for zzso of human nuclear zzso yet zzso zzso have infrequently been reported to cause human zzso Using an inverse zzso technique we mapped two zzso to the zzso zzso at positions zzso and zzso in zzso 3 of the human zzso DNA repair zzso We identified zzso zzso in each of these zzso in two newly diagnosed Turkish families with the zzso zzso disorder zzso zzso zzso zzso from two severely affected children in family A harbor a zzso point zzso in zzso zzso 3 zzso T to zzso located within the downstream zzso Using a real-time quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso these cells expressed no zzso zzso normal zzso zzso Instead they expressed an zzso zzso zzso with deletion of zzso 4 that has no DNA repair activity in a host cell zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in cells from three mildly affected siblings in family B, the zzso zzso located at the zzso position in zzso zzso 3 is zzso to a zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso of normal zzso zzso These cells from family B had a higher level of zzso than cells from the severely affected siblings in family A, who had multiple skin zzso zzso identified in two zzso of the zzso zzso 3 resulted in alternative zzso that impaired DNA repair function, thus implicating both of these zzso as essential for normal zzso zzso However, a small amount of normal zzso zzso can provide partial protection against skin zzso
