The discovery of zzso zzso protein zzso arose from interest in the mechanisms by which certain zzso cause zzso without necessarily zzso to zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso had for a long time been ascribed to inappropriate production of zzso hormone zzso by zzso The zzso portions of zzso and zzso have essentially identical actions through a common zzso for zzso to elevate plasma calcium by promoting bone zzso and decreasing calcium zzso zzso for plasma zzso fail to detect protein convincingly in normal zzso but measurable levels have been found in up to zzso of patients with zzso in zzso of patients with breast zzso zzso to bone, and in some zzso patients with zzso zzso Whereas zzso clearly functions as a hormone in those zzso in which it is produced in zzso in normal circumstances it is produced locally in many zzso in which it is a zzso zzso There appears to be little doubt that zzso is the major zzso of zzso in patients with zzso although it is possible that other factors zzso bone zzso zzso also could contribute in some zzso In the case of breast zzso another possible role arises for zzso The high zzso of zzso production by primary breast zzso elevated plasma levels in zzso of those with zzso and zzso zzso and higher zzso of zzso production in skeletal versus those with zzso zzso have led to the hypothesis that zzso might contribute to breast zzso growth in zzso Experimental evidence currently is available to support this zzso The discovery of zzso has contributed greatly to current understanding of the skeletal complications of zzso
