Cancer cluster investigations are usually zzso in nature; they focus on a particular cancer, such as zzso and attempt to determine whether excess risk is associated with a suspected zzso zzso Although several causes of death (such as zzso lymphoma, zzso may be considered, the approach is zzso because the causes of death are zzso zzso and independently of one zzso This approach is consistent with a zzso zzso zzso zzso however, is the action of a zzso zzso at only one body site, and correlations among causes of death are the norm rather than the zzso A multiple effects model is therefore appropriate, and the zzso nature of cancer mortality data should be exploited when exploring geographic pattern in cancer zzso This paper describes such an zzso We construct maps based on a principal components analysis of cancer mortality rates from different geographic zzso The resulting principal components are called synthetic cancer variables zzso and maps of the zzso scores are synthetic risk maps zzso These maps zzso geographic variation in cancer risk at several body sites zzso and may be zzso for zzso spatial structure and zzso geographic association with potential risk zzso As an example, we use synthetic risk maps to determine whether high-risk counties in Illinois cluster near nuclear zzso Much work remains to be done, but synthetic cancer risk maps appear to be a useful tool for zzso geographic pattern and zzso structure in cancer zzso
