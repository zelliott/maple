The objective in our study was to evaluate the worker's zzso to lead and cadmium in 32 zzso technicians in an eastern Sicily hospital in workers of low melting point zzso of lead, tin, cadmium and zzso zzso that can be melted at 73 degrees C as zzso Such zzso is used for the fabrication of objects used for the personal protection of cancer patients subject to high energy zzso The parameters taken into consideration for this study were sex, age and smoking zzso In the test zzso working cycle reported in our case, there were traces of smoke formation containing lead, tin, zzso and zzso zzso is a substance considered by zzso to be zzso and can be found in both work and living zzso therefore it is often difficult to establish rather its presence in the zzso is due to working activities and/or the living zzso In these cases it is necessary to evaluate whether the work represents an added risk to develop zzso compared to the consequences due to normal environmental zzso The added risk linked to work is evaluated comparing the concentration of toxic substances found in the living environments zzso zzso zzso with the toxic and/or zzso found in the working environment, and comparing the biological reports of the population not directly exposed by work zzso zzso zzso and those zzso We performed a biological monitoring for lead and cadmium on the workers zzso The Italian Legislature, aside from lead, has not yet issued guidelines pertaining to professional exposure to cadmium, and therefore it is mandatory to take reference to the American zzso charts both for environmental exposure zzso zzso biological monitoring zzso Biological monitoring, which allows to evaluate the zzso by both inhalation and zzso was performed through measuring the levels of lend and cadmium in the zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso in urine zzso The results show that in no case the levels of lead in the zzso zzso were above the reference value and zzso The levels of cadmium urine zzso weren't above the reference level and the zzso while the zzso levels of cadmium zzso were higher than the reference value in 8 subjects, each long time smokers, each of about 20 cigarettes a zzso This data shows how, in the evaluation of zzso to cadmium, aside from the exam of data pertaining to work, the study of ways of zzso and the interpretation of the results of environmental and biological monitoring, it is important to consider the possibility of intoxication outside of the zzso zzso smoke, as already indicated by other authors, is also confirmed in our studies as one of the major zzso of non professionally linked inhalation of zzso
