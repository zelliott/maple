zzso zzso has long been known to be the principal zzso growth factor that regulates cellular proliferation and differentiation along the zzso zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso is a zzso zzso that is zzso and exerts broad zzso effects in diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been widely used in the clinic to prevent or treat zzso zzso A series of clinical trials have documented the efficacy of zzso in reducing zzso zzso requirements and improving quality of life in cancer patients, and a recent zzso suggested a positive effect on zzso However, two zzso trials reported negative outcomes with zzso as patients in the zzso arm fared worse than their zzso counterparts with respect to zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells has raised the possibility that zzso zzso may exert direct effects on tumor cells associated with the potential for stimulation of zzso zzso of zzso or zzso of sensitivity to zzso zzso The presence of an zzso zzso system in tumors and potential effects of zzso on tumor zzso and zzso are consistent with a complex biology for zzso signaling in cancer that requires further zzso This review describes zzso and zzso biology, focusing on the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso as well as the expression and function of zzso in cancer zzso
