The purpose of this study was to estimate the mean incremental cost of zzso zzso and the drivers of zzso Another goal was to estimate the impact of depth and duration of zzso on the cost of zzso 

A retrospective zzso consisting of a random sample of 75 solid tumor or zzso patients who developed zzso zzso zzso 50,000 zzso per zzso was zzso The number of each type of resource used during 217 cycles with and 300 cycles without zzso were multiplied by the cost of each resource and summed to yield the total cost of care (in 1999 dollars from the provider's zzso 

Compared with cycles without zzso the mean incremental cost of zzso was zzso per zzso However, zzso of cycles were usual cost, with a mean cost of zzso of $43 per cycle less than control zzso Twelve percent of cycles were high cost zzso incremental cost zzso zzso per zzso zzso were very high cost zzso incremental cost zzso zzso The excess cost during zzso cycles was due to high consumption of zzso zzso zzso and during very zzso cycles to both higher zzso zzso consumption and to a high zzso of major bleeding zzso 

Although zzso is a common complication of chemotherapy, only zzso of cycles with zzso would be considered high or very high zzso zzso targeted at this subset of cycles could significantly reduce the cost of zzso provided they are initiated early enough in the chemotherapy experience to be zzso
