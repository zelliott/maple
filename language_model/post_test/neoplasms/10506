zzso from the primary tumor to distant zzso is the principal cause of mortality in patients with zzso While zzso factors can predict which patients are likely to have their cancer zzso these are not perfect zzso and some patient's zzso recur even decades after apparently successful zzso This phenomenon is referred to as zzso Data from experimental studies have revealed two categories of zzso zzso cellular zzso with solitary cancer cells in zzso zzso and zzso zzso characterized by a balanced state of proliferation and zzso but with no net increase in zzso Development of new models and imaging techniques to track the fate of dormant cancer cells is beginning to shed some light on zzso zzso of the molecular pathways involved in dormancy will advance clinical understanding and may suggest new avenues for treatment to inhibit the revival of these dormant cells, thereby reducing cancer mortality zzso
