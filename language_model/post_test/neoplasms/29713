Previous studies have shown that addition of zzso to the zzso in zzso zzso the zzso response of zzso to zzso whereas long term treatment by zzso in zzso has no major effect on the zzso responsiveness of zzso patient's zzso zzso reasons for the zzso between the results obtained following treatment by zzso in zzso and in zzso were zzso It was observed that the zzso response of zzso patients zzso to various zzso was not affected to any major extent 24 zzso after a single injection of 3 million units of zzso zzso zzso from zzso patients and healthy donors were found not to differ in their zzso to zzso zzso effect in zzso zzso zzso present in the zzso throughout the incubation period, inhibited the response of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso showing zzso and not zzso in the preparations to be responsible for this zzso Although the presence of zzso in the zzso throughout the incubation period inhibited the zzso response of zzso zzso of these cells with zzso in zzso was found to have no major effect on their response to zzso We conclude that the lack of effect on the zzso response of zzso following treatment by zzso in zzso is probably due to the fact that the zzso were only treated with zzso prior to the zzso
