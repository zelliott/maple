To determine the relationship between zzso and intensive care unit zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso study based on zzso collected zzso 

A zzso medical and surgical zzso 

All patients hospitalized zzso zzso in the zzso were eligible during a zzso zzso 

zzso was defined as active solid or zzso zzso zzso or chronic zzso zzso zzso bacteria were defined as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and extending spectrum zzso producing zzso zzso zzso bacteria screening zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso was performed at zzso admission and zzso Only zzso bacteria isolated zzso zzso after zzso admission were taken into zzso zzso were zzso Isolation measures were applied in all patients at zzso admission, in patients with zzso bacteria, and in patients with zzso zzso patients zzso were matched zzso with zzso patients zzso according to all the following criteria: age zzso zzso zzso Acute zzso zzso II zzso duration of zzso stay zzso days, and category of admission zzso zzso factors for zzso zzso bacteria were determined using zzso and zzso zzso 

Of zzso eligible patients, nine patients were excluded for absence of zzso bacteria screening at zzso zzso One hundred zzso zzso patients were zzso and 128 zzso of them were successfully zzso Mean time between zzso admission and first zzso zzso bacteria was 12 zzso 9 zzso zzso of zzso bacteria was significantly higher in cases than in controls zzso zzso 12 zzso zzso zzso days, p zzso zzso However, zzso was not independently associated with zzso zzso zzso analysis identified prior zzso treatment and zzso treatment in the zzso as risk factors for zzso zzso bacteria zzso ratio zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 11 zzso p zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is not independently associated with zzso zzso zzso However, infection control measures used in our zzso may have influenced this zzso
