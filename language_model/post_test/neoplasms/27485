This study was performed to determine the effects of markers of inflammation zzso 6) and zzso zzso on mortality and functional status in older zzso 

zzso were selected for the Duke zzso zzso for zzso Studies of the zzso In 1992, zzso subjects (age zzso zzso were zzso of whom zzso had zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso 6 and zzso were zzso into zzso Outcomes were mortality (through 5 zzso and functional status (through 4 zzso Relative risks were estimated with zzso hazards models that adjusted for potential zzso 

The relative risk of mortality was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso for those with only zzso levels in the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso for subjects with only zzso levels in the highest zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso for those with levels of both in the highest zzso as compared with those who were not in either of the highest zzso Those with high zzso and high zzso levels had the greatest declines in all measures of zzso 

zzso of the zzso and inflammatory pathways is associated with mortality and decline in function, and may be part of the explanation for the development of a frailty zzso in the zzso
