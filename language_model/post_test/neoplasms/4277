zzso of circulating soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso are elevated in patients affected by solid zzso however, the cellular sources generating high levels of zzso remain to be zzso Using zzso media zzso from seven zzso or zzso zzso cells, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso the release of zzso by human zzso vein zzso zzso The intensity of the effect correlated with the amounts of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso were also zzso by zzso zzso The zzso of the shedding of zzso and of its expression at protein and zzso level were completely reversed by the addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the in zzso data, zzso zzso were strongly stained for zzso compared with zzso normal tissue zzso Taken altogether, our observations reveal an zzso zzso relationship sustaining the shedding of zzso by zzso zzso This is a general phenomenon in solid zzso that zzso with the ability of zzso cells to zzso zzso rather than with their expression of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso has been previously shown to inhibit zzso zzso zzso therefore, the ability of zzso cells to zzso zzso is likely to represent a mechanism for their escape from immune zzso
