Bone zzso zzso zzso cells have been shown to promote the repair of damaged zzso offering promise for the treatment of zzso and acquired human zzso These cells in fact differentiate into zzso zzso cells and possibly zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells may participate in zzso by zzso into zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso cells home to sites of zzso and stimulate healing of injured zzso but also promote zzso tumor growth and inflammatory zzso These cells may thus participate in tissue zzso or zzso of several zzso Although the molecular mechanisms that promote the zzso and recruitment of bone zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso remain unclear the evidence that these cells promote tissue repair is zzso
