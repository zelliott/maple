Many human tumors treated by zzso do not reach therapeutic temperatures zzso degrees zzso The explanation for this difference may be that some tumors react to zzso stress in a manner similar to normal zzso zzso they increase blood flow during zzso in order to zzso the zzso Higher temperatures might be achieved in these zzso tumors by administering zzso agents in an effort to reduce blood zzso In this preliminary study, we determined the extent to which zzso zzso of local blood flow might allow higher temperatures to develop in normal muscles exposed to localized zzso zzso We found that the local muscle temperature rise could be increased by at least zzso in two dogs and six rabbits with the use of a local zzso zzso
