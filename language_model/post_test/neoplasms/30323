Many advanced tumors produce excessive amounts of zzso Growth zzso zzso which, in normal zzso cells, is a potent growth zzso However, in zzso activated cells, the zzso action of zzso is often diverted along alternative zzso zzso zzso signaling elicits protective or tumor zzso effects during the early zzso stages of zzso However, later in tumor development when zzso cells become zzso to zzso growth zzso the tumor cell responds by stimulating pathways with tumor progressing zzso At late stages of zzso tumor progression is driven by zzso zzso The tumor zzso is a target of zzso action that stimulates tumor progression via zzso effects on zzso zzso and zzso zzso Bone is one of the richest sources of zzso in the body and a common site for dissemination of breast cancer zzso zzso degradation of bone zzso which accompanies establishment and growth of zzso triggers further release of zzso zzso This leads to a vicious positive feedback of tumor zzso driven by ever increasing levels of zzso released from both the tumor and bone zzso It is for this reason, that pharmaceutical companies have developed therapeutic agents that block zzso zzso Nonetheless, the choice of drug design and dosing strategy can affect the efficacy of zzso zzso This review will describe zzso and clinical data of four major classes of zzso zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Long term dosing strategies with zzso zzso may be zzso since this class of drug has potentially highly zzso activity, and development of drug resistance might zzso tumor zzso Current zzso for the use of zzso zzso in zzso have therefore moved towards the use of zzso therapies and short term zzso with considerable promise for the zzso
