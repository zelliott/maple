zzso evidence of clinical benefits from cancer zzso is beginning to accumulate in several clinical zzso Cancer zzso is based on two main methods, active vaccination and zzso zzso The ex zzso expansion of T cells is required to monitor zzso zzso T cells or prepare large numbers of zzso zzso for adoptive zzso 

We examined the influence of culture medium on zzso growth, zzso and zzso after zzso using immobilized zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso blood zzso cells zzso were cultured in zzso zzso or zzso with or without zzso zzso 

When supplemented with sufficient serum, zzso was a good culture medium for zzso expansion following zzso zzso zzso of zzso serum to zzso or zzso increased the numbers of cells obtained to a similar extent, but their zzso and function were quite zzso zzso T cells cultured with zzso zzso greater zzso than any other zzso Regardless of the media used, the main population expanded after zzso stimulation was zzso zzso While more zzso zzso T cells were induced in zzso and zzso more zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso T cells were induced in zzso When cells were zzso by zzso for 14 days, approximately zzso times and zzso times more zzso T cells were obtained in zzso than zzso or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso depends on the selection of appropriate culture media to support efficient expansion of the type of T cell zzso
