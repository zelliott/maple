As prepared zzso of metals, zzso zzso and carbon often need surface modifications such as zzso exchange, and chemical and zzso reactions for various zzso zzso zzso drug delivery and therapeutic zzso Such surface modifications help us to control the zzso zzso and pharmacological properties of zzso Furthermore, introduction of various zzso functional groups on the surface of zzso allows us to zzso a spectrum of contrast agents, zzso zzso zzso drugs and zzso and construct zzso and hybrid zzso for the targeted imaging and treatment of zzso This tutorial review is intended to provide an introduction to newcomers about how chemical and zzso reactions transform the surface of zzso such as zzso zzso gold zzso gold quantum zzso semiconductor quantum dots, carbon zzso zzso and zzso and accordingly formulate them for applications such as zzso zzso drug and gene delivery, chemotherapy, zzso therapy and zzso zzso Nonetheless, controversial reports and our growing concerns about toxicity and zzso of zzso suggest the need for not only rigorous in zzso experiments in animal models but also novel zzso for practical applications in the clinical zzso Further reading of original and review articles cited zzso is necessary to buildup in-depth knowledge about the chemistry, zzso chemistry and biological applications of individual zzso
