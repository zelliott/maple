zzso have been a main focus of zzso zzso delivery strategies in zzso zzso capture therapy zzso a zzso method for the treatment of cancer that is based on the nuclear reaction between zzso atoms and low-energy zzso zzso Three novel zzso cholesterol derivatives were prepared as zzso zzso components for the construction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso A major structural feature of these novel zzso cholesterol mimics is the replacement of the B and the C ring of cholesterol with a zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that all three zzso compounds have structural features and zzso properties that are very similar to those of zzso One of the zzso zzso cholesterol mimics was zzso incorporated into zzso folate zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso No major differences were found in appearance, size distribution, and zzso between conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of this zzso cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso were taken up extensively in zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso and the zzso was effectively blocked in the presence of free zzso In contrast, a zzso cholesterol mimic incorporated into zzso zzso showed significantly lower cellular zzso There was no apparent in zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso cells when these were incubated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, although the former accumulated extensively in zzso cells and the latter effectively zzso with zzso by causing zzso and protecting zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso zzso
