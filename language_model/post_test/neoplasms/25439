We develop the application of age, period and cohort models to the representation of tables of zzso and zzso zzso A derivation is given by way of a familiar zzso zzso The zzso problem is discussed, identification techniques are reviewed and a new approach is recommended that is based upon the success of the three zzso zzso Other constraints are introduced that enhance zzso Examples are given for two sites of zzso This approach is contrasted with other methods designed to demonstrate zzso Finally, standard errors of the parameters and tests of goodness of fit are zzso
