We report the development of a severe zzso in 4 of 38 patients who were receiving zzso zzso therapy for the treatment of various underlying zzso In 2 of these patients, the zzso progressed to generalized zzso paralysis with zzso and respiratory involvement, requiring zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and nerve zzso studies showed evidence of zzso block, suggestive of a zzso zzso After several weeks, both patients improved zzso The other 2 patients developed a zzso zzso with zzso zzso of the limbs but without zzso or respiratory zzso No immediate response to zzso was zzso All 4 patients demonstrated an elevated zzso protein in the acute phase of their zzso which declined or returned to normal during zzso The development of zzso correlated with the maximum plasma zzso level, with an estimated zzso risk of developing zzso in those patients whose maximum level was 350 zzso or zzso No correlation could be made with the total dose of zzso administered or with the duration of zzso Two of these 4 patients zzso tumor shrinkage while receiving zzso zzso We conclude that zzso a promising zzso agent, is capable of inducing a severe zzso zzso which appears to be related to the plasma concentration of zzso zzso measurement of the plasma concentration during zzso therapy is zzso
