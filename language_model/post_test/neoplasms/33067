The human aurora family of zzso zzso comprises three members, which act in concert with many other proteins to control zzso assembly and segregation during zzso Aurora dysfunction can cause zzso zzso arrest, and cell zzso Aurora zzso are strongly expressed in a broad range of cancer zzso Aurora A expression in tumors is often associated with gene amplification, genetic instability, poor zzso zzso and poor zzso Aurora B is frequently expressed at high levels in a variety of tumors, often zzso with aurora A, and expression level has also been associated with increased genetic instability and clinical zzso Further, aurora zzso gene zzso are associated with increased risk or early onset of zzso The expression of aurora C in cancer is less well zzso In recent years, several zzso aurora zzso zzso have been developed that exhibit zzso activity against a wide range of solid zzso zzso clinical data from phase I trials have largely been consistent with zzso effects, with disease stabilization as the best response achieved in solid zzso zzso responses have been noted in leukemia patients, although this might conceivably be due to zzso of the zzso zzso Current challenges include the zzso of drug administration, the identification of potential zzso of tumor sensitivity, and combination studies with zzso zzso Here, we zzso the most recent zzso and clinical data and discuss new directions in the development of aurora zzso zzso as zzso zzso
