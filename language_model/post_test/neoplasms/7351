Recent conceptual and zzso advances have the potential for providing new avenues of investigation for the study of human disease at the cellular and molecular zzso zzso zzso by virtue of their training in the recognition of different disease states at various points in their evolution, are in a unique position to lead research efforts utilizing human zzso as a major investigative zzso Many zzso obtained in the surgical pathology laboratory are available for direct experimental studies without jeopardizing their zzso for routine diagnostic zzso Moreover, experimental data derived from their study may lead to more accurate and meaningful zzso Advances in tissue culture methodology and zzso zzso for example, have now made possible the study of mechanisms of zzso and variations in responses to different zzso directly in human zzso Analysis of the effects of the physical and chemical zzso on the expression of various zzso characteristics may be performed directly in cultures of normal and zzso zzso The application of zzso zzso will have a major impact in many areas of diagnostic and investigative zzso These methods, which exploit the exquisite sensitivity of zzso as diagnostic zzso for the zzso of a variety of zzso permit the pathologist to extent and expand zzso observations to include a variety of zzso zzso Potential applications include the characterization of the entire spectrum of zzso events preceding the development of overt zzso analysis of fully developed zzso with regard to the emergence of tumor zzso and evaluation of new tumor marker zzso zzso these zzso may be expected to aid in early diagnosis, determination of zzso and prediction of response to various forms of zzso A major challenge for the future depends on the appreciation of the unique importance of human zzso for biomedical research and on the development and expansion of the traditional role of the surgical pathologist in this zzso
