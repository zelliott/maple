The natural plant product zzso was isolated in 1959 from the Australian evergreen tree of the zzso zzso This compound was found to be an extremely promising zzso zzso The zzso zzso structure was found to interact with DNA through zzso exhibiting a high DNA binding affinity zzso zzso The presence of zzso ring zzso distinguished zzso from other simple zzso Both zzso and zzso species were found to be present under zzso zzso The positive charge stabilized the binding of zzso to zzso zzso while the more zzso zzso compound was shown to readily penetrate membrane zzso The structural nature of these compounds offers a plausible basis for the implication of multiple modes of action, including DNA zzso interactions with membrane zzso zzso zzso and modification of zzso zzso most notably that of zzso II and zzso zzso a number of toxic side effects have been shown to be problematic, but the zzso of zzso towards systematic structural modification has permitted the extensive application of rational drug zzso A number of successful zzso zzso have been designed and zzso with improved zzso and zzso zzso More recently the synthetic focus has broadened to include the design of hybrid compounds, as well as drug delivery zzso zzso research efforts have been directed towards gaining a greater understanding of the mechanism of action of these drugs that will aid further in the zzso of drug zzso
