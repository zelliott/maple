Recent investigations have demonstrated the ability of zzso to metabolize zzso or zzso into their zzso zzso As a possible explanation for the association between inflammation and cancer, we and others have hypothesized that local zzso of zzso could take up nearby zzso metabolize them, and release zzso agents that may cause damage in the surrounding zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso protocol with zzso we have tested this zzso We have shown that total human peripheral blood zzso cultured in the presence of zzso for 18 zzso can metabolize zzso into agents zzso to zzso zzso strain zzso Furthermore, experiments in which zzso zzso were separated from zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso to a much greater extent than the zzso
