Cancer is responsible for millions of immature deaths every year and is an economical burden on developing zzso One of the major challenges in the present era is to design drugs that can specifically target tumor cells not normal zzso In this context, tumor zzso peptides have drawn much zzso These peptides are playing a vital role in delivering drugs in tumor zzso with high zzso In order to provide service to scientific community, we have developed a database of tumor zzso peptides called zzso 

zzso is a manually curated database of zzso validated tumor zzso peptides that specifically recognize tumor cells and tumor associated zzso zzso zzso These peptides were collected and compiled from published papers, patents and zzso Current release of zzso contains zzso zzso Each entry provides comprehensive information of a zzso that includes its zzso target zzso target cell, techniques of zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we have derived various types of information from these zzso sequences that include zzso structure, zzso acid zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso in this database have been found to target different types of tumors that include breast, zzso zzso melanoma, zzso zzso These peptides have some common motifs including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which specifically recognize tumor zzso zzso zzso has been integrated with many zzso tools like zzso search, database browsing and zzso zzso These tools allow a user to search tumor zzso peptides based on their zzso acid zzso charge, zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a unique database of its kind, which provides comprehensive information about zzso validated tumor zzso peptides and their target zzso This database will be very useful in designing zzso drugs and zzso zzso It is freely available at zzso
