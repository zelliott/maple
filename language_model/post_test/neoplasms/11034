Since zzso has been recognized as a relevant factor distinguishing cancer cells from normal cells, it has become a very promising target for zzso zzso A correlation between short zzso length and increased mortality was revealed in many zzso The zzso zzso appears to be one of the most crucial factors to study to improve cancer therapy and zzso However, this zzso zzso complex can be regulated at various zzso Thus, several strategies have been proposed to control zzso in cancer cells such as zzso technology against zzso and zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso vitamin D, zzso acid, zzso stabilizers, zzso and zzso targeting agents, zzso of interaction with other proteins involved in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso However, the zzso control of key zzso zzso seems to play the crucial role in whole complexes activity and cancer cells zzso Thus, the research of zzso regulation can bring significant insight into the knowledge concerning stem cells metabolism but also zzso This review summarizes the current state of knowledge of numerous zzso regulation mechanisms at the zzso level in human that might become attractive zzso therapy zzso
