To obtain further information about the risks of cancer associated with occupational exposure to zzso oxide 

Follow up was extended by 13 years for a cohort of zzso men and women with zzso or potential exposure to zzso oxide in the chemical industry or in hospital zzso zzso zzso were traced through National Health Service and social security records, and their mortality was compared with that expected from rates in the national population by the zzso zzso 

Analysis was based on zzso deaths, of which 339 had occurred during the additional period of follow zzso zzso was close to or below expectation for all causes zzso deaths v zzso zzso all zzso zzso v zzso and for all specific categories of zzso including stomach cancer (10 v zzso breast cancer (11 v zzso zzso zzso (7 v zzso and zzso (5 v zzso All five deaths from zzso occurred in the subset of subjects with greatest potential for exposure to zzso oxide, but even in this group the excess of deaths was small zzso zzso 

The balance of evidence from this and other zzso investigations indicates that any risk of human cancer from zzso oxide is low, particularly at the levels of occupational exposure that have occurred in Britain over recent zzso This may reflect the capacity of human cells to repair DNA damage caused by the chemical, which is a potent zzso and animal zzso
