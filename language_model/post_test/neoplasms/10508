Combination chemotherapy involving zzso is a standard treatment for many zzso However, following an initial positive response, patients will often zzso presenting with zzso zzso One possible mechanism for the acquired resistance to zzso is an increase in DNA repair through the zzso of zzso an essential component of the zzso zzso repair zzso zzso of zzso to the site of DNA damage is coordinated through its interaction with a protein known as zzso As there are currently no effective zzso of this interaction, zzso of the zzso interaction may provide an effective strategy for overcoming the development of zzso zzso To discover small zzso zzso of this interaction, we have screened both the zzso diversity set of zzso and zzso molecules against the zzso binding site in zzso These compounds were screened using two different techniques in zzso to account for zzso zzso First, using a set of flexible zzso as determined from MD simulations of the zzso complex and second, using the relaxed complex scheme implemented by performing independent zzso experiments against an ensemble of target zzso that were generated from MD zzso zzso energy poses from the two different methods were then used to construct a zzso model, which was then validated by comparison to zzso a weak inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso
