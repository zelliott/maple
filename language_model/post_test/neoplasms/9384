To review the risks and benefits of zzso zzso and to make a clinical recommendation for an appropriate age when benefits of this procedure outweigh the zzso 

The risks and benefits of zzso as detailed in published articles are reviewed with regard to zzso issues and mortality outcomes in zzso versus zzso women from five diseases linked to zzso hormones zzso heart disease, zzso cancer, breast cancer, stroke, and hip zzso 

Numerous reports link zzso to higher rates of cardiovascular disease, zzso hip fractures, zzso short-term memory zzso decline in sexual function, decreased positive psychological well-being, adverse skin and body composition changes, and adverse zzso changes, as well as more severe hot zzso and zzso zzso The potential benefits associated with zzso include prevention of zzso cancer, a decline in breast cancer risk, and a reduced risk of pelvic pain and subsequent zzso zzso In our study of long-term mortality after zzso using zzso zzso preservation of zzso until women are at least aged 65 years was associated with higher survival zzso For women between ages 50 and 54 with zzso and zzso preservation, the probability of surviving to age 80 was zzso versus zzso if zzso was zzso This zzso difference in survival is primarily due to fewer women dying from cardiovascular heart disease and/or hip zzso This survival advantage far outweighs the zzso increased mortality rate from zzso cancer prevented by zzso If surgery occurred between ages 55 and 59, the survival advantage was zzso After age 64 there were no significant differences in survival zzso Prior literature supports our conclusion of a benefit over risk for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is associated with zzso long-term health consequences that merit serious zzso For women with an average risk of zzso cancer, zzso conservation until at least age 65 seems to benefit long-term zzso
