It has been reported that zzso expressed zzso zzso in tumor cells suppresses tumor progression through enhanced zzso immunity in immune competent mice or promote tumor progression through an increase in inflammatory zzso in zzso zzso The role of zzso zzso in tumor immunity remains zzso Here we showed that tumor growth and lung zzso were enhanced in zzso mice, associated with decreased zzso natural killer cells and tumor specific zzso T cells in the tumor draining zzso zzso and zzso Together with the published data showing that in zzso transforming growth zzso and zzso zzso cells induce tumor regression, our work supports the notion that zzso zzso zzso zzso cells may play a protective role in tumor zzso
