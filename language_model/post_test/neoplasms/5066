Studies of the zzso effects of zzso and radiation therapy on treatment of cancer show a strong evidence of a synergistic enhancement when both radiation and zzso zzso are applied zzso zzso of tissue heating approaches developed up to date still fail to overcome such essential limitations as an inadequate temperature control, temperature zzso and prolonged time delay between zzso and radiation zzso The authors propose a new zzso zzso seed, which serves as a source of both radiation and heat for concurrent administration of zzso and zzso 

The proposed seed is based on the BEST Medical, zzso zzso Model zzso where zzso marker core and the air gap are replaced with a zzso zzso The zzso core produces heat when subjected to alternating electromagnetic zzso field and effectively shuts off after reaching the zzso temperature zzso of the zzso material thus realizing the temperature zzso The authors present a zzso Carlo study of the dose rate constant and other zzso factors for the proposed zzso For the zzso zzso the authors studied a model consisting of 16 seeds placed in the central region of a zzso water phantom using a zzso partial differential equation solver package zzso zzso 

The modification of the internal structure of the seed slightly changes dose rate and other zzso factors characterizing radiation zzso The zzso modeling results show that the temperature of the zzso surface rises rapidly and stays constant around zzso of the zzso zzso The amount of heat produced by the zzso core is sufficient to raise the temperature of the surrounding phantom to the therapeutic zzso The phantom volume reaching the therapeutic temperature range increases with increase in frequency or magnetic field zzso 

An zzso distribution matching with the radiation zzso distribution can be achieved within a target volume by tuning frequency and intensity of the alternating magnetic zzso The proposed combination seed model has a potential for zzso of concurrent zzso and zzso
