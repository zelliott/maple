Most data on zzso risk in the rubber industry are based on data from Western zzso This study assessed cancer risks in a retrospective cohort in a Polish tire manufacturing plant, relying on zzso exposure to zzso zzso and aromatic zzso instead of job titles or external zzso 

zzso exposure for all zzso was assigned to cohort members based on estimates from a zzso zzso Cancer risks associated with cumulative exposure adjusted for zzso gender and year of birth were zzso 

Exposure levels were higher for women than for zzso zzso zzso exposure was significantly associated with increased urinary zzso cancer risk zzso depending on exposure level, and prostate cancer at low levels only zzso In women, increased risks were found for all zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso at low level only, while an zzso association with breast cancer risk was zzso zzso zzso exposure was associated with zzso of the liver and zzso zzso ducts in a zzso manner, while zzso reduced risks were found for respiratory zzso (most notably the zzso and cancer of the zzso 

Increased risks for specific cancer sites in this rubber plant were similar to Western Europe and the zzso However, several cancer risks were zzso which could relate to higher exposure levels in women or to differences in zzso to chemicals not assessed in this zzso
