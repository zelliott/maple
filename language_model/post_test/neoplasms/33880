The objective of the study was to enhance the clinical interpretation and practicality of the widely used comprehensive zzso Impact zzso 

zzso Response zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was used to zzso the severity of the zzso items, to assess item bias and to construct equally severe short forms of the zzso that can be used zzso The scores of zzso subjects were zzso 

Of the zzso zzso items, 82 items fitted the extended zzso model, zzso the observed proportions of sickness level groups endorsing the items corresponded to the proportions expected by the zzso The item severity hierarchy allowed a more straightforward interpretation of the zzso zzso zzso Some items showed bias in age, zzso or diagnosis zzso The equivalent short forms agreed sufficiently well with the zzso zzso item pool to be used zzso We observed a moderate correlation between the original zzso item severity weights and the zzso item severity zzso zzso 

The zzso and practicality of the zzso was enhanced by the zzso zzso Using the item zzso short forms can be assembled that can be used zzso
