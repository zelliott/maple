A comprehensive understanding of cancer progression may shed light on genetic and molecular mechanisms of zzso and provide important information for effective diagnosis and zzso We propose a zzso zzso model to identify genes that show significant correlations across multiple cancer zzso We have applied the approach on a zzso Cancer zzso progression data and obtained a set of genes that show consistent trends across multiple zzso Further analysis based on multiple zzso demonstrates that our candidate list includes not only some well-known zzso zzso but also novel genes that have been confirmed very zzso
