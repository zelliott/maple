It was once considered that the T cell response is an all or nothing type event, but recent studies have clearly indicated that T cells show many different types of zzso in recognition of altered zzso for T cell receptors zzso In this review, we zzso our recent findings on the response of human zzso helper T zzso cell clones to altered zzso zzso zzso peptides carrying single or multiple zzso zzso in zzso zzso The extensive analyses revealed that zzso and partial zzso are frequently observed by the stimulation with zzso zzso at particular zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso We observed unique partially zzso zzso inducing zzso of T cell survival without cell zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced proliferation and production of zzso in zzso cell clones zzso to zzso zzso The other zzso induced enhanced production of zzso by zzso presenting cells and subsequent enhancement of zzso production by T cells zzso to zzso By utilizing an zzso T cell zzso library generated by zzso zzso chain zzso it was revealed that human zzso cell clones recognize a more diverse array of peptides with multiple and simultaneous zzso acid zzso in an zzso zzso zzso also induced altered zzso signaling events including zzso calcium increase and zzso of signaling zzso This information provides basic knowledge regarding the characteristics of zzso recognition by human zzso cells and the subsequent zzso and a novel method for manipulation of human zzso cell responses by zzso as a possible candidate for zzso zzso or zzso zzso
