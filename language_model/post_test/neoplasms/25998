To increase the zzso stability and therapeutic potential of zzso zzso we designed a novel zzso zzso that is zzso and zzso It was constructed by linking four zzso variable zzso zzso zzso with zzso for human zzso zzso cell zzso or zzso (B cell zzso into a single chain zzso After expression in zzso coli, zzso folded zzso zzso zzso with a mass of 57 zzso zzso chain zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a molecular mass of 114 zzso zzso zzso could be isolated from the soluble zzso zzso The relative amount of tandem zzso proved to be dependent on the length of the zzso in the middle of the chain and bacterial growth zzso Compared to a previously constructed zzso zzso zzso the tandem zzso exhibited a higher apparent affinity and slower zzso from both zzso zzso They were also more effective than zzso in inducing T cell proliferation in the presence of tumor cells and in inducing the zzso of zzso in the presence of activated human zzso zzso in human serum at 37 degrees C, the tandem zzso retained 90 % of its zzso binding activity after 24 hours and 40 % after one zzso In zzso experiments indicated a higher stability and longer blood retention of tandem zzso compared to single chain zzso fragments and zzso properties that are particularly important for potential clinical zzso
