In order to find the conditions under which zzso zzso and zzso zzso may become zzso agents, leaving healthy zzso free from the zzso zzso the solution chemistry of these zzso was studied by paper zzso and paper zzso in distilled water, in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso acid zzso Both zzso are zzso in the zzso solution but get easily zzso to form zzso zzso species which concentrates in healthy bone and in some bone zzso zzso zzso being more stable remains long in the blood pool giving zzso presence of the zzso in zzso heart and zzso in addition to its reduced zzso in bone zzso and in some zzso We are trying to eliminate these drawbacks of healthy organ zzso of zzso not only to get a clean zzso image of the zzso with this zzso but to extend its zzso thus zzso to prepare zzso with zzso which is the higher zzso of zzso for systemic therapy of zzso Essentially similar solution chemistry of both zzso suggests that like zzso zzso is also a complex of zzso zzso and not of zzso zzso as so far supposed to zzso
