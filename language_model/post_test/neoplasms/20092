zzso is a zzso zzso with a zzso atomic layer of zzso bonded carbon atoms in zzso zzso together with zzso zzso with carbon atoms linked to oxygen functional zzso The zzso of zzso resides essentially in its own intrinsic chemical and physical structure, which zzso an extraordinary chemical versatility, high aspect ratio and unusual physical zzso The chemical versatility of zzso arises from the oxygen functional groups on the carbon structure that make possible its relatively easy zzso under mild conditions, with organic molecules or biological structures in zzso or zzso zzso The synergistic effects resulting from the assembly of zzso structures at zzso surface, in addition to its intrinsic zzso mechanical and electronic properties, allow the development of new zzso hybrid materials with a high potential in zzso cancer zzso zzso a comprehensive review of the fundamental properties of zzso requirements for cancer therapy and the first developments of zzso as a platform for this purpose is zzso
