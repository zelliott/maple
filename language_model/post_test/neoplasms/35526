Several decades back zzso acid was proposed as an effective zzso zzso However, this idea remained controversial and the mechanism of action zzso In this paper, we show that zzso acid at a concentration reported to be achievable through high doses of oral consumption is capable of zzso action against normal zzso Several antioxidants of both animal as well as plant origin including zzso acid also possess zzso zzso zzso is an essential component of zzso and can take part in zzso zzso Previously we have proposed a mechanism for the zzso action of plant antioxidants against cancer cells that involves zzso of zzso copper zzso and the zzso generation of zzso oxygen zzso Using human peripheral zzso and zzso zzso we show here that zzso acid is able to cause zzso DNA breakage in normal cells at a concentration of zzso zzso zzso a zzso specific zzso agent inhibited DNA breakage in a dose dependent manner indicating that zzso is an intermediate in the DNA zzso zzso The results are in support of our above hypothesis that involves events that lead to a zzso action by zzso The results would support the idea that even a plasma concentration of around 200 zzso would be sufficient to cause pharmacological tumor cell death particularly when copper levels are zzso This would account for the observation of several decades back by zzso and co-workers where oral doses of zzso acid in gram quantities were found to be effective in treating some zzso
