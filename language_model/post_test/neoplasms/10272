We report a zzso gold zzso that is designed to zzso in mild zzso zzso environments by its zzso zzso zzso zzso With a relatively small size of 10 zzso the zzso gold zzso can be efficiently zzso into zzso zzso zzso by pH change, the zzso surfaces are engineered to have both positive and negative zzso zzso attractions between the zzso can rapidly form zzso inside the cells, and the zzso accumulate as the zzso is blocked by the increased zzso zzso of gold zzso and the zzso are monitored real-time by dark field optical zzso The zzso formation of zzso shifts the zzso to zzso and zzso The zzso shift to longer wavelength is used for zzso cancer therapy as it guarantees zzso tissue penetration for potential therapeutic zzso The gold zzso show selective and efficient destruction of zzso cells with an intensity threshold of 5 zzso to induce the zzso zzso In the intensity range zzso zzso the circular area of damaged cells increases zzso with the zzso power zzso This shows a new zzso for zzso cancer therapy that exploits collective zzso modes of metal zzso
