zzso zzso play a crucial role in zzso and development through their effects on target zzso The characterization of zzso interactions will lead to a better understanding of cancer zzso Many zzso methods have been developed to zzso zzso targets zzso expression zzso Because expression zzso are in general limited in size, most existing methods zzso zzso from multiple studies to form one zzso zzso to increase sample size and zzso However, such simple zzso analysis results in identifying zzso interactions that are mostly common across zzso whereas specific interactions may be missed by these zzso Recent releases of The Cancer Genome zzso data provide paired expression profiling of zzso and genes in multiple tumors with sufficiently large sample zzso To study both common and zzso zzso it is desirable to develop a method that can jointly analyze multiple zzso to study zzso interactions without combining all the data into one single zzso 

We developed a novel statistical method to jointly analyze expression profiles from multiple zzso to identify zzso interactions that are both common across zzso and specific to certain zzso The benefit of this joint analysis approach is demonstrated by both simulation studies and real data analysis of The Cancer Genome zzso zzso Compared with simple zzso analysis or single sample analysis, our method can effectively use the shared information among different but related zzso to improve the identification of zzso zzso Another useful property of our method is that it can estimate similarity among zzso through their shared zzso zzso 

The program, zzso implemented in R is available at zzso
