zzso zzso zzso such as tandem zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso or single chain zzso zzso have shown to be able to zzso T zzso to tumor cells, leading to their zzso However, therapeutic efficacy is hampered by a short serum zzso of these small molecules having zzso masses of zzso zzso Thus, improvement of the zzso properties of small zzso zzso formats is required to enhance efficacy in zzso In this study, we generated several zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins and analyzed these molecules for biological activity and zzso zzso Three zzso zzso formats were produced by fusing two different zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso respectively, to human serum zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso directed against the tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso and the T cell zzso complex zzso zzso retained full binding capacity to both zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of T cells as monitored by zzso release was observed for zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent for zzso T cell zzso could be further enhanced by a target zzso zzso signal provided by a zzso fusion zzso Furthermore, we could demonstrate that fusion to serum zzso strongly increases circulation time of zzso zzso zzso In addition, our comparative study indicates that single chain zzso fusion proteins seem to be the most promising format for further studying zzso activities in zzso and in zzso
