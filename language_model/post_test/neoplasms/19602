A new fluorescent analog of D zzso was recently developed by zzso K, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso M, Ki zzso O, zzso Y, zzso H zzso A novel fluorescent zzso of zzso zzso to the assessment of zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and shown to be transported into normal zzso The purpose of this preliminary study was to assess the use of this fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso as a sensitive probe for monitoring zzso zzso into zzso tumor zzso 

zzso breast cancer zzso cells were grown and zzso on zzso for analysis of zzso zzso via zzso imaging zzso 

zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso displayed rapid zzso for the first one to five minutes, then slowed, reaching an apparent maximum zzso near zzso zzso zzso of 5 zzso D zzso to the media markedly reduced zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso was slow, averaging less than zzso of that observed for zzso cells, the zzso breast cancer cells and the zzso liver cancer cell zzso 

The preliminary data clearly demonstrate a rapid zzso of zzso into tumor cells that can be monitored by zzso imaging zzso The zzso displays zzso and competition with D zzso all properties expected for zzso zzso and retention in cancer zzso Additional studies, including comparisons among other zzso cell lines and control cells, will be needed to fully characterize the kinetic properties of zzso zzso and the potential use of this zzso analog as a probe for zzso zzso in zzso zzso
