zzso processes are implicated in the development and progression of zzso However, it is not clear whether systemic markers of inflammation predict zzso We examined the prospective relationship between circulating white blood cell zzso count and cancer zzso 

zzso cohort study of zzso individuals, aged 49 to 84 years and free of cancer at the baseline examination (January 1, 1992, to December 31, zzso in the Blue Mountains region, west of Sydney, zzso The main outcome of interest was all cancer mortality zzso from vital status as of December 31, zzso 

Higher zzso count was found to be associated with all cancer zzso In zzso hazards models adjusting for age, sex, education, body mass index, zzso level, alcohol consumption, physical zzso smoking, weekly aspirin use, diabetes zzso or zzso zzso status, and zzso zzso levels, the multivariable relative risk of all cancer mortality comparing zzso 4 of zzso count ( zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso 1 zzso or zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso the relative risk of cancer mortality comparing zzso 4 of zzso count with zzso 1 was higher among those with diabetes or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than among those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Also, the relative risk of cancer mortality associated with joint exposure to zzso 4 of zzso count and aspirin zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with their zzso 

These data provide new zzso evidence of an association between circulating zzso count, a widely available marker of zzso and subsequent cancer zzso
