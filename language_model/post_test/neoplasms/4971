In the present study attempt has been made to enhance the selective tumor cell killing in mouse zzso model using zzso as a zzso carrier and zzso zzso as a zzso to target tumor zzso 

zzso modified zzso zzso were prepared by zzso zzso zzso loaded zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso Developed systems were characterized for size and size distribution, zzso efficiency, and in zzso drug zzso Fluorescence zzso and flow zzso were performed to evaluate cellular zzso of the zzso zzso activity was determined using zzso zzso In zzso therapeutic efficacy was determined in zzso mouse zzso 

zzso studies demonstrated that zzso result in higher zzso intensity to the cancer cells as compared to plain zzso zzso exhibited better zzso activity in zzso as compared to plain zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso study revealed that zzso concentration in the tumor was much higher in the case of zzso as compared to plain zzso and zzso zzso however in other zzso it was much lower than the latter two zzso zzso exhibited significant zzso activity in the mouse zzso zzso 

The finding demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso can effectively be delivered to the tumor in zzso and exhibit significant zzso zzso
