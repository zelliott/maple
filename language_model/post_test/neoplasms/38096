An expanding understanding of the importance of zzso in zzso and the development of numerous zzso zzso are driving the search for zzso of zzso We review currently available candidate zzso and surrogate markers of zzso agent zzso 

A number of zzso minimally zzso and zzso tools are described with their potential benefits and zzso zzso markers can evaluate tumor tissue or biological zzso or specialized imaging zzso 

The inclusion of these markers into clinical trials may provide insight into appropriate dosing for desired biological effects, appropriate timing of additional therapy, prediction of individual response to an agent, insight into the interaction of chemotherapy and radiation following exposure to these agents, and perhaps most importantly, a better understanding of the complex nature of zzso in human zzso While many markers have potential for clinical use, it is not yet clear which marker or combination of markers will prove most zzso
