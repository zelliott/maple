The zzso zzso zzso are a family of plasma zzso zzso assembled from a light chain - zzso zzso by zzso - and five zzso heavy chains zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contributing to zzso zzso stability by zzso linkage to zzso So far, zzso molecules have been shown to play a particularly important role in inflammation and zzso 

We systematically investigated differential gene expression of the zzso gene family, as well as zzso and the interacting partner zzso in 13 different human tumor entities (of breast, zzso zzso zzso stomach, small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso dot zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

We found that zzso genes are clearly zzso in multiple human solid tumors, including breast, colon and lung zzso Thus, zzso genes may represent a family of putative tumor zzso genes that should be analyzed in greater detail in the zzso For an initial detailed analysis we chose zzso expression in human breast zzso Loss of zzso expression in zzso of cases zzso zzso 50, zzso could be confirmed by real-time zzso in an additional set of breast zzso zzso zzso zzso Next we studied zzso expression on the protein level by analyzing a comprehensive tissue zzso array including 185 invasive breast cancer zzso We found a strong correlation zzso zzso zzso between zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso expression indicating that zzso may be involved in the regulation of this zzso zzso 

Altogether, this is the first systematic analysis on the differential expression of zzso genes in human cancer, showing frequent zzso that may be associated with initiation and/or progression of these zzso
