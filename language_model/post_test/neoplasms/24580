Patients with newly diagnosed cancer may request an estimate of their prospects for long-term zzso Unfortunately, standard estimates of survival may be zzso because they do not reflect recent zzso The authors present a projection method that incorporates trends in survival and provides more up-to-date estimates of long-term survival for newly diagnosed zzso 

The projection method fits a zzso model to zzso relative survival and includes a zzso associated with a trend on diagnosis zzso The cumulative relative survival rate zzso in a target year is calculated by zzso the projected zzso survival rates for that zzso To investigate the zzso ability of the projection approach and to develop zzso rules, data from the zzso zzso and End zzso Program and the Connecticut tumor registry were used to recreate data that were available at a particular time in the past, and those data were used to project survival for specified target zzso 

The projection method was better at predicting the survival of recently diagnosed patients than current methods, especially long-term survival for patients who had disease sites with an increasing and stable trend in zzso The authors predicted that the 15-year zzso for patients who were diagnosed in 2003 will be zzso for all cancer sites combined, 57% for zzso cancer, zzso for female breast cancer, zzso for zzso cancer, and zzso for prostate zzso 

Although the projection method was more speculative than other methods that are aligned more closely with current observed data, it offered the possibility of providing improved estimates of long-term survival for recently diagnosed zzso zzso should be used when applying these methods for cancer sites where there has been a dramatic zzso of zzso zzso prostate cancer, for which the projected results may be overly zzso
