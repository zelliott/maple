In zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso using zzso zzso zzso the zzso are the major zzso zzso because of zzso zzso and retention of zzso Preventing zzso zzso or toxicity will allow for higher zzso radiation zzso We tested the zzso drug zzso which selectively protects healthy tissue during zzso and zzso for its zzso capacities after zzso with high-dose zzso 

Male Lewis rats were injected with zzso or 555 zzso zzso to create zzso damage and were followed up for 130 zzso For zzso rats received either zzso or zzso with zzso zzso blood and urine were collected for toxicity zzso At 130 days after zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scan was performed to zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso a measure of zzso zzso 

Treatment with 555 zzso zzso resulted in body weight loss, elevated zzso and zzso zzso and zzso treatment significantly prevented this rise in zzso and the level of zzso but did not improve the zzso zzso In contrast, after zzso zzso zzso zzso values were slightly, but not significantly, elevated compared with the control zzso zzso and zzso damage were different from controls and were significantly improved by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso at 130 days after zzso therapy correlated well with zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso effectively decreased functional zzso damage caused by high-dose zzso Besides zzso zzso might be used in clinical zzso as well as to zzso zzso zzso
