Deaths from cancer in Denmark from zzso were extracted from the Danish National Death Register at the Danish Institute for Clinical zzso This paper illustrates the relationship between demographic factors and mortality from a large group of zzso which increases progressively from young adult life into old zzso zzso zzso mortality rates between 30 and 79 years of age were zzso for 14 different cancer sites among both males and zzso in five zzso birth zzso and for the capital and zzso The number of deaths at a particular age were found to follow a zzso distribution and the mortality rate could be expressed by the function zzso zzso zzso where zzso is the mortality rate at age zzso and b and k are parameters to be zzso With this model a straight line is zzso when mortality and age are plotted on a double zzso zzso The maximum likelihood estimates of b and k were found zzso for each of the 280 combinations of zzso zzso For fixed sex and cancer site the relationship between age, residence and cohort was zzso It appeared that k was independent of zzso For 10 of the male zzso and 12 of the female zzso k was found to be independent of cohort and in the last 6 cases k was found to be a linear function of zzso For 12 out of 14 cancer sites among males the ratio of mortality in the capital to mortality in the provinces was significantly greater than zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
