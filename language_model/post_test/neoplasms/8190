Higher zzso zzso contain both zzso genes and genes of which the expression is restricted to a defined time and zzso It is well established that a correlation exists between structural organization of the zzso and gene expression zzso The functional mechanisms underlying this correlation are still poorly zzso Here I describe several observations that are the basis of present concepts of zzso organization and nuclear architecture related to zzso Regarding the relationship between positioning and disturbed cell zzso I describe observations showing that the proximity of selected gene zzso is statistically correlated with their propensity for zzso zzso as well as observations of patterns occurring in neurodegenerative disorders where unstable repeats are translated into an expanded zzso zzso Such observations underscore the importance to understand how genetic zzso lead to the global reorganization of nuclear architecture, zzso structure and widespread changes in gene zzso
