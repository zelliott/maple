zzso functionality and muscle weakness are prominent features in cancer zzso We investigated zzso of muscle function assessed by hand grip and knee extension strength as well as functional status in cancer zzso 

189 zzso admitted cancer patients (age zzso zzso zzso years, 96 zzso were zzso Muscle function was assessed by hand grip and knee extension strength, and percentage of anticipated peak zzso flow zzso zzso status was determined by the zzso questionnaire of quality of zzso zzso status was assessed with zzso Global Assessment zzso Age, zzso zzso body mass index, clinical variables such as cancer location, presence of distant zzso zzso burden according to zzso stage, zzso stage, number of drugs per day, number of zzso type of treatment and depression were investigated as potential risk factors for muscle weakness and impaired functional status in a multiple zzso zzso 

80 patients zzso zzso were classified moderately or severely zzso zzso also emerged as an independent zzso for hand grip zzso effect size zzso p zzso zzso knee extension strength zzso effect size zzso p zzso zzso and peak zzso flow zzso effect size zzso p zzso zzso and functional status zzso effect size zzso p zzso zzso next to age and zzso which were the strongest zzso Among the disease zzso only amount of daily medication exhibited a significant influence on knee extension zzso 

zzso is a disease independent risk factor for reduced muscle strength and functional status in cancer zzso Treatment of zzso might therefore also restore muscle zzso
