Our laboratory has previously developed a bacterial cancer therapy strategy by targeting tumors using engineered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that were generated to grow in viable as well as zzso areas of tumors but not in normal zzso The mechanism by which zzso kills cancer cells is zzso In the present report, high-resolution zzso zzso was used to investigate the cellular basis of bacteria killing of cancer cells in live zzso Lewis lung cancer cells zzso were genetically labeled with red fluorescent protein zzso and injected zzso in nude zzso After tumor growth was observed, the mice were treated with zzso bacteria expressing zzso via zzso zzso Mice without zzso treatment served as zzso zzso The imaging system was zzso scan head mounted on a flexible zzso articulated zzso A zzso 80 zzso zzso zzso laser zzso zzso was used for the zzso zzso We applied this high-resolution imaging tool to zzso zzso bacteria targeting the Lewis lung cancer cells growing zzso in nude zzso The zzso images revealed that zzso cancer cells greatly expanded and burst and thereby lost zzso Similar results were seen in zzso using zzso zzso The bacteria targeted the tumor within minutes of zzso zzso Using mice in which the zzso drives zzso and in which blood vessels are labeled with zzso the bacteria could be zzso in and out of the blood zzso zzso scaffolds within the tumor were zzso by second harmonic generation zzso The zzso zzso system described here allows imaging of cancer cell killing by bacteria and can therefore be used to further understand its mechanism and zzso for clinical zzso
