Overall, five short forms showed good zzso properties at both zzso Two of these forms were very zzso Some zzso symptoms assessed on the full zzso were reported with high zzso However, few individuals reported a large number of zzso At both visits, patients identified as likely to have severe depression gave different responses from other patients on most items on the zzso 

Several short forms of the zzso may be appropriate for use in zzso zzso Patients identified as likely to have severe depression showed many of the same symptoms that zzso depression in other geriatric zzso
