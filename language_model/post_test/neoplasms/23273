A successful immune response against pathogens requires the zzso of different cell types of the immune zzso These zzso processes are difficult to study by classical zzso and genetic methods zzso In this review we describe how approaches of synthetic biology, such as rebuilding of minimal functional signaling systems and the design of new molecules acting as signaling zzso can be used to get a deeper insight into the signaling mechanism of immune zzso In particular, the interaction of receptors with zzso elements can be studied in detail with these new zzso In addition, sophisticated synthetic immune receptors are being tested in the clinic for gene therapy against certain cancer zzso
