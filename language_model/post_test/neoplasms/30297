zzso interference zzso has been proved as a novel approach for gene zzso However, zzso zzso only aims at single zzso it therefore may ultimately fail to cure zzso caused by zzso zzso To overcome the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was put forward as a new zzso By zzso the zzso of zzso triggering single or multiple targets directly and other zzso or zzso zzso zzso keeps target genes silent, prevents zzso progression and zzso zzso of tumor zzso This paper mainly reviews the major strategies of zzso and their applications in cancer gene zzso
