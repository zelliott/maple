The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso with a molecular weight of zzso highly related to the zzso derived growth zzso stimulating factor zzso zzso of the zzso gene result in impairment of zzso zzso and of the zzso cell zzso In order to zzso zzso functions in development and zzso we have analyzed zzso its expression in human normal and transformed zzso zzso The zzso has been detected in zzso zzso and unexpectedly, in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso and breast zzso While the gene product is expressed in zzso lung tumors, and melanoma of low zzso no zzso levels have been detected in zzso and breast zzso zzso and invasive zzso In breast tumors these findings were confirmed by zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso preparations from normal and transformed zzso The present results demonstrate that the zzso zzso plays a role in the development of a larger spectrum of cell zzso Furthermore, on the basis of the transformation associated changes, we speculate that, while in some cell types, zzso expression positively regulates zzso and is selected for in zzso zzso in other zzso the zzso zzso is involved in zzso and differentiation and is, therefore, zzso selected in the course of tumor zzso
