We examined the merits of zzso zzso vaccination and zzso zzso gene therapy and evaluated its zzso effects in an animal tumor zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells were transplanted into 28 mice, and 4 and 11 days after tumor challenge, zzso mice were zzso zzso with zzso or zzso vaccine and subsequently administered PBS or zzso zzso zzso groups (7 mice per zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso zzso zzso days after tumor challenge, we zzso mice in the zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso groups with zzso zzso zzso progression and zzso mice zzso were monitored by zzso We investigated zzso immune response generated by combination zzso zzso tumor growth zzso was observed in the zzso + zzso group by zzso at 32 days after tumor zzso Mice in zzso + zzso group showed complete zzso tumor suppression after tumor zzso whereas mice in the zzso + zzso group did zzso The zzso mice zzso were much higher in the zzso + zzso group than in the other three zzso zzso of zzso zzso T cells were higher in the zzso + zzso group than in the other three zzso zzso zzso cells in the zzso + zzso group were found to be most effective at generating zzso zzso T zzso The activities of zzso zzso T cells in the zzso + zzso group were higher than in the other three zzso Our data suggest that zzso + zzso combination therapy zzso generates marked zzso effects against established zzso zzso
