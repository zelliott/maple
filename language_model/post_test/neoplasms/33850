zzso is a member of the inhibitor of DNA zzso zzso family of dominant negative zzso zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the control of differentiation and zzso zzso of various cell cycle regulators and high levels of zzso expression are frequently detected in various cancer zzso However, it is unclear whether zzso is a marker of highly zzso cancer cells or whether it directly contributes to the tumor zzso A detailed analysis of zzso human cells revealed that a fraction of zzso zzso to zzso zzso expression of zzso in primary cells and tumor cell lines resulted in zzso of cells with abnormal zzso zzso There was no evidence for zzso zzso or induction of zzso abnormalities by the other ID family zzso zzso zzso may contribute to zzso not only by zzso zzso activity of basic zzso zzso factors and abrogate differentiation but also by zzso zzso zzso
