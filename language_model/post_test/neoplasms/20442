zzso zzso is an zzso that is essential for DNA synthesis and zzso It is composed of 2 zzso proteins called zzso and zzso that are both necessary for zzso activity that reduces zzso to zzso This is the zzso reaction that provides a supply of precursors for DNA synthesis therefore it is essential for cell zzso The importance of understanding the complex regulation of zzso zzso is emphasized by observations that mechanisms controlling its expression and activity may be altered during zzso cell proliferation which leads to drug resistance, making it a useful target to develop zzso compounds in the treatment of zzso zzso studies with the zzso and zzso genes have provided evidence for a direct role for the components of zzso zzso in determining zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated by zzso zzso of gene expression and zzso mechanisms that alter zzso message zzso zzso regulation of zzso turnover plays an important role in modulating zzso steady state levels and therefore directly influences gene zzso The zzso region zzso of zzso and zzso messages contain sequences that are important in regulating gene expression through changes in message zzso Studies have found that zzso message stability is zzso by growth factors, zzso and tumor zzso Several studies have zzso signal zzso pathways of tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso This report reviews how knowledge of these signaling pathways is revealing new insights into how zzso zzso zzso binding proteins are important in regulating cellular zzso drug resistance and zzso
