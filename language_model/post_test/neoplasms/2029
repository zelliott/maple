One hundred zzso patients were treated 256 times with chemotherapy supported by zzso bone zzso transplantation during the past 9 zzso The two most commonly used protocols were zzso zzso zzso + zzso 80 zzso + zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso zzso + zzso 100 zzso + zzso zzso zzso Among 115 patients in the therapeutic setting in which two courses were usually given, 75 were zzso and the overall response rate was zzso with zzso zzso zzso Breast and pediatric groups responded well; the response rate in breast cancer was zzso with zzso zzso zzso Two patients with breast cancer who had multiple distant zzso and 2 pediatric patients are now alive with zzso after 5 years of the treatment and seem to have been zzso The results in zzso settings have also been quite promising, zzso zzso zzso survival probability among breast patients mainly in stage zzso Although drops of blood cell counts to the zzso zzso zzso less than zzso could not be zzso the periods of zzso appeared to have been effectively shortened so that the patients could be safely managed with intensified general supportive zzso zzso counts are usually less affected, but the recovery is slower than for zzso zzso There were 13 patients who died within 10 weeks of the initiation of the zzso Two of them succumbed to zzso and progressive disease was the cause of death in 8 patients whose terminal zzso were undoubtedly affected by some infectious zzso We have shown that there are inverse relationships between infused numbers of zzso and zzso recovery judged by the duration of zzso and the time required for zzso to recover over zzso Our recent laboratory experiments testing zzso zzso and zzso in addition to zzso counts and zzso showed that vulnerabilities of zzso zzso seem to differ from cell lineage to cell zzso This must therefore be taken into careful consideration in pursuing zzso zzso
