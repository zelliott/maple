A principle objective in chemotherapy is the development of zzso capable of selectively destroying zzso cells while sparing normal zzso One new approach to selective zzso zzso zzso zzso uses zzso zzso coupled to zzso zzso zzso which bind to cell surface zzso on zzso zzso Selective destruction of human T leukemia cells zzso was accomplished by zzso the efficient zzso zzso zzso to an zzso cell zzso using zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso ratios of zzso retained zzso zzso MA b binding activity, and had a quantum yield for zzso oxygen production of zzso zzso zzso the same as that of free zzso zzso Cell killing was dependent on the doses of both zzso and zzso zzso light and occurred only in target cell populations which bound the zzso On the order of zzso zzso oxygen molecules were necessary to kill a zzso A second approach to specific zzso selective zzso cell zzso zzso relies on preferential zzso of certain zzso zzso by zzso cell zzso We have evaluated several classes of zzso zzso and in the case of zzso zzso and some of its zzso have demonstrated highly selective killing of human zzso cell, zzso and colon zzso cells in zzso In isolated zzso zzso zzso and zzso depended on membrane potential, and the dye specifically zzso damage to Complex I in the electron transport zzso zzso and some of its zzso accumulated within subcutaneous zzso of human tumors in nude mice with zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso caused significant zzso of tumor growth, without zzso zzso
