One possible mechanism by which zzso occurs was zzso The effect of a zzso zzso upon the rate of membrane zzso of a zzso aromatic zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso spectrum and quantum yield of BA, when zzso to zzso underwent spectral shifts upon addition of zzso zzso These spectral changes appeared to result from the transfer of BA from the zzso surface into the zzso zzso We used these spectral changes to measure the rates of membrane zzso of BA from the zzso state and from the zzso and zzso states of zzso Our studies demonstrated that zzso of BA to zzso resulted in an increased rate of zzso of BA into zzso zzso compared to the zzso rate into these zzso from zzso zzso Such zzso membrane zzso of chemical zzso may be of importance in explaining the enhanced zzso of the zzso aromatic zzso in the presence of particulate zzso
