To develop a novel zzso approach for the safe and effective therapy of zzso 

The zzso A chain zzso was expressed in zzso coli in the form of a zzso fusion protein and zzso with zzso affinity zzso A zzso zzso B chain zzso zzso green zzso protein zzso was zzso zzso and zzso were tested for zzso either individually or in combination in human cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso Cell viability was determined with zzso blue zzso or zzso zzso 

The expression and release of zzso as well as the entry of zzso into zzso cells were zzso When zzso and zzso was used individually, neither was toxic to the zzso When they were applied together, significant cell death was observed in all of the cell lines zzso The zzso effect correlated with the amount of zzso protein used, with cell mortality at about zzso at zzso zzso g zzso in combination with zzso at 100 zzso No major cell killing was seen when zzso was used in combination with a control zzso zzso The treatment of healthy zzso cells with the zzso zzso from zzso zzso cells resulted in cell death, suggesting the formation of zzso complex, and a potential zzso zzso 

The new approach was successful in zzso Further modifications of the zzso zzso as well as an in zzso study are needed to confirm its potential in cancer zzso
