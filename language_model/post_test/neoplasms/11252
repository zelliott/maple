Small interfering zzso zzso molecules are potent zzso of zzso gene zzso Using zzso zzso imaging and a mathematical model of zzso delivery and function, the effects of zzso and zzso parameters on zzso gene zzso are monitored in cells zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso protein levels recover to zzso values within zzso week in rapidly dividing cell lines, but take longer than 3 weeks to return to zzso levels in zzso zzso Similar results are observed in zzso with zzso lasting approximately 10 days in subcutaneous tumors in zzso mice and zzso weeks in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso These data indicate that dilution due to cell division, and not zzso zzso zzso zzso the duration of gene zzso under these zzso To demonstrate the practical use of the model in treatment design, model calculations are used to predict the dosing schedule required to maintain persistent zzso of target proteins with different zzso in rapidly dividing or zzso zzso The approach of zzso imaging combined with mathematical modeling provides useful insights into zzso function and may help zzso the translation of zzso into clinically relevant zzso for disease treatment and zzso
