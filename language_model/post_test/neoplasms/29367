One of the central hallmarks of cancer is the rapid and infinite cellular zzso In order to cope with increased requirement for building blocks and energy, cancer cells develop abnormal zzso zzso zzso assessment of cancer cell metabolism can provide biological information for use in both drug discovery and development of personalized cancer zzso Analysis of intact tissue using high resolution magic angle spinning zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso gives qualitative and quantitative zzso measures with minimal sample zzso zzso statistical methods are important tools for analysis of complex MR data and have in recent years been used for analysis of zzso zzso data from intact zzso zzso zzso analysis of intact tissue allows combination of zzso data with zzso or zzso data, and can therefore be used both for exploring the molecular biology of cancer and for clinical improvements in cancer zzso zzso and treatment zzso In this review, the basic concepts of zzso zzso are zzso and its use in zzso of cancer metabolism is discussed with specific focus on selected pathways such as zzso metabolism and zzso The use of zzso zzso in analysis of zzso acids and zzso metabolism in cancer is also zzso Finally, the expected role of zzso in zzso zzso in the near future is zzso
