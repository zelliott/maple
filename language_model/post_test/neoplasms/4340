The zzso gene encodes three overlapping proteins which all contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins are zzso expressed and are downstream targets and zzso of activated zzso zzso zzso We investigated zzso of zzso proteins in normal and transformed zzso In tumor cells with known zzso gene zzso zzso proteins were zzso zzso and zzso with the activated zzso No zzso zzso zzso was found in primary cell cultures and normal zzso In 14 of 27 tumor cell lines with no reported zzso zzso zzso proteins were zzso zzso and formed stable complexes with novel zzso zzso Ten distinct zzso zzso were identified with molecular weights ranging from 30 to 200 zzso In a subset of zzso cell lines, zzso zzso proteins zzso with a zzso zzso that was identified as the zzso activated zzso In one zzso cell line, a zzso zzso was identified as the activated zzso In 13 of 14 acute leukemia samples zzso zzso proteins were zzso zzso with a zzso zzso Some of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Met, zzso zzso bound both the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso others zzso zzso only the zzso domain and yet others zzso only the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso proteins are common zzso of zzso activated zzso and that the analysis of zzso zzso allow the identification of tumors with zzso zzso zzso
