An original method of automatic zzso of dual zzso by ozone was made use of to show the functional role of zzso zzso zzso and cholesterol, in the transfer, within the zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso of saturated and essential zzso acids by zzso The values of correlations dual zzso and dual zzso are indicative of that the saturated fat acids are zzso by zzso in blood serum, and the essential zzso fat acids are zzso by zzso The presence of dual zzso in lipids of some zzso shows that zzso of a very low density are carriers of saturated fat acids (in the form of zzso zzso and zzso of low density are the key carrier of essential zzso fat acids (in the form of zzso zzso of zzso The cells absorb passively the fat acids (in the form of polar zzso and they absorb actively the fat acids (in the form of zzso lipids and by means of zzso zzso A stable correlation dual zzso at zzso of the alcohol content in the blood serum by 20 times, and similar correlation values in man, rats and mice demonstrate that the cells zzso be means of zzso zzso the essential zzso fat acids (in the form of zzso of zzso The level of cholesterol depends on a content of fat zzso mainly of the omega-3 and zzso essential zzso fat zzso in the blood zzso
