Increased expression of the zzso zzso is strongly associated with poor outcome for many different zzso Depending on the cancer type, zzso is expressed by either the cancer cells themselves or by zzso cells surrounding the zzso zzso plays diverse roles in cell zzso zzso migration and zzso all features of invasion and zzso These wide ranging functions have been attributed to the central zzso region of zzso and to the zzso and zzso terminal zzso zzso which collectively interact with a large number of zzso zzso and cell surface structural zzso Here we review the recently identified mechanisms responsible for the regulation of zzso expression and the biological roles that zzso plays in cancer invasion and zzso The regulation of zzso expression may represent one mechanism zzso cancer cells alter their surrounding zzso to facilitate the zzso growth and invasion of several tumor zzso A greater understanding of the regulation of zzso expression may contribute to the development of therapeutic methods to inhibit zzso function and tumor zzso
