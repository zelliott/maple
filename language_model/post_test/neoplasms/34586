zzso protein zzso an exquisitely sensitive systemic marker of zzso has emerged as an independent predictor of cardiovascular diseases zzso Because other chronic diseases are also associated with an inflammatory response, we sought to assess the association of zzso zzso zzso with total and zzso mortality in a large cohort of middle-aged zzso 

We measured zzso at baseline in zzso middle-aged men, randomly drawn from 3 samples of the general population in the zzso area zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso was defined as all deaths, fatal zzso fatal coronary heart disease zzso including sudden cardiac deaths, and cancer zzso 

During an average follow-up of zzso years, zzso deaths occurred zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso In multivariable Cox zzso analysis, subjects with zzso zzso zzso at baseline showed an almost zzso increased risk to die vs those with zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso for fatal zzso zzso zzso for fatal zzso and zzso zzso for cancer zzso In contrast, neither total nor HDL cholesterol significantly predicted zzso or cancer zzso and cholesterol had only modest effects on zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that increased circulating zzso zzso are associated with an increased risk of death from several widespread chronic zzso zzso increased zzso is a sensitive and valuable zzso indicator of an ongoing disease process that deserves serious and careful medical zzso
