Loss or gain of zzso is associated with many cancer zzso This property, called zzso instability, might arise from a zzso in the zzso segregation zzso Essential for zzso segregation are the proper connection of zzso to zzso and the zzso segregation of sister zzso in zzso zzso of these processes is ensured by two sophisticated zzso called the correction mechanism and the zzso assembly zzso Here we outline the current understanding of the underlying mechanisms, and highlight recent challenging experiments to address how zzso segregation failure might relate to zzso zzso these mechanisms may lead to the discovery of new and improved zzso zzso
