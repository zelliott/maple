We screened small molecules to identify two compounds, which we named zzso and zzso that have increased zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso screening with biologically active compounds defined aspects of the mechanism of action for zzso and zzso such as a zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso a previously reported compound with zzso zzso showed similar zzso zzso interference experiments targeting zzso zzso channel 3 zzso a target of zzso demonstrated that zzso is a scaffold that acts through zzso to activate the observed zzso zzso activated a similar death mechanism but in a zzso zzso We found that cells transformed with zzso zzso have increased iron content relative to their normal cell counterparts through zzso of zzso zzso 1 and zzso of zzso heavy chain 1 and zzso light zzso
