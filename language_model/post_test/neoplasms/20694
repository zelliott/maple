A retrospective study was conducted to characterize the diseases, clinical findings, and zzso and zzso findings associated with zzso zzso calcium concentration zzso zzso in 71 cats presented to North Carolina State University Veterinary zzso zzso The 3 most common diagnoses were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso failure zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was diagnosed in 4 zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso were the most frequently diagnosed zzso zzso zzso zzso were diagnosed in 8 of 11 cats with zzso Cats with zzso had a higher serum calcium concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso than cats with zzso failure or zzso and zzso failure zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration was higher in cats with zzso failure than in cats with zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite the fact that the majority of cats with zzso were zzso their serum zzso nitrogen and zzso zzso and urine specific gravity differed from that of cats with zzso zzso Additional studies are warranted to determine the underlying disease mechanism in the cats we identified with zzso and zzso We also identified a small number of cats with diseases that are not commonly reported with zzso Further studies are needed to determine whether an association exists between these diseases and zzso as well as to characterize the underlying zzso mechanism for each disease zzso
