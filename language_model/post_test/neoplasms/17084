The zzso growth factor zzso zzso has been one of the most targeted receptors in the field of zzso While zzso zzso have demonstrated clinical success in specific zzso most patients demonstrate either intrinsic or acquired resistance within one year of zzso Many mechanisms of resistance to zzso zzso have been identified, one of these being attributed to alternatively localized zzso from the cell membrane into the cell's zzso Inside the nucleus, zzso functions as a zzso factor for several genes involved in cell proliferation and zzso and as a zzso zzso to activate and stabilize zzso cell nuclear zzso and DNA dependent protein zzso Nuclear localized zzso is highly associated with disease zzso worse overall survival in numerous zzso and enhanced resistance to radiation, chemotherapy, and the zzso therapies zzso and zzso In this review the current knowledge of how nuclear zzso enhances resistance to cancer zzso is discussed, in addition to highlighting ways to target nuclear zzso as an zzso strategy in the zzso
