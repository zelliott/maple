zzso that show high sensitivity and specificity are needed for the early diagnosis and prognosis of zzso An immune response to cancer is zzso in humans, as demonstrated, in part, by the identification of zzso against a number of zzso zzso zzso in zzso from patients with different types of zzso Identification of zzso and their zzso zzso is a promising strategy for the discovery of relevant zzso During the past few years, three zzso approaches, including zzso identification of zzso by zzso expression cloning zzso zzso zzso analysis zzso and, more recently, protein zzso have been the dominant strategies used to identify zzso and their zzso zzso In this review, we aim to describe the advantages, drawbacks and recent improvements of these approaches for the study of zzso zzso Finally, we discuss the definition of zzso signatures to improve sensitivity for the development of clinically relevant zzso
