zzso statistics on the cancer burden are essential, both for purposes of research and for setting priorities in zzso zzso So that in vast countries with partial registration coverage, such as Iran, local data are more zzso We here estimated the zzso prevalence and mortality time trend of four major cancer site, zzso stomach, breast and zzso over the period zzso and provided short-range projections to zzso in zzso 

Estimates were derived by applying the zzso analysis method, a zzso approach to estimate and project zzso prevalence and mortality of chronic degenerative disease, starting from knowledge of mortality and relative survival zzso 

Age adjusted zzso mortality and prevalence rates in zzso exhibited a clear upward trend for all four sites during the period zzso with marked increases in prostate and breast predicted for the zzso zzso in zzso trends between males and females might be attributable to the difference in risk factors specific to certain cancer sites, with smoking being the main risk zzso 

In this study, males and females displayed an increasing pattern for zzso and mortality rate over the entire study period until zzso This information can be used as basis for planning zzso management and allocating zzso in public zzso
