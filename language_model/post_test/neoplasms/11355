Many models of zzso formation have been put forth so zzso In general they involve zzso in at least three elements within the zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulators of zzso zzso Recently numerous zzso in zzso have been found in many zzso whereas they were absent in normal zzso from the same zzso The presence of zzso of course, does not prove that they play a zzso role in development of zzso zzso and zzso however, the key role played by zzso in both zzso and generation of zzso zzso oxygen species might indicate that the observed zzso contribute to zzso zzso Recent experiments with nude mice have proven that zzso zzso are indeed responsible for zzso growth and exacerbated zzso zzso This review describes zzso zzso in main types of human zzso
