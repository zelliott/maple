The molecular zzso zzso maintains the activity and stability of a diverse set of zzso proteins that play key roles in normal and disease zzso Around 20 zzso zzso that zzso the zzso clientele have entered clinical trials for zzso However, the full extent of the zzso zzso which encompasses not only clients but also proteins modulated by downstream zzso responses, is still incompletely characterized and poorly zzso Earlier large-scale efforts to define the zzso zzso have been valuable but are incomplete because of limited technical zzso Here we discuss previous large-scale surveys of zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso in light of a significant new study using state-of-the-art zzso technology combined with more sensitive high-resolution mass zzso zzso that extends the catalog of zzso changes in zzso cancer zzso Among wide-ranging changes, major functional responses include zzso of protein zzso activity and the DNA damage response alongside zzso of the protein degradation zzso Despite this improved zzso coverage, there was surprisingly little overlap with previous zzso This may be due in part to technical issues but is likely also due to the zzso of the zzso zzso with the inhibitor conditions used, the cancer cell type and the genetic status of client zzso We suggest future zzso studies to address these factors, to help distinguish client protein components from indirect zzso components and to address other key questions in fundamental and zzso zzso zzso Such studies should also reveal new zzso for patient selection and novel targets for therapeutic zzso
