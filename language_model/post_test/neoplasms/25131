identifying imaging zzso of healing of zzso of the jaw zzso in cancer patients may assist in better zzso of treatment zzso 

patients with zzso were followed zzso and underwent bone zzso both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso End points were time to healing and the number of zzso zzso parameters included zzso zzso pattern of zzso and zzso of zzso relative to the unaffected zzso 

a total of 22 patients were recruited (3 zzso 19 zzso with a stage 1 zzso zzso in 8, stage 2 in 9, and stage 3 zzso in 5 zzso Median duration of follow-up was 12 months zzso zzso zzso acquisitions proved superior over zzso images in detecting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso relative to the unaffected side showed increasing zzso with higher stages of zzso mean, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso in stage 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso in stage 2, and zzso zzso zzso zzso in stage zzso In addition, this relative ratio of zzso was found to be an independent predictor of zzso healing zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Neither zzso stage nor relative ratio of zzso were zzso of the occurrence of zzso zzso 

bone zzso in patients with zzso is feasible and zzso acquisitions are preferred over zzso zzso Relative zzso of zzso zzso provides zzso information independent of clinical stage that may assist in identifying patients with a poor zzso
