The zzso addressed in this section consist of a number of thought-provoking issues and unresolved questions that emerge from the papers in this zzso The evidence for tamoxifen zzso in animal models and, to a more restricted extent, in humans has led some investigators to question whether zzso are ready or appropriate for clinical zzso in a disease prevention setting involving healthy but high-risk zzso There is, however, inconsistency in both efficacy and zzso zzso animal models and humans, leading others to question the value of basing the decision to proceed with clinical studies on zzso results in zzso Although the molecular basis for zzso action is rapidly being zzso the cellular activity of these agents is still zzso We discuss the view that the efficacy of tamoxifen in breast cancer is based on its treatment of zzso zzso or small collections of cancer cells that are not clinically apparent, not only in the context of prevention but also in the treatment zzso As part of our approach that assumes zzso activity to be the foundation upon which zzso development is being zzso we discuss the inconsistency between the zzso data and prospective zzso data with respect to the relationship between zzso use and cardiovascular zzso The need to validate surrogate markers of zzso action is discussed in relation to bone but is clearly relevant to all disease zzso The zzso used in describing zzso action as zzso or zzso in relation to zzso at various target sites has been inconsistent, especially in the clinical zzso We attempt to dissect out some of the inconsistencies in zzso in the hope that this will contribute to improved communication of data resulting from zzso zzso In the clinical arena, we begin with the premise that the large, simple zzso trial offers the optimal design for the testing of zzso In view of limited resources, however, we counter this position with alternative, if less desirable, approaches to the clinical format for zzso zzso Finally, we explore the process by which statistically meaningful results from clinical trials are zzso into the specific drug indications that apply to clinical zzso
