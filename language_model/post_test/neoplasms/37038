Transfer of the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso gene into cancer cells followed by treatment with zzso zzso is an attractive strategy of cancer gene zzso zzso cells are efficiently killed by the direct zzso effect of zzso which is generated by zzso from zzso In addition, the bystander effect kills adjacent zzso tumor cells, although this mechanism is not fully zzso We addressed whether the systemic immune response is involved in tumor zzso in zzso zzso cells, from a zzso zzso cell line zzso with a zzso zzso bearing the zzso gene driven by the zzso early promoter, were zzso into zzso zzso After complete zzso of zzso tumors with zzso treatment, the animals were challenged with zzso tumor zzso zzso or significant growth zzso of challenged tumor cells was zzso In these animals, zzso zzso T cells were efficiently zzso zzso cells appeared to be a main component in this zzso T cell zzso zzso of class I major zzso complex zzso increased in zzso cells treated with zzso These results suggest that suicide gene therapy may be useful not only for short-term tumor zzso zzso by direct cell killing and bystander effect, but also, due to the vaccination effect, may be an aid in long-term tumor zzso and prevention of zzso
