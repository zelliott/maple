zzso are specific cellular regulators that directly and indirectly control activities such as cell attachment and migration, differentiation and zzso proliferation and zzso and zzso zzso Considering the zzso of these issues to tumor zzso the generation of zzso zzso fragments able to zzso zzso biological functions would allow the development of new strategies to improve treatment of cancer zzso In this report, we explore the use of zzso display technology to isolate human zzso zzso zzso A library of single chain zzso was selected using intact mouse zzso and five different clones were zzso All the zzso were specific for their zzso zzso as revealed by lack of zzso with other components of the basement zzso A more extensive characterization of the panel indicated that these zzso recognize the native protein through zzso zzso All of them reduced tumor cell attachment to zzso suggesting that zzso of the zzso zzso that are recognized by these zzso likely bind to zzso zzso The zzso fragments bind to zzso rat and human zzso and show strong zzso zzso with basement zzso in human and zzso tissue zzso Their properties make them ideal candidates for in zzso zzso
