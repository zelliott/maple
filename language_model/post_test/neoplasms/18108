Recent reviews suggest that the routine use of zzso outcome measures zzso in cancer clinics improves the processes of care but not patient outcomes such as quality of life or zzso We set out to identify future strategies for zzso interventions to impact patient outcomes and zzso trials to identify treatment zzso 

zzso and zzso were systematically searched to identify reports of relevant zzso controlled zzso zzso and trial designs were compared and contrasted along the parameters identified by previous reviews and the rationales reported in each zzso zzso were zzso with evidence for impact to develop zzso 

Six articles were zzso Evidence for impact on patient outcomes was zzso zzso varied according to the zzso used, the frequency, content and presentation of feedback, and the training offered to medical zzso Trials varied in their unit of zzso outcome measures, control of contamination, monitoring of zzso use, and length of zzso Our analysis identified the need for future interventions to ensure that zzso data are used to optimum effect and for trials to control for contamination and monitor use of zzso to link this with zzso 

Future interventions should motivate and zzso health professionals to use zzso data in managing patients, train patients in zzso use more specific zzso in clinic, improve the zzso of feedback for both medical staff and patients, and monitor the use of zzso to intervene when problems zzso Future trials should use a zzso design to control for contamination and enable zzso zzso
