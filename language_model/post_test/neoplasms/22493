zzso tumor cell migration zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso are a powerful tool for modeling and understanding the biology of this critical step in the process of zzso Currently available methods offer very limited zzso and are not amenable to studies of comparative pharmacology or small-scale zzso The authors present an automated approach to zzso tumor cell migration zzso A standard zzso plate with an array of zzso was designed and constructed from common zzso After filling the channels with zzso zzso cells were placed at one end of the channel, and migration into the channel was monitored via an imaging zzso All zzso steps were performed by standard zzso zzso zzso cell migration in the channel was truly zzso and correlated with zzso zzso The zzso data from these zzso were used to rank the potency of compounds zzso migration through zzso collagen as well as to gain additional insights into the zzso activities related to cell zzso This approach is compatible with a variety of zzso zzso and/or kinetic zzso
