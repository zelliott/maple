zzso in the expression of zzso zzso like the inhibitor of zzso zzso protein family, display a pivotal zzso by which cancer cells acquire resistance to therapeutic zzso Among this family, zzso the smallest and structural unique member, deserves growing attention due to its universal zzso in human tumors, and its prominent role in disparate networks of cellular division, zzso signaling and zzso Several zzso studies have demonstrated that targeting zzso expression by the use of small interfering zzso dominant negative zzso zzso and small zzso zzso zzso tumor cells towards chemotherapy and zzso and reduced tumor growth zzso Due to these properties, zzso has been proposed as a molecular target for zzso zzso Recent studies further revealed that zzso achieved by zzso zzso seems to be multifaceted and involves zzso and zzso zzso In general, an enhanced rate of zzso and pronounced cell cycle arrest have been zzso More recently, a hampered zzso response has been noted, indicating a distinct role of the protein in zzso double strand break zzso These properties were linked to a nuclear import and physical zzso with members of the zzso repair machinery such as zzso zzso and DNA dependent zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso strategies in clinical practice is currently under investigation as the first zzso zzso successfully entered phase zzso zzso Although these trials do not include radiation therapy at present, zzso zzso may represent a novel type of molecular zzso to improve the effectiveness of radiation therapy or zzso
