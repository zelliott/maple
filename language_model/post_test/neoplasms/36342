The zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso has a crucial negative role on cell cycle zzso In addition to its classical role as a zzso zzso it also performs zzso functions as the regulation of zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso has been associated with tumor aggressiveness and poor clinical outcome, although the mechanisms underlying this participation still remain zzso We report here a new cellular function of zzso as a zzso regulator in association with zzso complexes that could be relevant for zzso We observed that zzso associates with specific promoters of genes involved in important cellular functions as processing and zzso of zzso zzso organization and zzso translation and cell zzso On these promoters zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with these proteins and by affinity zzso we demonstrated a direct interaction of zzso with zzso and zzso through its zzso We have also shown that zzso recruits zzso on the zzso and there zzso is needed for the subsequent recruitment of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed that zzso behaves as zzso zzso of these zzso genes zzso Finally, in human tumors, we established a correlation with zzso of zzso and poor zzso Thus, this new function of zzso as a zzso zzso could have a role in the major aggressiveness of tumors with low levels of zzso
