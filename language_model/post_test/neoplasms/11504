The purpose of this paper is to identify the treatment patterns and corresponding costs of zzso resource use associated with zzso care for different types of advanced cancer patients, from the time they started strong zzso treatment until zzso This was a zzso study performed from the perspective of the zzso National Health Service zzso A data set was created zzso zzso patients in the zzso database who had a Read code for zzso zzso with a specific zzso diagnosis and who received their first strong zzso between 1 January 1998 and 30 September 2000 and died during that zzso zzso zzso resource zzso data were obtained from the zzso zzso Unit costs at zzso prices were applied to the resource use estimates to determine the mean cost of zzso care from the start of treatment until zzso There were significant differences in age between patients with different cancer types and in patients' survival from diagnosis, time to the start of zzso care and duration of zzso zzso The mean duration from cancer diagnosis to the start of strong zzso treatment ranged from zzso to zzso years in patients with lung and breast cancer zzso Moreover, the length of zzso care ranged from 180 to zzso days in patients with these cancer types zzso There were also statistically significant differences in resource use between patients with different cancer types, but this zzso in part, the varying zzso of zzso zzso Nevertheless, there were also differences in the monthly number of primary care visits reflecting the different number of monthly zzso There was no apparent relationship between the length and corresponding cost of zzso care which ranged from 1816 pounds sterling for colon cancer to zzso pounds sterling for zzso zzso Additionally, on average, only a third of all patients also received zzso zzso as part of their initial strong zzso zzso The total cost of zzso care varied between cancer type and zzso at least in part, the distinct clinical features associated with different zzso and the varying lengths of survival following the start of strong zzso zzso Nevertheless, no apparent relationship was found between length of zzso care and corresponding zzso This analysis provides data on zzso care resource use for a variety of zzso and could provide useful input when planning local zzso strategies and building service commissioning zzso
