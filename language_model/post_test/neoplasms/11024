zzso evidence indicates that gene transfer to the zzso root zzso using zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso can reduce zzso behavior in animal models of zzso This clinical trial was carried out to assess the safety and explore the potential efficacy of this approach in zzso 

We conducted a zzso zzso phase I clinical trial of zzso a zzso zzso zzso expressing human zzso zzso in subjects with intractable focal pain caused by zzso zzso was injected zzso into the zzso corresponding to the zzso distribution of zzso The primary outcome was zzso As secondary measures, efficacy of pain relief was assessed using a zzso rating scale zzso the Short Form McGill zzso zzso zzso and concurrent zzso zzso 

Ten subjects with moderate to severe intractable pain despite treatment with zzso of zzso (or zzso were enrolled into the zzso Treatment was well tolerated with no study zzso serious adverse events observed at any point in the zzso zzso receiving the low dose of zzso reported no substantive change in zzso zzso in the middle- and high-dose zzso reported pain relief as assessed by zzso and zzso 

Treatment of intractable pain with zzso was well zzso There were no zzso controls in this relatively small study, but the zzso zzso effects suggest that zzso may be effective in reducing pain and warrants further clinical zzso
