To see whether zzso levels can identifying patients at high risk of zzso zzso events and establish the best zzso zzso Current guidelines do not recommend routine prophylaxis against zzso zzso zzso in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy, but the risk increases about zzso because of this zzso zzso was measured at baseline in 124 cancer patients scheduled for their first zzso zzso events, including symptomatic episodes of deep vein zzso or pulmonary embolism or both, were recorded during the first 6 months of therapy, and zzso deep vein zzso was revealed by zzso zzso at baseline and after 90 and 180 zzso During zzso there were 11 episodes of zzso zzso Mean zzso values were higher in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1039 zzso zzso zzso zzso On grouping zzso values in zzso only zzso zzso zzso zzso in the first zzso zzso and second zzso zzso zzso suffered a deep vein zzso embolism event as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso in the third zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was significantly shorter in the third zzso than in the first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relative risk for third zzso first zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso analysis found that only baseline zzso zzso were correlated with the subsequent development of zzso zzso zzso values in cancer patients scheduled for chemotherapy might be used to select those at low risk of zzso most likely to be safe without zzso
