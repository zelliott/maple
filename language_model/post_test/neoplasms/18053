zzso is a tandem zzso protein that has recently been shown to be zzso in several cancer cells and zzso and that might play an active role in tumor cell invasion and zzso Here we show that zzso of the tandem zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells is necessary and sufficient to stimulate these cells to invade a collagen I zzso and this effect can be regulated by zzso binding to the zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso invasion requires signaling through zzso zzso and zzso signaling pathways and involves changes in zzso zzso zzso when we used zzso interference to inhibit zzso expression in different invasive cancer cell lines, we observed a drastically decreased ability of these cells to migrate and invade into collagen type I or zzso zzso cells also show increased cell zzso indicating that zzso is important for zzso zzso in zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso of zzso by zzso interference could provide a means of zzso tumor invasion and possibly zzso in different zzso and point to zzso as a potential cancer zzso and drug zzso
