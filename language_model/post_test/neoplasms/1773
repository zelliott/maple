zzso is a pivotal zzso factor that zzso signals from a variety of zzso phase regulators and zzso diverse cellular functions, such as DNA zzso repair, zzso and zzso Its role in cellular proliferation and zzso as depicted from experimental models and limited reports in human zzso remains a matter of zzso Recently, in zzso cell lung cancer, it was observed that zzso zzso was associated with zzso growth, zzso an zzso zzso To clarify further the role of zzso in zzso the investigation was expanded in four of the most common human zzso by examining its expression status and putative impact on zzso zzso These issues were addressed by zzso and molecular means in 52 breast zzso 42 prostate zzso 58 colon zzso and 77 superficial zzso transitional cell zzso zzso The following results were zzso zzso in breast zzso zzso expression correlated with proliferation zzso zzso zzso and growth index zzso zzso zzso zzso in prostate zzso absence of zzso was noted, in contrast to its expression in normal and zzso zzso zzso in colon zzso zzso expression was zzso related to growth index zzso zzso zzso being expressed in zzso with increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and low proliferation zzso zzso zzso and zzso in superficial zzso zzso expression correlated with proliferation zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso has a zzso effect in breast zzso and superficial zzso whereas the opposite seems to be the case for colon and prostate zzso To interpret the above findings, the status of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which are known to affect zzso activity, was further zzso The results suggest that the actions of zzso are mainly dependent on the functionality of these zzso Nevertheless, the data also imply that zzso pathways may play a zzso role in the function of zzso in colon zzso
