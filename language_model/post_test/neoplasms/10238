The identification of zzso associated with tumor destruction is a major goal of cancer zzso Several genetic and zzso techniques have revealed a broad range of gene products that elicit immune recognition in cancer patients, but the zzso importance of these responses in most cases is poorly zzso While some targets are linked to tumor zzso in the context of adoptive cellular therapies or cancer zzso the possible roles of immunity to most zzso in disease zzso and clinical outcomes remain to be zzso One strategy for characterizing zzso that elicit clinically significant immune recognition involves the study of patients who achieve durable clinical benefits from immune zzso Through this approach, we uncovered the zzso of major zzso zzso protein A zzso which is a zzso for zzso and zzso a protein zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso Our findings suggest that components of the zzso zzso may be attractive targets for therapeutic zzso zzso
