The human zzso proteins are a family of four proteins characterized by a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso This domain consists of zzso zzso of complex zzso occurring in tandem with a zzso zzso of zzso zzso Together, these proteins are linked to various zzso including cancer and zzso zzso zzso Despite an increasing research focus on these zzso their functions in general, and their specific roles in disease, are still zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso zzso amplified sequences with zzso tandem repeats 1), a predicted zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso there is a particular lack of information available in the zzso The aim of the present review is therefore to zzso the existing information on zzso and also to compile data that could be linked to zzso and thus help our understanding of this neglected zzso zzso
