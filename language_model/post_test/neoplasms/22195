Cancer zzso zzso zzso are promising candidates for tumor vaccines due to their zzso and zzso zzso Recently, we identified a novel cancer zzso zzso zzso whose expression is restricted to male zzso after zzso and is strictly absent in zzso female zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein that shares 11 zzso finger zzso with zzso factor zzso and differs at the zzso and zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso regulation of zzso X zzso zzso repression, and zzso of cancer zzso zzso zzso expression has been documented in zzso of diverse zzso origin, including, but not limited to breast, zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso and subsequent expression of many zzso zzso including zzso and zzso indicating that it is expressed very early in zzso and might be an attractive candidate for zzso In this study we tested zzso as a vaccine in a very aggressive, highly zzso and poorly zzso zzso model of zzso zzso zzso with a DNA zzso the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso significantly prolonged survival, and inhibited tumor growth in zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso mixed with molecular zzso and boosting with zzso zzso expressing zzso was generally more effective, suggesting that the vaccination protocol could be further zzso This is the first report demonstrating the feasibility of vaccination with a cancer associated zzso regulator for the induction of tumor zzso
