The recent development of mouse strains with zzso genes zzso or zzso has provided investigators with new models for testing zzso strategies to offset specific genetic zzso to zzso This review focuses on the three genetically altered mouse models that have been the most widely used in zzso zzso zzso mice, which carry a zzso in the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Studies with the zzso and zzso mice provide the strongest evidence to date that the zzso zzso plays a major role in colon zzso and that zzso zzso drugs that target zzso have great potential as colon cancer zzso zzso In addition, zzso studies in mice deficient of the zzso zzso zzso the most commonly altered gene in human cancer, suggest that the increased zzso to cancer resulting from the loss of zzso function may be offset by preventive zzso Other recently developed transgenic and knockout models of potential interest for zzso studies will also be zzso
