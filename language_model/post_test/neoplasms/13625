zzso cells are the most potent zzso cells and are critical to initiation of immune zzso zzso cells loaded ex zzso with zzso zzso are being administered to cancer patients in an effort to zzso a zzso zzso zzso immune response resulting in tumor shrinkage and clinical zzso 

zzso Corporation has designed three therapeutic vaccines using zzso zzso cells loaded ex zzso with zzso zzso for prostate zzso zzso for multiple myeloma and other zzso zzso and zzso for zzso expressing the zzso zzso 

zzso studies demonstrated that blood zzso cells matured spontaneously in short-term culture without growth factors, and that fusion of zzso with zzso zzso factor enhances zzso zzso and presentation by blood zzso zzso Phase zzso trials suggest that these zzso zzso vaccines are safe and well zzso zzso has demonstrated zzso activity in zzso prostate zzso approximately zzso of patients experienced decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso levels and a similar percentage experienced disease zzso zzso zzso zzso trials in zzso zzso zzso prostate cancer have been zzso Phase II data on zzso are similarly encouraging, and expanded phase II testing is ongoing in anticipation of opening phase III trials in zzso zzso is in early clinical development and has shown significant capacity to elicit zzso immune zzso 

zzso delivery by ex zzso zzso zzso cells may be an effective approach to cancer zzso
