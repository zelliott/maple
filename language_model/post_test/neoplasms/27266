Human cancer cell lines are commonly used in basic cancer research to understand the behavior of primary zzso zzso in the DNA zzso patterns are nowadays recognized as a hallmark of the cancer zzso However, no comprehensive study defines the DNA zzso environment present in the established cancer cell lines used in everyday zzso zzso To address this matter, we have analyzed 70 widely used human cancer cell lines of 12 different tumor types for zzso island promoter zzso of 15 tumor zzso zzso global zzso zzso content, chemical response to the zzso agent zzso and their genetic zzso for zzso metabolism zzso Several conclusions arise from our zzso zzso a specific profile of zzso island zzso exists for each tumor type, allowing its zzso within zzso clusters according to the originating zzso zzso cancer cell lines generally have higher levels of zzso island zzso than primary tumors, because of the contribution of particular zzso islands and tumor zzso and zzso there are no major differences between cell lines in their zzso DNA content, efficacy of zzso treatment, and distribution of zzso of zzso metabolism zzso Our data provide a basis for a better use of human cancer cell lines in basic and zzso research with respect to their DNA zzso zzso
