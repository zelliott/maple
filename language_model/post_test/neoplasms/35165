The separation of zzso zzso from poorly differentiated zzso and zzso tumors and zzso processes can be a difficult problem in zzso zzso techniques can be applied to zzso specimens to detect cellular zzso which may aid in their proper zzso We have reviewed 67 zzso specimens in which zzso techniques were employed using zzso to common zzso zzso zzso zzso markers zzso zzso 12 and zzso and zzso light zzso zzso markers zzso 1, zzso zzso 12 and zzso and zzso light zzso zzso markers zzso 1, zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso These specimens included 33 body cavity zzso (21 zzso 8 zzso and 4 zzso 22 zzso zzso zzso and 12 fine needle zzso (4 brain, 1 zzso 2 liver, 1 zzso 3 zzso masses and 1 zzso zzso The marker studies confirmed the initial zzso diagnoses in 31 specimens and modified the final diagnoses in 16 zzso zzso in 20 specimens were zzso due to low zzso or technical zzso Two problems may limit the usefulness of these zzso First, many of the zzso specimens contained too few cells for adequate zzso Second, the zzso cells from zzso specimens often stained with zzso Our findings indicate that marker studies are of value in the diagnosis of problematic cases presenting as zzso tumors in zzso
