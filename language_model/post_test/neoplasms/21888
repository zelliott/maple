DNA zzso is an zzso modification of the DNA sequence and thus does not change the genetic code but affects zzso stability and gene zzso DNA zzso patterns are zzso and can be passed on to the daughter zzso In this review, we briefly zzso our current knowledge on normal DNA zzso patterns and move on to discuss the current state of the field with respect to altered DNA zzso in zzso We make a special attempt to address current questions relating to zzso DNA zzso zzso Since DNA zzso is used as a therapeutic target in clinical studies, it is of utmost importance to define potential target sequences that could be used as diagnostic or zzso zzso We conclude the review by outlining possible scenarios that may explain tumor zzso DNA zzso patterns described by zzso evaluating zzso levels of DNA zzso
