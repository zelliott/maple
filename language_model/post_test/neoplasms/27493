To use 5 years of primary data to compare the incremental zzso of breast conservation and radiation versus mastectomy with the restriction of choice to a single therapy versus providing a choice of either zzso 

We evaluated a random retrospective cohort of zzso Medicare beneficiaries treated for newly diagnosed stage I or II breast cancer from 1992 through zzso The outcome measures were zzso zzso zzso and zzso medical zzso zzso and propensity score adjustments were used in the zzso 

A breast conservation and radiation regimen has significantly higher costs than mastectomy in the first year after zzso the adjusted zzso costs are zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso greater than those of zzso The adjusted incremental zzso ratio comparing breast conservation and radiation to mastectomy was zzso per zzso for the comparison of the two zzso If the possibility of patient choice from maintaining the availability of multiple treatments versus restricting choice to mastectomy alone provides a zzso gain of zzso zzso then the zzso ratio of this choice option is zzso per zzso 

The current system of providing a choice between mastectomy and breast conservation surgery is economically attractive when the economic analysis includes the benefit of patient choice of zzso
