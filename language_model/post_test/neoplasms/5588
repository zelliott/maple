zzso are assumed to play a crucial role in zzso and zzso zzso including cell zzso zzso differentiation and zzso Furthermore, cell surface zzso profile changes in the so called zzso zzso such as zzso zzso To better investigate these zzso the zzso composition in different solid zzso and in two transformed cell lines was zzso In some of these models we also tried to correlate the pattern of zzso to the key zzso involved in their zzso The results we obtained can be summarized as zzso zzso with or without zzso 22 zzso predominance of zzso zzso in the former and of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso between zzso ratio and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso developed in zzso transgenic zzso zzso of zzso zzso The different zzso distribution seems to correlate with the zzso size; zzso zzso zzso cells zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso transformed cells exhibit a lower activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to normal zzso suggesting a possible correlation with the zzso zzso The zzso activity seems to correlate to the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso normal zzso zzso and zzso transformed zzso zzso is absent in zzso while it accounts for the main zzso species in zzso On the contrary, zzso present in a large amount in normal zzso is practically absent in transformed zzso No correlation has been observed between zzso profile and zzso activities so far zzso
