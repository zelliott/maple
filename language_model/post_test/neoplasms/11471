Field placement for zzso Treatment Planning can be done based on the surface zzso or simulator zzso or simulator with CT zzso A prospective study was carried out to compare these three techniques of radiation treatment planning to zzso find out the difference in normal tissue zzso and target volume coverage in the three groups after three-dimensional zzso 

The CT scans of 30 patients in the treatment position, taken on a zzso zzso zzso scanner at zzso zzso were transferred to zzso three-dimensional radiation treatment planning zzso The normal zzso and target volumes zzso and zzso were outlined on all the CT slices as per zzso Report zzso zzso Three types of radiation treatment planning was done zzso Plan zzso on the surface zzso alone, Plan zzso on zzso and Plan zzso on zzso 

The mean dose to zzso of the clinical target volume zzso was increased by zzso and zzso by Plans II and III as compared with Plan zzso The mean dose to zzso zzso to all the critical zzso was decreased by zzso and zzso by Plans II and III as compared to Plan zzso The mean time, in simulator room, for field placement for Plans zzso was zzso zzso and 44 zzso zzso 

Thus for adequate coverage of target volumes and sparing normal zzso zzso based radiation treatment planning is the best method of radiation treatment planning though it is more time zzso
