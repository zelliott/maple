zzso responses in zzso cells appear to be highly zzso Six human cell lines were used to evaluate whether zzso response could be related to radiation sensitivity or zzso versus normal cell zzso 

Six human cell lines zzso zzso two melanoma, two breast zzso were cultured under identical conditions to plateau zzso The cells were given inducing doses of 0, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed after incubation at 37 degrees C by challenge doses to assess radiation zzso 

An zzso response zzso was observed in some but not all the cell zzso The zzso was observed at 2 h and persisted for up to 24 zzso It was observed for doses as low as zzso and zzso zzso and declined with higher zzso In the resistant melanoma cell line there was no zzso zzso instead it showed zzso for all inducing zzso 

Human cells can demonstrate an zzso zzso This response is variable among cell lines and appears not to be related to zzso nor differences between zzso and normal cell zzso
