zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso responsible for the zzso step in the zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso Its expression is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, but the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso expression are still zzso In this study we investigated whether the zzso G zzso zzso zzso or zzso one of the key zzso genes involved in zzso development, activated zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein levels in zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, targeted zzso gene expression of zzso by small hairpin zzso and chemical zzso of zzso zzso activity by tin zzso IX zzso impaired zzso survival, zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso cells implanted in the zzso flank of nude mice developed tumors with elevated zzso expression and zzso zzso administration of zzso to the implanted mice, under conditions that effectively blocked zzso activity and zzso expression in the transplanted cells, zzso reduced tumor growth, without apparent side zzso On the contrary, administration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso further enhanced zzso tumor zzso These data zzso zzso as an important zzso of zzso tumor growth and suggest that zzso of zzso zzso activity by zzso may be a potential therapeutic zzso
