zzso against zzso zzso is a promising approach to cancer therapy and zzso but it faces several challenges and limitations, such as tolerance mechanisms associated with zzso expressed by the tumor zzso zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso zzso have improved the efficacy of zzso and zzso vaccines in animal models and are under investigation in clinical zzso However, their efficacy as vaccine zzso is likely limited by the fact that they mediate both zzso and zzso signals to T cells via zzso and zzso zzso To overcome these limitations, we have generated a zzso zzso zzso zzso with preferential binding to zzso named zzso protein zzso which we combined with a zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso named zzso zzso induced a zzso immune response against human zzso zzso upon DNA vaccination in zzso zzso However, zzso DNA zzso alone or in combination with human zzso zzso induced no zzso zzso T cells in the peripheral blood of the zzso In contrast, zzso combined with zzso induced both zzso and zzso T cells specific for zzso Moreover, zzso combined with zzso induced significantly higher levels of zzso zzso than zzso plus zzso These improved zzso properties of zzso when compared with zzso illustrate the importance of zzso zzso in vaccine responses in nonhuman primates and warrant further studies on the potential of zzso in improving the efficacy of cancer zzso
