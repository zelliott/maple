zzso zzso are small zzso zzso zzso whose primary function is to regulate gene expression at the zzso zzso zzso play crucial roles in normal biological processes and are commonly zzso in human zzso Stem cells are regarded as the zzso cells of all types of differentiated cells that comprise zzso and zzso of the zzso A novel hypothesis proposes that tumors are composed of zzso cells derived from cancer stem cells, which have zzso and differentiation capabilities similar to those of normal stem zzso Cancer stem cells have been isolated and characterized from various zzso Given recent studies supporting the critical regulatory roles of zzso in the zzso and differentiation of cancer stem cells, better understanding the functions of zzso will provide invaluable insights into the prevention of zzso and tumor zzso In this review, we will zzso the research progress in the study of zzso involved in the zzso and differentiation of cancer stem zzso
