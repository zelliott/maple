In the period zzso 3 zzso kidney zzso were performed on 3 zzso patients in zzso In the same period 67 primary zzso zzso were detected in these zzso In comparisons using age and zzso zzso in a background population, the observed zzso zzso was significantly higher than zzso zzso were made in regard to a number of factors with potential influence on zzso The zzso from transplantation to appearance of zzso was significantly longer in the recipients of zzso from living relatives than in zzso kidney zzso zzso correlation of zzso zzso was found with zzso mismatch in recipients of zzso zzso zzso zzso as underlying kidney disease and blood zzso showed correlation with zzso zzso From these observations the hypothesis is proposed that a chronic zzso effect is a dominant factor among the numerous possible zzso mechanisms in patients with zzso
