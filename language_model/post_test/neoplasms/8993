Cancer develops mainly as a result of accumulating zzso in genes controlling cell growth zzso zzso is one of the most commonly zzso genes in zzso While agents targeting the signaling aspects of zzso have met with some success, resistance to therapy remains a major zzso Another focus of drug development has been to harness the immune system to target cells harboring zzso zzso which can appear zzso to the immune zzso It has been observed that cancer is able to avoid regular immune surveillance through local and systemic mechanisms leading to immune zzso One potential way of breaking immune tolerance is through vaccine zzso 

The authors review the current but limited available literature on zzso vaccine zzso The research reviewed was identified from zzso and presentations from national zzso meetings related to zzso vaccines in general and zzso series zzso 

While targeting zzso has proven difficulties, developing novel vaccine approaches such as zzso appear to be safe with early efficacy in subset of patients with zzso zzso However, further research is crucial to identify this group of patients and develop zzso
