With the growing recognition that patients and partners react to a cancer diagnosis as an zzso system and increasing evidence that zzso interventions can be beneficial to both patients and partners, there has been a recent increase in the attention given to interventions that target zzso The aim of this systematic review was to identify existing zzso interventions for patients with cancer and their partners and explore the efficacy of these interventions (including whether there is added value to target the couple versus zzso the content and delivery of zzso interventions, and to identify the key elements of zzso interventions that promote improvement in adjustment to cancer zzso 

A systematic review of the cancer literature was performed to identify experimental and zzso zzso interventions published between 1990 and zzso To be considered for this review, studies had to test the efficacy of a zzso intervention for couples affected by zzso Studies were excluded if they were published in a language other than English or French, focused on zzso exercise, or dietary components combined with zzso zzso or did not assess the impact of the intervention on psychological distress zzso depression, zzso or quality of zzso Data were extracted using a zzso data collection form, and were zzso independently by three zzso 

Of the zzso articles screened, 23 were included in this zzso zzso interventions were most zzso in improving couple communication, psychological distress, and relationship zzso zzso had a limited impact on physical distress and social zzso Most interventions focused on improving communication and increasing understanding of the cancer diagnosis within zzso zzso were most often delivered by zzso nurses or clinical zzso Although most were delivered in person, few were zzso No difference in efficacy was noted based on mode of zzso zzso associated with zzso and completion included symptom severity, available time and willingness to zzso 

Given effect sizes of zzso interventions are similar to those reported in recent zzso of zzso and zzso interventions zzso it appears zzso interventions for patients with cancer and their partners may be at least as zzso as zzso and zzso zzso Despite evidence that zzso interventions enhance zzso adjustment for both patients and partners, these interventions have not yet been widely zzso Although more work is needed to facilitate translation to routine practice, evidence reviewed is promising in reducing distress and improving coping and adjustment to a cancer diagnosis or to cancer zzso
