zzso zzso is an zzso protein zzso in various experimental models of zzso and appears to be involved in zzso and zzso Although various studies have assessed zzso protein levels in several tumor types, a broad survey of zzso expression in human zzso under the same experimental conditions has not been carried zzso 

We used zzso to detect zzso in a selection of 350 human tumors and 113 normal zzso from a variety of body sites, using zzso human cancer tissue zzso zzso included zzso from breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso esophagus zzso stomach zzso zzso zzso zzso duct zzso liver zzso colon zzso kidney zzso zzso zzso prostate zzso head and neck zzso zzso zzso zzso lung zzso skin zzso and brain zzso 

High zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso of gastric zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of transitional cell zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of pancreatic zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso of lung and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso of the head and neck, and 59% of zzso zzso Although zzso expression was identified in a good number of zzso zzso and brain tumors, the majority of 6 skin zzso 11 of 14 zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso and 23 of 26 breast zzso revealed low zzso zzso or were zzso When considering all sites, zzso expression significantly correlated with tumor stage zzso correlation zzso P zzso zzso zzso score and stage were also significantly correlated for specific cancer sites including zzso zzso zzso zzso colon zzso zzso zzso kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mouth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study reports the broad distribution of zzso in human tumors from different body sites, suggesting involvement of this protein in tumor zzso The strong correlation between pathological stage and zzso across multiple tumor types suggests a role for zzso in tumor zzso
