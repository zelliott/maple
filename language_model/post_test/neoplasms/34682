Exposure to environmental hazards contributes to many chronic diseases, yet the magnitude of their contribution to the total disease burden in Canada is not well zzso 

To estimate the environmental burden of disease zzso in Canada for respiratory disease, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and zzso zzso zzso the contribution of environmental zzso to the overall burden of disease could play an important role in shaping public health and environmental policy zzso 

The World Health Organization zzso recently estimated the environmental burden of disease globally by using a combination of comparative risk assessment data and expert judgment to develop environmentally attributable zzso zzso of mortality and morbidity for 85 categories of zzso We use the zzso developed by the WHO, zzso developed by other researchers, and data from Canadian public health institutions to provide an initial estimate of the environmental burden of disease in Canada for four major categories of zzso 

Our results indicate that: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso million days spent in zzso zzso zzso million restricted activity days for asthma zzso zzso new cases of zzso zzso low birth weight zzso and between zzso billion and zzso billion in costs occur in Canada each year due to respiratory disease, cardiovascular illness, cancer, and zzso zzso associated with adverse environmental zzso 

The burden of illness in Canada resulting from adverse environmental zzso is zzso zzso efforts to prevent adverse environmental zzso are warranted, including research, education, and zzso
