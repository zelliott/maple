zzso play a critical role in tumor growth and zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso is a powerful marker of zzso in solid zzso Thus, breaking of immune tolerance of zzso zzso is an attractive approach to cancer zzso To test this concept, we zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and used it as a zzso zzso We found that zzso with zzso zzso was effective at both protective and therapeutic zzso immunity in several mouse tumor zzso zzso against mouse zzso were identified by Western zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were substantially zzso zzso zzso B cells were zzso by zzso zzso There was zzso deposition of zzso within zzso The zzso activity was also induced by the adoptive transfer of the zzso zzso zzso was apparently inhibited within the tumor zzso and on the zzso zzso The increased zzso cells were found within the tumor zzso from the mice treated with zzso zzso The zzso activity and production of zzso against mouse zzso could be zzso by depletion of zzso T zzso zzso no marked toxicity was found in the zzso zzso These observations may provide an alternative rational strategy for active cancer zzso
