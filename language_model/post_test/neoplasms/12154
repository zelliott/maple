To determine the feasibility of administration, safety, zzso zzso zzso maximum tolerated dose, and zzso of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the Mr 40,000 zzso cell zzso zzso zzso in patients with advanced zzso 

zzso was initially administered to patients as a zzso intravenous infusion every 3 zzso zzso and zzso data led to the evaluation of a weekly zzso The distribution of zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

Twenty-five patients received 82 courses of zzso zzso toxicity was initially observed at the zzso zzso and zzso dose zzso A patient zzso at zzso zzso developed acute zzso with severe abdominal pain, zzso and zzso A patient zzso at zzso zzso had an zzso zzso and zzso zzso to 502 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both patients made uncomplicated zzso No other zzso zzso were zzso Regardless of dose, the volume of distribution zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clearance decreased with increasing zzso To minimize toxicity and increase dose intensity, we then administered zzso zzso No significant toxicity was observed in 7 patients zzso at zzso zzso Studies of zzso zzso zzso showed zzso to zzso and prostate zzso A patient with zzso cancer had an zzso zzso in the levels of zzso zzso 

The recommended dose for zzso is zzso zzso by intravenous infusion zzso The absence of severe toxicity at this dose, low zzso and preliminary evidence of zzso tumor zzso and zzso efficacy support the further clinical development of this zzso to treat zzso zzso zzso
