The mature body weight of zzso zzso zzso male rats permitted to select their own diets throughout life was shown to correlate zzso with the frequency of spontaneous zzso In an analysis of the dietary practices of these animals, a zzso model was zzso which zzso and early zzso data only were zzso accounted for a large proportion of the zzso in mature zzso The level of food or calorie intake proved less zzso than the zzso the interactive effects of food intake relative to body weight, the proportion of protein and zzso constituents in the diet, the intake of each of these zzso and, particularly, the efficiency with which the diet consumed was used for growth during early zzso zzso In a prospective study of other rats maintained on a similar feeding regimen, the model was found to be an accurate predictor of mature zzso Several of the explanatory factors necessary for zzso of body weight also contributed to tumor zzso Nonetheless, both dietary and body zzso factors in a specific zzso sequence were required to explain variation in spontaneous tumor zzso
