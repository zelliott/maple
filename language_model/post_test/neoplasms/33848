DNA zzso generated by zzso chemicals reflects human exposure and DNA zzso are related to tumor zzso Most chemical zzso require zzso to zzso zzso that bind to zzso centers in proteins and zzso acids thereby forming zzso zzso Also, many of the chemicals considered zzso for humans form zzso DNA zzso zzso such DNA damage is generally considered to be zzso and linked to tumor zzso In this article we have summarized the work done for many years on the role of DNA zzso formation as an indicator of their zzso We have also addressed the important role for measurement of DNA zzso in studies with potential zzso agents for which it is central to have a marker that can be measured more rapidly than changes in cancer zzso
