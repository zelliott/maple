A link between common zzso fragile sites and frequent zzso deletions in cancer was observed two decades ago and led to the hypothesis that genes at fragile sites may play a role in tumor zzso In 1996, the human fragile zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified by zzso cloning of the zzso region spanning the zzso common fragile site, zzso at zzso Loss or zzso of the zzso gene in a large fraction of human tumors results in absence or reduction of zzso zzso In zzso analyses and in zzso zzso studies show that restoration of zzso protein zzso tumor suppression in 50% of tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso gene transfer to zzso mice not only prevents but reverses the zzso tumor development in zzso in accordance with the zzso properties of zzso zzso The strong zzso activity following zzso infection of cancer cells strengthens the case for further exploration of zzso gene therapy in cancer prevention and zzso
