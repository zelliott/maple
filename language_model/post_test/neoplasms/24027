To compare dose values specified at the reference point, as recommended by the International Commission on zzso Units and zzso zzso and the mean dose to the planning target volume, zzso 

zzso dose calculations were performed with a 3-D treatment planning system for 6 series of patients treated for zzso brain, breast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso All patients were arbitrarily chosen from a set of previously treated patients zzso with a two- or zzso technique using zzso zzso zzso wedge angles and beam weights were chosen to make the dose distribution as homogeneous as zzso 

The dose at the zzso reference point was generally higher than the mean dose to the zzso The difference between the zzso reference dose and the mean dose to the zzso for an individual patient was less than zzso in zzso of cases and less than zzso in zzso of the zzso The differences were larger in those patients where the dose distribution is significantly influenced by the presence of lungs or air zzso For each series of patients the mean difference between the zzso reference dose and the mean dose to the zzso was zzso The difference between these two values never exceeded zzso Because not all planning systems are able to calculate the mean dose to the zzso the concept of the mean central dose, the mean of the dose values at the zzso of the zzso in each CT zzso has been zzso The mean central dose was also calculated for the same patients and was closer to the mean dose to the zzso than the zzso reference zzso 

The mean dose to the zzso is well estimated by either the zzso reference dose or the mean central dose for a variety of treatment techniques for common types of zzso
