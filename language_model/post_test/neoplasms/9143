In order to clarify the optimal timing for peripheral blood stem cell zzso collection, zzso collection records of 323 children who were scheduled to undergo zzso stem cell transplantation from two study periods differing in the timing of zzso collection were zzso In the early study period (March 1998 to August 2007, zzso zzso collection was initiated when the peripheral zzso count exceeded zzso during recovery from zzso zzso in this study period indicated that initiation of zzso collection at a higher zzso count might result in a greater zzso cell zzso zzso during the late study period zzso 2007 to December 2012, zzso zzso collection was initiated when the zzso count exceeded zzso zzso in the late study period validated our conclusion from the early study zzso Collection of a higher number of zzso cells was associated with a faster zzso recovery after transplant in the late study zzso zzso of zzso collection at zzso count zzso zzso was an independent factor for a greater zzso cell zzso In conclusion, zzso collection at a higher zzso count is associated with a greater zzso cell yield, and consequently a faster zzso recovery after zzso
