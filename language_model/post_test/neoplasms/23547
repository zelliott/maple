zzso of circulating tumor cells zzso in zzso zzso is associated with poor zzso zzso and zzso of zzso may permit zzso treatment decisions, provided zzso are available for zzso Here, we investigate what is needed to detect zzso in all zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso zzso of blood together with survival from zzso patients with zzso breast, zzso and prostate cancer were used to predict the zzso concentration in the zzso of these patients in whom no zzso were found and to establish the relation of concentration of zzso with zzso zzso of different zzso definitions were investigated by automated cell recognition and a flow zzso zzso without an enrichment or zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso of the log of zzso yielded a good fit to the zzso frequency zzso zzso of the blood volume to 5 L predicted that zzso of patients had at least one zzso before therapy zzso Survival of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is reduced by zzso months for each zzso zzso zzso Using flow zzso the potential zzso recovery improvement is not sufficient to detect zzso in all patients in zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are present in all patients with zzso breast, zzso and zzso cancer and their frequency is zzso to zzso To serve as a liquid biopsy for the majority of patients, a substantial improvement of zzso yield is needed, which can only be achieved by a dramatic increase in sample zzso
