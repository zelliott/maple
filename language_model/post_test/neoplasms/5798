The influence of the shape of a region of interest zzso on the uncertainty in the sampled volume of the zzso is investigated for zzso with regular Cartesian zzso Both zzso defined volumes and clinically relevant zzso were zzso The sampling uncertainty is shown to depend on the zzso of the zzso and on effects of grid matching and zzso zzso In clinical zzso without zzso symmetry the estimate of the sampling uncertainty is improved up to a factor of zzso by taking the zzso of the zzso into zzso In a zzso zzso zzso effects were demonstrated by means of zzso zzso In this type of zzso zzso effects decrease as well as increase the sampling uncertainty up to a factor of zzso zzso symmetry is shown to cause a decrease in the sampling uncertainty convergence power from 2/3 for zzso zzso to 1/2 for zzso or 1/3 for zzso zzso For clinical zzso with zzso zzso similar decreases were zzso With the theory derived and these symmetry effects taken into account the experimental uncertainty of volume zzso can be estimated for most clinical zzso within a factor of zzso Special care should be taken in grid sampling of volumes inside zzso surfaces of zzso field zzso For the volume of a prostate an uncertainty level of zzso or zzso is obtained with less than zzso or 80 grid points, respectively, while for such an zzso surface up to 16,000 or 500 grid points are required for the same uncertainty zzso
