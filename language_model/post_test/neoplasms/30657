zzso zzso is significantly increased in tumors (10 to 100 zzso when compared to the amounts present in normal adjacent zzso To investigate if the changes in concentration of zzso zzso could be reflected in the urine of cancer patients we have analyzed the zzso zzso zzso by 44 patients with different types of tumors, 50 normal individuals and 15 patients with unrelated zzso 

The identification and structural analyses of the zzso zzso were made by zzso and degradation with specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of their zzso products by zzso zzso and zzso and chemical zzso 

The zzso products formed from zzso zzso of the 44 cancer patients by action of zzso ABC show a substantial relative increase of non zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with a relative decrease of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when compared to the zzso zzso of normal subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or from patients with unrelated zzso There is a direct correlation between the non zzso zzso content and the stage of zzso of the cancer zzso A significant change of the ratio of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a decrease in the zzso migration of zzso zzso were also observed in cancer zzso 

All the cancer patients analyzed so far have shown the structural anomaly of the urinary zzso zzso and this may be useful in the diagnosis and follow up of cancer zzso
