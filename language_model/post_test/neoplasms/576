The great variety in zzso properties of immune complexes occurring in human and animal disease states has made the detection of such complexes a difficult zzso zzso in immune complex size, zzso and interaction with zzso or cellular zzso systems, such as complement and zzso suggests different zzso zzso The introduction of zzso and the recently improved knowledge of the immune zzso interactions have lead to the description of a large number of detection procedures, which in turn has widened the zzso of diseases associated with immune zzso This widespread occurrence of soluble immune complexes has lead many investigators to think that such complexes may occur either as a transient zzso phenomenon, important for fast clearance of the zzso or as primary zzso factors triggering inflammatory zzso Among the 50 procedures for immune complex detection known today, the article will select some pertinent tests, which will be discussed with respect to their zzso sensitivity, and zzso Furthermore, it is well known that when applied to the study of a patient group with one particular immune complex disease, various tests will result in different percentages of patients having zzso This observation is due to differences in the underlying principle on which the various tests are zzso Thus immune complexes must be further characterized with respect to their size, to the zzso class or specificity involved and, most difficult, to the zzso specificity which zzso in the zzso Recent advances in such experimental characterization of immune complexes in zzso and in the clinical evaluation of patients with complement zzso associated to the presence of immune complexes will be zzso
