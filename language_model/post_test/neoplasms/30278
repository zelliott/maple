This analysis, carried out in the context of a wider zzso prospective study, tried to explore whether four World Health zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had different effectiveness when using several different outcomes and zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and pain centers in zzso 

Two hundred zzso cancer patients monitored over a zzso follow-up zzso zzso Not zzso 

The zzso efficacy was assessed using effectiveness zzso such as pain intensity, pain intensity difference zzso proportion of zzso zzso and zzso zzso subjects, percentage of switches and dose zzso 

Mean values of zzso led to differences among zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were more frequent in zzso groups than in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The percentage of switches resulted three times more frequent when using zzso than zzso zzso vs zzso An increase of dose zzso zzso a day was observed in zzso of zzso patients vs zzso of zzso As a whole, zzso show some different behaviors on the basis of the considered zzso 

The observed results, even if the small sample size and the nature itself of the study do not allow a definitive evaluation of the effectiveness of the drugs, underline a degree of zzso among zzso and address toward a correct planning of a comparative zzso clinical trial that is now zzso in zzso For this reason, a zzso effectiveness zzso controlled trial is zzso
