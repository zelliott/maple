A liquid zzso mass zzso zzso zzso for the quantitative analysis of the novel zzso drug zzso and the screening of six potential zzso in human plasma has been developed and validated to support a phase I study with the zzso zzso is an inhibitor of zzso zzso which are associated with tumor growth and development of zzso Plasma samples were prepared for analysis using a simple zzso extraction method on zzso zzso zzso separation was performed on a zzso extend zzso column zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso particle zzso using a mobile phase of zzso 10 zzso ammonium hydroxide zzso zzso pumped at a zzso of zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso mass zzso was used for specific and sensitive zzso The best zzso speed zzso run time 8 zzso and peak shapes were obtained by employing an alkaline mobile phase zzso in zzso phase approximately zzso Furthermore, an alkaline zzso was favored in order to obtain a better overall sensitivity for the zzso zzso The dynamic range was from 10 to 1000 zzso zzso from 500 zzso of plasma for zzso and the zzso were detected at levels of the same order of zzso zzso zzso for zzso at five concentration levels were between zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were always zzso zzso stability was not critical during either storage or zzso This method was successfully applied in a phase I clinical study of zzso The active drug, zzso and all of the zzso included in the zzso could be identified in plasma from zzso zzso We believe that the method described in this paper using an alkaline mobile phase in combination with a basic stable zzso column may also be generally useful for the zzso of other basic zzso
