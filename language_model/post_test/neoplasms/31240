zzso blood zzso cells zzso harvested for zzso transplantation are usually zzso within 2-4 h of zzso However, there are conditions in which it would be useful to freeze zzso after a liquid storage zzso This study was performed to evaluate whether prior storage for just 24 h damages frozen zzso First, zzso products were obtained from 9 patients and divided into three zzso The first fraction was frozen within 2 h and used as a zzso The second and the third zzso were stored either at 4 degrees C or at 22 degrees C for 24 h before zzso Cell counts, zzso values, and pH were studied after collection, after storage, and after zzso Similar results were obtained at 4 degrees C and 22 degrees zzso However, pH decreased most markedly at 22 degrees zzso Mean zzso zzso zzso were not significantly different and were, respectively, zzso zzso zzso (4 degrees zzso and zzso zzso degrees zzso These observations were confirmed in an additional study of frozen zzso collected from 12 patients and previously stored for 24 h at 4 degrees zzso These data indicate that blood zzso may be stored for 24 h and subsequently frozen without quantitative and qualitative zzso
