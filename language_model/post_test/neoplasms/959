The field of zzso is rapidly expanding with the development of novel zzso that have potential for zzso medical zzso The rapid pace of expansion in this field has exceeded the pace of pharmacological and zzso research on the effects of zzso in the biological zzso The development of zzso zzso known as quantum dots, show great promise for treatment and diagnosis of cancer and targeted drug delivery, due to their zzso zzso and ease of zzso for tissue zzso However, information on pharmacology and zzso of quantum dots needs much further development, making it difficult to assess the risks associated with this new zzso Further, zzso poses yet another risk for toxic cadmium, which will now enter the biological realm in zzso In this review, we discuss zzso quantum dots and their zzso properties at the zzso We zzso the existing work on pharmacology and zzso of zzso quantum dots and discuss perspectives in their utility in disease zzso Finally, we identify critical gaps in our knowledge of cadmium quantum dot zzso and how these gaps need to be assessed to enable quantum dot zzso to transit safely from bench to zzso
