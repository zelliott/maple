A zzso zzso zzso model was used to estimate tumor zzso in nude mice with a grafted zzso The zzso of a rapid clearance blood pool agent, zzso were investigated by dynamic zzso after zzso zzso Signal enhancements were recorded in zzso blood and in tumor zzso To analyze these data, we developed a zzso mathematical model of the agent's zzso using zzso zzso The model included six zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso into zzso and zzso and the rest of the body (also split into zzso and zzso As an application, changes in tumor zzso parameters were evaluated in mice receiving either an zzso treatment zzso or a zzso The analysis was performed in a zzso zzso and the model was fitted to experimental data using zzso zzso zzso Carlo zzso zzso showed a significant difference in tumor zzso between the two groups of mice when the zzso parameters are considered zzso This zzso zzso model enables to analyze jointly data in tumor tissue and in zzso zzso This leads to accurate estimates of zzso parameters and the evaluation of their zzso
