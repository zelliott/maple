Advances in laboratory sciences offer much in the challenge to unravel the complex zzso of cancer and to therefore provide an zzso for zzso One area where improved zzso are particularly important to epidemiology is exposure zzso this requirement has been highlighted through the concept of the zzso In addition, the ability to observe genetic and zzso zzso in individuals exposed to putative risk factors also zzso an opportunity to zzso underlying mechanisms of zzso which in turn may allow earlier detection and more refined molecular zzso of zzso In this context the application of zzso technologies to large zzso studies and their associated zzso raise exciting new avenues of zzso This review considers the areas of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the evidence to date that people exposed to zzso factors (for example, zzso diet, occupational zzso environmental zzso have specific zzso zzso Although in their early stages of development these approaches show promising evidence of distinct zzso biological effects and indicate molecular pathways that may be particularly relevant to the zzso process subsequent to environmental and lifestyle zzso Such an interdisciplinary approach is vital if the full benefits of advances in laboratory sciences and investments in large-scale prospective cohort studies are to be realized in relation to cancer zzso
