In this study we aimed to identify zzso where there is a consistent sex disparity, with the goal of identifying unexplained sex disparities that may offer promising opportunities for zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso data from Cancer zzso in Five zzso provided by the International Agency for Research on zzso were used to calculate zzso rate ratios for 35 cancer sites, comparing men to women, adjusting for attained age, gross domestic product zzso and geographical zzso zzso zzso and breast cancer were zzso The consistency of relative risks was examined by zzso and geographical region and, in a subset of longstanding cancer zzso by calendar zzso For each cancer site, the sex disparity was broadly classified as zzso explained by established environmental risk factors, partly explained, or zzso Cancer zzso was statistically significantly higher in men than women at 32 of 35 sites, with disparities zzso for 15 sites and zzso for 5 zzso For nearly all sites, the sex disparity was consistent across zzso groups and geographical zzso However, the zzso rate ratios varied considerably by age at zzso The sex disparity for 13 cancer sites was considered to be entirely unexplained by known risk zzso these sites showed zzso little variation in the zzso rate ratios over zzso Thus, the basis of many of the largest sex disparities in cancer zzso seems mostly unknown, highlighting the need for intensified research into its zzso
