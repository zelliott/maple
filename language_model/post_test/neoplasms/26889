zzso capture therapy zzso is a promising zzso cancer therapy approach and some recent zzso research has focused on using compounds containing zzso as an alternative to currently used zzso considering several advantages that zzso offers compared to those of zzso In this study, we evaluated zzso zzso compound as zzso capture therapy agent by in zzso experiment on zzso zzso zzso zzso compound were injected zzso via tail vein and allowed to accumulate into tumor zzso zzso samples were taken for quantitative analysis by zzso at 2, 12, and 24 h after zzso compound zzso zzso zzso concentration was observed at about 2 h after zzso compound injection with an average of zzso zzso of wet tumor zzso We performed zzso zzso at zzso reactor facility of Japan Atomic Energy Research Institute in zzso with average zzso zzso of zzso zzso The experimental results showed that the tumor growth suppression of zzso zzso group was revealed until about four times higher compared to the control group, and no significant weight loss were observed after treatment suggesting low systemic toxicity of this zzso The zzso zzso will become one of the candidates for zzso delivery system on zzso
