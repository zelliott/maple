Response to treatment with zzso drugs is subject to wide zzso zzso This zzso is expressed not only as differences in severity and type of zzso but also as differences in zzso zzso in the constitution of genes involved in the zzso and zzso pathways of zzso drugs has been shown to possibly translate into differences in treatment zzso The overall knowledge in the field of zzso has tremendously increased over the last couple of years, and has thereby provided opportunities for zzso zzso zzso In previous parts of this series, we described zzso zzso in zzso phase I and phase II drug metabolism and drug zzso This fourth part of a zzso series of reviews is focused on zzso zzso and encompasses genetic variation in drug target genes such as those zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, genetic zzso in other zzso candidate genes involved in response to zzso drugs is discussed, including genes involved in DNA repair such as those zzso zzso repair zzso group 1 and group 2, zzso zzso group 1 and group 3, and breast cancer genes 1 and zzso Finally, zzso zzso in zzso and the gene zzso zzso growth factor zzso zzso and implications for zzso drugs are zzso Potential implications and opportunities for patient and drug selection for zzso zzso therapy are zzso
