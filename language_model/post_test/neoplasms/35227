Human zzso cell function is regulated by zzso distributed zzso receptors termed zzso cell zzso zzso zzso that recognize zzso zzso zzso shared by zzso and zzso class I zzso groups and every functional zzso cell in the repertoire expresses at least one zzso for self zzso I zzso zzso when zzso cells are confronted with zzso targets which do not express the zzso class I zzso zzso cell zzso may zzso zzso versus recipient zzso zzso occur in full zzso zzso zzso zzso transplants that are zzso zzso mismatched in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of functional zzso cells in the donor repertoire expressing a zzso for the zzso class I group which is absent in the recipient as their sole zzso zzso for self, sense the missing expression of the self class I zzso on zzso targets and mediate zzso zzso zzso zzso In clinical trials, donor versus recipient zzso zzso are highly beneficial as they reduce the risk of leukemia zzso do not cause zzso and markedly improve zzso zzso
