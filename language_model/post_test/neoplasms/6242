Good zzso for early detection of cancer lead to better zzso However, harvesting tumor tissue is invasive and cannot be routinely zzso Global DNA zzso of peripheral blood zzso DNA was evaluated as a zzso for cancer zzso 

We performed a zzso to estimate overall cancer risk according to global DNA zzso levels among studies with various cancer types and zzso methods used to measure DNA zzso Studies were zzso searched via zzso with no language limitation up to July zzso zzso estimates were calculated using a fixed effects zzso 

The zzso analyses by experimental methods to determine DNA zzso level were performed due to zzso within the selected studies zzso zzso zzso zzso was not found in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso used same target sequence zzso zzso zzso whereas considerable zzso remained in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer studies zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that experimental methods used to zzso global DNA zzso levels are important factors in the association study between zzso levels and cancer zzso Overall, cancer risks of the group with the lowest DNA zzso levels were significantly higher compared to the group with the highest zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Global DNA zzso in peripheral blood zzso may be a suitable zzso for cancer zzso However, the association between global DNA zzso and cancer risk may be different based on experimental methods, and region of DNA targeted for measuring global zzso levels as well as the cancer zzso zzso it is important to select a precise and accurate surrogate marker for global DNA zzso levels in the association studies between global DNA zzso levels in peripheral zzso and cancer zzso
