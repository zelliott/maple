To describe the development and validation of a scale for assessing openness to discuss cancer in the zzso 

Two studies were zzso Study 1 was a zzso study designed to test the factor structure of the zzso Four hundred zzso patients with either breast cancer or Hodgkin's disease were zzso In Study 2, a zzso study, 133 patients with cancer in the head and neck were tested at four points in time: just before treatment, 6 weeks, 13 weeks and 52 weeks after zzso Study 2 aimed to confirm the factor structure established in Study 1, to test for construct zzso in a new population, to test the zzso properties of the zzso zzso and to test the zzso sensitivity to zzso 

In Study 1, a zzso solution was revealed, resulting in a scale of eight zzso In Study 2, the factor structure found in Study 1 was zzso In line with theoretical expectations, subjects who perceived their communication about cancer as more open showed more positive rehabilitation outcomes especially at 13 weeks after treatment (less uncertainty, fewer negative feelings, more control, higher self-esteem, fewer psychological and physical zzso Furthermore, more open communication related with more support by family members and more discussion with the zzso The scale was found to be stable over zzso 

The zzso construction and subsequent analysis show that open discussion of problems zzso to zzso in the family can be measured reliably with an zzso zzso Additional validation of the scale is zzso
