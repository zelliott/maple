Aging of the zzso system causes zzso reduced zzso and increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso stem cells zzso play a crucial role in this process as their functions decline during zzso zzso are a family of protein zzso zzso zzso that have diverse roles in regulating zzso zzso stability, cell zzso and survival, and have been implicated in zzso aging and zzso Here we provide an updated overview of zzso in aging research; particularly, how increased activity of zzso zzso or zzso improves several aging zzso and may possibly increase lifespan in zzso We review the literature on how zzso may play a role in zzso aging and zzso zzso and how key signaling pathways of zzso may be affected by zzso Among them, zzso plays a critical role in chronic zzso zzso an zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso stem cells to zzso zzso inhibitor treatment and blocks acquisition of resistant zzso zzso zzso understanding of zzso in zzso aging and zzso may help design novel strategies to deter zzso aging and improve treatment of zzso zzso
