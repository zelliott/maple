zzso signaling networks are orchestrated and fine-tuned through multiple interactions of zzso factors with zzso of zzso thereby assembling zzso complexes to zzso or positively balance zzso zzso These mechanisms account for the large diversity of target genes but also for time and tissue specific gene regulations through single zzso factors such as zzso One family of zzso zzso that has attracted much attention is represented by the zzso zzso factors zzso zzso themselves are controlled through interactions with a growing number of zzso and zzso zzso We recently identified zzso zzso of cancer cell zzso which can associate with zzso zzso to zzso invasive cancer cell migration through regulation of zzso expression and zzso However, zzso is likely to have additional functions depending on the tissue environment and signaling zzso Interestingly, zzso not only zzso zzso but can also regulate the activities of other zzso such as zzso or the zzso zzso fusion zzso Thus, zzso may act in very different conditions such as during cancer zzso development or cell zzso
