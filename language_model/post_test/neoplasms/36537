The zzso zzso level of patients during radiation therapy is associated with both survival and local tumor control in several organ zzso This clinical trial tested whether administering zzso human zzso zzso to cancer patients would increase their zzso level during the course of radiation therapy without adverse zzso 

The 40 participating patients had a zzso value zzso zzso zzso and a zzso tumor located above the zzso without evidence of distant zzso for which they were scheduled to undergo a 5-8 week course of daily radiation zzso All 40 patients were given oral zzso zzso throughout their radiation therapy zzso Half the patients also received zzso zzso of zzso zzso three times per week starting zzso days prior to the first dose of zzso 

The zzso and control groups did not differ significantly in patient age, zzso tumor type, initial zzso erythropoietin, or iron zzso The zzso level increased more than zzso during radiation therapy in all 20 of the zzso patients but in only zzso of the control patients zzso zzso zzso The zzso rose from a mean zzso standard zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 14 zzso during radiation therapy in zzso of the zzso group compared to in zzso of the control group zzso zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso change in zzso concentration during radiation therapy was 27 zzso zzso (an average rise of zzso per week) in the zzso group and 0 zzso zzso in the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso had no significant measurable effect on blood pressure, white blood cell, zzso or zzso count, or liver or zzso zzso The only reported adverse effect of zzso administration was an zzso skin rash in one zzso 

zzso with zzso zzso significantly increased the zzso level in cancer patients without interfering with their course of radiation therapy, whereas zzso zzso alone did zzso zzso appears to be a safe and effective means of increasing red cell mass during radiation zzso
