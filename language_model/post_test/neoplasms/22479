DNA zzso breaks zzso are the most deleterious zzso inflicted by zzso zzso Although zzso are potentially zzso it is not clear whether complex zzso that are zzso to repair are more zzso zzso compared with simple breaks that can be rapidly zzso correctly or incorrectly, by zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that complex zzso induced by zzso energy transfer zzso zzso zzso are repaired slowly and zzso whereas those induced by zzso gamma rays are repaired efficiently by zzso zzso To determine whether zzso zzso are more zzso zzso than gamma zzso breaks, we zzso zzso zzso zzso that were deficient in zzso and zzso tumor zzso and injected the surviving cells zzso into nude zzso Using this model system, we find that zzso zzso are zzso zzso generating tumors with significantly higher frequency and shorter zzso compared with tumors generated by gamma zzso zzso formation by zzso cells is accompanied by rampant zzso instability and multiple zzso changes, the most interesting of which is loss of the zzso tumor zzso due to deletion of a zzso region harboring the zzso and zzso zzso The additional loss of zzso in tumors derived from cells that are already deficient in zzso bolsters the hypothesis that zzso plays an important role in tumor suppression, especially in the absence of zzso Indeed, we find that zzso of zzso in zzso cells significantly zzso the zzso potential of these cells, indicating that zzso loss may be a critical event in zzso triggered by complex zzso
