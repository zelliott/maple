Childhood cancer survivors zzso are more insulin resistant and have higher levels of several cardiovascular risk factors even while still zzso This study examines specific treatment zzso associated with cardiovascular risk factors and insulin zzso 

zzso of ages 9 to 18 years at study entry and in zzso 5 years or more from diagnosis zzso zzso zzso and 208 sibling controls were recruited into this zzso study that included zzso assessment of insulin resistance zzso zzso zzso and assessment of cardiovascular risk zzso zzso and zzso tree modeling were used to ascertain treatment combinations associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular zzso 

Mean current age of zzso was zzso years and zzso were male zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso included leukemia zzso brain tumors zzso solid tumors zzso or zzso zzso Among zzso analysis of individual chemotherapy agents failed to find associations with cardiovascular risk factors or insulin zzso Compared with siblings, insulin resistance was significantly higher in zzso who received platinum plus zzso zzso zzso zzso brain zzso and in those who received steroids but no platinum zzso zzso zzso resistance did not differ between zzso who received surgery alone versus zzso Within zzso comparisons failed to zzso treatment combinations that increased insulin resistance compared with those who received surgery zzso 

Exposure to zzso zzso or steroids is associated with insulin resistance and cardiovascular risk factors and should be taken into consideration in the development of screening recommendations for cardiovascular zzso 

Earlier identification of zzso who may benefit from targeted prevention efforts may reduce their future risk of cardiovascular zzso
