It is estimated that in the Netherlands cancer zzso could be reduced by zzso zzso cases annually, best zzso ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso deaths could be reduced by zzso zzso deaths annually, best zzso ranging from zzso to zzso Evidence is most abundant for gastrointestinal zzso followed by zzso zzso but limited for other sites and zzso 

zzso consumption of fruits and vegetables carries a large public health zzso zzso trials and biological mechanisms should eventually provide scientific proof of their zzso The available evidence is sufficient to justify public health education and promotion aimed at a substantial increase in the consumption of fruits and zzso
