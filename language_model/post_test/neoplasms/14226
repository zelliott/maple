Quality of Life zzso Core 30 zzso and zzso Assessment of Cancer zzso zzso are widely used zzso zzso quality of life zzso zzso We aimed to compare their responsiveness with clinically important effects and statistical efficiency to detect such zzso 

Secondary analysis of zzso and zzso data from a zzso controlled trial of Medical zzso zzso zzso 162 zzso cancer zzso zzso in responsiveness zzso and relative efficiency zzso were calculated for five zzso 

zzso total score was more efficient than zzso global scale for detecting change within the intervention arm zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and comparing change between trial arms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the social domain, the zzso scale was more responsive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and more efficient within arm only zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the physical, zzso and emotional zzso neither questionnaire was more responsive or zzso 

zzso would require about one-third the sample of zzso to detect a given change in overall zzso whereas in the social domain, it would require five times the sample zzso zzso won advantage in overall zzso by reduced zzso (smaller standard zzso achieved by summing across 27 zzso whereas zzso won advantage in the social domain via a larger zzso zzso through zzso item zzso
