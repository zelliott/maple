The effective zzso diffusion of zzso along zzso and permeable zzso has been studied considering the contribution of molecular and zzso diffusion based on the Taylor's theory of zzso zzso The problem is of importance in the transport of zzso used for the zzso delivery of drugs and contrast zzso It has been shown that for a given zzso size and zzso conditions a critical radius zzso exists for which the effective zzso diffusion along the zzso has a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso diffuse mainly by zzso diffusion whereas zzso with a zzso zzso diffuse mainly by zzso and the effective diffusion zzso grows with zzso In permeable zzso the effective diffusion reduces significantly compared to normal zzso vessels and it has been derived that zzso grows almost zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of blood zzso It has been shown that the blood zzso with the largest effective zzso zzso could be zzso targeted by the circulating zzso Based on these findings, the following strategies are proposed to increase the number of zzso targeting the tumor zzso zzso The use of zzso with a critical radius for normal vessels, zzso the injecting of zzso of zzso with different zzso and zzso the zzso of the tumor zzso Finally, it has been emphasized that the size of the zzso should be selected depending on the body district where the zzso mass is developing and on the type, zzso and state of the zzso
