The zzso gene encodes zzso a widely expressed zzso protein zzso zzso functioning as a signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso cause Noonan syndrome zzso a zzso disorder characterized by an increased risk of zzso Recently, a novel class of zzso zzso in zzso has been documented as a zzso event in a zzso group of zzso Because of the relatively higher prevalence of certain solid tumors in children with zzso and the positive zzso function of zzso in zzso zzso a wider role for zzso zzso zzso in cancer has been zzso Here, we screened a number of solid tumors, including those documented in zzso or in which zzso zzso signaling occurs at significant frequency, for zzso zzso No zzso zzso was identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso 50), zzso zzso zzso zzso and colon zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso change, promoting an increased zzso zzso activity of zzso was observed in one zzso zzso Our data document that zzso zzso function does not represent a major molecular event in pediatric and adult tumors, further supporting our previous evidence indicating that the zzso role of zzso zzso is zzso zzso
