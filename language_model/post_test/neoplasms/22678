zzso zzso is an important zzso regulator in embryonic stem zzso cells, zzso cell zzso and zzso Here, we identify a zzso regulatory network in zzso cells by combining zzso and zzso interaction studies and show that zzso interacts with the zzso complex, a regulator of zzso cell zzso In combination with regulatory network information, we define three zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso and show that the zzso are functionally zzso illustrating that the overall zzso cell zzso program is composed of distinct zzso With these zzso as an zzso zzso we have zzso the hypothesis linking an zzso cell signature with cancer or cancer stem zzso We find that the zzso zzso independent of the Core zzso is active in various zzso and predicts cancer zzso The apparent similarity of cancer and zzso cell signatures zzso in large part, the pervasive nature of zzso regulatory zzso
