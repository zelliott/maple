zzso expression systems have been zzso successfully for the production of various zzso zzso In particular, myeloma cell lines have been exploited to express a variety of different zzso for diagnostic applications as well as in the treatment of various human zzso The use of myeloma cells for zzso production is advantageous because they are professional zzso cells and are able to make proper zzso zzso Proper zzso has been shown to be important for zzso zzso Advances in genetic engineering and molecular biology techniques have made it possible to isolate zzso and human variable regions of almost any desired zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced in myeloma cells have been extremely helpful in zzso the zzso acid zzso and structural motifs that contribute to zzso zzso Because of their domain nature, zzso genes can be easily manipulated to produce zzso or humanized zzso These zzso are less zzso in humans and also retain their specificity for zzso and zzso zzso In addition, novel proteins in which zzso are fused to zzso sequences as well as zzso zzso have been produced in myeloma zzso
