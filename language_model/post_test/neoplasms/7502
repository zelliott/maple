On the basis of the previous study, on the cell interaction between zzso tumor cells and other cells, especially with zzso the present study was carried out by investigating cell to cell interaction of human zzso tumor cells and human zzso cells such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso As a result it has been revealed that live zzso cells were not zzso on the cell surface of the tumor cells, nor is it zzso by tumor cells, but in zzso of zzso zzso zzso 2,000 zzso zzso it zzso slightly on the cell surface of tumor cell but no cell fusion of tumor cells and zzso cells is zzso On the other hand, the tumor cell as well as zzso and zzso all have receptors to zzso A zzso zzso on their cell surfaces, and they show a marked cell binding such as tumor cell and zzso tumor cell and zzso and there can be observed a marked zzso of zzso cells by tumor zzso Moreover, the tumor cells that have zzso zzso cells undergo a marked cell destruction within 4 hours of zzso and zzso which is especially prominent in the case of zzso of zzso cell by tumor zzso
