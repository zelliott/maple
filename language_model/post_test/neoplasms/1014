We investigate the zzso zzso of cancer zzso zzso In contrast to zzso of two cancer types from gene expression data, zzso zzso of more than two cancer types are relatively hard and less studied zzso We used zzso zzso genes with corresponding zzso support zzso machine zzso zzso to maximize the zzso of selected zzso Final prediction was made by using probability scores from all zzso We used three different methods of zzso probability from decision zzso Among the three probability methods, zzso approach was more consistent, zzso zzso approach performed better for zzso with unequal proportion of samples in different zzso zzso based decision does not only gives true and fair comparison between different zzso zzso zzso but also gives the possibility of using them for any post zzso Several ensemble experiments, an example of post analysis, of the three probability methods were implemented to study their effect in improving the zzso zzso We observe that ensemble did help in improving the zzso accuracy of cancer data sets especially involving unbalanced zzso zzso external zzso zzso experiment was performed on the six zzso cancer zzso to obtain unbiased estimates of prediction zzso Analysis of zzso frequently selected genes on two cancer zzso demonstrated that the approach was able to select important and relevant genes consistent to zzso This study demonstrates successful zzso of the framework of zzso feature selection and zzso zzso for prediction of cancer zzso on six zzso
