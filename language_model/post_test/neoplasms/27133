Imaging mouse models of cancer with reporter zzso has become a relatively common experimental approach in the laboratory, which allows zzso and zzso investigation of diverse aspects of tumor biology in zzso Our goal here is to outline briefly the principles of the relevant imaging zzso emphasizing particularly their strengths and weaknesses and what the researcher can expect in a practical sense from each of these zzso Furthermore, we discuss how relatively subtle modifications in the way reporter zzso expression is regulated in the cell zzso the ability of reporter zzso as a whole to provide zzso on such varied aspects of tumor biology in zzso
