zzso is an agent with impressive clinical activity but a rather poor profile of toxicity when given every three zzso zzso zzso of its clinical use is highly zzso This is a zzso study of weekly zzso particularly focused on the feasibility of long-term administration and zzso of cumulative zzso 

Twenty-six patients (11 zzso male, median age 56, range zzso were treated over the range of zzso zzso zzso toxicity for this schedule was defined as any grade zzso 2 zzso toxic effect resulting in a zzso zzso delay for zzso of the drug, or any grade zzso 2 zzso zzso Patients were monitored clinically and zzso for zzso No prolonged zzso zzso or zzso zzso growth factors were zzso 

A zzso number of zzso consecutive weekly courses were given per zzso The maximum tolerated dose that prevented zzso administration of the drug was 50 zzso The main cumulative zzso were a mild fluid retention and zzso which became evident as the number of treatment courses zzso Grade 2 zzso and fatigue were observed only at 45 zzso and zzso zzso was seen at all of the dose levels zzso 

zzso weekly administration of zzso is feasible at doses up to 45 zzso with acceptable zzso Further clinical evaluation is justified at this schedule and 40 zzso of zzso is proposed for phase II studies as an active dose with minimal zzso
