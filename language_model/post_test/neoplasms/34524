The zzso zzso zzso factor, in particular the zzso proteins play critical roles in the regulation of cell proliferation and tumor zzso To study the potential clinical relevance of interfering with zzso zzso we generated zzso expressing short hairpin zzso Reduction of zzso levels causes increased proliferation and zzso in zzso zzso zzso whereas in zzso knockout cells zzso cell cycle arrest and zzso are zzso Using zzso zzso cancer cells the combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso leads to cell cycle arrest and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the combined treatment extends survival of mice zzso with the tumor zzso These results indicate that in the absence of zzso zzso can act as a tumor promoter and zzso of both, zzso and zzso could provide a valuable strategy for zzso zzso
