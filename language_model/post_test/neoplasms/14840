Thirty-nine studies from the Asia Pacific zzso Studies zzso database were zzso We used Cox zzso hazard zzso models to estimate the associations between height and zzso zzso 

A total of zzso participants with zzso deaths were zzso zzso men, inverse linear associations were observed between height and coronary heart disease zzso stroke, zzso injury and total zzso The hazard ratios zzso confidence zzso zzso for a zzso zzso 6 zzso zzso in height ranged from zzso zzso for injury to zzso zzso for total zzso Similar trends were found between height and zzso zzso stroke and zzso in zzso A positive linear association was observed between height and cancer zzso For each standard zzso greater zzso the risk of cancer was increased by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in men and women, zzso No regional difference was observed between Asian and zzso zzso zzso for markers of education did not alter the zzso 

The opposing relationships of height with zzso and cancer suggest that care is required in setting national policies on childhood nutrition lest they have unintended consequences on the zzso of major zzso zzso
