zzso is used to treat approximately zzso of solid tumors in the zzso The relative zzso of these tumors can have a significant impact upon local zzso One factor that has been shown to contribute to the increased survival of tumor cells is the zzso of signaling pathways in which zzso products play a central zzso The Ras zzso family, comprised of zzso zzso and zzso are frequently activated by zzso in certain tumors such as pancreatic and zzso cell lung zzso and are activated by zzso zzso zzso activity in an even wider range of tumor zzso The role of zzso zzso and more recently Ras signaling has been an area of intense study in both zzso and tumor biology in zzso In this review, we focus on findings from our lab and others that led to the current hypotheses relating to the role of Ras signaling in tumor radiation survival and the strategies used to block Ras zzso We will also point out new means of studying the contribution of Ras and Ras zzso components that could contribute to defining new targets for zzso in the context of radiation zzso
