zzso zzso of zzso islands within the promoter regions of tumor zzso or zzso genes is a common mechanism leading to the zzso of gene zzso To determine whether zzso zzso is a contributing factor to zzso zzso of zzso zzso in liver zzso a candidate tumor zzso zzso we examined its zzso status in twelve zzso zzso breast, zzso and prostate tumor cell lines with low or zzso expression of zzso By Southern zzso analysis of DNA zzso with the zzso sensitive zzso zzso we found a different degree of promoter zzso in all cell lines with zzso zzso zzso The zzso status was reversed by the addition of zzso a zzso agent, in one human zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso is responsible for zzso the function of the zzso gene in a subset of liver, breast, zzso and prostate zzso
