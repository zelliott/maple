Advances in zzso are enabling integration of various zzso to reveal the complexities underneath zzso zzso signaling pathways are zzso and evolve zzso and temporally depending on the tumor zzso This finding shifts the focus of cancer research from zzso zzso target and zzso to zzso zzso zzso targets and zzso zzso and zzso new challenges on the imaging community in terms of imaging targets, scales and information zzso In current clinical settings, most imaging zzso assess cancer risk through zzso in zzso function, zzso zzso or limited molecular zzso Few zzso imaging zzso are capable of detecting aberrations in signaling pathways at the level of tissue zzso An exception to this is zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso which is capable of imaging the molecular signatures of special zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can identify multiple zzso including zzso and products simultaneously to allow extraction of critical parameters such as flux zzso for multiple zzso zzso Meanwhile, recent progress in cancer metabolism research affirms that zzso zzso are directly controlled by signaling zzso Thus, in zzso assessment of aberrations occurring in signaling pathways becomes feasible through zzso zzso zzso This report briefly reviews the connections between signaling pathways and cancer zzso zzso the current status of zzso zzso zzso in assessing signal zzso and recent advances in zzso zzso zzso zzso Integrated with cancer zzso and animal models, zzso zzso zzso may hold high promise in exploring important issues in cancer that are linked to functionality of signaling zzso Examples include zzso therapy, zzso zzso and drug zzso
