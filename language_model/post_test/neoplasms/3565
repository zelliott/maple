zzso outcomes such as length of stay and charges are used to compare the quality of care across institutions and among individual zzso Clinical variables representing disease severity may explain some of the zzso in these zzso 

To determine the extent to which readily available clinical data can explain the zzso in length of stay and charges for children with cancer admitted to the hospital for fever and zzso and to assess the appropriateness of using a zzso electronic zzso strategy for the development of administrative outcome zzso 

A retrospective cohort of 157 fever and zzso encounters in a single institution during 11 months in 1997 was identified using a largely automated zzso strategy followed by independent, blinded review of the selected discharge zzso Models of admission variables predicting log length of stay and log charges were developed using multiple linear zzso The zzso technique of zzso adjusted for zzso zzso was used in calculating each zzso predicted length of stay and zzso zzso values were zzso There were two secondary zzso In one, the result of admission blood culture was entered as a potential zzso In the second, to evaluate the appropriateness of basing models on automated zzso without discharge summary review, the authors zzso the models using all of the encounters zzso zzso zzso identified by the algorithm, which had included three zzso zzso 

Mean length of stay was zzso zzso Mean charges were zzso Absolute zzso count at admission was a zzso independent negative predictor of length of stay and zzso zzso cancer diagnosis also was zzso zzso were highest for acute zzso zzso followed by central nervous system tumors, other solid tumors, and acute zzso leukemia and zzso zzso of stay was highest for acute zzso zzso followed by central nervous system tumors, acute zzso leukemia and zzso and other solid zzso Absolute zzso count and tumor type were the major components of the model, but admission temperature (for both administrative zzso and the presence of localized infection (for length of zzso also were significant zzso zzso values were zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso with validation zzso values of zzso and zzso zzso Entering zzso as a zzso improved the zzso zzso of the three zzso cases generated models with only a modest loss of zzso it introduced zzso zzso of some of the less significant zzso but did not disrupt the ability to identify the major zzso absolute zzso count and tumor zzso 

The clinical variables that were significant in this study account, in validation zzso estimates, for more than zzso of the zzso in administrative outcomes for encounters of fever and zzso zzso length of stay and charges for these clinical variables would allow for a fairer comparison of institutions and individual zzso The electronic zzso zzso served as an efficient way to identify absolute zzso count and tumor type as the major zzso and provided a conservative estimate of zzso
