zzso of the sodium zzso zzso zzso gene in tumor cells may provide a novel mechanism for treating zzso The zzso mediates the normal zzso transport of zzso across the zzso cell zzso This mechanism of zzso zzso has been used to both diagnose and treat zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso is largely limited to the zzso therefore, expression of the zzso gene in cancer cells would allow for specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In this study, we directly compared the human and rat zzso zzso for their ability to concentrate zzso into human and zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso in multiple cell lines was demonstrated following zzso with zzso zzso expressing either the human or zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso was consistently higher with the zzso zzso up to zzso greater, when compared to the human zzso even within a variety of human tumor cell zzso This zzso zzso allowed for cell killing following zzso treatment in zzso cells when zzso by in zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso gene provides superior zzso zzso ability, and may be preferable for use in designing zzso gene therapy zzso
