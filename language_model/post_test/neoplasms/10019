Four zzso rat zzso zzso clones were examined for their survival response to heating under conditions that induced transient zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the subcutaneous locally growing zzso whereas clones zzso and zzso were derived from spontaneous lung zzso There was zzso among these clones in zzso induced by either zzso 45 degrees C or continuous 42 degrees C heating, but the order of sensitivity was not necessarily the zzso The clones developed zzso resistance at different rates and to different degrees within the same time zzso There was zzso between clones isolated from within either the primary site or zzso zzso However, clones derived from zzso zzso did not zzso acquire more or less zzso to zzso 45 degrees C or continuous 42 degrees C heating than did clones from the primary zzso Further, there was no apparent relationship between any zzso properties that zzso more or less zzso in zzso and any zzso properties that zzso enhanced zzso success of these same clones by spontaneous zzso or experimental zzso routes in zzso These tumor clones also differ in their zzso zzso potential, cell surface features, sensitivity to zzso and drugs, and ability to repair zzso radiation zzso These results provide further zzso to the concept that inherent zzso within tumors may be as important in therapeutic success as other known zzso of outcome such as site and treatment zzso
