zzso heating of zzso zzso embedded tissue sections in zzso buffer zzso has been shown recently to enhance the zzso of a number of zzso zzso To assess the practical utility of this technique in diagnostic zzso we evaluated the effect of zzso on the zzso of routinely processed tissue from the surgical pathology laboratory with 30 commonly applied, commercially available zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso tissue sections from a variety of normal and zzso zzso expected to contain the target zzso were zzso in parallel following both the routine laboratory zzso including zzso zzso if zzso and zzso heating for 10 zzso at maximum output in 10 zzso zzso buffer without zzso zzso were scored for intensity zzso to zzso and extent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso 1/3 to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and combined zzso scores zzso + zzso were zzso zzso zzso compared to the routine protocol was observed with zzso for all 30 zzso zzso The percentage of cases improved ranged from 38% to zzso with a mean of zzso The mean increase in zzso score was zzso We concluded that zzso zzso the recognition of zzso important zzso in zzso zzso tissue and can be applied routinely without adverse zzso
