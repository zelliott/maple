Two approaches have been pursued to elicit zzso zzso zzso induce recruitment of immature zzso cells or their precursors at a site of zzso delivery, and zzso induce zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso The recruitment of selected DC zzso conditions the class of the immune zzso Each immature DC population displays a unique spectrum of zzso zzso For examples, zzso cells zzso migrate selectively in response to zzso (through zzso blood zzso DC to zzso zzso (through zzso All these zzso are zzso in response to inflammatory zzso zzso in particular is only detected within inflamed zzso at the site of zzso entry, which is infiltrated by immature zzso Furthermore, to reach the site of injury, sequential responsiveness might operate, blood DC precursors are recruited by a set of zzso zzso zzso while within the tissue other zzso will direct their navigation zzso Of interest, when injected in zzso together with zzso zzso but not zzso recruits blood zzso or blood DC precursors that promptly differentiate into typical zzso and that improve zzso immune zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso upon zzso responsiveness to zzso zzso zzso zzso due to zzso zzso In particular, in the zzso zzso expressed by zzso vessels may direct into the zzso zzso zzso maturing zzso leaving the site of zzso while within zzso zzso plays a critical role in the entry of zzso T cells from the blood through zzso In regard to its central role, we decided to investigate whether the expression of zzso in zzso may lead to zzso immune zzso zzso colon zzso zzso cell line zzso with zzso showed reduced zzso when injected in zzso into zzso zzso The protection was zzso dependent and associated with an important zzso zzso of zzso Most zzso zzso zzso zzso had an immature zzso were able to present zzso in the context of zzso class I, but were zzso to stimulation with the combination of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso paralysis could be zzso however, by in zzso or in zzso stimulation with the combination of a zzso zzso sequence and an zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso alone were inactive in zzso while zzso triggered zzso in normal zzso In particular, zzso plus zzso enhanced the zzso immune response and triggered de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plus zzso treatment showed robust zzso therapeutic activity exceeding by far that of zzso alone, and zzso zzso immune zzso
