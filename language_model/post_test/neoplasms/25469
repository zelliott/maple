DR zzso are thought to function as differentiation zzso and to restrict immune recognition between T cells and B cells, zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso These zzso are commonly found on tissue culture lines from zzso zzso and tumors of zzso derivation but are notably uncommon on cell lines from other zzso Using frozen tissue zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso known to detect an zzso common to all DR zzso on the beta zzso chain of DR zzso and a zzso indirect zzso technique, DR zzso were found on all zzso zzso tested and on many primary tumors and their zzso zzso The technique of using zzso zzso in indirect zzso zzso of freshly frozen tissue allows individual cells to be assessed for zzso expression and presumably more accurately reflects in zzso zzso expression than results obtained from cells selected by tissue culture zzso
