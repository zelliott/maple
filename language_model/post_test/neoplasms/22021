To compare the suitability of new zzso markers including zzso factors zzso zzso and zzso for detection of zzso and zzso zzso with the two well-known markers zzso and zzso 

The zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was examined in two zzso zzso 28 zzso zzso and 10 of their zzso zzso zzso of specificity was achieved by additional tissue array studies on 75 zzso other than germ cell zzso zzso Clinical data including serum zzso were available in 18 zzso 

Compared with other zzso significantly better zzso results were observed with zzso to zzso and zzso in all zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso pattern with zzso to zzso zzso and zzso was variable or zzso The lowest specificity was obtained with zzso which was expressed in a variety of zzso The only zzso zzso expressed no other zzso zzso No correlation between serum zzso level and tissue zzso expression was zzso 

zzso and zzso are the most sensitive markers for zzso zzso or primary zzso zzso Combination of these markers provides highly specific and clear results for detection of a zzso zzso
