Reliable animal models are critical for evaluating zzso and for defining tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso are moving away from traditional transplantation tumor systems because they do not adequately model human zzso zzso mouse models in which tumors arise spontaneously have been developed for most zzso The models use one of three zzso zzso promoters to drive expression of zzso large T zzso or zzso zzso deletion of tumor zzso genes by gene zzso or, conditional deletion of tumor zzso genes or zzso of zzso via zzso zzso zzso mice expressing human tumor zzso and zzso mice with deletions for zzso relevant molecules have been integral to advancing knowledge of the zzso zzso Although animal models are becoming more zzso additional improvements are needed so that more realistic models can be zzso
