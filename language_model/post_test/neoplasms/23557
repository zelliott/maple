The long-term stability of zzso peripheral blood zzso cells is an important issue for patients experiencing disease zzso However, there is no consensus on how to evaluate the long-term effects of zzso We describe the effect of zzso on viability and zzso colony activity from 87 individual samples processed at the Scripps Green Hospital Stem Cell zzso Center zzso Jolla, CA, zzso 

We randomly selected 87 peripheral blood zzso stem cell zzso samples from 60 patients and evaluated the effect of zzso on sample viability and red and white cell colony activity after zzso h and 7, 10 and 15 years of zzso zzso was zzso via zzso blue dye exclusion and activity was measured following 14 days of zzso 

An age at collection older than 50 years may result in zzso activity and viability following long-term zzso while gender and disease status had no zzso zzso did not significantly affect white or red cell activity following 10 years of zzso However, for samples stored longer than 10 years, viability and activity significantly zzso We noted a positive association between higher zzso zzso count and colony zzso 

zzso of peripheral blood zzso cells for up to 10 years results in no loss of zzso capacity, as determined by culture activity, although longer zzso of storage may affect zzso Until validated methods are developed, zzso zzso should be evaluated based on zzso zzso cell counts as zzso by flow zzso and zzso sample evaluation should be reserved for patients identified as poor zzso
