Using zzso sequence analysis, we discovered that a high proportion of cells in zzso as diverse as zzso zzso and heart muscle contain high proportions of zzso zzso zzso expanded from single initial zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso expansion of zzso point zzso is a common event in normal human zzso This finding implies efficient homogenization of zzso zzso within individual zzso zzso qualitative differences observed between the zzso of zzso expanded zzso in zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso suggest, however, that either the processes generating these zzso or mechanisms driving them to zzso are likely to be fundamentally different between the two zzso Furthermore, the ability of zzso zzso zzso to expand zzso for their zzso zzso as well as their apparently high zzso reinforces the possibility that these zzso may be involved actively in various zzso processes such as aging and degenerative zzso The abundance of zzso expanded point zzso in individual cells of normal zzso also suggests that the recently discovered zzso of zzso zzso in tumors may be explained by processes that are similar or identical to those operating in the normal zzso
