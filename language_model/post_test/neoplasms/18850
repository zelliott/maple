The tumor zzso is an increasingly attractive target for development of zzso zzso The fundamental principle for zzso cancer therapy is based on the zzso effect of chemical compounds, proteins or zzso on tumor zzso Indeed, in almost all zzso tumor models, zzso zzso with different agents shows potent effects on suppression of tumor zzso However, zzso zzso has barely produced any clinical benefits in cancer zzso Although in combination with chemotherapy some zzso drugs demonstrate survival improvement in patients with certain types of zzso the overall benefits by addition of zzso drugs zzso to chemotherapy remain zzso The disparity of zzso responses between zzso models and clinical cancer patients has raised important issues, which include: 1) Are current animal tumor models appropriate for assessing the therapeutic efficacy of zzso for clinical development? 2) What are the key differences between mouse tumor models and human cancer zzso 3) Are zzso drugs off target in cancer zzso 4) What are alternative options for improvement of the clinical benefits of zzso In this short review, I discuss these critical issues in relation to the clinical practice of zzso
