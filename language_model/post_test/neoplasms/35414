zzso zzso is a revolutionary concept whose clinical zzso is rapidly zzso zzso of executing beam intensity zzso have included individually designed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamic zzso and sequential zzso zzso We have developed zzso zzso as an innovative solution to overcome some of the limitations of other zzso zzso The unique physical design of zzso zzso allows the realization of the concepts of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In principle, these advances should improve normal tissue sparing and permit dose reconstruction and zzso thereby allowing significant biologically effective dose zzso Recent zzso findings can be translated into altered zzso schemes that aim to improve the local control and long-term zzso This strategy is being tested at the University of Wisconsin using zzso zzso with its highly precise delivery and zzso system along with meticulous and practical forms of zzso Innovative techniques such optical guidance, respiratory zzso and ultrasound assessments are being designed and tailored for zzso zzso zzso The intrinsic capability of zzso zzso for zzso CT zzso imaging for zzso zzso is being zzso The unique features of zzso zzso might allow zzso of zzso zzso that was previously impossible or zzso Here we review the zzso physical, and zzso rationale for the ongoing and upcoming clinical trials that will use zzso zzso in the form of zzso zzso and we describe our plans for testing our hypotheses in a rigorous prospective zzso
