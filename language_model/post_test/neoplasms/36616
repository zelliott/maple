The neologism zzso means zzso with zzso which are the particles constituted by zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso The theoretical considerations about the clinical advantages this treatment zzso can yield and the results obtained at the centers where it has already been used justify the proposal to project a center of this kind also in our zzso To this purpose, two of the authors of this paper zzso zzso zzso zzso founded the zzso Group formed by physicists, engineers and zzso who work in close collaboration on a feasibility study for a zzso zzso The first aim of the zzso Project is to design a center equipped with a zzso which, at the beginning, will accelerate negative hydrogen zzso zzso which will first produce zzso zzso zzso beams and, then accelerate light zzso (up to zzso to 430 zzso This accelerator will serve four or five treatment rooms where patients can be zzso zzso Two rooms will be equipped with a fixed horizontal beam for the treatment of eye, head and neck zzso the others will be equipped with rotating zzso to zzso in any clinical situation, really adequate zzso Such a unit, when enough experience is zzso will allow at least 1000 patients to be treated zzso The zzso zzso will be designed so as to allow, parallel to the zzso activities, other applications of medical and biological interest such zzso the production of zzso for diagnostic use (especially zzso zzso the analysis of trace elements through the zzso technique and the production of zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso capture zzso
