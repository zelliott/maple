A zzso zzso zzso model scaled from rabbit tissue distribution data was used to predict plasma zzso zzso in 23 patients and zzso tissue zzso in nine surgery patients following zzso zzso doses of zzso zzso The predicted zzso were compared to zzso determined zzso using a specific zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso The predicted plasma time course for 11 of 16 patients with relatively normal liver and kidney function agreed closely with the observed plasma time zzso zzso in the other five patients were ascribed to possible changes in the profile of zzso formation and/or fluctuations in zzso zzso All four patients with elevated serum zzso demonstrated significantly higher and more prolonged plasma levels than zzso The results of two patients with impaired kidney function and one patient with both zzso and zzso involvement were zzso The comparison between predicted and observed tissue zzso in biopsy samples was zzso however, all were within an order of zzso It is concluded that the model depicts zzso zzso and distribution reasonably well; however, more needs to be known concerning individual variation in zzso and zzso zzso rates for this to become more zzso Also, a tumor compartment appears to be an important addition in zzso the model to allow for clinical zzso
