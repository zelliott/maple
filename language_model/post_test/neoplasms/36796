zzso genes are a family of regulatory genes zzso zzso factors that primarily play a crucial role during zzso Several indications suggest their involvement in the control of cell growth and, when zzso in zzso We will describe the zzso in tumor origin and evolution, of members of the zzso gene families zzso zzso zzso and MSX as well as of other divergent zzso zzso We will also propose a model for the function of the zzso gene network in controlling cell identity to account for the involvement of some zzso genes in both normal development and zzso
