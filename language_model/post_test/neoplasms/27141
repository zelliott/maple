Recent advances in sequencing technologies have revealed extensive zzso zzso zzso both within individual zzso and between primary and zzso zzso for different cancer zzso Such genetic diversity may have clinical implications for both cancer diagnosis and treatment with increasing evidence linking zzso and therapeutic zzso Nonetheless, whilst limiting the activity of targeted agents, zzso genetic zzso may provide a new therapeutic opportunity through generation of zzso that could be zzso and targeted by the patient's own immune system in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso studies assessing zzso zzso architecture and its correlation with the underlying immune response to cancer in each particular patient are needed to follow zzso evolutionary dynamics over time and through therapy, in order to further understand the mechanisms behind drug resistance and to inform the development of new zzso therapeutic zzso
