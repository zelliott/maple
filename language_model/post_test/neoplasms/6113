After zzso zzso cells zzso a distinct zzso of zzso zzso cells, migrate from skin to zzso zzso where they regulate the magnitude and quality of immune responses initiated by zzso applied zzso zzso of zzso zzso is likely to be central to regulation of zzso zzso zzso express high levels of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein that is characteristic of some zzso and many zzso and that has been implicated in zzso zzso and zzso To gain insight into zzso function in a zzso context in zzso we generated conditional knockout mice with zzso zzso and characterized zzso zzso from these mice contained increased numbers of zzso with normal levels of zzso and zzso molecules and zzso activity in zzso zzso of zzso zzso from skin zzso was zzso but zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso the ability of contact zzso zzso zzso to exit zzso in zzso was delayed, and zzso fewer zzso zzso subsequently accumulated in zzso zzso zzso migration of zzso zzso resulted in enhanced contact hypersensitivity responses as previously described in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed reduced zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso in contact zzso zzso These results zzso link zzso expression to zzso zzso and zzso migration to immune zzso zzso appears to promote zzso migration from zzso by decreasing zzso zzso and may zzso zzso zzso and cell movement within in zzso during development and zzso in an analogous zzso
