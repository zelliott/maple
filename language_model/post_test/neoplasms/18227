An zzso generic zzso has been developed to compare three zzso models used to delineate gross zzso volume on zzso PET zzso zzso volume was extracted and characteristic parameters were zzso Three fitting models using different parameters were zzso model 1 zzso zzso model 2 zzso and model 3 zzso The zzso was performed using a zzso phantom filled with hot zzso To validate the models, two other zzso were zzso The zzso procedure showed a better fitting model for model 1 zzso from zzso to zzso than for model 3 zzso and model 2 zzso The validation study shows that model 3 yielded large volume measurement zzso Models 1 and 2 gave close results with no significant zzso Model 2 was preferred because it presents less error zzso and needs fewer characteristic zzso making it easier to zzso Our results show the importance of developing a generic zzso to compare the performances of fitting models zzso and to validate results on other zzso than the ones used during the zzso process to avoid zzso zzso
