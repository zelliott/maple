zzso a zzso C zzso zzso is important for embryonic development and cancer zzso Here, we show that zzso is zzso by zzso and is crucial for zzso cell zzso zzso interacts directly with zzso zzso muscle zzso zzso to zzso zzso flux in cancer zzso The zzso interaction resides at the zzso interface region of zzso which zzso zzso zzso and blocks zzso zzso zzso This interaction also influences zzso of zzso into the nucleus and promotes zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso target genes involved in zzso zzso resulting in a reduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in cancer zzso zzso along with zzso and zzso is recruited to the zzso response element site in the zzso zzso A and zzso zzso and mediates the recruitment of the latter two zzso Our data uncover a mechanism zzso zzso can be regulated by zzso zzso zzso paving the way to cell zzso zzso
