There have been many advances in the therapy of cancer following the introduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were observed in primary tumors and often in zzso zzso zzso However, one of the consequences of chemotherapy is the zzso of drug-resistant zzso and the development of multiple drug zzso The development of drug resistance remains a major obstacle in the treatment of such tumors and therefore, there is an obvious need for alternative approaches such as zzso zzso The cloning of biologically active zzso molecules has been considered as potential new zzso in the destruction of drug-resistant tumor zzso For instance, some members of the zzso are characterized by their ability to inflict cell death upon binding to their zzso zzso zzso was the first zzso to be tested for its zzso activity, followed by zzso These two molecules are efficient in killing a variety of tumor cells, however, they cause significant damage to normal zzso that result in life-threatening zzso zzso the search for a zzso zzso that is selective for tumor cells has continued until the recently discovered new member of the zzso zzso namely zzso TRAIL has been shown to be selectively zzso in inducing zzso against tumor cells and has minimal or no toxicity against normal zzso as examined both in zzso and in zzso in zzso zzso TRAIL is a new agent that has great potential for its in zzso zzso effect, whether used alone or in combination with zzso Studies from our laboratory have recently demonstrated that tumor cells that are resistant to TRAIL can be zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso tumor cells are significantly killed by zzso This review describes the current status of research studies performed with TRAIL by other investigators as well as by our zzso
