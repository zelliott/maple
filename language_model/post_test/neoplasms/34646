zzso and zzso are structurally related zzso proteins that function as critical negative regulators of zzso activity in embryonic and adult zzso The zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso functions in zzso and the amplification of zzso or zzso is observed in human zzso retaining zzso zzso We now demonstrate a surprising role for zzso in suppressing zzso that is distinct from its zzso ability to inhibit zzso The deletion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso formation and the loss of zzso from zzso zzso zzso This reduction in zzso number, not observed in zzso cells with zzso deleted, zzso with increased cell proliferation and the spontaneous transformation of zzso mouse embryonic zzso in zzso and with an increased rate of spontaneous zzso in zzso mice in zzso These results indicate that zzso has a zzso role in suppressing zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso by promoting zzso zzso and bipolar zzso
