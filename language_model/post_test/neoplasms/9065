zzso instability is recognized as one of the primary mechanisms that lead to zzso zzso When zzso maintenance systems, such as zzso zzso repair, are zzso zzso instability is zzso which causes accelerated aging zzso This can be observed in humans as well as in mouse models of zzso zzso The role of zzso instability related to nuclear DNA is currently under investigation with respect to its role in cardiovascular disease, and in particular those cardiovascular diseases that are associated with vascular zzso In this review, we highlight the first findings in this field of research that come from experiments in zzso zzso zzso mouse models and from genetic zzso zzso mechanisms that mediate the consequences of zzso instability at the local vascular and at the systemic level, such as cell zzso zzso zzso damage, and zzso 1 and IGF-1 decrease, are discussed and important goals for future research are zzso
