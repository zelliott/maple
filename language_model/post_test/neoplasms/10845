zzso K, zzso and S are zzso zzso zzso in cancer and zzso zzso zzso to facilitate zzso but difficulty distinguishing specific zzso activity in complex tissue extracts confounds scientific studies and employing them for use in clinical zzso Here, we have developed multiplex zzso zzso to profile zzso K, zzso and S activity in 10 zzso human breast, zzso and cervical tumors by exploiting unique zzso mobility and zzso zzso 

Frozen breast, zzso and zzso cancer tissue zzso and normal organ tissue zzso from the same human patients were obtained zzso breast zzso 23 lung zzso and 23 zzso zzso minced and zzso prior to loading for zzso gelatin zzso to determine zzso zzso 

zzso bands of zzso activity were identified and validated in tumor extracts and detected zzso and zzso differences in zzso zzso K was unique compared to zzso L and zzso It was significantly higher for all zzso even at the earliest stage tested zzso I for lung and zzso zzso zzso 6, p zzso zzso and stage II for zzso zzso zzso 6, p zzso zzso Interestingly, cervical and breast tumor zzso activity was highest at the earliest stage we tested, stages I and II, respectively, and then were significantly lower at the latest stages tested zzso and IV, zzso zzso zzso 6, p zzso zzso and p zzso zzso but lung zzso activity increased from one stage to the next zzso zzso 6, p zzso zzso Using zzso K as a diagnostic zzso for breast cancer detected with multiplex zzso yielded zzso sensitivity and specificity for 20 breast tissue samples tested (10 zzso 10 zzso in part due to the consistent absence of zzso K in normal breast tissue across all zzso 

To zzso this sensitive zzso provides quantitative zzso of zzso K, zzso and S activities from mere zzso of tissue and has potential use as a supplement to zzso methods of clinical diagnoses of zzso human zzso
