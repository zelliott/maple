A broad body of evidence indicates the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor zzso zzso A distinct function of the zzso in this zzso process, however, is still zzso Therefore the effect of zzso zzso zzso on tumor cell zzso to the basement zzso a key event in zzso formation, was zzso 

A wide variety of compounds designed in our work group and identified as zzso zzso zzso were applied to several zzso zzso tumor cell lines to test their influence on tumor cell zzso For this purpose an zzso basement membrane zzso model with the zzso gel preparation zzso was zzso 

Most of the zzso zzso zzso tested had no effect on cell zzso Although two compounds significantly reduced tumor cell zzso in a zzso manner, this was not related to zzso zzso zzso 

These data indicate that zzso might not be involved in the attachment of tumor cell lines to the basement zzso
