Gene expression data play an important role in the development of efficient cancer diagnoses and zzso However, gene expression data are usually redundant and zzso and only a subset of them present distinct profiles for different classes of zzso Thus, selecting high zzso genes from gene expression data has become increasingly interesting in the field of zzso In this paper, a zzso zzso based zzso method is proposed to select the small subset of zzso gene relevant to the zzso In the proposed algorithm, zzso the zzso zzso is used to choose the 60 top gene expression zzso zzso to make zzso based zzso suitable for the discrete problem, zzso zzso based zzso as called zzso is proposed based on a zzso migration model and a zzso zzso zzso Then, zzso zzso zzso based zzso as we called zzso is proposed by zzso the zzso sorting method and the crowding distance method into the zzso zzso Finally, the zzso method is used for gene selection, and support zzso machine is used as the zzso with the zzso zzso method zzso In order to show the effective and efficiency of the algorithm, the proposed zzso is tested on ten gene expression zzso zzso Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method is better or at least comparable with previous particle swarm zzso zzso zzso and support zzso machine zzso from literature when considering the quality of the solutions zzso
