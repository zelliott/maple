This study focused on the effects of repetitive zzso magnetic stimulation zzso on normal and zzso cells of zzso We used three human cell lines, zzso zzso normal breast zzso zzso zzso breast zzso and zzso zzso cervical zzso Cell proliferation at 37 degrees C and 40 degrees C and the expression of heat shock protein zzso 70 at 37 degrees C, 40 degrees C, and 42 degrees C, before and after the exposure to zzso was zzso Cell proliferation showed no effects of exposure to zzso in both normal and zzso zzso however, zzso expression was increased by zzso exposure under zzso stress at 40 degrees C and 42 degrees C in zzso and zzso We concluded that zzso exposure zzso the effect of zzso stress on both normal and zzso cells, and zzso cells derived from different zzso respond differently to zzso zzso
