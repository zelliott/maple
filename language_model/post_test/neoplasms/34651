For most US health statistics, Asian-Americans are grouped into a single race zzso We use a unique data file to determine zzso cancer death rates for persons aged 65 and older in six Asian-American ethnic zzso zzso Indian, Japanese, zzso zzso and zzso and determine for which cancer sites the zzso Asian-American race category is a misleading summary of zzso cancer zzso 

We previously determined zzso death rates for Asian-American zzso using Social Security files, in collaboration with a colleague at the Social Security zzso By linking these records to death zzso we determine zzso death rates for 21 cancer zzso We test whether there is significant zzso among subgroups, using zzso zzso 

For about half of cancer sites, all Asian zzso have lower rates than zzso For three sites most zzso have higher rates than zzso zzso liver, and zzso but there is significant zzso For other cancer sites, there is an inconsistent pattern, with some zzso having rates lower than zzso and some having rates similar to zzso Asian Indians are most often the Asian zzso with a divergent zzso 

The zzso Asian-American rate masks significant zzso zzso for many, but not all, cancer zzso
