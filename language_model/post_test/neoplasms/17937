To obtain proof of external zzso of the visual analogue scale and re-evaluate the use of this instrument in assessing cancer patients' quality of zzso 

zzso patients attending 79 Italian medical zzso and zzso centers over a period of 1 week were asked to fill out both a questionnaire concerning the presence of 19 problems and a zzso linear visual analogue scale evaluating their quality of zzso Quality of life was rated as zzso and zzso when given a score of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso models were used where good and bad quality of life were correlated with explanatory variables including patient and disease characteristics and the presence or absence of the 19 zzso 

zzso level of education, treatment setting, zzso performance status, disease extent, and the presence of 12 out of 19 problems were found to be correlated with good quality of zzso A similar pattern of correlations was found with bad quality of zzso 

Due to the difficulties in attaining reliable assessment of quality of life using zzso zzso the further proof of zzso obtained in this study allows us to propose the zzso of the role of the zzso in measuring the quality of life of cancer zzso
