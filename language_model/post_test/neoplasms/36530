zzso zzso is a chemotherapy drug which has zzso activity at standard doses, exhibits a steep zzso effect in zzso and is associated with relatively few zzso zzso These characteristics suggest a potential role for this drug in bone zzso transplant zzso zzso To pursue this hypothesis, 16 patients with zzso solid tumors were enrolled in a phase I study of single agent zzso to determine the dose of zzso requiring bone zzso zzso and to define the zzso toxicity and maximum tolerated dose when given with zzso bone zzso zzso zzso were evaluated at the zzso zzso dose zzso The zzso requiring dose was 2000 zzso when given as a single intravenous zzso zzso The zzso zzso toxicity of zzso was zzso with the maximum tolerated dose of zzso being zzso zzso when given with bone zzso transplantation zzso Other zzso were transient and zzso At zzso zzso of zzso plasma zzso declined zzso with a terminal zzso of 3 zzso The mean clearance was zzso zzso with a volume of distribution at steady state of zzso zzso and a mean maximum plasma concentration of 150 zzso One patient with melanoma developed a partial response of short duration after receiving zzso zzso of zzso zzso can be significantly dose escalated with an acceptable toxicity profile, when given with zzso Future trials should focus on the addition of this drug to current zzso zzso regimens used for the treatment of patients with zzso
