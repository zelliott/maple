The possibility of reduced cell kill following zzso radiation therapy zzso compared to conventional radiation therapy has been debated in the zzso This potential reduction in cell kill relates to prolonged treatment times typical of zzso dose delivery and consequently increased repair of zzso zzso While there is some theoretical support to this reduction in cell kill published in the literature, direct experimental evidence specific to zzso dose delivery patterns is zzso In this study we present cell survival data for three cell zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso human cervical zzso zzso and colon zzso zzso Cell survival was obtained for zzso zzso delivered as acute dose with zzso pair zzso zzso time 75 zzso which served as a zzso regular zzso zzso zzso time 5 zzso and zzso with a break for multiple leaf zzso zzso zzso after three fields were delivered, zzso time 10 zzso An actual zzso dynamic zzso zzso plan for a head and neck patient was zzso The zzso plan was generated for a zzso zzso or zzso linear accelerator with 120 leaf zzso zzso Survival data were also collected for doses zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to establish parameters of the zzso equation describing survival following acute dose zzso zzso were zzso inside an acrylic zzso phantom specifically designed for this zzso zzso from both zzso and POP were validated using zzso chamber zzso A zzso increase in cell survival was observed following zzso dose zzso This increase varied from small for zzso with a surviving fraction of zzso following POP vs zzso following uninterrupted zzso to very pronounced for zzso with a surviving fraction of zzso following POP vs zzso for uninterrupted zzso When compared to zzso or zzso with a break for zzso zzso cell survival following acute dose delivery was significantly different, p zzso zzso in three out of six zzso In contrast, when cell survival following zzso was compared to that following zzso with a break for zzso zzso the difference was always statistically zzso When projected to a 30 fraction treatment, dose deficit to bring cell survival to the same value as in POP was calculated as zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso cell lines, zzso The dose deficit did not relate to the zzso ratio obtained in this study for the three cell zzso Clinical data do not show reduction in local control following zzso zzso reasons for this are zzso The obtained data set can serve as a test data set for models designed to explore the effect of dose delivery zzso in zzso on radiation therapy zzso
