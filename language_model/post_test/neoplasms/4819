There is widespread evidence that cancer zzso an increased risk of deep zzso zzso zzso This risk is thought to vary among different cancer zzso The purpose of this study is to better define the zzso of zzso complications among patients undergoing surgical treatment for a spectrum of prevalent cancer diagnoses in contemporary zzso 

All patients undergoing one of 11 cancer surgical operations zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified by Current zzso zzso and International zzso of zzso Ninth Revision codes using the American College of Surgeons National zzso Quality Improvement Program database zzso The study zzso were zzso pulmonary embolism zzso and overall zzso zzso zzso events zzso within 1 month of the index zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to calculate adjusted odds ratios for each zzso 

Over the study zzso zzso of the selected cancer operations were zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and total zzso within 1 month following surgery varied widely across a spectrum of cancer diagnoses, ranging from zzso zzso and zzso for breast zzso to zzso zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso Compared with breast cancer, the zzso of zzso ranged from a zzso increase in zzso associated with zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso to a zzso increase associated with zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso status, steroid use, advanced age zzso zzso zzso obesity zzso mass index zzso blood zzso zzso cardiac arrest, zzso infectious zzso and prolonged hospitalization were independently associated with increased risk of zzso 

The zzso of zzso and zzso complications associated with cancer surgery varies zzso These findings suggest that both tumor type and zzso magnitude may impact zzso zzso zzso such data support diagnosis and zzso guidelines for zzso zzso prophylaxis and can be used to anticipate the risk of potentially preventable zzso
