A mathematical model has been developed to determine the best approach to improving tumor targeting with zzso The amount of zzso in the tumor zzso zzso and the zzso tissue zzso concentration ratio zzso zzso were calculated over 12 days from injection, using the computer program zzso to solve the stiff zzso differential equations describing the zzso zzso indicate that success requires an optimal combination of dose, size, and binding affinity of zzso zzso the dose to 100 times that presently used for scanning increased both the percentage of injected zzso in the tumor and the zzso ratio by up to 2 orders of magnitude to zzso values determined by zzso This result could be achieved by zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity from zzso zzso zzso to zzso increased the zzso ratio from 5 to 100 for whole zzso and to 550 for a small zzso at the calculated optimal dose, but had no effect at the current scanning zzso With decreasing molecular size at average zzso the same maximum tumor content and zzso ratio were achieved but progressively zzso At high affinity there was a substantial advantage for a small zzso compared with whole zzso in terms of zzso ratio zzso versus zzso and zzso tissue integral dose ratio zzso versus zzso The zzso of a small zzso was not increased by binding to plasma protein but with increasing time the tumor content was higher than without protein zzso
