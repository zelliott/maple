Much evidence now exists that tumors possess specific zzso recognizable by T zzso The goal of zzso is to break tolerance to these zzso while preserving zzso Recently, newer approaches have been developed in animal systems that modify tumor cells genetically so that they express new zzso or zzso certain zzso Engineering tumor cells to zzso zzso in a zzso fashion can induce powerful local zzso effects which, in addition to inducing local zzso can alter the presentation of tumor zzso or the zzso of zzso T zzso resulting in systemic zzso zzso
