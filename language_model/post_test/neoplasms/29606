The purpose of this study was to develop a population zzso zzso model for zzso to evaluate the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso profile of zzso and to assess the relationship between zzso disposition and patient zzso 

A total of 40 patients with advanced cancer from two phase 1 studies were included in the population zzso model zzso Patients received zzso zzso zzso IV on day zzso zzso plasma and zzso levels were sampled at 10 zzso over a zzso period and measured by a validated zzso zzso Data were analyzed by a zzso zzso modeling approach using the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were described as a zzso model with zzso zzso with one compartment representing the plasma and another representing zzso zzso Gender was associated with volume of distribution, in which women had a lower zzso The number of cycles administered was associated with zzso those with decreased clearance were more likely to receive less than 2 cycles before going off zzso 

This study suggests that monitoring zzso plasma zzso in the first cycle and dose adjustment in those with decreased clearance may be helpful in decreasing toxicity associated with the zzso
