The term contact zzso zzso encompasses the cellular changes that result in zzso of cell migration and of proliferation due to signals zzso when one cell comes into physical contact with another zzso Cancer cells, however, do not contact zzso A molecular understanding of the loss of zzso in cancer cells is important for understanding tumor zzso In this zzso we propose that the loss of zzso observed in cancer cells is the result of zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso molecules zzso in the tumor zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso results in a shed zzso zzso and released zzso zzso that zzso zzso and zzso signals that promote proliferation and/or zzso The importance of this observation in tumor progression is supported by the presence of the shed zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso in serum and tumor tissue of cancer patients suggesting that instead of acting as tumor zzso the shed zzso zzso and zzso fragments actually function as zzso The study of zzso zzso zzso will provide important and novel means of zzso imaging, and treating tumor zzso
