zzso is expressed on a wide variety of tumor cells including zzso zzso breast, zzso lung cancer zzso It is probable that the core proteins and lipids differ on the different cell types since there is marked zzso in the binding of the zzso within and among the different cell zzso Previously, there had only been a single zzso of the zzso class directed to zzso The present study demonstrates the existence of one more zzso zzso (an zzso Unfortunately, a third zzso submitted as an zzso zzso did not appear to be an zzso in our studies and a fourth zzso zzso submitted as an zzso did not have significant binding activity and also could not be confirmed as zzso An interesting finding was that all of the zzso could mediate zzso zzso with rabbit zzso However, the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso could not mediate zzso with human complement, while all of the zzso zzso could do zzso It is not clear why this difference zzso zzso is known to be expressed on mature zzso cells in the zzso zzso The expression of zzso on zzso cells has been mapped by the indirect method of zzso zzso and measurement of zzso zzso These studies have estimated that about 50% of normal zzso express zzso In the present workshop, we examined the expression of zzso on a quantifiable cell population, the zzso positive zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
