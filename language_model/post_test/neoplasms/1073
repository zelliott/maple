To review the zzso properties of a novel class of zzso agents, the zzso and to zzso findings from recent clinical trials investigating the various zzso in cancer zzso 

Literature searches were conducted using zzso zzso and the abstract search engines for the American Society of Clinical Oncology and American Association for Cancer Research annual meetings (all searches through November zzso zzso search terms included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Publications were given priority for inclusion if they discussed structural or zzso properties of the zzso as a class or if they included zzso or clinical data for zzso currently in clinical zzso 

The zzso are a novel class of zzso agents zzso zzso are structurally and zzso distinct from zzso but the exact ways in which the zzso of the 2 classes differ has not been firmly zzso A number of natural, zzso and fully synthetic zzso are in various stages of clinical zzso These agents differ from each other and from existing zzso these differences influence zzso stability, and zzso zzso is currently approved to treat zzso zzso breast cancer and has demonstrated efficacy in earlier stages of breast cancer and in several other tumor zzso zzso and zzso are currently under clinical investigation and have each shown promise in a number of treatment settings and tumor zzso All 3 agents appear to be associated with manageable zzso but no zzso toxicity profile exists for the zzso and zzso zzso differ among the zzso 

The zzso have demonstrated significant potential for addressing the growing therapeutic challenge of zzso resistance, and the ever-increasing pool of information regarding zzso relationships of these zzso will help to zzso zzso zzso
