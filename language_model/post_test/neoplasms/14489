zzso regional disparities in life expectancy were found in a previous study of Irish zzso An attempt is made in the present paper to assess the relative importance of each of the major causes of death to an understanding of regional disparities in total zzso using a specially devised index known as a partial zzso mortality zzso It is found that regional disparities created by each of the major causes of death tend to have a reinforcing effect, although cerebrovascular diseases tend to conform less closely to the patterns established by the other major causes zzso cardiovascular diseases, zzso zzso and respiratory zzso zzso diseases exert the strongest influence upon the overall pattern, but zzso zzso exert a much stronger influence than might be expected given the number of deaths from zzso Regional disparities are stronger for males than for zzso suggesting lines for further zzso zzso
