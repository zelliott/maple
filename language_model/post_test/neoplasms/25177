It has become increasingly evident that the study of DNA is inadequate to explain many, if not most, aspects of the development and progression of zzso zzso from zzso zzso to zzso Thus, the term zzso can no longer refer to just the study of the zzso Much of the action in genetic research now shifts to the methods by which the zzso from one gene is processed to yield multiple different zzso different quantities of the same protein as well as other forms of regulating zzso Thus, the age of zzso processing and zzso control of the transfer of information from the zzso has zzso The mechanisms of zzso processing and zzso control that must be characterized in greater detail including alternate zzso regulation of zzso degradation, zzso regulatory factors including those factors which extensively edit zzso control of translation, and control of protein stability and zzso This chapter reviews many of the processes that control information from the zzso to proteins and how these factors lead from less than 40,000 genes to more than an order of magnitude increase more proteins which actually control the zzso of cells - normal or zzso It is usually the products of genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are the molecular markers that will control zzso research and ultimately, individualized zzso medical approaches to zzso This chapter emphasizes how the process of zzso zzso the normal processes of cellular operations, especially those processes that are important in the normal development of the organisms - including zzso cellular death, zzso cellular mobility and invasion, and zzso to ensure zzso development, survival and zzso This chapter reviews the wide range of processes controlling the information that flows from the zzso to proteins and emphasizes how molecular steps in pure processes can be used as zzso to study zzso treatment and/or management of zzso
