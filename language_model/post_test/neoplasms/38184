An important area of research in systems biology involves the analysis and integration of zzso functional zzso In this context, a major goal is the identification of a putative molecular network controlling zzso response from experimental zzso With very zzso zzso information, this is a challenging zzso A number of methods have been developed, each one with the potential to address an aspect of the zzso Here, we review some of the most widely used zzso and report new results in support of the usefulness of zzso and other zzso techniques in identifying components of the molecular networks that are zzso of zzso zzso We also discuss how system identification in biology could be approached, using a combination of zzso that aim to reconstruct the relationship between molecular pathways and physiology at different levels of the organizational complexity of the molecular zzso
