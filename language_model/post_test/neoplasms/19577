In two dimensions, zzso zzso zzso Arc zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to be powerful methods for the zzso of plans with zzso at risk zzso zzso surrounded by a target volume zzso In three dimensions, some additional boundary conditions have to be considered to establish zzso zzso as an zzso zzso A further aim was to create rules for ad hoc adaptations of an zzso plan to a daily changing zzso zzso As a test model, a zzso zzso zzso combination was zzso The centrally placed zzso can adapt arbitrary diameters with different gap zzso toward the zzso Along the rotation axis the zzso diameter can vary, the zzso can even zzso at some axis positions, leaving a circular zzso The zzso and weight of the second segment were the free parameters to zzso The objective function f to minimize was the root of the integral of the squared difference of the dose in the target volume and a reference zzso For the problem, two local zzso zzso zzso as a secondary criteria, the magnitude of hot and cold spots were taken into zzso As a result, the solution with a larger segment zzso was zzso From plane to plane for varying zzso of zzso and zzso and for different gaps between them, different sets of weights and zzso were zzso Because only one weight for one segment shall be used for all planes zzso leaf zzso a strategy for complex three-dimensional zzso cases was established to choose a global zzso In a second step, a suitable segment zzso was zzso minimizing f for this global zzso The concept was demonstrated in a planning study for a zzso zzso example with a large range of different zzso of an zzso along the patient zzso The method is discussed for some classes of zzso at risk zzso zzso zzso cases were treated zzso The product of zzso and weight of the additional segment as well as the integral across the segment profile was demonstrated to be an important zzso This product was up to a factor of 3 larger than in the zzso zzso Even in three dimensions, the zzso zzso zzso increased the zzso of the dose distribution in the zzso zzso Rules for adaptation to varying zzso combinations were zzso It can be concluded that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also zzso in three zzso In the majority of cases, weights between zzso and 2 will occur for the additional zzso The zzso product of the second segment is always smaller than the zzso radius of the zzso The zzso product of the additional segment is strictly connected to the relevant diameter of the organ at risk and the target zzso The derived formulas can be helpful to adapt an zzso plan to altering target zzso
