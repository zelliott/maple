Writing a computer program for modeling zzso disease process for cancer or chronic disease is often an arduous and time-consuming zzso We have developed a zzso zzso program for zzso the transition parameters in such models using zzso zzso The program is very flexible and enables the user to specify homogeneous and zzso zzso zzso distribution, zzso zzso zzso models, incorporate zzso using the zzso hazards form, derive transition zzso formulate the likelihood function, and calculate the maximum likelihood estimate zzso and zzso confidence zzso within a zzso zzso The program was successfully applied to an example of a zzso disease model for the progression of zzso cancer from normal zzso free), to zzso zzso zzso and finally to invasive zzso with or without adjusting for zzso This zzso program can be generalized to other zzso models with s zzso
