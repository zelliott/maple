On 25th November 2011, a symposium organized by the Royal College of zzso entitled zzso diagnosis on zzso and zzso took place in zzso As zzso in zzso and zzso we were zzso to consider the role that molecular biology is likely to play in future practice and how this is addressed by our own zzso The symposium provided a basis for this zzso zzso samples requiring molecular analysis are equally relevant to zzso and zzso and molecular biology laboratories are now using zzso as well as zzso material for diagnostic testing, allowing different zzso types to be used as and when they are most zzso The most widely used types of molecular analysis in routine cellular pathology are zzso testing in lung cancer, molecular testing of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso testing of urine samples, zzso analysis in zzso testing, zzso testing in breast and gastric cancer, zzso testing in zzso cancer, zzso assessment of breast cancer zzso zzso molecular testing of gastrointestinal zzso zzso and mismatch repair protein zzso Of these, the majority in the UK are carried out on zzso samples, although many are zzso to zzso samples if adequate material is zzso We are particularly encouraged by the potential of molecular diagnostic zzso in traditionally difficult areas, such as zzso zzso We believe that increasing reliance on molecular diagnostic techniques will also herald changes in zzso
