zzso replicating zzso zzso represent a promising class of novel zzso agents that are used for zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been shown to zzso eradicate tumor zzso The presence of the zzso region in the latter virus is known to improve cell killing that can be attributed to the presence of the zzso Ad death zzso The more precise mechanism by which zzso kill tumor cells is zzso and the role of the host cell zzso machinery in this process has been addressed only in a limited zzso Here, we examine the role of several major zzso pathways in the zzso killing of zzso lung cancer zzso zzso As expected, zzso was more potent than zzso No evidence for the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso Western zzso analyses demonstrated strong suppression of zzso expression and unchanged zzso levels during viral zzso and stable zzso of human zzso type zzso in zzso cells did not affect killing by both zzso zzso activity was also not hampered by stable zzso of zzso zzso or zzso and zzso zzso protein levels remained constant during the zzso zzso Some evidence for zzso processing was obtained at late time points after zzso however, the zzso of zzso by the zzso inhibitor of zzso protein zzso or zzso with zzso did not inhibit zzso cell zzso zzso of several zzso features revealed no evidence for nuclear fragmentation or DNA zzso although zzso zzso was zzso We conclude that despite the known zzso abilities of individual Ad zzso zzso zzso trigger zzso cell zzso In addition, we propose that zzso zzso in cancer cells, a possible drug resistance zzso provides no barrier for zzso zzso
