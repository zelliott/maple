zzso zzso is a hallmark of tumor zzso The ability of normal cells to undergo zzso arrest after damage to DNA is crucial for the maintenance of zzso zzso The zzso pathways that stop the cell cycle in response to cellular zzso are called zzso zzso checkpoint function results in genetic modifications that contribute to zzso The regulation of checkpoint signaling also has important clinical implications because the zzso of checkpoint function can alter the sensitivity of tumor cells to zzso Here, we provide an overview of the mechanisms that regulate the cell cycle, current zzso therapies that target checkpoint signaling zzso and strategies for the development of novel zzso zzso
