It has been demonstrated that zzso derivatives act as zzso agents, thus we designed and zzso a novel class of symmetrical zzso zzso We evaluated the zzso and zzso activity of zzso against five human tumor and normal cell zzso The results indicated that the majority of the compounds exhibited zzso activity equivalent to or greater than the positive zzso zzso (11) and zzso demonstrated the most potent zzso activity with zzso values between zzso zzso and zzso zzso The potent zzso capabilities of these compounds against zzso human transformed zzso cells indicated that these zzso could potentially serve as zzso zzso We also reviewed the relationship between structure and activity based on the experimental zzso Our findings provide a good starting point for further development of symmetrical zzso derivatives as potential novel zzso zzso
