Through the classic study of zzso much has been learned about the regulation and progression of human zzso Specifically, cancer has been defined as a disease driven by genetic zzso including zzso in zzso genes and zzso as well as zzso zzso However, the study of normal human development has identified that in addition to classical zzso regulation of gene expression is also modified by zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA zzso the regulation of zzso group zzso and the zzso function of zzso zzso These changes are modifications inherited during both zzso and zzso yet they do not result in zzso of the actual DNA zzso A number of biological questions are directly influenced by zzso such as how does a cell know when to zzso differentiate or remain zzso and more importantly, what happens when these pathways become zzso Do these zzso lead to the development and/or progression of zzso This review will focus on zzso the limited current literature involving zzso zzso in the context of human cancer stems cells zzso The extent to which zzso changes define cell fate, identity, and zzso are still under intense investigation, and many questions remain largely zzso Before discussing zzso gene zzso in zzso the different zzso of stem cells and their properties will be zzso This will be followed by an introduction to the different zzso zzso Finally, there will be a discussion of the current knowledge of zzso modifications in stem cells, specifically what is known from zzso systems and established cancer cell lines, and how they are leading us to understand human stem zzso
