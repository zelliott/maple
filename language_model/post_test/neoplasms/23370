Human zzso zzso zzso is the key zzso involved in de zzso zzso synthesis and thus represents an important therapeutic target against zzso diseases, most notably zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate the ability of zzso zzso zzso to inhibit the activity of zzso The structural similarities of these zzso with zzso predicted that they would inhibit zzso activity by binding to its zzso zzso In zzso analysis and in zzso characterization identified one particular analogue designated as zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso X-ray crystal structure of zzso bound to zzso was zzso zzso studies showed the zzso effects of the corresponding zzso zzso against leukemia zzso zzso binds to zzso with zzso zzso zzso does not induce zzso of zzso like zzso the native zzso inhibitor of zzso that binds with high affinity to the zzso The X-ray crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso complex determined to zzso zzso resolution shows that zzso does not bind to the zzso but rather at the zzso Regardless, zzso zzso produces zzso and zzso effects against human leukemia cells by altering zzso zzso Our studies provide useful insights toward developing new zzso with improved potency and efficacy against zzso
