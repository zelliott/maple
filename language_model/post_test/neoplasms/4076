The use of zzso zzso as therapeutic agents has heralded a new field of genetic zzso zzso are relatively easy to design and display increased affinity and selectivity for their zzso acid targets compared with traditional zzso However, the development of zzso therapy has not been as simple as was first zzso many critical issues had to be zzso The first generation of zzso investigated as drug candidates were zzso zzso Several animal experiments have provided evidence that zzso zzso can inhibit gene expression of zzso zzso These promising studies led to the advancement of these compounds into clinical trials in such diverse fields as infectious diseases, cancer and zzso The insights gained through ongoing clinical trials has opened the zzso to the design of second-generation zzso which have an improved safety profile and zzso
