Data from several previous studies examining zzso and cardiovascular risk have hinted at a possible relationship between zzso and zzso zzso We thus systematically examined the zzso value of zzso variables on the subsequent risk of death from zzso 

In the Paris Prospective Study I, zzso zzso French working men aged 42 to 53 years, free of clinically zzso cardiovascular disease and cancer, underwent a standardized graded exercise test between 1967 and zzso zzso zzso zzso increase during exercise, and decrease during recovery were zzso Change in resting zzso over 5 years was also available in zzso zzso zzso including zzso cancer deaths was assessed over the 25 years of zzso 

There were strong, graded and significant relationships between all zzso parameters and subsequent cancer zzso After adjustment for age and tobacco consumption and, compared with the lowest zzso those with the highest zzso for resting zzso had a relative risk of zzso for cancer deaths zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso This was similar after adjustment for traditional cardiovascular risk factors and was observed for the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Similarly, significant relationships with cancer death were observed between poor heart rate increase during exercise, poor decrease during recovery and greater zzso increase over time zzso for zzso 

zzso and exercise heart rate had consistent, graded and highly significant associations with subsequent cancer mortality in zzso
