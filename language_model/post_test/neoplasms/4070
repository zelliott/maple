Despite many published studies no zzso could be identified yet to zzso and individually predict collection results in stem cell zzso We analyzed zzso counts and processed blood volume, absolute and relative zzso cell counts, and overall collection efficiency in 120 patients with zzso and solid zzso zzso zzso using the zzso zzso cell zzso a median of 3 per patient, span zzso Stem cells were mobilized into peripheral blood by conventional chemotherapy followed by daily doses of zzso zzso zzso cell counts were monitored through zzso flow zzso Blood and collection flows varied in the range of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were enriched zzso in the zzso product as compared to peripheral blood at a processed blood volume lower than one total blood zzso Efficiency continuously declined, on to a zzso concentration at a processed blood volume above the zzso total blood zzso Total collection efficiency, calculated from the absolute content of zzso zzso cells in peripheral blood and zzso concentrate (a zzso for zzso cell zzso during the zzso reached a plateau at a processed blood volume above the zzso total blood zzso However, variation among individual patients was zzso The concentration rate of zzso cells at a zzso count below zzso averaged 50 and declined continuously to 8 at zzso counts between 45,000 and zzso To zzso in zzso of patients with zzso counts below zzso and zzso zzso cell counts above zzso more than zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso body weight could be collected in a single zzso According to the presented data, the variation in overall collection efficiency is mainly due to: 1) varying zzso of zzso during the zzso procedures itself and 2) dependence on peripheral zzso zzso
