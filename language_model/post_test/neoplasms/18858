Known for years as professional zzso zzso cells zzso are also endowed with zzso zzso This dual role of DC as killers and zzso may have important implications for tumor zzso However, the zzso activity of zzso has mainly been investigated in animal zzso Cancer cells inhibit zzso immune responses using numerous mechanisms, including the induction of zzso zzso zzso that have lost their ability to present zzso in an zzso zzso In this study, we evaluated the possibility of generating tumor killer zzso from patients with zzso zzso We demonstrate that human zzso zzso are endowed with significant zzso activity against tumor cells following zzso with zzso The mechanism of zzso tumor cell killing primarily involves zzso This observed zzso activity is restricted to immature zzso Additionally, after killing, these zzso zzso are able to activate tumor zzso T zzso These observations may open important new perspectives for the use of zzso zzso zzso in cancer zzso zzso
