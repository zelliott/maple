This analysis evaluated zzso outcomes and zzso use in patients with bone zzso from solid zzso across three comparative studies of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso data were zzso from three zzso designed zzso phase III studies comparing subcutaneous zzso zzso with intravenous zzso acid zzso monthly in patients with bone zzso from breast cancer zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso or other solid zzso zzso zzso severity, pain zzso zzso quality of life and zzso use were zzso 

At zzso approximately half of patients had zzso pain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delayed onset of zzso pain by zzso zzso zzso vs zzso hazard ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso risk zzso and clinically meaningful increases in overall pain interference by zzso zzso zzso vs zzso hazard ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso risk zzso compared with zzso zzso Strong zzso use and worsening of zzso quality of life were less common with zzso 

Across three large studies of patients with advanced solid zzso and bone zzso zzso prevented progression of pain severity and pain interference more effectively than zzso zzso
