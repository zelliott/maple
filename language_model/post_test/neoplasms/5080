To develop a list of zzso to guide decisions on priorities for preventive action in Australian zzso 

The following criteria provided the assessment framework to establish a list of priority zzso evidence of zzso using International Agency for Research on Cancer zzso zzso use in occupational circumstances; and use in Australia zzso Literature from national and international agencies relating to zzso and industrial practice informed the zzso 

The final priority list contained 38 established or probable zzso agents that are present in Australian zzso Agents were grouped into the following zzso combustion products, zzso zzso organic zzso metals, radiation, other industrial chemicals and zzso zzso The priorities are based primarily on the potential for occupational exposure and evidence of use in Australian industry because there is limited information on the prevalence and level of exposure to occupational zzso in zzso 

The priority list of agents can provide direction for future disease burden studies to establish the prevalence and levels of exposure to zzso amongst Australian zzso From a policy viewpoint, a priority list will allow regulators to focus on activities such as setting exposure standards and restricting zzso and zzso
