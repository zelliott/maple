The aim of this study was to analyze the clinical and zzso features of the 56 still alive patients at our institution harboring a functional first zzso transplant since more than 30 zzso The mean zzso graft survival in all patients was zzso zzso zzso years, the mean serum zzso concentration was zzso zzso 7 zzso and the mean urinary protein concentration was zzso zzso zzso zzso Fifty-one percent of the patients had experienced cancer involving the skin zzso and/or other zzso zzso zzso was diagnosed in zzso of the patients with chronic viral zzso B and/or C zzso The zzso patient survival rate zzso after the 30th transplantation zzso was zzso in patients presenting a tumor versus zzso in those zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso the proportions of the memory and zzso T cell subsets, and the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso T cells did not differ from those observed in more recently transplanted zzso These results suggest that the impact of chronic zzso on some immune functions does not zzso over time and that the observed high prevalence of cancer in these patients may be related to the synergistic effects of decreased zzso and the time required for zzso
