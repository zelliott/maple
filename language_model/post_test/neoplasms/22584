to observe the effect of zzso on the zzso and zzso mice after chemotherapy, and explore the zzso of zzso and zzso function in mice zzso by zzso 

mice were injected Cy zzso except control group , then randomly divided into mode zzso positive zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso 80, 40 zzso All mice were treated respectively for 10 successive zzso The pathological changes of zzso were observed by HE zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso were measured by zzso kits and its production of zzso and zzso was measured by zzso zzso zzso of white blood cells zzso red blood cell zzso and zzso zzso in the peripheral blood were detected with automated blood cell counter zzso zzso of peripheral blood and bone zzso zzso were observed under the zzso 

zzso could protect the zzso and bone zzso from zzso The proliferation of zzso and killing activity of zzso cells in zzso treatment groups was all zzso moreover, the population of zzso zzso and zzso were increased zzso 

zzso can improve the state of zzso and zzso mice caused by Cy thus could alleviate the side effect of chemotherapy zzso
