zzso zzso are a recently discovered class of small zzso zzso zzso zzso acids that zzso regulate gene zzso This novel class of molecules zzso a wide array of growth and differentiation processes in human zzso High zzso zzso utilizing the solid phase, array platform, or liquid phase, zzso zzso have variously demonstrated that zzso expression was commonly zzso in human zzso zzso expression profiling has shown promise in defining zzso status in retrospective zzso zzso disagreement remains with respect to the zzso signature for a specific cancer cell type, which appears to depend largely on the zzso zzso Nonetheless, various internally controlled studies have successfully identified the zzso of tumors of unknown origin according to zzso expression zzso The evaluation of zzso expression may also be of zzso value, as best exemplified by the correlation of zzso and zzso levels with disease survival in zzso cell lung zzso
