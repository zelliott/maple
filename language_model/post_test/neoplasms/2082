The understanding of zzso and its relation to zzso and aging is developing zzso A number of new findings are relevant to our understanding and are zzso 1) The zzso rate of zzso DNA damage is estimated to be zzso zzso in humans and an order of magnitude higher in zzso 2) The induction of cell proliferation may be a critical factor in both human cancer and the cancer caused by the maximum tolerated dose zzso of chemicals in zzso 3) About half of all chemicals tested, whether synthetic or natural, are zzso including the group of nature's zzso the main zzso than zzso toxic chemicals in our zzso It is not clear how much, if any, of this high percentage of zzso is due to bias in selection of zzso A reasonable explanation for a very high percentage of all chemicals being zzso at the zzso is that the zzso causes cell proliferation and zzso risk factors for zzso 4) In the evolutionary war between plants and animals, animals have developed layers of general defenses, almost all zzso against a world of natural toxic zzso This means we are well zzso against toxicity at low doses from both man-made and natural zzso Thus, low doses of zzso appear to be both much more common and less hazardous than is generally zzso
