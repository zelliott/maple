The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the relationship between the zzso activity of zzso drugs in the clinic and in fresh human zzso cells from patients, as detected by a zzso zzso zzso The activity of 18 different zzso drugs in fresh human zzso cells ex zzso was zzso in up to 15 samples from each of 13 different diagnoses using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For each drug and diagnosis, relative activity zzso zzso were zzso defined as the fraction of samples within the diagnosis having a survival index zzso less than the median zzso for the drug in all tested zzso Clinical response rates for the drug in the same diagnoses were collected from published phase II trials and were compared with the zzso using zzso rank correlation zzso and zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso could be calculated for 12 zzso The zzso varied between zzso and zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso but for most drugs the correlation between zzso and clinical response rates was good, with zzso zzso zzso and R zzso zzso zzso correlations were observed for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively), which might be due to old clinical data, and for zzso zzso zzso zzso which perhaps could be explained by in zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso The 18 drugs were also zzso according to their suggested clinical use in solid or zzso zzso and were then compared regarding the activity in solid compared with zzso zzso ex zzso expressed as the ratio between the number of zzso among solid and zzso zzso zzso zzso The mean ex zzso zzso ratios in the group of drugs registered for use in zzso zzso was only zzso and was significantly different zzso zzso zzso from the mean zzso ratios for the drugs used in both zzso and solid zzso zzso and in solid zzso only zzso Furthermore, the zzso could identify the 50% most and least sensitive diagnoses with respect to clinical phase II activity with zzso zzso correct zzso The results indicate that the relative activity of zzso drugs in different diagnoses may be detected by the zzso Thus, zzso II trials ex zzso using zzso zzso zzso might be used to make clinical trials more effective by targeting trials to diagnoses in which a new agent is most likely to be zzso
