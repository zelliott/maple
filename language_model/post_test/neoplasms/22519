zzso research is one of the emerging research fields in biomedical zzso During the last few decades, a collection of useful tools (both to design the experiments and to analyze the zzso and databases are zzso This review chapter discusses basic tools which are used to detect zzso islands and the zzso Start Site zzso and discusses experimental design and analysis, mainly of zzso zzso During the last years, an enormous amount of experimental data had been generated and zzso zzso we describe some zzso databases, with a special focus on DNA zzso and zzso Some general cancer databases are discussed as well, as they might reveal the link between the results from zzso experiments and their biological influence on the development or progression of zzso Next, some novel zzso approaches in zzso are discussed, for instance used to predict the zzso state of a promoter in certain zzso To show a possible data analysis strategy of an zzso zzso in cancer research, there is a showcase where a zzso zzso generated on zzso cancer samples, is zzso This demonstrates how a zzso zzso might look like and the different steps in a possible analysis strategy and how to interpret the zzso
