A series of zzso complexes of zzso zzso zzso where zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso These complexes zzso have been characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and single crystal zzso for zzso and zzso and for zzso zzso The X-ray crystal structures reveal that the complexes zzso and zzso are zzso in the solid state in which the copper atoms adopt a distorted zzso zzso In both the cases, the neutral zzso zzso zzso have been coordinated to the zzso through the zzso atom in a terminal zzso The complexes have been screened for their in zzso zzso activity in human cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso They show a moderate zzso against these seven human cancer cell lines comparable to that of the less active standard zzso drugs used for zzso They were also screened for their zzso activity and were found less active than the standard drug zzso
