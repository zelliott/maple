As zzso screening aims to improve the prognosis through earlier zzso zzso progression and screening test sensitivity zzso represent key parameters in the evaluation of screening zzso We will here study some methods for zzso of zzso progression and zzso and show how previously used methods can be combined and developed to zzso more of the data available in modern screening zzso zzso et zzso recently suggested a study design using interview data about time since previous screening to estimate zzso progression and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso While useful, the approach does not zzso zzso size zzso nor link zzso progression to zzso zzso zzso we will here propose formulas for zzso zzso progression and zzso using a continuous zzso growth zzso To estimate zzso progression and zzso zzso growth zzso are followed from one screening to the next, and probabilities for all combinations of zzso sizes at repeated screening examinations zzso Based on the probabilities for screening detection on subsequent screening zzso maximum likelihood estimates are zzso zzso to Norwegian data, the new approach gives similar results to previously published results based on zzso data, confirming the earlier estimated large variation in zzso growth zzso
