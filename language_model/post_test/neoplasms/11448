The primary aim of the current study was to determine whether zzso tumor response is associated with zzso outcomes such as symptom response or zzso quality of zzso 

A zzso was conducted of 21 available studies from zzso that provided data sufficient for examining the association between tumor response and zzso zzso including symptom response and zzso quality of zzso A second aim was to examine the influence of possible zzso study variables on effect size zzso 

As hypothesized, zzso outcome improvement rates were most frequently associated with patients classified as a complete or partial response zzso followed by those with stable disease zzso and progressive disease zzso zzso effect sizes were observed between the zzso and zzso zzso size of zzso and zzso and zzso categories zzso size of zzso A weak effect size was found between zzso and zzso zzso size of zzso raising concern over the zzso of the zzso zzso No significant correlations were found between effect size and patient or study zzso zzso associations existed between treatment duration and age, study zzso survival, and symptom response rates, especially among zzso zzso 

Despite significant zzso zzso an important association exists in the correlation between tumor response and formal measures of change in zzso zzso A better understanding of this relation would be enhanced if future reports included estimates of effect size in zzso outcome change by tumor response zzso zzso zzso limitations, and directions for future research are zzso
