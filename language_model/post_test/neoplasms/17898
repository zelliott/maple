The gene zzso has been fashioned as the zzso of the zzso and as zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso whose function must be zzso in order for zzso to zzso The ubiquitous expression of truncated zzso protein zzso results in zzso zzso of laboratory mouse strains engineered for expressing such zzso These facts have been construed in the argument that zzso evolved in order to protect organisms with renewable zzso from developing cancer yet, because zzso is also an zzso of cellular zzso or zzso after extensive DNA damage, it becomes a limiting factor for tissue renewal by depleting zzso from zzso cells thus leading to zzso zzso From that point of view zzso displays zzso zzso contributing to the establishment of degenerative diseases and zzso zzso zzso suppression becomes a balancing act between cancer prevention and zzso Nevertheless, here we present current evidence showing that the aforementioned argument is rather inconsistent and zzso on evolutionary zzso The evolutionary perspective indicates that zzso evolved so as to play a subtle but very important role during development while its role as a zzso is only important in animals that are protected from most sources of zzso zzso thus suggesting that zzso was primarily selected for its zzso role and not as a zzso Therefore no real zzso zzso can be attached to zzso functions and their relationship with zzso zzso might be a laboratory zzso
