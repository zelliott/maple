Many papers have been published on the measurement for specific treatment machines and/or techniques of the dose to points outside the primary zzso often called the peripheral dose zzso Most papers concern zzso in zzso We report on the results of a comparison of estimates of the zzso based on these phantom zzso with zzso measured on zzso 

A special holder with zzso zzso was placed against the zzso of patients referred to our institute for radiation zzso The measured dose was then compared with the dose calculated on the basis of published zzso zzso 

For all zzso together, the calculated values exceeded the measured zzso by about zzso with a standard zzso of zzso The correlation varied between specific zzso but the difference between measurement and calculation did not exceed zzso 

We conclude that published zzso data can be used to accurately predict the peripheral dose in the clinical zzso
