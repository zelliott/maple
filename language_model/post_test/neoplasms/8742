zzso cancer cells with vitamin B12 zzso is hampered by unwanted zzso tissue zzso zzso by zzso zzso to good manufacturing practice, we have developed a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso shows no binding to zzso but is recognized by zzso a protein present in the circulation and notably expressed in many tumor zzso In this prospective study, we investigated zzso zzso of zzso in 10 patients with various zzso zzso 

Ten patients with zzso zzso cancer were zzso Dynamic imaging was started immediately after injection of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were obtained at 10, 30, 60, zzso and 240 zzso and after 24 zzso The relative tumor activity using zzso over the tumor region after 4 h was measured in comparison to zzso lung zzso Patients zzso received between 20 and 1,000 zzso of zzso zzso before injection of zzso The study population comprised 4 patients with zzso of the zzso 3 with zzso cell zzso of the zzso region, 1 with prostate zzso 1 with breast, and 1 with colon zzso 

The median age of the study group was 61 zzso 11 zzso Six of 10 patients showed positive tumor zzso on zzso zzso zzso The scan was positive in 1 patient with colon zzso in 3 of 4 lung zzso in 1 of 3 zzso zzso cell zzso and in 1 breast zzso Renal zzso was between zzso and zzso for the left zzso zzso with zzso increased the tumor zzso and improved zzso zzso The best image quality was achieved with a zzso of zzso zzso of cold zzso The mean patient dose was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

To our knowledge, we report for the first time on zzso imaging in patients with zzso cancer disease and show that tumor targeting is zzso
