One of the major causes of failure of cancer chemotherapy is the proliferation of specific drug-resistant tumor cells during zzso zzso tumor cells, however, usually bear zzso changes which are related to the resistance zzso New zzso against resistant cells could be possible if we were able to characterize these zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso show zzso zzso drug zzso to other unrelated zzso zzso and zzso zzso possess an enhanced outward transport of zzso agents, which results in a low zzso of zzso agents in the zzso The cells express unique zzso in the plasma zzso and possess a higher calcium content in the zzso They also have zzso zzso and zzso zzso regions in zzso By targeting for these zzso changes, we have established new zzso against drug-resistant tumor zzso zzso channel zzso inhibited the enhanced outward transport of VCR and zzso from resistant tumor cells, and thus overcame resistance to these zzso This approach showed potential usefulness in clinical zzso Another possible approach against drug-resistant tumor cells could be the zzso of zzso zzso against unique zzso in the plasma membrane of resistant tumor zzso We have developed zzso zzso against zzso human zzso leukemia zzso Our recent progress with work on calcium channel zzso and zzso zzso are discussed in this zzso
