We determined the primary structures of various zzso zzso as well as of their normal counterparts by zzso zzso zzso The results clearly indicated that zzso zzso are mostly formed by zzso of zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso no new zzso transcripts have so far been found in tumor zzso Among the modified zzso affected by zzso zzso and Y base are the most zzso In various tumor zzso species, zzso Y base located next to the zzso is zzso to form zzso zzso Y base lacking zzso and zzso zzso This Y base analog should be a good marker for analyzing the state of cancer zzso zzso located in the first position of the zzso is partly or completely replaced by zzso in all tumor cells tested so zzso The amount of zzso decreased markedly when the cells differentiated into mature zzso cells, with zzso increase of zzso This indicates that the presence of zzso is closely related to the state of the cells, not merely to the fast growth rate of tumor zzso The zzso zzso zzso which is a key zzso in zzso of zzso in zzso zzso Q base into zzso by a zzso zzso is active in both tumor cells and normal zzso Administration of chemically zzso Q base to zzso mice resulted in complete conversion of zzso to zzso in tumor cells, indicating that zzso added Q base is effectively incorporated into zzso Various Q base zzso that can be used as zzso for zzso zzso were zzso zzso These compounds may be used for clinical cancer diagnosis, since they should be incorporated selectively into zzso in tumor zzso In addition to use as cancer zzso zzso it should be possible to develop new Q base zzso that induce zzso or blocking of protein synthesis after zzso into zzso
