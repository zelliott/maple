The cell surface analysis is a very useful tool to diagnose tumor cells, especially zzso disorders such as leukemia and zzso Particularly zzso to the recent spread of flow zzso and development of zzso zzso a single color analysis has become to be used as routine clinical series at many zzso Recently a two color analysis with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has become to be easily applied to a cell surface zzso and a more detail analysis has become to be available in studying cell surface zzso By using a two color zzso it has been found that adult T cell leukemia cells, which are positive for zzso zzso T zzso in a single color analysis, are derived from zzso zzso T cells zzso zzso The increased cells in zzso have also been identified to be positive for zzso and zzso simultaneously zzso We conclude that a two color analysis is a very useful tool to study more detail and precise cell surface zzso A flow chart to diagnose zzso disorders with cell surface markers is also proposed in this zzso
