zzso zzso 10 zzso is expressed at high levels on the cell surface of almost all zzso zzso zzso but is absent in most normal zzso In a previous study, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed considerable therapeutic efficacy in zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of the present study was to zzso the factors associated with this therapeutic efficacy of zzso zzso 

zzso expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line) and zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by the cell binding zzso and their zzso was evaluated by incubation with zzso zzso in zzso zzso study of zzso zzso zzso was performed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso For therapeutic studies, zzso and zzso zzso mice were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and 200 zzso after which the change in tumor volume was zzso zzso zzso was performed on the excised zzso 

zzso level of zzso on zzso was much greater than that on zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was much higher in zzso zzso mice than in zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, at 48 h after zzso In zzso zzso substantial tumor size reduction was observed in all mice treated with zzso zzso zzso volume decreased to less than zzso zzso at 11 days after zzso and tumor regrowth was not observed in most of zzso In contrast, only slow progression was observed in zzso zzso When incubated with zzso zzso high zzso was needed to damage zzso zzso study indicated zzso of zzso zzso 

The therapeutic efficacy of zzso seems to largely depend on the tumor zzso
