zzso zzso constitute major mechanisms of zzso in human zzso The zzso zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso which is expressed in many normal human zzso and zzso zzso plays a major role in the distribution and zzso of drugs and is involved in intrinsic and acquired drug resistance of zzso The regulation of zzso expression is complex and has not been well studied in a clinical zzso In this review, we zzso molecular signaling and zzso interactions that govern zzso expression and the development of zzso in zzso We focus on acquired expression of zzso that is associated with zzso instability of cancer cells, including zzso events that alter zzso structures, gene zzso and zzso in tumor zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso which guard the integrity of zzso In addition, zzso modifications of the zzso zzso and far upstream promoters by either zzso of DNA or zzso of zzso zzso play a pivotal role in inducing zzso zzso We describe a molecular network that coordinates genetic and zzso events leading to the zzso of zzso These zzso insights provide additional zzso targets and potential strategies to deal with clinical zzso
