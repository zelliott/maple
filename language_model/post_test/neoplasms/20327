The results of the present study of the zzso zzso in a broad panel of human cell lines zzso zzso zzso and biopsy specimens zzso zzso zzso from both normal and zzso zzso can be summarized as zzso zzso zzso in primary cultures from normal zzso express very low levels of the zzso protein while strong nuclear zzso of zzso can be seen in all zzso 40 transformed human cell lines and the vast majority of zzso cell lines zzso zzso Similarly, in human zzso strong nuclear zzso expression is found in high proportion of zzso of various zzso in contrast to benign zzso zzso zzso surrounding zzso zzso and normal zzso in which the zzso protein levels remain below the limits zzso by common zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso revealed point zzso in the central region of the zzso gene in several cancer cell zzso Furthermore, very good correlation was found between the presence of such zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso This study confirms and extends our current view of zzso as the gene most frequently altered in human cancer and suggests that simple zzso methods can be used to screen for aberrations of this zzso
