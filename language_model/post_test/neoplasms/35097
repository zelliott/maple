We isolated a zzso zzso zzso originating from the zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso cell line, zzso The sequence was highly expressed in various tumor zzso and tumor lines in rats, mice and zzso In rats, the expression of the sequence was also observed in fetal liver of 7 and 10 days of zzso to some extent in the zzso liver, yet was sparse in normal adult zzso Additionally, this expression was induced when adult rat zzso in primary zzso cultures proliferated by the addition of zzso growth factor and zzso Southern zzso analysis showed no major gene amplification and zzso between zzso from zzso and normal liver of the same zzso In addition, in zzso nuclear zzso zzso revealed that a zzso clone corresponding to the zzso zzso to the nascent zzso from isolated zzso of zzso but not from those of normal rat zzso All these observations suggest that the expression of the zzso sequence we isolated is closely associated with cell growth and is regulated at the zzso zzso
