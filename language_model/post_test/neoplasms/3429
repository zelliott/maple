We attempted a zzso study of cancer risk change in time using the follow-up data of the zzso zzso rate zzso of cancer in Japan, which covered 13 zzso types of both sexes in zzso and ranged from 1975 to 1993 in zzso The purpose of our study was to test whether or not there was any mathematical zzso that was to condition cancer risk changes in time in all the 13 human zzso zzso We investigated the relation between 2 zzso as regards log zzso changes in time by the direct successive elimination method of zzso a fitness test of a given pair data to an equilibrium zzso The fitness test was repeated in each of 156 tumor pairs zzso in both zzso in each of 3 zzso zzso coordinates - the original zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso coordinates and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Total number of fitness test in this study was estimated to be zzso The zzso zzso zzso coordinates and the zzso zzso zzso coordinates were defined each as an zzso zzso framework with its zzso axis crossed at a right angle to the zzso line of the original log zzso data, and as another framework with its zzso axis run in parallel with the zzso line of the original log zzso zzso The fitness of a given tumor to an equilibrium system was assessed in terms of the correlation zzso value r within the range of zzso (the zzso equilibrium zzso to zzso (the tumor zzso zzso equilibrium zzso zzso obtained are given as zzso zzso the zzso rates of the fitness test to the zzso equilibrium system and the tumor zzso zzso system in the male zzso population were each zzso zzso tumor zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso and those in the female zzso population were each zzso zzso tumor zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso Evidence was available to indicate that all of the 13 human zzso types of both sexes was associated with both zzso zzso and tumor zzso gene zzso at the level of individual zzso In other words, clearance of both zzso zzso and tumor zzso gene zzso was the sine zzso non premise of zzso zzso The zzso score profiles of a given tumor zzso presentation of zzso score for each zzso for each of 2 cancer genes and for each sex, was highly specific for each of the 26 tumor units (13 tumors of both zzso The presence of a highly specific zzso score pattern might be taken as another expression of complex interaction of 2 cancer genes in zzso zzso Evidence was presented to suggest that specified interactions of the zzso zzso gene complexes of both sexes might be zzso related to the emergence of sex discrimination of cancer risk, as testified in a set of tumors with both male dominance of cancer risk and female dominance of cancer zzso zzso The significance of one tumor pair that failed to show fitness to both the zzso equilibrium system and the tumor zzso zzso equilibrium system was discussed in terms of zzso restricted zzso of the power center of the zzso equilibrium system from that of the tumor zzso zzso equilibrium system in a given tumor zzso
