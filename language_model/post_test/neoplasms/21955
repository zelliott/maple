A unique zzso population, zzso zzso cells, has been revealed to be a key player in both the innate and acquired immune responses, including zzso zzso Recent studies revealed that at least two zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso type I, having zzso zzso zzso and type II, having zzso zzso zzso The specific zzso zzso zzso effectively stimulates mouse and human type I zzso zzso The zzso of type I zzso cells substantially influences function of other various cell types, particularly DC, zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso T cells, all contributing to the zzso immune zzso Recent studies also indicated that, unlike type I zzso cells, type II zzso cells have a potential to repress zzso immune zzso In this review, we zzso the characteristics of the zzso immune responses zzso by both mouse and human zzso zzso cells and discuss their potential in clinical applications against zzso
