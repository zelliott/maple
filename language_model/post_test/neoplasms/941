The aim of this study was to create an alternative zzso of the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso reporter gene with reduced zzso capacity for zzso zzso but not zzso compounds that will allow for successful PET zzso 

A new zzso of zzso reporter zzso suitable for PET imaging using zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso contains an zzso substitution at position 176 zzso of the zzso binding region of the zzso 

The zzso product showed favorable zzso characteristics toward zzso zzso while exhibiting reduced activity with zzso zzso In order to enhance zzso reporter activity with zzso zzso we introduced the zzso substitution into the more active zzso zzso zzso human zzso cells zzso with the zzso double zzso reporter gene showed high zzso zzso zzso and low zzso zzso analog zzso in zzso PET imaging also demonstrated high zzso and low zzso zzso in zzso zzso The feasibility of imaging two independent zzso zzso zzso in the same animal with PET was zzso Two opposite zzso expressing the zzso reporter gene and the previously described zzso zzso of zzso zzso reporter zzso were zzso using a short-lived zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso respectively, administered on 2 consecutive zzso 

We conclude that in combination with zzso zzso reporter zzso a zzso zzso containing the zzso substitution could be used for PET imaging of two different cell populations or concurrent molecular biological processes in the same living zzso
