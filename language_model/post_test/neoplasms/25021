zzso in tumors deviates significantly from that of normal zzso Increasingly, the underlying zzso zzso pathways are being considered as novel targets for cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso small zzso drugs are under investigation for focused zzso of key zzso steps that are zzso by tumors, since such zzso should harbor minimal toxicity towards surrounding normal zzso This review will examine the primary zzso pathways that tumors harness to enhance their zzso capacity, which in turn, help their rapid proliferation and zzso within the zzso It is hoped that zzso drugs can be zzso to interfere with zzso flux pathways active within the zzso and across zzso zzso In fact, the major pathways of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso pathways have been examined as putative targets for drug development, with some drug candidates advancing to phase zzso zzso In this regard, zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso - that zzso the zzso flux in tumors, and the associated zzso metabolism have received the most attention as suitable zzso targets, focused either at the zzso zzso or at the zzso zzso zzso zzso in this review are zzso studies that have led to the discovery of promising drug candidates to target zzso zzso and ensuing patents, with descriptions of the zzso rationale for the zzso strategy of a particular zzso zzso candidate zzso
