During chronic inflammatory processes an excess of free zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso are produced, which zzso cellular zzso and can drive normal cells to zzso zzso zzso DNA bases are generated by reactions of DNA with a major zzso product, zzso We investigated steady state levels of zzso zzso in zzso blood or urine from patients with cancer prone diseases, especially when related to persistent inflammatory zzso We have developed sensitive and specific methods for zzso detection in zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly elevated in patients with Wilson's disease and primary zzso Excess storage of zzso causing zzso stress and zzso zzso are implicated in disease zzso as confirmed by studies in zzso a model for Wilson's zzso When patients with alcohol related zzso fatty liver, zzso and zzso were compared with zzso zzso excess zzso zzso was seen in all patients, except those with zzso zzso zzso in urine was measured in zzso patients diagnosed with chronic zzso zzso and zzso zzso as compared to controls, patients had zzso increased urinary zzso 

zzso zzso may serve as potential markers for assessing progression of inflammatory zzso zzso Also the efficacy of human zzso interventions could be verified by using our zzso urine zzso zzso and zzso that influence the zzso levels of zzso zzso in cancer prone zzso are under zzso
