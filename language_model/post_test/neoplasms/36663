zzso zzso protein zzso is an important zzso factor in the syndrome of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and its importance is evident by the many studies examining either zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or circulating zzso levels in patients with zzso However, the relationship between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and circulating zzso levels in the same group of patients with zzso has not been zzso This study was carried out to explore this relationship in a group of patients with solid zzso associated with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso were localized by in zzso zzso and zzso respectively in 26 zzso zzso and 15 zzso from patients who were either zzso or zzso Plasma zzso and serum zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were localized in 11 zzso per zzso and 10 zzso per zzso of 11 zzso zzso from zzso patients, all of whom had zzso circulating zzso levels, and in 14 zzso per zzso and 11 zzso per zzso respectively of 15 zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were localized in only two zzso per zzso and four zzso per zzso respectively of seven zzso associated with zzso Since the majority of zzso zzso zzso zzso irrespective of the calcium status of the patient, this suggests that the clinical expression of zzso zzso zzso may depend on the rate of zzso of zzso rather than gene zzso and that the zzso of zzso zzso may be modulated by zzso zzso
