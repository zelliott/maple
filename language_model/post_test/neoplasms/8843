Preventing zzso zzso and vomiting zzso is integral to treatment success in patients with zzso This analysis was undertaken to assess the relative efficacy and safety of zzso versus older zzso zzso in preventing zzso associated with moderately or highly zzso zzso 

zzso data from four randomized, zzso phase III trials comparing zzso zzso or zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso zzso included complete response zzso no zzso and no rescue zzso in the acute zzso delayed zzso and overall zzso zzso periods zzso complete control zzso no zzso no rescue zzso and no more than mild zzso number of zzso episodes, and zzso zzso 

zzso rates were significantly higher for zzso zzso versus older zzso zzso zzso in the delayed zzso vs zzso zzso and overall periods zzso vs zzso zzso odds ratios zzso zzso in the zzso delayed, and overall periods were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso rates and zzso severity were observed for the delayed and overall periods and in zzso episodes for all three zzso The zzso of zzso adverse events was similar with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and older zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is more effective than older zzso zzso for controlling zzso in the delayed and overall zzso zzso
