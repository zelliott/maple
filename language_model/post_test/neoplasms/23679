A method is presented for the evaluation of optimal zzso and phase zzso for the radiating elements of a phased array zzso system, in order to achieve desired zzso temperature zzso inside and outside of zzso zzso Use is made of a detailed electromagnetic and zzso model of the heated tissue in order to predict the zzso temperature at any point in zzso zzso zzso are obtained by minimizing the squared error between desired and model predicted temperatures inside the tumor volume, subject to the constraint that temperatures do not exceed an upper bound outside the zzso The penalty function technique is used to solve the constrained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are obtained by a modified Newton zzso zzso results for a four element phased array zzso system are zzso
