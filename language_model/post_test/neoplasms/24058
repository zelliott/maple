Selective induction of vascular damage within tumors represents an emerging approach to cancer zzso zzso studies have shown that several zzso agents can induce vascular damage within tumors but only at doses zzso the maximum tolerated dose, which has limited their clinical zzso In this study, we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso vascular shutdown within tumors at doses less than one-tenth of the maximum tolerated zzso In zzso studies indicate that a short drug exposure results in profound long-term zzso effects against zzso zzso cells but not cells that are zzso prior to and during drug zzso zzso shutdown, within experimental and human breast cancer models in zzso following systemic drug administration, was demonstrated with a reduction in functional vascular volume of zzso at 6 h following drug administration and persisted over the next 12 zzso with corresponding zzso consistent with zzso necrosis resulting from vascular zzso These actions against tumor zzso and the broad therapeutic window demonstrate the clinical potential of these drugs and warrant further study to zzso the mechanisms responsible for the zzso effects of zzso zzso
