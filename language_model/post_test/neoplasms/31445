The article discusses the possible mechanisms of the zzso effect of hypoxic zzso agents zzso when they are used in low zzso zzso Experimental and clinical studies provide evidence of the occurrence of stages which in administration of zzso into the organisms of the zzso may develop in succession, leading to stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the hypoxic zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso of the tumor cells, and presentation of the zzso of zzso in association with the main complex of class I zzso zzso zzso of these cells by zzso This process may be similar to that in contact sensitivity to zzso compounds (a zzso of the reaction of delayed hypersensitivity zzso in the zzso zzso It is suggested that direct control of the effect of zzso on the zzso and/or tumor cells may occur zzso to or zzso with this process as the result of interaction of these compounds with the surface or zzso zzso It cannot be excluded that the activated zzso may force the zzso zzso out of the zzso centers of these receptors and realize zzso control of gene zzso
