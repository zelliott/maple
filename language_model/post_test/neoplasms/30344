Few studies have assessed the impact of pre-existing medical zzso on long-term survival after major zzso This study investigated the influence of zzso as measured by the zzso zzso Index zzso on the zzso mortality after major traumatic zzso 

Adult patients who survived their initial trauma admission in zzso Alberta, Canada, between April 1, 2002, and March 31, 2006, defined the study zzso Clinical and outcome information was obtained from regional electronic zzso

zzso illnesses have an important influence on long-term outcomes after major zzso Whether this represents an inherent risk for adverse outcome or an opportunity for enhanced medical zzso remains to be zzso
