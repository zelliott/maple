The aim of this retrospective single center analysis was to compare possible long-term benefits of two different zzso zzso zzso induction therapies after cardiac zzso 

A total of 484 primary cardiac transplanted patients received induction therapy with two different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All patients received zzso maintenance therapy with zzso zzso and zzso zzso rejection was assessed by serial zzso zzso Surveillance of graft zzso was performed by zzso 1, 3, and 5 years after zzso 

zzso survival was significantly better in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had a lower rate of death from rejection zzso zzso zzso zzso and graft zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso After 5 years, freedom from rejection was zzso in the zzso group compared to zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso appeared in zzso of zzso patients and in zzso of zzso patients zzso zzso infections occurred more often in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso although there was no difference in appearance of zzso disease (17 zzso zzso Freedom from zzso zzso disease was comparable between the two zzso 

These results suggest that there are differences between rabbit zzso zzso The superior prevention of rejection with zzso may be the reason for the lower rate of graft zzso
