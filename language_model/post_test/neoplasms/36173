zzso assessments on images are crucial to clinical decision making, especially in cancer patients, in whom zzso of zzso are tracked over zzso However, the potential value of quantitative approaches to imaging is zzso by the difficulty and zzso nature of compiling this information from prior studies and reporting corresponding information on current zzso The authors believe that the quantitative imaging work flow can be automated by making zzso data zzso zzso In this article, they demonstrate the utility of the zzso and Image zzso standard in a World Wide Web-based application that was developed to automatically zzso prior and current quantitative imaging zzso The system zzso the Response zzso zzso in Solid zzso zzso along with several alternative indicators of cancer treatment response, by using the data stored in the zzso zzso The application also allows the user to overlay the recorded metrics on the original images for visual zzso Clinical evaluation of the system demonstrates its potential utility in accelerating the standard zzso work flow and in providing a means to evaluate alternative response metrics that are difficult to zzso by zzso The system, which illustrates the utility of capturing quantitative information in a standard format and linking it to the image from which it was zzso could enhance quantitative imaging in clinical practice without adversely affecting the current work zzso
