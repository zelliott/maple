zzso acid zzso the zzso zzso was evaluated for its potential to protect against zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso was administered to Swiss zzso mice orally ad zzso at the doses of 5, 10 or 25 zzso body weight in drinking water to set DNA damage in cells, which was characterized in mouse peripheral blood zzso cells and bone zzso cells using zzso gel zzso and analyses of generated zzso for Tail moment, Tail DNA and Tail zzso DNA damage was dose zzso zzso by LA was zzso LA zzso 10 and 25 zzso body weight zzso in zzso zzso and zzso administration schedule zzso DNA damage substantially in both cell zzso Protection by LA was also dose zzso LA zzso DNA damage by zzso in zzso relaxation zzso A negligible DNA damage resulted during interaction of zzso and zzso Compared to zzso LA emerged as a better zzso and least DNA zzso In conclusion, our study advocated an experimental therapeutic research potential in LA against zzso DNA damage for reduction of occupational cancer risk in zzso
