The zzso family of proteins is zzso as class III zzso zzso that play complex and important roles in zzso pathological conditions such as cancer and the deregulation of zzso There are seven members in humans, divided into four classes, and zzso zzso zzso can be found in most forms of life, including both zzso and zzso The highly zzso zzso core domain composed of a large zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fold zzso suggests that these proteins belong to a family of zzso zzso Along with their function in regulating cellular metabolism in response to stressful conditions, they are implicated in zzso a wide variety of zzso this increases the complexity of zzso the interplay of zzso and their zzso Over the past few years, all of these new findings have attracted the interest of researchers exploring potential therapeutic implications related to the function of zzso It remains to be zzso whether, indeed, zzso can serve as molecular targets for the treatment of human zzso
