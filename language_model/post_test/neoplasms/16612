The aim of cancer biology is for a better understanding of the molecular basis of cancer, with the expectation that this will result in therapeutic advances and improved outcomes for zzso The discovery of zzso has contributed much to our understanding of the mechanisms of cell death, in both normal and zzso cells, and it has led to changes in the way that chemotherapy has been zzso It is now increasingly accepted that part of the efficacy of conventional zzso drugs is due to their ability to induce zzso although this area is not without zzso This has allowed advances in the fundamental understanding of zzso to have similar impacts upon cancer zzso It is now possible to construct a framework where cellular decisions about life and death can be seen as the result of a balance of zzso and zzso signals, enacted by protein members of the zzso family, controlling zzso zzso c zzso This framework has allowed the importance of providing death signals and zzso survival signals to both be zzso A range of novel approaches to the induction of zzso by zzso survival zzso are zzso In addition, many alternative strategies aimed at targeting particular molecular abnormalities of zzso cells as a means of inducing zzso are also under investigation and several of these are zzso The zzso understanding of cell death will have profound impacts upon the practice of zzso and outlook for many zzso
