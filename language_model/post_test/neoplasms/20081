zzso are implicated in various cellular zzso Among their target zzso liver X receptors zzso zzso and zzso zzso the cell cycle in a large range of cancer cell zzso Besides their role as cholesterol sensors, zzso are also involved in the zzso balance regulation in various types of zzso 

This review covers zzso and derivatives of cholesterol as well as synthetic or natural zzso zzso of zzso Most tumor cell lines are sensitive to zzso zzso zzso various zzso are concerned such as zzso breast, glioblastoma, zzso and zzso tumors, and zzso 

zzso the use of zzso zzso in human health, especially in the field of cancer, represents a novel and promising zzso Despite a wide spectrum of applications, numerous adverse effects of zzso zzso need to be solved before genuine clinical trials in zzso Future directions will be based on the engineering of selective zzso zzso zzso as already done for nuclear steroid zzso
