This study aimed to zzso the available evidence on the efficacy and safety of zzso zzso zzso 

We searched studies in electronic zzso zzso controlled trials zzso assessing the efficacy of TD zzso comparing with zzso or other zzso drug in zzso cancer pain were zzso The primary end points are zzso pain intensity and pain zzso For zzso data, the summary relative risk zzso and its 95 % confidence zzso zzso were derived using zzso model in view of zzso zzso 

Eight clinical trials zzso zzso zzso were included in the zzso Only a few studies reported the same outcome in similar way, which created difficulty in the pooling of outcome zzso Two studies zzso zzso zzso assessed zzso and showed a significant difference between TD zzso and zzso in all three doses of TD zzso zzso zzso or 70 zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso I zzso 0 zzso the zzso was zzso zzso Two studies zzso zzso zzso showed a comparable requirement for rescue zzso zzso between TD zzso and zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso I zzso 0 zzso The preferred outcome measure zzso % pain zzso was not reported in any included zzso On the basis of summary quality, further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the zzso 

zzso zzso has an increasing role for the relief of cancer zzso Further research in this field is zzso zzso studies in this field using a common protocol and strict supervision will be more zzso
