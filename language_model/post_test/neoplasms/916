The zzso system is an zzso zzso zzso network zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso degrading zzso The zzso zzso is predominantly expressed in zzso but is also zzso with the zzso zzso in peripheral zzso In recent years, CB zzso zzso including zzso have been proposed as potential zzso zzso 

This review critically discusses the pharmacology of CB zzso zzso as a novel therapeutic zzso strategy in terms of zzso zzso tissue specificity and zzso zzso zzso effects zzso by cannabinoids are not confined to zzso of cancer cell zzso cannabinoids also reduce zzso cell migration and zzso inhibit zzso and zzso inflammatory zzso In the last decade several new selective zzso and zzso zzso agents have been zzso but most studies in the area of cancer research have used zzso CB zzso Moreover, many of these zzso exert prominent CB zzso pharmacological effects, such as zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma and the transient zzso potential zzso zzso 

The role of the zzso system in zzso is still poorly understood and the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso action need to be zzso The development of zzso zzso agents could be advantageous in light of the unwanted central effects exerted by zzso zzso zzso Probably the most interesting question is whether cannabinoids could be useful in zzso or in combination with established zzso zzso
