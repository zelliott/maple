A zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso structure is designed and zzso via zzso zzso and click zzso The zzso has an zzso maximum at zzso zzso with a quantum yield of zzso and a large zzso shift of 143 zzso in zzso By virtue of its zzso zzso zzso this zzso naturally forms zzso zzso that minimize zzso interaction with zzso in zzso solution, consequently allowing for efficient zzso with zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso can be zzso as a reliable fluorescent probe for targeted cellular imaging of zzso cancer cells such as zzso Considering its low zzso and good zzso the zzso zzso holds great promise in practical imaging zzso This study also provides a molecular engineering strategy to overcome the intrinsic limitations of traditional fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso and linear zzso zzso for zzso and zzso
