The alpha v beta 6 zzso was identified in cultured zzso cells and functions as a zzso zzso We have now used zzso zzso to determine in zzso expression patterns of the beta 6 zzso in normal and pathological human or zzso zzso and during experimental wound healing or induced lung zzso The results indicate that beta 6 expression is restricted to zzso and is zzso in parallel with zzso events, zzso and zzso zzso During development of the zzso zzso and skin, we found that beta 6 is expressed by specific types of zzso cells, whereas it is mostly zzso in normal adult zzso lung and zzso In contrast, we detected high-level expression in several types of zzso For example, beta 6 is almost invariably zzso in zzso cell zzso derived from the oral zzso often zzso localized at the zzso edges of tumor zzso zzso of beta 6 is also zzso in zzso zzso at the wound edge during experimental zzso wound zzso Similarly, beta 6 expression is induced in type II zzso zzso cells during lung injury caused by injection of live zzso We also observed beta 6 expression in adult lungs and zzso at focal sites of zzso zzso as well as in a variety of clinical specimens from patients with chronic or acute inflammation of the lungs or zzso From these findings and earlier results, we zzso that alpha v beta 6 affects cell zzso migration and growth during reorganization of zzso in development, tissue repair, and zzso
