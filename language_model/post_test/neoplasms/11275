To locate geographical sources of engine exhaust emissions in Great Britain and to link them with the birth addresses of children dying from zzso To estimate the cancer initiating roles of nearby roads and railways and to measure effective zzso 

Birth and death addresses of all children born between 1955 and 1980 in Great Britain, and dying from zzso or other cancer during those years, were linked to locations of railway stations, bus stations, ferry zzso zzso roads, canals, and zzso zzso distances to zzso and deaths were measured, and migration data relating to children who had moved house were zzso zzso of close to hazard birth addresses, compared with close to hazard death addresses, indicate a high prenatal or early zzso risk of cancer zzso 

Child cancer birth and death addresses and their map references were extracted from an earlier zzso zzso references of putative hazards were downloaded from the zzso zzso national digital map of Great zzso These data are recorded to a precision of one zzso and have ground zzso around 20 zzso 

zzso birth excesses were found within short distances of bus stations, railway stations, zzso zzso and zzso class roads, with a relative risk of zzso within 100 zzso tapering to neutral after zzso zzso About zzso of child zzso were attributable to these joint birth zzso Roads exerted the major zzso 

Child cancer zzso are strongly determined by prenatal or early zzso zzso to engine exhaust zzso probably through maternal inhalation and zzso of zzso over many zzso The main active substance is probably zzso
