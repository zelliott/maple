Previous research has noted higher cancer mortality rates and lower survival among males than zzso However, systematic comparisons of these two metrics by sex have been zzso 

We extracted zzso vital rates and survival data from the zzso zzso and End zzso Database for 36 zzso by sex and age for the period 1977 to zzso We compared zzso mortality rates and examined zzso mortality rate ratios zzso We also extracted case data which included age and date of diagnosis, sex, primary cancer site, tumor stage and grade, survival time, vital status, and cause of zzso Relative zzso zzso for death in the zzso period following diagnosis were estimated with Cox zzso hazards models, adjusted for zzso 

For the vast majority of zzso zzso mortality rates were higher among males than females with the highest zzso zzso for lip zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso esophagus zzso and urinary zzso zzso zzso survival was, for most zzso worse for males than zzso but such disparities were drastically less than corresponding zzso zzso lip zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso esophagus zzso zzso zzso and urinary zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso differed markedly while cancer survival disparities were much less zzso This suggests that sex-related cancer disparities are more strongly related to zzso than zzso 

Future zzso studies should attempt to understand causes of observed sex disparities in zzso
