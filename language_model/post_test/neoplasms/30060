To investigate the underlying tumor zzso mechanisms and reasons for the high risk of cancer in zzso anemia zzso 

Gene Set zzso Analysis zzso was performed to compare gene expression profiles between 21 zzso patients' bone zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and 11 normal controls in cancer related gene sets from zzso zzso database, then core enriched genes were identified by further zzso Through enrichment analyzing biological processes of gene zzso sets and structural zzso gene sets between zzso expression profiles and control, more details related with its tumor zzso had been zzso 

Compared with normal control, gene expression in zzso group had significant been enriched in resistance to zzso inhibitor gene set, zzso growth factors zzso zzso insulin and zzso growth factors zzso zzso pathways induced cancer genesis gene zzso The high level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression provided an initiate environment for zzso and drug zzso There were significant differences in zzso zzso molecules and zzso structure organizations between zzso and zzso Genes with promoter regions around zzso start sites containing either motif zzso or zzso were enriched and those former genes match zzso for zzso zzso factor 3 zzso 

The high tumor zzso of zzso patients may be closely related with the dramatic changes in cancer related growth factors and hormones zzso This study provides new insights into tumor zzso mechanism in zzso zzso
