We previously found that the efficacy of zzso zzso with zzso an zzso against zzso zzso zzso on colon cancer, was enhanced by local zzso zzso or chemotherapy with zzso zzso In this study, we aimed to further enhance its efficacy by combining these three zzso Human colon cancer zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso in zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso female mice were treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso degrees C for 1 zzso and zzso (30 zzso zzso zzso zzso day zzso for 5 zzso zzso growth zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso where zzso is tumor zzso time, in mice treated with zzso + zzso + zzso was improved to zzso from zzso zzso and zzso with zzso alone, zzso + zzso and zzso + zzso zzso Complete response was observed in 4 out of 8 tumors with zzso + zzso + zzso and 3 out of 10 with zzso + zzso No tumor showed complete response with zzso + zzso or zzso zzso zzso slightly increased zzso of zzso but zzso did not affect zzso Body weight loss was not enhanced by the zzso These results indicate that the combination of three zzso is a feasible approach to enhance the zzso efficacy of zzso without serious increase of zzso
