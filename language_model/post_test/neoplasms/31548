zzso development in different cell types and tissue locations involves many zzso distinct genes and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in fusion genes or promoter swapping are believed to be involved in the early development of many tumor zzso They are present in almost all cases of a particular tumor type and cases have been described that carry only tumor zzso zzso without any signs of other zzso zzso The mechanisms behind zzso zzso in solid tumors are largely zzso zzso is an important factor in zzso zzso but no zzso sequence motifs are made out in the break points of solid zzso The fusion genes found in zzso are dominated by the zzso factor type of genes with the zzso and zzso series of fusion genes as the largest zzso More than 50% of zzso zzso zzso carry fusion proteins with zzso zzso zzso zzso involving zzso zzso and zzso are common in benign zzso tumors and zzso zzso zzso Many zzso tumor zzso show a strict specificity for tumor zzso This specificity can most likely be explained by the specific sets of target genes that are zzso by the fusion gene zzso Identification of the downstream target genes is currently the object of intense research and may provide us with information that will help design better diagnostic tools and eventually find a cure for these zzso
