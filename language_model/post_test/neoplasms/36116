zzso zzso zzso reported as zzso for zzso pose problems in clinical zzso Silver zzso for zzso zzso organizer regions zzso has proved useful in making a zzso differential diagnosis between benign and zzso zzso zzso organizer zzso are zzso of DNA located in zzso zzso These zzso are zzso by silver zzso technique that recognizes these zzso associated proteins which are increased in zzso 

This study aimed to distinguish zzso zzso cells from zzso cells in zzso zzso using these zzso 

A total of 174 zzso zzso received at the Department of zzso zzso during a period of one year were included in the zzso zzso were studied by conventional zzso and zzso zzso zzso counts, variation in size and zzso of zzso dots in zzso were graded and compared in zzso and zzso zzso 

Mean zzso counts of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were significantly zzso zzso zzso greater as compared with counts of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso were irregular in shape in zzso zzso whereas they were comparatively larger, single dots in benign zzso zzso size and zzso were of higher grade in significantly greater proportion of zzso as compared with non zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the zzso suspicious samples, nine were in the zzso range and one was in the benign zzso 

zzso study appears to be clinically useful as an additional diagnostic tool for use in zzso zzso when the zzso diagnosis is zzso
