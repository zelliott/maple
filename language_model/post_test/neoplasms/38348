Previous studies from our laboratory have demonstrated that zzso hormones play a key role in cancer zzso In addition, a zzso form, zzso acid zzso that zzso the zzso action of these hormones was found to possess zzso functions through its ability to inhibit cellular proliferation and zzso The present study was undertaken to investigate whether zzso could also suppress the development of drug resistance, known as a zzso factor of disease zzso zzso was shown to enhance cellular response in zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso A in resistant tumor cell lines derived from zzso zzso and breast zzso The mechanism of action of zzso did not involve expression of classical drug resistance zzso However, zzso zzso zzso in cells was enhanced by zzso suggesting that one or more export mechanisms for zzso agents are zzso zzso was also found to enhance cellular zzso to zzso and zzso suggesting that the agent may target multiple drug resistance zzso zzso has previously been shown to inhibit tumor cell proliferation in zzso In zzso studies reported here revealed that zzso in a zzso regimen was effective in suppressing the growth of a zzso human breast tumor in the nude zzso In this zzso zzso was not zzso indicating that zzso the in zzso restoration of drug sensitivity by zzso may not correlate with in zzso resistance phenomena and zzso zzso is an effective zzso agent in zzso zzso
