Resistance to chemotherapy is a major cause of treatment failure in human zzso zzso evidence has indicated that the acquisition of resistance to zzso drugs involves the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in response to chemotherapy has been observed often in zzso zzso The potential molecular mechanisms by which zzso agents activate the zzso zzso are zzso zzso of this zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso agents via regulation of essential cellular functions such as protein zzso zzso survival and proliferation in zzso How zzso agents induce zzso zzso and how activated zzso zzso zzso through regulation of signaling networks are discussed in this zzso Combining zzso zzso with standard chemotherapy has been successful in increasing the efficacy of zzso agents both in zzso and in zzso Several small molecules have been developed to specifically target zzso and other components of this pathway, which in combination with chemotherapy may be a valid approach to overcome therapeutic zzso We propose several feedback and zzso regulatory mechanisms of signaling networks for maintenance of the zzso activity for cell zzso These regulatory mechanisms may limit the efficacy of zzso zzso therefore, disruption of these mechanisms may be an effective strategy for development of novel zzso zzso
