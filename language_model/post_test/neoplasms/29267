The management of high-dose zzso zzso therapy in patients with cancer depends on the routine monitoring of drug zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso urine zzso patient zzso and other clinical zzso of patient zzso A key factor in patient oversight is the zzso of zzso clearance to minimize drug-related zzso The aim of this investigation was to evaluate the performance of a clinical decision support system and zzso forecasting zzso in the prediction of zzso zzso and assessment of zzso dosing requirements in pediatric and young adult patients with cancer based on the current practice at the Children's Hospital of zzso Fifty patients ranging in age from 8 months to 21 years zzso range, zzso zzso contributing 80 total dosing events zzso zzso serum zzso were zzso The forecasting model was able to consistently predict future zzso zzso with the knowledge of one prior concentration and continued to improve with additional concentration data made available through daily therapeutic drug zzso Precision was good at zzso with low bias at zzso zzso between the decision support system recommendations for zzso rescue relative to the actual zzso administration was also zzso Sixteen patients would have initiated rescue therapy earlier, seven patients would have received a larger dose zzso zzso and zzso would have been given less often for 37 zzso The forecasting zzso in the zzso zzso was reasonably accurate in predicting zzso zzso and should improve further as the underlying model and prediction zzso zzso This decision support system can be useful in helping physicians decide if a patient is clearing zzso as expected or if more aggressive rescue therapy is zzso
