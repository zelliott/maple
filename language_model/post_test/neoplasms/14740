zzso zzso receptors and their zzso have become appealing candidates as molecular therapeutic agents for the treatment of zzso zzso growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso transition factor zzso play a role in many human tumors, promoting cell proliferation and invasion, as well as resistance to zzso zzso being developed by Amgen zzso is a humanized zzso directed against zzso and is thus able to interfere with the interaction between zzso and zzso to prevent zzso zzso In zzso studies, zzso effectively blocked zzso zzso zzso zzso downstream signaling zzso In phase I clinical trials, zzso was well tolerated at doses up to 20 zzso every 2 zzso Data from zzso studies and a phase zzso trial demonstrated that zzso had an additive effect when combined with zzso agents, leading to the initiation of several phase II trials that are enrolling patients with different tumor types to assess combinations of zzso with zzso regimens, as well as with other zzso Which tumor types might benefit most from treatment with zzso remains to be determined, and the identification of candidate patients will be a critical issue for the further development of this zzso
