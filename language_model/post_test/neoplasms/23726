zzso are among the most important agents used in cancer zzso zzso the zzso and zzso are active drugs for both induction and maintenance chemotherapy of childhood and adult zzso while the new zzso zzso are active against zzso cell zzso with promising activity against other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso are being used in the treatment of several solid zzso Recent advances in the clinical pharmacology of widely used zzso have shown a relationship among dose, plasma zzso and clearance with the toxicity and zzso zzso Thus, it has been shown that zzso control of zzso administration is possible, limiting the toxicity of this zzso Recent advances in the zzso of, for example, zzso and zzso will possibly enable researchers to identify patients who may have an increased risk of zzso For zzso some evidence has been obtained to identify populations at risk of no zzso In addition, for most zzso convincing evidence of their zzso zzso metabolism has been zzso thus making it possible to identify patients who are likely to respond to zzso These studies zzso zzso of active zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of target zzso such as zzso zzso have made it possible to develop the basis of zzso zzso is, specific manipulation of zzso metabolism of the zzso It is anticipated that new technical developments in molecular biology, zzso cell biology and zzso will make it possible to improve the identification of resistant patients in order to zzso specifically drug metabolism in the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been successful in achieving significant improvements in treatment and currently is a zzso in cancer zzso Together with the development of promising new zzso zzso zzso (with other drugs, zzso will be a major strategy for the zzso
