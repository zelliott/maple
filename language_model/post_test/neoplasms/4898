zzso type 3 zzso zzso replicates zzso in zzso zzso zzso shows synergistic in zzso zzso in combination with zzso and zzso The purpose of this phase zzso study was to assess zzso combined with zzso in patients with advanced zzso 

Patients were initially treated in a zzso phase I trial with intravenous zzso days 1 to 5, zzso zzso under curve zzso 5, day zzso and zzso zzso zzso day 1) zzso zzso was escalated through three dose zzso 3 zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso were to define the maximum tolerated dose and zzso toxicity and to recommend a dose for phase II zzso Secondary zzso included zzso immune response, and zzso zzso A subsequent phase II study using the 3 zzso zzso zzso dose characterized the response rate in patients with head and neck zzso 

Thirty-one heavily zzso patients received study zzso There were no zzso zzso during zzso and most zzso were grade zzso zzso effectiveness rates were as zzso one patient had a complete response zzso six patients zzso had partial response, two patients zzso had major clinical responses clinically evaluated in radiation zzso zzso which are not zzso by Response zzso zzso in Solid zzso zzso nine patients zzso had stable disease, and eight patients zzso had disease zzso zzso shedding was minimal and zzso immune responses were attenuated compared with previous zzso data for zzso 

The combination of zzso plus zzso is well tolerated with evidence of activity in cancer of the head and zzso A zzso phase III study is currently open for zzso
