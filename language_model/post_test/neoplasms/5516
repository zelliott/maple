For nearly two decades, studies in the cancer research field zzso on identifying genes that act as positive and negative regulators of cell zzso Only relatively recently was it recognized that the regulation of cell death zzso is also an important zzso of zzso At least two genes linked to human zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to regulate zzso The correlation between zzso modulating genes and human zzso raises an important question as to how zzso of zzso contributes to zzso transformation and zzso cell zzso Cell culture studies have clearly demonstrated that zzso can induce and zzso can suppress zzso in response to various zzso Studies of zzso zzso which possess mechanisms for both inducing and evading zzso have also extended our understanding of this zzso On the basis of such findings, several animal models have been developed which begin to address the role of zzso regulation in zzso This chapter discusses those animal models, zzso on zzso (and its zzso and zzso
