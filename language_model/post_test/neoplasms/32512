zzso modification of proteins is an important regulatory zzso Numerous biologically active peptides that play an essential role in zzso contain an evolutionary zzso zzso zzso as a zzso regulatory zzso zzso zzso could therefore be viewed as important zzso Limited zzso of such peptides may lead to quantitative but, importantly, due to the change of zzso zzso also qualitative changes of their signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identical with zzso was for many years believed to be a unique cell membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso end of peptides and zzso zzso a number of other molecules were discovered, exhibiting various degree of structural zzso and zzso zzso activity, capable of zzso similar set of zzso These comprise for example, zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I, II and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is tempting to speculate their potential participation on zzso biological zzso zzso expression and zzso activity of zzso activity and/or structure zzso zzso might corrupt the message carried by their zzso promoting abnormal cell zzso zzso zzso of particular zzso activity using zzso DASH zzso specific zzso or DASH expression modification may be an attractive therapeutic concept in cancer zzso This review summarizes recent information on the interactions between DASH members and their zzso with respect to their possible role in cancer zzso
