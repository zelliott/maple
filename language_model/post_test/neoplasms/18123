zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of signaling zzso It is implicated in and considered a therapeutic target for inflammation and cancer, yet no small zzso zzso for zzso have been zzso To begin the development of specific small zzso zzso of zzso function, we have used a series of surface binding fluorescent zzso to probe the surface zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to bind zzso in a distinct zzso We characterized the binding interaction by determining both the structure of zzso bound to zzso and the structure of zzso bound to zzso to zzso zzso In both cases, two molecules of dye were zzso such that the zzso groups were positioned in two zzso grooves that are formed by the zzso zzso of each zzso We observed that zzso acts as a gatekeeper to the binding zzso adopting an zzso zzso for the more zzso zzso while remaining in a zzso zzso for the more compact zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that zzso binds two copies of zzso each with a zzso of 125 zzso zzso zzso lifetime zzso indicated that the two molecules of zzso bind in two independent binding sites with different zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso is not perfectly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso has a higher affinity for zzso than zzso zzso zzso studies were also used to probe contributions of individual zzso of an zzso triple zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso of zzso which forms part of the zzso zzso occupied by zzso reduced the level of zzso zzso suggesting a potentially important role for the zzso zzso pocket in defining a zzso zzso Additional zzso studies also delineate contributions of zzso and in particular zzso that shows the most significant zzso binding to zzso zzso these data suggest a complex interaction between zzso and the much larger zzso These studies form the basis for the development of small zzso reporters and zzso of zzso form and zzso
