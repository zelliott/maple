The X-ray repair zzso group 3 zzso is a highly suspected candidate gene for cancer zzso However, association studies on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in cancer have shown conflicting zzso zzso we performed a zzso to better assess the zzso zzso Forty eight eligible zzso studies including zzso cancer patients and 34, 209 controls were selected for our zzso Overall, individuals carrying the zzso zzso zzso showed a small cancer risk under a zzso genetic zzso The zzso and zzso analysis demonstrated different scenarios concerning the zzso zzso zzso role in cancer zzso for different zzso zzso there was a significantly increased risk of breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso elevated but not significant risk of cancer for head and neck, zzso surprisingly, a significantly decreased risk of zzso skin cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso A significantly elevated risk of cancer was observed in zzso zzso studies but not in zzso or hospital based zzso Similarly, we found a significantly increased risk of cancer for zzso and a decreased risk for zzso under dominant genetic zzso Our zzso results support that the zzso might represent a zzso susceptible gene especially for cancer of breast, zzso head and neck, and zzso skin zzso A single larger study should be required to further evaluate zzso and zzso interactions on zzso zzso and zzso cancer risk in an ethnicity specific zzso
