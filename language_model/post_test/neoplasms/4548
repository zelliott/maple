zzso zzso cell cycle progression and DNA damaging zzso induce zzso protein zzso indicating that zzso responds to DNA zzso We have measured zzso zzso DNA damage in association with zzso zzso The most relevant DNA zzso for zzso zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso which detects both zzso and zzso forms of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso lung zzso and zzso breast zzso cell lines containing zzso zzso was followed by an increase in zzso protein zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso decreased both the formation of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso The cell lines not able to activate zzso zzso and zzso (both human lung zzso zzso zzso lung zzso zzso and human zzso did not show any increase in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso cell line, containing a zzso in zzso 7 of zzso and the zzso cell line expressed very high levels of zzso protein before zzso treatment and no increase in zzso zzso was zzso These findings indicate that zzso protein is part of the response of the cells to zzso DNA zzso
