zzso is a promising treatment zzso for cancer in combination both with zzso and zzso In spite of its great therapeutic potential, the underlying molecular mechanisms still remain to be zzso Due to zzso imbalances and zzso zzso most of the zzso cells possess elevated membrane zzso However, further increasing membrane fluidity to zzso to zzso or zzso could have some other zzso In fact, zzso of cell membrane induced by membrane zzso zzso a stress response as the heat shock protein response, which may zzso positively or zzso zzso cell zzso zzso some recent findings based on a technology allowing direct imaging of zzso zzso in live cells and zzso novel aspects of the intimate relationship between the zzso zzso of zzso cells and the cellular heat shock response will be zzso Our findings lend support to both the importance of membrane zzso and the release of zzso signals initiating stress protein response, which can operate in tandem to control the extent of the ultimate cellular zzso Overall, we suggest that the fluidity variable of zzso should be used as an independent factor for predicting the efficacy of zzso cancer zzso
