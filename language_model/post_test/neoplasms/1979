Various human tumor zzso contain different growth zzso In some cases progression of tumors is paralleled by elevated levels of these substances in blood or in tumor zzso There is evidence that these growth promoting peptides might stimulate tumor zzso The growth of most tumors was associated with zzso substances zzso zzso We isolated and zzso a substance zzso zzso with insulin zzso from human zzso We found the molecular weight of affinity zzso zzso to be approximately zzso Our in zzso experiments with human zzso zzso cells and growth factors suggest an important role of these molecules in tumor zzso
