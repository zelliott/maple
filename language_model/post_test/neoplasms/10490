It is a classic story of two related zzso zzso zzso is a potent regulator of zzso during early zzso embryonic development, and is notable for its ability to convert adult zzso cells to zzso The widely expressed zzso protein shares significant zzso with zzso binds to the same zzso regulates common target zzso and shares common modes of upstream regulation, including the ability to respond to cellular zzso Both proteins are also associated with zzso yet zzso cannot substitute for zzso in the generation of zzso The molecular zzso of these phenomena are emerging, as are the consequences for adult stem cells and cancer, and thereby hangs a zzso
