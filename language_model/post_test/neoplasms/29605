To assess the zzso dose zzso zzso toxicity zzso safety, and zzso of the zzso continuous intravenous zzso infusion of zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso in patients with advanced solid tumors and to determine the zzso of an oral dose of 100 zzso zzso 

zzso was administered as a zzso zzso infusion every 21 zzso zzso escalation proceeded per toxicity zzso A zzso oral dose was administered to seven patients 48 h prior to the zzso infusion dose of 64 zzso 

zzso patients received a total of 86 infusions of zzso zzso toxicity at 96 zzso included grade 4 zzso and grade 3 zzso zzso The zzso was identified as 64 zzso The most common adverse events were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso infusion zzso had an estimated mean terminal zzso of approximately zzso h and that zzso zzso and mean zzso were approximately dose zzso The estimated mean oral zzso of zzso was zzso One patient with advanced zzso cancer attained prolonged stable disease for 11 zzso 

zzso was well tolerated in this zzso Almost half the patients attained stable zzso Further development of this class of agents will likely occur in combination with other zzso zzso
