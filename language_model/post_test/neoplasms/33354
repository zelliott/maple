zzso in protein zzso networks is due to modulated zzso interactions and is fundamental for proper signal progression and response to external and internal zzso This property is in part enabled by linear motifs embedding zzso modification zzso These serve as recognition sites, guiding zzso by zzso and subsequent binding of modular zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of such zzso interactions on a zzso scale requires extensive zzso and experimental zzso Here, we review the latest advances in methods for zzso zzso cellular interaction zzso In particular, we will discuss how the combination of new quantitative zzso technologies and zzso zzso together are enhancing mapping of these largely uncharted dynamic zzso By combining quantitative zzso of zzso events with zzso approaches, we argue that systems level models will help to decipher complex diseases through the ability to predict cellular systems zzso
