The crystal structure at zzso A resolution of the normal human zzso zzso protein lacking a flexible zzso 18 zzso reveals that the protein consists of a zzso beta sheet, four alpha zzso and nine connecting zzso Four zzso are involved in interactions with bound zzso zzso one with the zzso another with the zzso and two with the zzso zzso Most of the transforming proteins (in zzso and in zzso have single zzso acid zzso at one of a few key positions in three of these four zzso plus one additional zzso The biological functions of the remaining five zzso and other exposed regions are at present zzso However, one loop zzso to the binding site for a zzso zzso zzso and another to a putative zzso zzso zzso in the latter region do not alter zzso zzso binding or zzso zzso activity but they do reduce the transforming activity of activated zzso The data provide a structural basis for understanding the known zzso properties of normal as well as activated zzso zzso proteins and indicate additional regions in the zzso that may possibly participate in other cellular zzso
