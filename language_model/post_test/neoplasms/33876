zzso zzso cells zzso were found to inhibit proliferation of different tumor cell zzso zzso maturation of DC strongly increased their capacity to inhibit tumor cell zzso We observed that zzso activity of zzso DC was independent of their zzso zzso Indeed, zzso DC were able to inhibit growth of zzso or zzso zzso cells whereas they were not zzso towards the same zzso On the other hand, we found that zzso derived from zzso DC exerted a significant zzso activity against zzso cells while it did not induce any zzso zzso zzso necrosis factor zzso was shown to critically contribute to tumor growth zzso in this zzso
