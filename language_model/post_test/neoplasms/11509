Cancer patients with tumors of similar zzso staging and zzso can have markedly different treatment responses to different chemotherapy zzso So far, individual markers have failed to correctly predict resistance against zzso zzso We tested 30 cancer cell lines for sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso methotrexate, zzso C, zzso zzso zzso and zzso at drug zzso that can be zzso achieved in zzso The resistance index was determined to designate the cell lines as sensitive or zzso and then, the subset of resistant zzso sensitive cell lines for each drug was zzso Gene expression signatures for all cell lines were obtained by interrogating zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso was applied for feature zzso An individual prediction profile for the resistance against each chemotherapy agent was constructed, containing zzso zzso The overall accuracy of the predictions in a zzso cross validation was zzso A list of the top 67 zzso resistance candidate genes that were associated with the resistance against at least 4 zzso agents was zzso Moreover, the differential expressions of 46 selected genes were also measured by quantitative zzso using a zzso zzso zzso card zzso As a single gene can be correlated with resistance against several agents, associations with resistance were detected all together for 76 genes and resistance zzso zzso This study focuses on the resistance at the in zzso zzso making future clinical cancer response prediction zzso The zzso gene expression patterns provide new gene candidates for zzso zzso
