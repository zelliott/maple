In May 2004, 10 additional countries joined the European Union zzso including a total of 75 million zzso Most of these were from central and eastern European countries with comparably high cancer mortality rates and with relatively zzso zzso zzso it is important to provide updated mortality data regarding major zzso in various countries and to analyze trends for the current population of the zzso 

The authors considered mortality rates zzso standardized to the world standard zzso for all zzso and for 8 major cancer sites in the year 2000 in the 25 countries of the zzso and analyzed corresponding trends since 1980 using data derived from the World Health Organization data zzso 

For men, overall cancer mortality in the year 2000 varied by a factor zzso 2 between the highest rate of zzso per 100,000 men in Hungary and the lowest rate of zzso per 100,000 men in zzso Central and Eastern European zzso countries had the highest rates not only for lung and other zzso zzso but also for gastrointestinal zzso and zzso The geographic pattern was different and the range of variation was smaller for women, zzso between zzso per 100,000 women in Denmark and zzso per 100,000 women in Spain in the year zzso In the zzso as a whole, lung cancer mortality in men peaked at zzso per 100,000 men in 1988 and declined thereafter to zzso per 100,000 men in zzso zzso cancer steadily declined from zzso per 100,000 men in 1980 to zzso per 100,000 men in zzso Other major sites showed moderately favorable trends over the last few zzso In women, breast cancer peaked at zzso per 100,000 in 1989 and declined to zzso per 100,000 in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated steady zzso but lung cancer increased from zzso per 100,000 women in 1980 to zzso per 100,000 women in zzso The increase in lung cancer mortality in women age zzso 55 years was 38% between 1990 and 2000 (from zzso per 100,000 women to zzso per 100,000 zzso reflecting the spread of tobacco smoking among women in the zzso over the last few zzso 

The priority for further reduction of cancer mortality in the zzso remains tobacco control together with more widespread availability of modern diagnostic and treatment procedures for zzso that are amenable to zzso
