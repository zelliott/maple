zzso investigations of zzso cells during the past 25 years have revealed more than 600 acquired, zzso balanced zzso zzso and it has been established that every tumor type, studied in a sufficient number to permit conclusions, may be subdivided on the basis of specific, and even zzso zzso At the molecular level, the balanced zzso exert their action through one of two alternative zzso zzso of one gene by relocation to an zzso or zzso zzso zzso or the creation of a hybrid gene by the fusion of parts of two zzso At present, nearly 100 genes have been found to be involved in zzso zzso zzso the great majority in zzso zzso At the same time, the clinical usefulness of various zzso abnormalities as diagnostic and zzso aids has been increasingly zzso The identification of a recurring zzso zzso can assist in the diagnosis and zzso of a zzso disease and, zzso in the selection of the appropriate zzso The zzso is also an independent zzso zzso In zzso zzso where the knowledge of zzso abnormalities still is much more complete than is the case with solid tumors, zzso analysis now plays an integral part in the diagnostic zzso of individual zzso Data obtained during recent years strongly suggest that corresponding breakthroughs will be achieved in solid tumors within a not-too-distant zzso
