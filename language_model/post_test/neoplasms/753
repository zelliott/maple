The identification of a set of relevant but not redundant features is an important first step in building zzso and diagnostic models from biomedical data zzso Most commonly, individual features are ranked in terms of a quality zzso out of which the best zzso k features are zzso However, feature ranking methods do not sufficiently account for interactions and correlations between the zzso Thus, zzso is likely to be encountered in the selected zzso We present a new algorithm, termed zzso zzso zzso that takes an arbitrary feature ranking as zzso and improves this ranking by identifying redundant features and demoting them to positions in the ranking in which they are not zzso zzso features are those that are correlated with other features and not relevant in the sense that they do not improve the zzso ability of a set of zzso zzso on two cancer data sets, one melanoma image data set and one lung cancer zzso data set, show that our zzso greatly improves the feature rankings provided by the methods information gain, zzso and zzso zzso in terms of zzso zzso
