The chemistry of zzso suggests that, in biological systems, it is most likely present as the zzso zzso or, as the zzso zzso analogous to sulfur in the zzso acid zzso zzso are stronger acids than zzso and, at zzso zzso exist mainly in zzso form zzso whereas the zzso group exists mainly in the zzso zzso The zzso form of the zzso group is a good zzso as well as a good leaving zzso Also, it binds metals zzso which is the principle behind the use of zzso compounds for heavy metal zzso zzso metal zzso can strip zzso from zzso compounds and zzso zzso zzso and zzso are highly effective in this zzso In zzso zzso compounds tend to undergo reduction in contrast to sulfur compounds which are acquired in reduced form and generally undergo zzso zzso of zzso zzso compounds, yielding zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso appears to be the major zzso of zzso zzso in zzso The highest activity of the zzso has been found in liver and kidney followed by zzso skeletal muscle, zzso and zzso zzso zzso appears to be incorporated into proteins via post zzso modification of zzso Six proteins that zzso zzso have been isolated: zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of muscle, zzso zzso zzso and the bacterial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There is evidence also that zzso is an essential component of zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and a bacterial zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
