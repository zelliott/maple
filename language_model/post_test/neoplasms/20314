Relatively low zzso of zzso zzso and chronic cardiovascular disease was documented in this work the emphasis being put on the conditions running with zzso zzso The percentage of zzso in the total autopsy material of zzso men and zzso women was zzso and zzso zzso and in the zzso with heart weight zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This percentage was significantly lower in separated zzso of: zzso zzso hypertension, zzso and zzso zzso zzso syndrome, zzso and zzso zzso healed zzso zzso accompanied by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acquired zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of heart weight zzso g showed zzso and zzso of cases with zzso while that of cardiac weight over 600 zzso and zzso In the zzso of normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso wall thickness corresponding percentage zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso of zzso wall thickness over 6 zzso and zzso and in that of zzso wall thickness over 18 zzso and zzso zzso available information suggests some zzso activity of catecholamines believed to condition that of zzso zzso are also attributed with the stimulation of zzso zzso The correlation of our findings with assumptions mentioned above seem to justify a hypothesis, or only a possibility, that zzso mechanisms active in the cardiovascular diseases create an zzso background for the development of zzso
