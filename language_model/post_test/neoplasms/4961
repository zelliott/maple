To describe a technique for zzso biopsy based on zzso findings and to evaluate the indications and results of the technique in cancer zzso 

We evaluated all patients receiving zzso zzso zzso whose indication was based on zzso findings at an zzso reference center from October 2009 to December zzso The zzso images were evaluated side by side with zzso CT images to identify the zzso or area of interest to be zzso zzso were guided by CT with the needle directed at the area of zzso activity identified in the zzso examination performed before the zzso 

A total of 64 cases were included in this zzso The most common zzso location was pulmonary zzso zzso zzso zzso The median of the zzso greatest diameter and maximum zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso results of the zzso were negative for zzso in 15 cases zzso positive in 46 cases zzso and zzso in 3 cases zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso were more likely to be zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso zzso should be used routinely for zzso identified or better characterized by zzso The results of this study demonstrate that this method is reliable, zzso and very accurate zzso revealing a high percentage of zzso zzso
