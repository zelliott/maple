Several lines of evidence from recent years support the existence of cancer zzso especially studies of natural killer zzso cells and the zzso zzso However, immune suppression is clearly observed in cancer patients and zzso animals as zzso The fact is that although zzso often elicit a vigorous immune response during the early part of their growth, the immune response is soon zzso permitting progressive tumor zzso Apparently, the intrinsic plasticity of tumors allows the immune system to zzso the zzso zzso of tumors to escape efficient immune zzso But most zzso several mechanisms have now been found to contribute to the failure of immune control of tumor zzso zzso cells have a very low level of zzso class II, zzso zzso and weak zzso They also produce immune zzso factors zzso zzso zzso that exert systemic effects on immune cell zzso In particular, disabled zzso cell zzso zzso migration, and function are fundamental to this zzso as they are the most potent zzso cells zzso of the immune system, interacting with T and B zzso as well as zzso cells to induce and zzso immune zzso In addition, tumors also alter host zzso and produce large numbers of immature zzso cells, and evidence shows that these cells are directly immune zzso zzso the immune system for effective cancer therapy has remained a great zzso zzso vaccines, or zzso vaccines in combination with treatments designed to improve the host immune environment, may offer hope for more effective cancer zzso zzso interactions are an important zzso of tumor behavior and response to zzso How tumors interact with their hosts is thus a very broad and complex zzso In this chapter, we will focus on zzso immune interactions and the roles of zzso cell dysfunction in tumor avoidance of host immune zzso We will survey recent findings regarding tumor immune zzso zzso host immune responses, and how the immune system also functions to promote or select tumor zzso with reduced zzso We will then discuss immune suppression caused by tumors, which is clearly observed in zzso animals and cancer zzso Finally, we will discuss altered zzso cell function and differentiation in some detail, as it is likely to be one of the most fundamental mechanisms by which tumors escape immune zzso
