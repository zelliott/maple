The distinction between zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso may be impossible based on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are newly described zzso markers which can potentially be zzso for zzso this zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso molecules expressed in zzso cells and zzso cells, zzso The differential expression of zzso in zzso cells and zzso in zzso cells has been zzso to differentiate zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso protein within the family of zzso zzso It is abundantly expressed in peripheral and central nervous zzso and has been shown to consistently zzso with zzso zzso We studied cell block sections from 77 zzso zzso zzso zzso 26 zzso and 29 zzso to investigate the potential zzso use of zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso between zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso A modified zzso zzso complex (ABC) method was zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso A distinct membrane zzso pattern was seen in zzso The pattern of zzso was zzso in all zzso zzso and varied from membrane to zzso in zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso percent of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso with zzso Based on these results, we conclude that zzso is a potentially useful marker in the distinction of zzso cells from zzso However, it is not as useful for the distinction of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso did not reliably distinguish between zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells in zzso zzso
