In order to put more accurate zzso into practice, a zzso planning system using CT, which is named CT simulation system, has been developed and introduced at Kobe University zzso The CT simulation system consists of a CT zzso an image processing zzso and a laser marking zzso The target area of radiation is determined on each CT zzso image or scout view in the zzso zzso treatment planning is feasible on the basis of the two-dimensional tumor information in CT zzso zzso After setting treatment zzso the zzso of the radiation field on zzso eye view and the zzso position are calculated by zzso This system makes it possible to choose an appropriate zzso method and an optimal dose zzso In the present study we examined the fundamental capability of this zzso The laser marking system proved to have a very high degree of zzso The outcome of a phantom test raised the strong possibility that this system may be applied zzso In addition to these basic findings, this paper describes preliminary clinical observations that support the good zzso of the radiation field projected with the CT zzso In conclusion, this system is of high value for radiation therapy zzso
