The zzso zzso catalyze the zzso transformation of a large number of zzso and zzso chemicals in plants, insects, and zzso One consequence of this type of reaction is the generation of highly zzso zzso zzso that can react with zzso zzso It has been zzso that the initiation reaction for chemical zzso and/or cellular toxicity involves the metabolism of zzso by zzso The naturally occurring steroid zzso zzso when administered as a supplement to the diet of zzso has been reported to have zzso and other zzso zzso A change in the inventory of liver zzso occurs during treatment of zzso with zzso the most pronounced being that involved in the zzso of zzso length fatty zzso In addition, changes in the activities of other liver zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso occur as shown by in zzso experiments to assess the zzso formation of zzso zzso of testosterone and zzso The effect of feeding zzso a diet supplemented with zzso mimics some of the changes seen when animals are treated with zzso drugs (such as zzso and other chemicals which are known to be zzso zzso Studies comparing the zzso functions of the zzso expressed zzso forms of zzso zzso responsible for the two step zzso of zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso respectively, illustrated the marked differences in zzso properties between the human and the rat zzso The findings serve to demonstrate that zzso is an obligatory intermediate for the synthesis of zzso in the human, but not in the zzso The zzso changes responsible for the zzso properties of zzso remain to be zzso The studies presented here suggest that zzso when administered as a dietary supplement, functions like a zzso and that its effects may result from zzso in the inventory of cellular zzso thereby influencing the balance of zzso activities associated with the initiation phase of chemical zzso and/or zzso
