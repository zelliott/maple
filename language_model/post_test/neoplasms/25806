The purpose of this study was to perform a Phase I trial of zzso a selective inhibitor of zzso zzso and to determine the zzso and toxicity profiles as a function of zzso zzso Fifty patients with advanced solid tumors and good performance status were treated with zzso as a zzso zzso infusion every 3 weeks, at doses escalating from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso toxicity were the most common zzso zzso in this largely zzso patient population, but they occurred during the initial cycle in only one of nine patients treated with zzso zzso and in two of nine patients treated with zzso zzso Only 2 of 13 patients treated with zzso zzso ultimately experienced unacceptable toxicity after three and seven cycles, compared with 42 and zzso of patients receiving zzso and zzso zzso after medians of three and two cycles, zzso The maximum zzso plasma concentration and the area under the plasma zzso curve increased in proportion to zzso zzso clearance was independent of dose and was associated with the estimated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and tended to occur more frequently when patients received three or more cycles of zzso A zzso treatment zzso was feasible in the majority of patients at all zzso Although zzso zzso appeared to be a safe starting dose in this zzso patient population, about half who received two or more courses ultimately experienced zzso zzso A dose of zzso zzso was well tolerated in most zzso
