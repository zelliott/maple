Human zzso embryonic cells are similar in zzso to cancer zzso Both types of cell undergo zzso to a zzso stem cell state and become potentially zzso and zzso To investigate the hypothesis that embryonic genes are zzso in cancer cells, we prepare amplified zzso from human individual zzso zzso and isolate zzso zzso We show that three novel embryonic zzso and also the known zzso zzso are expressed in human zzso but not expressed in normal zzso zzso Genes specific to this unique phase of the human life cycle and not expressed in zzso cells may have greater potential for targeting in cancer zzso
