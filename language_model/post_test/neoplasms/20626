Previously we reported that zzso zzso were able to overcome zzso protection from zzso Here we show that zzso of the zzso activity in zzso cells accumulates the zzso zzso protein to zzso where it interacts to zzso zzso This event was followed by release of zzso zzso c into the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso did not induce any apparent changes in zzso protein zzso In addition, treatment with a zzso inhibitor increased levels of zzso forms of zzso zzso without any effects on zzso zzso zzso We also established a zzso zzso degradation zzso in which an in zzso zzso zzso protein can be zzso by a tumor cell protein zzso zzso by addition of a zzso inhibitor or depletion of the zzso or zzso The zzso degradation activity can be zzso in the zzso zzso by addition of a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Finally, by using tissue samples of human prostate zzso we demonstrated that increased levels of zzso degradation correlated well with decreased levels of zzso protein and increased zzso scores of prostate zzso Our studies strongly suggest that zzso zzso degradation is a novel survival mechanism in human cancer cells and that selective targeting of this zzso should provide a unique approach for treatment of human zzso especially those zzso zzso
