zzso research requires taking basic science observations and developing them into clinically useful tests and zzso We have developed a process to develop molecular zzso for diagnosis and prognosis by zzso tissue zzso zzso technology and an zzso zzso zzso zzso technology allows investigators to study hundreds of patient samples on a single glass slide resulting in the conservation of tissue and the reduction in zzso zzso The zzso system allows investigator to reliably track, store, and evaluate zzso zzso Here within we describe the process that has evolved through an empirical basis over the past 5 years at two academic zzso 

The generic design of this system makes it compatible with multiple organ system zzso zzso breast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Studies and folders are restricted to authorized users as zzso Over the past 5 years, investigators at 2 academic institutions have scanned 656 zzso experiments and collected zzso digital images of these tissue zzso 68 zzso from 12 major user groups have zzso the zzso Two groups directly link clinical data from over 500 patients for immediate access and the remaining groups choose to maintain clinical and pathology data on separate zzso zzso currently has 170 K data points such as zzso intensity, tumor grade, and nuclear zzso Due to the zzso database structure, analysis can be easily performed on single or multiple zzso experimental zzso The zzso module of zzso can maintain images acquired from multiple zzso 

We have developed a robust process to develop molecular zzso using zzso technology and an zzso database system to track all steps of this zzso This system is zzso to other types of molecular data as separate zzso and is freely available to academic institutions for zzso
