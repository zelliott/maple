Among the alternative beams being recently considered for external cancer zzso zzso has received some attention because it is expected that its biological effectiveness could be zzso by the zzso zzso of two alpha particles and a zzso that takes place at the zzso zzso zzso have been performed to zzso this exotic beam physically and models have been developed to estimate zzso its biological zzso Here, the particle and zzso transport code system ( zzso ) is used to calculate zzso and linear energy transfer zzso for a zzso beam in water and the results are compared with published zzso Although zzso fails to reproduce some of the features of the zzso it suggests that the zzso of zzso contributes zzso to the zzso zzso thus contradicting the previous interpretation of the measured zzso We have also performed a zzso calculation to estimate the biological effect of the zzso which was found to be zzso previous zzso zzso calculations were found to be zzso An zzso argument, of geometrical nature, confirms this conclusion and gives a theoretical upper bound on the additional biological effectiveness of the zzso However, no explanation can be offered at present for the observed difference in the biological effectiveness between zzso and zzso the zzso of this surprising result will be verified in coming zzso
