The zzso zzso and zzso are widely used zzso agents that have demonstrated significant clinical activity against a number of human tumor zzso zzso promote zzso zzso and stabilization which zzso zzso and leads to zzso zzso induce a number of other molecular zzso One such example is their ability to promote zzso of the zzso zzso gene and to stabilize the zzso zzso zzso zzso This leads to increased production of zzso which have been implicated in zzso Increased zzso activity has been associated with tumor growth, poor zzso zzso and zzso clinical zzso therefore, zzso of zzso might zzso the zzso effect of the zzso This provides the rationale for the use of zzso zzso in combination with zzso as this could theoretically improve the clinical efficacy of zzso and zzso zzso from zzso studies have generally shown enhanced zzso activity from the addition of zzso zzso to zzso zzso Data from Phase II clinical studies in patients with zzso cell lung cancer zzso have suggested a marginal improvement in response rate when zzso is added to zzso therapy when compared with historical trials in similar patient groups receiving zzso zzso There may also be a role for zzso zzso in zzso some of the side effects of zzso treatment, such as fatigue, zzso and zzso zzso clinical trials would be needed to establish whether zzso zzso improve the therapeutic profile of zzso or zzso in patients with solid zzso
