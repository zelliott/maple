To assess if the effectiveness of biopsy zzso whose usefulness is widely zzso can be influenced by different cutting mechanisms, we compared four different types of needles zzso B, C, zzso in 76 patients, each needle being of the same length (15 zzso and zzso (18 zzso but with different tip zzso Forty biopsy samples were obtained with each type of needle for a total of 160 samples in 76 zzso 61 samples were acquired under CT guidance and 99 under US zzso The results were subdivided in 6 categories based on biopsy zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso P zzso diagnosis in benign zzso S zzso of zzso zzso E zzso zzso zzso zzso The results, respectively, for each needle type are: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with needle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with needle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with needle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with needle zzso The sensitivity and specificity for each needle type were, respectively, zzso and zzso for needle zzso zzso and zzso for needle zzso zzso and zzso for needle zzso zzso and zzso for needle zzso No statistically significant difference was found in the effectiveness of the four needles zzso zzso on the contrary, zzso size can affect sampling zzso
