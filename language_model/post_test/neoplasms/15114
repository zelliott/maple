Although links between exceptional cancer zzso zzso and complementary and alternative medicines zzso have been suggested, most research on zzso uses zzso criteria for zzso without necessarily including zzso zzso Little knowledge can be found about zzso perspectives of zzso in relation to zzso 

This Swedish study explores how patients, significant others, and zzso and biomedical health care zzso providers reason about zzso including the role of zzso 

Using a case study approach, open interviews were conducted with multiple zzso about cancer zzso reported as zzso 

zzso analysis of 5 cases indicated that although all zzso agreed that the reported cases were positive, in no case was the same trajectory considered exceptional by all zzso Different zzso shared neither zzso of what constituted an zzso nor zzso for positive zzso zzso significant others, and zzso providers emphasized unexpectedly long survival and well-being in zzso whereas zzso providers only referred to zzso zzso and zzso providers zzso reported zzso although the forms for this differed between provider zzso zzso zzso zzso accounts are discussed relative to different health care zzso legitimization zzso and legal constraints, which have led to the lack of a public sphere for zzso use in zzso
