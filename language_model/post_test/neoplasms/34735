The zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor located in a region of zzso 5 zzso that has been proposed to contain one or more tumor zzso zzso We report here consistent zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso tissue from different anatomical origins, including zzso breast, zzso stomach, zzso and zzso and demonstrate DNA zzso as the regulatory mechanism of zzso gene zzso zzso of zzso gene expression in a human lung cancer cell line using zzso significantly enhanced in zzso zzso and zzso cell growth as well as cell growth after transplantation into zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso in zzso normal human zzso zzso cells enabled them to grow in an zzso zzso Further, zzso of zzso expression in the human lung cancer cell line zzso resistance to zzso signals and enhanced zzso and invasion in zzso and zzso potential in zzso zzso expression of zzso in tumor cells resulted in diminished zzso and zzso cell growth and reduced zzso zzso These results therefore demonstrate that zzso is a putative new tumor zzso gene in multiple types of human zzso
