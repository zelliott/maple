Although zzso zzso specific for particular zzso have been discovered, zzso analysis of gene expression profiles, supported by zzso analysis zzso helps to identify common factors in molecular zzso zzso of zzso Gene zzso zzso is a recently proposed approach to zzso suitable for identifying features shared by two data zzso Here we extend the idea of zzso to the detection of significant zzso marker genes from zzso of multiple data zzso Three data sets for leukemia and the other six for different solid tumors are used to demonstrate our method, using established statistical zzso 

We describe a set of significantly similar ordered gene lists, representing outcome comparisons for distinct types of zzso This kind of similarity could improve the diagnostic zzso of individual studies when zzso is incorporated into the support zzso machine zzso In particular, we investigate the similarities among three ordered gene lists pertaining to zzso survival, prostate recurrence and zzso zzso The zzso genes are related to the outcomes of patients with lung cancer with a hazard ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso Many of these genes are involved in breakdown of zzso proteins regulating zzso and may be used for further research on zzso markers and molecular targets of gene therapy for zzso 

The proposed method and its application show the potential of such zzso in clinical studies of gene expression zzso
