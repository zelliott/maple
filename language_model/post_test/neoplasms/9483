In zzso cells, relaxed zzso zzso zzso pronounced changes resulting in formation of highly condensed zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso is particularly evident during zzso and zzso cell death, whereas zzso relaxation is necessary for zzso repair, zzso and zzso The zzso modifications of zzso tails such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso play a critical role in dynamic zzso that occurs during the cell zzso zzso zzso is believed to play a direct role in zzso cell death, repair, replication and zzso However, definitive roles for this modification in these processes have not yet been zzso In this review, we discuss recent progress in studies of zzso zzso
