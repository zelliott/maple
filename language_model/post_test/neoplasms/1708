Many studies have used DNA zzso to identify the gene expression signatures of human cancer, yet the critical features of these often zzso large signatures remain zzso To address this, we developed a statistical method, comparative zzso which identifies and zzso the intersection of multiple gene expression signatures from a diverse collection of zzso data zzso We collected and analyzed 40 published cancer zzso data sets, zzso 38 million gene expression zzso from zzso cancer zzso From this, we characterized a common zzso profile that is universally activated in most cancer types relative to the normal zzso from which they zzso likely reflecting essential zzso features of zzso zzso In addition, we characterized a zzso profile that is commonly activated in various types of zzso cancer, suggesting common molecular mechanisms by which cancer cells progress and avoid zzso Finally, we validated these zzso profiles on independent data zzso
