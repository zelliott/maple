Five compounds representative of major structural classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acids zzso were investigated for their ability to affect cell proliferation or wound healing, two functional targets of relevance for research on cancer or tissue zzso The experiments were carried out on zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso cells, and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed high toxicity for zzso acid, intermediate toxicity for zzso acid, and low toxicity for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso wounding experiments on zzso zzso in the presence of zzso doses of zzso compounds, showed strong wound closure effects by zzso and zzso acid, an intermediate effect by zzso and zzso zzso and no effect by zzso zzso A combination of zzso and zzso acids gave a further increase in the wound closure zzso The results of a cell migration test correlated with the wound healing zzso In conclusion, zzso acid might be a particularly interesting compound for the prevention of zzso zzso while zzso and zzso acids qualify as interesting leads in the promotion of tissue zzso
