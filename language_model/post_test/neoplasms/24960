zzso are zzso zzso protein modifications that are modulated during zzso and disease zzso As such, zzso are attractive zzso zzso Here, we describe a mass zzso zzso that incorporates zzso affinity zzso to enrich for proteins that carry specific zzso zzso As increases in zzso and zzso are prominent among zzso zzso we focused on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which bind zzso zzso and zzso structures, zzso zzso and zzso zzso from human zzso served as positive controls, and zzso structures from zzso zzso served as negative zzso The standards were spiked into Multiple zzso zzso System zzso zzso zzso human plasma from healthy zzso zzso were loaded onto zzso zzso separated by zzso into zzso and bound zzso and treated with zzso zzso F to remove zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso were interrogated by zzso zzso We identified a total of 122 human plasma zzso containing 247 unique zzso zzso several of the observed zzso zzso zzso 5 and zzso zzso zzso typically circulate in plasma at low zzso per zzso zzso Together, these results provide mass zzso evidence of the utility of incorporating zzso platforms into cancer zzso discovery zzso
