A wide array of zzso and zzso zzso genes are involved in the prevention of zzso Each form of cancer requires zzso in a characteristic group of zzso but no single group controls all zzso This lack of zzso shows that the control of cancer is not an zzso fixed property of zzso By contrast, it supports a dynamic evolutionary model, zzso genetic controls over zzso cell growth are recruited independently through evolutionary time in different zzso within different zzso The complexity of this genetic control can be predicted from a population genetic model of lineage selection driven by the zzso fitness effects of zzso Cancer occurs because the genetic control of cell growth is vulnerable to zzso zzso (or zzso particularly in large, continuously dividing zzso Thus, compared to small zzso humans must have evolved more complex genetic controls over cell growth in at least some of their zzso because of their greater size and zzso an expectation relevant to the application of mouse data to zzso Similarly, the zzso model so successfully applied to zzso which originates in a small embryonic zzso is unlikely to be generally zzso to other human zzso instead, more complex scenarios are expected to dominate, with complexity depending upon a zzso size and its pattern of zzso
