To minimize invasive surgery, we employed B ultrasound to guide the placement of the zzso used in continuous circulatory zzso zzso zzso chemotherapy zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso were treated with zzso guided by zzso zzso zzso were originally from zzso cancer (11 zzso gastric cancer (10 zzso zzso cancer zzso and pancreatic cancer (2 zzso The zzso was carried out at zzso for 90 zzso with zzso saline solution as a carrier containing zzso and zzso or zzso as therapeutic zzso depending on the type of the primary zzso The therapeutic zzso zzso complications and survival period of these patients were assessed with follow-up zzso Among all zzso to be assessed with zzso 26 and 4 patients showed complete zzso zzso and partial zzso zzso respectively, with an objective zzso rate zzso of zzso The zzso scores were elevated by zzso after 3 sessions of ultrasound guided zzso and the quality of life zzso of patients was significantly improved zzso The median survival time was zzso and 18 patients survived between 3 and 30 months after zzso zzso Additionally, patients with different types of zzso significantly differed in the survival time zzso A novel approach of using B ultrasound guided zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso demonstrated satisfactory zzso The approach shows benefit in minimizing invasive surgery, improving the patient zzso and zzso survival zzso
