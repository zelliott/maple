Collecting zzso zzso zzso data in three-dimensional zzso mode may potentially allow reduction of the zzso dose and/or the acquisition time without compromising image quality thereby making the procedure more zzso and cost zzso The objective of our study was to compare zzso Point zzso reconstruction zzso in zzso zzso zzso data obtained in zzso and two-dimensional zzso mode in routine clinical diagnostic setting in zzso zzso 

Standard zzso imaging zzso zzso was followed by zzso of the target region in zzso and zzso zzso The zzso data were zzso to 4, 3 and 2 zzso zzso Visual and zzso analyses were zzso zzso of zzso volume and body mass index on tissue zzso were zzso 

Visual image quality in zzso mode was superior to zzso zzso and mean zzso zzso values of zzso did not differ between zzso and zzso Mean background zzso zzso values were significantly lower in zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso to background ratios were higher than zzso in small zzso and obese patients zzso mass index zzso or zzso 30) with all acquisition zzso 

The new reconstruction method produces images of similar or better quality with zzso compared with zzso zzso The difference is pronounced in small zzso and in obese zzso According to our study, zzso is the preferred acquisition mode for routine zzso evaluation of zzso zzso
