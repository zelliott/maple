zzso a group of zzso complex diseases, are generally caused by zzso of multiple genes or zzso of zzso zzso zzso that can characterize zzso would help to understand and diagnose zzso Traditional zzso methods that detect genes zzso expressed between cancer and normal samples fail to work due to small sample size and independent assumption among zzso On the other hand, genes work in concert to perform their zzso zzso it is expected that zzso pathways will serve as better zzso compared with single zzso 

In this paper, we propose a novel approach to identify zzso pathways in cancer based on a zzso interaction zzso Our contribution is zzso zzso we present a new method to construct zzso interaction network based on gene zzso zzso interactions and cellular zzso zzso the identification of zzso pathways in cancer is treated as a feature selection problem, which is biologically reasonable and easy to zzso zzso the zzso pathways are identified as zzso from the zzso interaction networks, where the zzso characterize very well the functional dependency or zzso between zzso The zzso results on several distinct cancer zzso demonstrate that our method can obtain more reliable and accurate results compared with existing state of the art zzso Further functional analysis and independent literature evidence also confirm that our identified potential zzso pathways are biologically reasonable, indicating the effectiveness of our zzso 

zzso pathways can serve as better zzso compared with single zzso In this work, by utilizing zzso interaction networks and gene expression data, we propose a novel approach that effectively identifies zzso zzso which can not only be used as zzso to diagnose zzso but also serve as potential drug targets in the zzso
