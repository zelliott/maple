Human zzso which are small zzso peptides produced by zzso and zzso cells, form two genetically distinct alpha and beta zzso They are involved in innate immunity through killing microbial pathogens or zzso bacterial toxins and in zzso immunity by serving as zzso and zzso of immune zzso zzso are mainly packaged in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso by zzso zzso cells zzso zzso while zzso are expressed in zzso and zzso zzso Using surface enhanced laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso were found to be expressed in a variety of human zzso either in zzso cells or at their zzso zzso peptides are also zzso and their zzso in biological zzso was proposed as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso in some zzso types in which it could behave as a zzso zzso zzso zzso promote zzso cell growth or, at higher zzso provoke cell zzso These peptides also inhibit zzso which, in addition to zzso indicates a complex role in zzso zzso This review summarizes current knowledge of zzso to discuss their role in zzso growth, zzso monitoring and cancer zzso
