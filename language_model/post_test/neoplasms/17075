The use of adequate zzso acid rescue (in clinically relevant zzso after high dose zzso will prevent zzso without reducing treatment zzso 

A literature search was performed to test the hypothesis that no evidence for the existence of zzso acid zzso of high-dose zzso zzso in clinically relevant situations exists zzso that too much zzso acid reduced cure zzso 

Examples of zzso acid zzso after lower doses of zzso were found and has been cited as evidence of over rescue of high dose zzso Mega doses of zzso acid, used when toxic levels of zzso occurred, also could neutralize the zzso zzso Data were found to support the contention that higher levels of zzso require zzso higher zzso acid doses for zzso zzso examination of the available studies after zzso yielded more convincing alternative explanations for reduction in cure rate than over zzso Little convincing evidence for the existence of over rescue after zzso was zzso 

The rescue of high-dose zzso with an appropriate dose of zzso acid that can prevent zzso especially zzso was not shown to reduce the therapeutic zzso No evidence was found that higher doses of zzso acid after high dose zzso reduces the therapeutic zzso 

Acceptance of the hypothesis can prevent harm being caused (especially brain zzso by reversing the trend of dose reduction in zzso zzso The recognition that the use of higher zzso acid doses is safe, can prevent zzso and does not reduce prognosis has important implications for the development of effective non toxic treatment zzso
