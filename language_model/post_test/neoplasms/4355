A comparative study of human zzso type 16 zzso and normal human zzso smooth muscle cells by zzso electron zzso zzso and zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso cells retained much of the zzso of normal zzso smooth muscle cells, including expression of smooth muscle markers and appropriate growth responses to zzso and zzso These cells differed from normal vascular smooth muscle cells in that they had slightly altered zzso and a higher growth rate that was not due to an zzso response to zzso zzso and they contained more zzso than normal smooth muscle zzso
