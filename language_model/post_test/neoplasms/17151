Air pollution exposure has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of specific zzso This study investigated whether the number and zzso of the most common zzso in Saudi Arabia were associated with urban air pollution exposure, specifically zzso Overall, high model goodness of fit zzso was observed in the Eastern, zzso and zzso zzso The significant zzso of determination zzso were higher at the regional level zzso zzso zzso weaker at the zzso level zzso zzso zzso and declined slightly at the city level zzso zzso zzso suggesting that an increased zzso spatial level increased the explained zzso and the model zzso However, the low zzso at the lowest spatial level suggests that additional variation remains zzso At different spatial levels, associations between zzso concentration and the most common zzso were marginally improved in geographically weighted zzso zzso analysis, which explained both global and local zzso and variations in cancer zzso High zzso of determination were observed between zzso concentration and lung and breast cancer zzso followed by zzso zzso cervical and zzso zzso confirming results from other zzso These results could be improved using individual explanatory variables such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and genetic risk zzso
