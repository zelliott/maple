Unlike infections related to zzso zzso zzso infections occurring in patients with solid zzso remain largely zzso Our aim is to evaluate the outcomes and the zzso relationship associated with zzso infections following zzso of common solid zzso 

We used Texas Discharge Data to study patients undergoing zzso of cancer of the zzso zzso stomach, zzso zzso or zzso from zzso to zzso From their billing records, we identified zzso codes indicating a diagnosis of serious zzso infection zzso zzso zzso pneumonia, and wound infection, occurring during surgical admission or leading to zzso within zzso of zzso Using zzso techniques, we estimated the impact of zzso on zzso resource zzso and costs, as well as the relationship between hospital volume and zzso after adjusting for zzso and data zzso 

zzso occurred following zzso of the zzso eligible tumor zzso and was independently associated with nearly zzso increased odds of zzso mortality zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso required six additional hospital days zzso zzso zzso at an incremental cost of zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients who underwent zzso at high-volume hospitals had a zzso decreased odds of developing zzso than those at zzso hospitals zzso 

Due to the substantial burden associated with zzso following common solid tumor zzso hospitals must identify more effective zzso measures to avert these potentially preventable zzso Additional zzso research is needed to identify infection prevention processes that can be transferred from zzso to zzso zzso
