The authors report the results obtained from the application of electron zzso techniques to the zzso of zzso samples of zzso zzso from various body zzso These results show that the tissue structure, which is usually lost during the zzso necessary for light zzso zzso is preserved when the samples are processed for zzso zzso zzso zzso also allows a highly detailed study of the cell's inner zzso Thus, when this technique is applied, fine zzso samples can be regarded as actual zzso However, because of the high cost of zzso techniques, we suggest that actual analysis be performed only in selected cases, whereas fixation and inclusion for electron zzso could be done zzso
