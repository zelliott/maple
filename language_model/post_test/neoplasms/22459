zzso zzso are small zzso zzso which play essential roles in many important biological zzso zzso their dysfunction is associated with a variety of human diseases, including zzso zzso evidence shows that zzso can act as zzso or tumor zzso and although there is great interest in research into these zzso zzso little is known about zzso In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis of putative human zzso zzso and tumor zzso We found that zzso zzso and tumor zzso clearly show different patterns in function, evolutionary rate, zzso zzso distribution, zzso size, free energy, zzso factors, and zzso For example, zzso zzso are located mainly in the amplified regions in human zzso whereas zzso tumor zzso are located mainly in the deleted zzso zzso zzso tend to cleave target zzso more frequently than zzso tumor zzso These results indicate that these two types of zzso zzso play different roles in cancer formation and zzso Moreover, the patterns identified here can discriminate novel zzso zzso and tumor zzso with a high degree of zzso This study represents the first large-scale zzso analysis of human zzso zzso and tumor zzso Our findings provide help for not only understanding of zzso in cancer but also for the specific identification of novel zzso as zzso zzso and tumor zzso In addition, the data presented in this study will be valuable for the study of both zzso and zzso
