zzso and young adult zzso cancer survivors may have unique physical, psychological and social needs due to their cancer occurring at a critical phase of zzso The aim of this study was to develop a zzso rigorous measure of zzso need to capture the specific needs of this zzso 

Items were developed following a comprehensive literature review, focus groups with zzso and feedback from health care providers, researchers and other zzso The measure was pilot tested with 32 zzso cancer survivors recruited through a zzso cancer registry to establish face and content zzso A main sample of 139 zzso cancer patients and survivors were recruited through seven treatment zzso and invited to complete the zzso To establish zzso zzso a zzso of 34 participants completed the measure a second zzso zzso factor analysis was performed and the measure was assessed for internal consistency, zzso zzso potential responsiveness and zzso 

The Cancer zzso zzso - Young People zzso has established face and content zzso and zzso The final measure has 70 items and six factors: Treatment Environment and Care zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Daily Life (12 zzso Information and zzso (5 zzso Education (3 zzso and Work (3 zzso All zzso achieved zzso alpha values greater than zzso zzso zzso reliability was also high, with all but four items reaching weighted zzso values above zzso 

The zzso is the first zzso measure of zzso need which has been developed specifically for zzso cancer patients and zzso The measure displays a strong factor structure, and excellent internal consistency and zzso zzso However, the small sample size has implications for the reliability of the statistical analyses zzso particularly the exploratory factor zzso Future studies with a larger sample are recommended to confirm the factor structure of the zzso zzso studies to establish responsiveness and zzso zzso should also be zzso
