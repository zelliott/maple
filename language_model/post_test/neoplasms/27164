We put forward a model for cancer zzso as a migration phenomenon between tumor cell populations zzso and evolving in two different zzso One of them is a primary tumor and the other one is a secondary or zzso zzso The evolution of the different cell zzso populations in each habitat is described by means of a simple zzso model allowing for a cascade of zzso between the different zzso in each zzso The cell migration event is supposed to be zzso and take place continuously in zzso The possible clinical outcomes of the model depending on the zzso space are analyzed and the effect of the zzso of the primary tumor is zzso
