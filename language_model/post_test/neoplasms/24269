zzso shows a broad clinical activity in zzso breast and zzso cell lung zzso However, controversy remains about the respective effects of doses and schedules in zzso zzso This study was conducted to compare the zzso activity of short-term (1 zzso versus prolonged exposure zzso zzso to zzso in human cancer zzso A zzso cloning system zzso was used to determine the in zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso against cancer cells taken directly from zzso A decrease in tumor colony formation resulting from drug exposure was considered an in zzso response if survival of colonies was up to 50% of that in positive zzso Among 11 zzso patients' zzso both zzso and long-term exposure to zzso had significant zzso effects on the growth zzso of human cancer zzso With the 1 h exposure schedule, in zzso responses were observed in zzso and zzso of zzso tumor specimens at final zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso With the prolonged exposure schedule, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced 27, 45 and 91 in zzso response rates, zzso In those patients' zzso prolonged exposure to zzso induced significantly more in zzso tumor responses than 1 h administration zzso zzso zzso Similar trends were observed in zzso breast and zzso cell lung zzso Our data indicate that the duration of exposure to zzso is an important factor in zzso zzso in human tumors and suggest that long-term exposure may improve the zzso activity of zzso
