Patient exposure rate zzso verify published patient dose rate data and characterize dose rates near zzso zzso zzso A specific dose rate constant based on patient exposure rate zzso is a convenient quantity that can be applied to the desired distance, injection activity, and time zzso to obtain an accurate calculation of cumulative external radiation zzso This study reports exposure rates measured at various locations near zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients prior to PET zzso These zzso are zzso for the amount of administered activity, measurement distance, and time zzso and are compared with other published zzso 

Exposure rates were measured using a zzso zzso chamber at various body locations from 152 adult zzso patients zzso after a mean zzso time of 76 zzso following injection with a mean activity of zzso zzso zzso Data were obtained at nine measurement locations for each zzso three near the head, four near the chest, and two near the zzso 

On contact with, 30 zzso superior to and 30 zzso lateral to the head, the mean zzso zzso dose rates per unit injected activity at 60 zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On contact with, 30 zzso anterior to, 30 zzso lateral to and 1 m anterior to the chest, the mean zzso zzso dose rates per unit injected activity at 60 zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso h zzso 30 zzso inferior and 30 zzso lateral to the feet, the mean zzso zzso dose rates per unit injected activity at 60 zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso for this study support the use of zzso zzso zzso h as a reasonable representation of the dose rate anterior from the chest of patients immediately following zzso This value can then be reliably scaled to the desired time and distance for planning and staff dose evaluation zzso At distances closer than 1 zzso a zzso dose rate constant of zzso zzso h at 30 zzso is recommended for accurate zzso An accurate zzso dose rate constant that accounts for zzso variables zzso distribution and zzso will allow an accurate evaluation of the dose rate from a patient injected with an isotope rather than simply utilizing a physical zzso
