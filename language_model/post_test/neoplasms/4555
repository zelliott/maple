zzso therapy can provide long-term control of local or zzso cancer without removal of large volumes of tissue and with preservation of function of surrounding normal zzso zzso therapy is used for zzso that have extended near or around critical structures such as spinal cord, nerves, or large zzso zzso tissue response limits the total radiation dose that can be zzso The objective of radiation therapy is to provide the highest probability for local tumor control with a probability for serious complications such as bone or zzso necrosis of less than zzso zzso therapy can be used in combination with surgery and/or zzso however, there should be a carefully coordinated treatment zzso The basic principle of cancer treatment with zzso intent is to treat as early and as aggressively as zzso The first opportunity for tumor control is always the best zzso zzso zzso are using improved equipment and greater knowledge of radiation biology to maximize tumor control and to minimize normal tissue zzso Currently, most veterinary radiation zzso practices use an external beam source of radiation from either zzso 60 zzso units or clinical zzso Many practices use daily treatments for 3 to 4 zzso The relatively short overall treatment time prevents significant zzso of tumor cells during the course of zzso The total dose is divided into several smaller fractional doses that spares late responding normal zzso
