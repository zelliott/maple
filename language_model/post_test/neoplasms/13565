zzso spread of zzso is a common clinical problem, with limited treatment options leading to morbidity and zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso combines zzso surgical zzso of gross tumor with zzso light delivery to the zzso after zzso zzso injection of zzso to treat residual zzso An issue of concern in zzso is the potential lack of zzso zzso by residual small tumor zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in maximum diameter and by microscopic residual disease caused by incomplete development of a vascular zzso This study examined the existence of zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso in 12 patients in a Phase II clinical trial for zzso 

Patients received zzso zzso zzso zzso 48 h before zzso zzso obtained during surgery were zzso zzso for zzso cell zzso zzso 1, and analyzed by light zzso Mean vascular zzso in zzso were determined by counting zzso within a zzso field zzso zzso zzso Sections were also examined for zzso zzso by zzso image analysis using an zzso microscope and zzso zzso zzso 

Data obtained showed that tumors as small as 1 zzso in diameter stained positive for zzso cell zzso zzso 1 and contained zzso A negative control from a patient not given zzso showed no zzso zzso The average of all mean vascular zzso in zzso was determined to be 100 zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso as small as 1 zzso in diameter, have a functional zzso because these tumors show zzso zzso after zzso zzso Both properties are crucial for the treatment of residual zzso by zzso after surgical zzso
