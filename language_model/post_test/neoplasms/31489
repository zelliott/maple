In this paper we study a mathematical model that describes the growth of an avascular solid zzso Our analysis concentrates on the stability of steady, zzso model solutions with respect to zzso taken from the class of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso analysis, previous results are extended to show how the zzso of the zzso modes zzso Attention focuses on a special case for which the model equations zzso Analysis of the simplified model equations leads to the identification of a zzso family of zzso steady solutions, the dimensions of whose stable and unstable zzso depend on the system zzso The zzso steady solutions limit the basin of attraction of the zzso steady state when it is zzso zzso On the basis of these zzso and zzso results we zzso the existence of fully zzso steady solutions which are stable with respect to zzso zzso
