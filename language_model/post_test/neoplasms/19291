zzso large molecules into the zzso of animal cells without damaging the cells has been one of the toughest challenges in zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that was designed to deliver zzso zzso zzso and other zzso substances into the zzso compartment of cells by an zzso process that avoids damaging the plasma membrane of the zzso This prevents the loss of vital cell contents and the attendant high cell toxicity typical of most delivery zzso To deliver a substance into cells simply add that substance to the medium covering the cells, followed by addition of the zzso zzso solution and swirl to zzso While most delivery zzso begin to show serious toxicity after just a few hours and are relatively ineffective in the presence of serum, delivery with zzso may be continued for 24 hours, or even 48 hours, without undue zzso and zzso is particularly effective in the presence of the zzso serum commonly used with cultured zzso The mechanism of delivery, zzso rapid zzso of zzso to cell surfaces, but this zzso to the cell surface does not damage the plasma zzso The zzso zzso is rapidly zzso along with any substances present in the medium zzso the cargo one wishes to zzso Upon subsequent zzso of the zzso (a natural zzso the zzso contained within that zzso is converted to its zzso form, which acts to zzso the zzso zzso This zzso zzso of the zzso membrane allows any zzso cargo to pass from the zzso into the zzso of the zzso This paper describes the basic design strategy used to develop zzso test systems used to guide that development, and the effects of various structural zzso including size and composition of the zzso face, size and composition of the zzso face, and the relationship between zzso length and delivery efficiency in the presence of zzso
