The Ras zzso are a zzso of molecular switches that regulate cellular proliferation and zzso in response to zzso zzso The regulation of these pathways depends on the interaction of the zzso with specific zzso Recently, we have cloned and characterized a novel gene zzso a putative Ras zzso the zzso domain family 1 zzso zzso The zzso gene is located in the zzso segment of zzso The high zzso loss in a variety of zzso suggested a crucial role of this region in zzso At least two forms of zzso are present in normal human zzso The zzso zzso is highly zzso zzso in zzso breast, zzso zzso zzso zzso and several other zzso zzso of zzso reduced the growth of human cancer cells supporting a role for zzso as a tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are mutually exclusive events in the development of certain zzso This observation could further pinpoint the function of zzso as a negative zzso of Ras in a zzso signaling zzso In zzso zzso and gastric cancer zzso zzso is associated with virus infection of zzso and zzso respectively, and suggests a zzso relationship between viral infection and progressive zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, a significant correlation between zzso zzso and impaired lung cancer patient survival was reported, and zzso zzso was correlated with several parameters of poor prognosis and advanced tumor stage zzso poor zzso zzso and zzso Thus, zzso zzso could serve as a useful marker for the prognosis of cancer patients and could become important in early detection of zzso
