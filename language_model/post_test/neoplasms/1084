The zzso zzso zzso plays key roles in tumor suppression and induction of tumor cell zzso However, the mechanisms behind these functions remain poorly zzso Using zzso tools, we identified a zzso factor zzso network regulated by zzso and required for human zzso zzso cell zzso in zzso We found that zzso zzso regulates a core network of 46 genes that includes 16 zzso zzso of zzso induced the expression of the zzso zzso and zzso while zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, induction of zzso by zzso was dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso interrupted tumor cell zzso while zzso of zzso or zzso or zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso the onset of zzso Our results identify components of the regulatory mechanisms driving zzso cancer cell zzso These may regulate dormancy of residual disease that usually precedes the onset of zzso in many zzso
