zzso is a novel zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso rationally designed to spare a class of closely related zzso known as zzso zzso zzso zzso is hypothesized to play a role in the zzso joint zzso occurring with zzso zzso zzso This trial was conducted to establish the recommended phase II zzso determine safety, zzso and zzso of zzso and to assess potential markers of zzso activity zzso necrosis zzso zzso release and zzso zzso 

This was an open label, single arm, phase I study conducted at two zzso Patients with advanced or zzso cancer were treated with zzso oral zzso at doses escalating from 600 to zzso zzso Six to eight zzso level were to be studied with the recommended phase II dose level expanded to a total of 15 zzso zzso sampling was performed on days 1, 15, and 29 at 0, zzso 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, and 24 h after zzso zzso tumor assessment was performed every 8 zzso 

zzso zzso patients were enrolled in this study with the most frequent tumor types being zzso cancer and zzso cell lung zzso zzso limiting zzso were observed at 600 zzso (one of eight patients with grade 3 zzso and at 1200 zzso (1 of 15 patients with grade 3 rash and grade 4 zzso of zzso both in the context of zzso zzso No zzso zzso occurred at zzso 1800, or zzso zzso The most frequent adverse events considered zzso probably, or definitely drug-related were joint toxicity zzso zzso fatigue, headache, zzso and taste change, all of which were mild, grade 1, grade 2, and not zzso No objective tumor responses were zzso Twelve of zzso patients received treatment for zzso months, six for zzso months, three for zzso zzso zzso trough levels of parent zzso were maintained with once daily zzso The mean plasma concentration of parent zzso at trough exceeded the calculated in zzso zzso value for zzso and zzso value for zzso at the recommended phase II dose of 1200 zzso No major changes in serum zzso of zzso zzso products, zzso or zzso were zzso 

zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor with a novel zzso zzso zzso In this study, plasma zzso of zzso continuously exceeded in zzso zzso zzso values without zzso joint zzso In this zzso patient population, a suggestion of disease stabilization was observed in 12 zzso On the basis of zzso clinical, and zzso data, the recommended phase II dose for future study is 1200 zzso
