Iron oxide zzso due to their exceptional magnetic property, zzso and zzso have long been studied as contrast agents for magnetic resonance imaging zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Drug zzso Rev zzso zzso While previous applications mostly target zzso system zzso zzso such as liver and zzso zzso recent efforts have been made to impart targeting peptides or zzso onto particle surface to enable zzso targeting after systemic administration zzso et zzso zzso Drug zzso Rev zzso zzso Cai and zzso Small zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Drug zzso Rev 58 zzso 2006; zzso et zzso zzso zzso Res zzso Moreover, other imaging zzso can be loaded onto zzso to achieve zzso imaging zzso zzso and zzso Small zzso zzso Lee et zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this zzso we describe the procedure of constructing an iron oxide zzso zzso probe with high affinity towards zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and magnetic resonance imaging zzso dual zzso zzso The related zzso and validation experiments, including particle concentration determination, zzso blue zzso animal model preparation, and in zzso zzso imaging will also be zzso
