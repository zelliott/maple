zzso cancer mortality is zzso higher for Black Americans than for the general zzso population, which may result from inappropriate use of cancer detection zzso Social support has been shown to affect adjustment to breast cancer and survival, but it has not been studied as a predictor of use of preventive health care services in the older zzso Our hypothesis is that larger social networks are associated with greater zzso of zzso tests in the older zzso 

The objective of this study was to examine the relationship between social support and use of zzso tests among older Black zzso 

Data for this study were obtained from a 1986 baseline survey evaluation of a community intervention program to increase cancer awareness and a 1991 zzso survey of use of cancer detection zzso Our study sample consisted of zzso Black Americans aged 55 years or older who lived in San Francisco zzso the control community, and in Oakland zzso the target community for zzso The survey included measures of 1) social network zzso as determined by a modified version of Berkman and zzso Social Network zzso 2) demographic zzso and 3) use of six zzso zzso zzso blood stool examination, cervical zzso clinical breast examination, digital zzso examination, and zzso 

Multiple zzso zzso analysis of the Social Network Index results indicated statistically significant positive associations of social support with the use of zzso and zzso blood stool examination but not with the other zzso zzso There were statistically significant associations between having zzso zzso Maintenance zzso insurance and increased use of zzso and zzso blood stool examination, compared with having zzso or other zzso The zzso between the surveys had a statistically significant positive association with use of zzso These significant associations were not explained by differences in the other zzso which included health status, age, zzso education, type of health insurance, zzso between the surveys, and a regular source of zzso 

Social support seems to be associated with increased use of zzso and zzso blood stool examinations among older Black zzso 

zzso designed to increase zzso of social networks may be an effective way to increase use of cancer zzso which may ultimately lead to reduced mortality from zzso
