We examined 106 zzso of cancer patients receiving zzso zzso to investigate the nature and meaning of zzso It is known that zzso causes zzso areas of zzso zzso and zzso the appearance of which is dose zzso zzso cancer patients not yet receiving zzso were examined to provide zzso Patients were divided into six groups, according to total cumulative zzso dose zzso The zzso of bites in the different groups was shown to be as zzso group 1 zzso 38 zzso zzso group 2 zzso zzso of body surface zzso 23 zzso zzso group 3 zzso zzso 33 zzso zzso group 4 zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso group 5 zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso group 6 zzso than 400 zzso 10 zzso zzso groups 2-6 zzso These percentages show a trend which is highly correlated with the total cumulative dose of zzso zzso The influence of age on the appearance of bites has been excluded by analyses of trends in patients below and over 50 years zzso In zzso of cases, bites appear on more than one plane and mostly close to the maximum zzso zzso We therefore think that these results favor the hypothesis that bites are the zzso expression of zzso such as small zzso and zzso areas, which interfere with the normal spread of the zzso zzso zzso
