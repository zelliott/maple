The present study was designed to determine the maximum tolerated dose zzso toxicity profile, zzso zzso and zzso activity of the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Pharmaceuticals, zzso zzso zzso when administered in combination with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Patients with zzso solid tumors received zzso zzso as a zzso continuous infusion administered simultaneously with zzso and zzso given daily for 5 days repeated every 4-5 weeks (one zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis were performed on samples taken during the first cycle in all zzso Fifteen patients received zzso zzso at one of three dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso All patients simultaneously received zzso zzso zzso and zzso (20 zzso for 5 consecutive zzso Grade 1-2 zzso included zzso fatigue, zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor zzso One patient had grade 3 chest pain considered to be related to zzso therapy, another patient had zzso grade 3 zzso resolving in zzso days, and one patient with a history of zzso had an acute upper gastrointestinal bleed thought to be zzso zzso Five patients developed cycle 1 grade 4 zzso which resolved without zzso factors before the next treatment zzso There were no effects on zzso time and activated partial zzso zzso A clinically defined zzso was not zzso The character and severity of these zzso do not seem to be dose zzso and, as such, there was no classical zzso toxicity defining the zzso zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso was consistent with those reported zzso zzso zzso parameters were also similar in the presence or absence of zzso zzso Six of 14 patients ( approximately zzso across all dose zzso had an improvement in measurable tumor response ranging from minor reduction in tumor size (4 zzso to objective partial response zzso reduction in tumor size, 2 zzso zzso zzso is tolerable at its recommended zzso dose when given with zzso and zzso There is no apparent zzso interaction between zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso activity was observed with the zzso however, it is uncertain whether clinical activity is a result of enhanced drug zzso Our study warrants further exploration of efficacy in a Phase II and/or Phase III clinical trial zzso
