Recent studies have found that bone zzso cells give rise to zzso cells during states of tissue repair and zzso We have found that one key zzso zzso promotes the zzso of circulating zzso zzso cells zzso to sites of ongoing tissue zzso This zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to the vascular zzso in inflamed tissue or within zzso We demonstrate how to zzso zzso zzso and characterize zzso We also demonstrate in zzso analysis of the roles of bone zzso cells in tumor growth and zzso by demonstrating adoptive transfer, bone zzso zzso tumor models, and zzso for markers of blood and zzso zzso Finally, we show how to characterize cell zzso mechanisms regulating bone zzso zzso cell zzso
