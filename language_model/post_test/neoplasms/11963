Progress in zzso and in zzso together with the evolution of radiation generators led to adopt very elaborated zzso zzso However, the therapist should have confidence in these protocols on condition that zzso parameters are strictly zzso For obvious reasons, this is impossible despite the meticulous zzso In this, paper, we therefore intend to study the role of the angle of zzso on the actual distribution of zzso we also study the inaccuracy of certain parameters recorded during preparation for the therapy or shown during successive zzso zzso In this paper we retain only errors which can be easily zzso These are errors concerning the zzso apparatus zzso to skin distance, angle of the rays, field zzso and those due to factors related to the patient zzso zzso zzso entrance point of rays and zzso changes of the zzso The different errors can be associated in various ways for a given therapy zzso For the same reason, an zzso of a given nominal value will have several zzso All these zzso are lined by two zzso which we call zzso and inferior zzso these border the zzso zzso It can be said that at the end of the treatment, the given zzso lies in this area; it is however impossible to define its form or exact zzso A few examples in the text illustrate these results and show the possible practical angles of zzso If we assume that errors during successive zzso are distributed at random, a certain compensation is noted and the zzso of zzso zzso But if the errors are constantly on the same side, as is sometimes the case, the dose distribution can be very different from that predicted in the zzso zzso
