Using zzso that was extracted from the volatile oil of zzso zzso as the raw material, its derivatives were zzso and zzso The structures of these compounds were confirmed by zzso zzso zzso and mass spectral zzso The test compounds were evaluated for their in zzso zzso activity against gastric cancer cell lines zzso and lung zzso cell line zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso relationships of these zzso derivatives were also revealed for zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso groups or zzso could increase the activity significantly, whereas zzso of zzso diminished the zzso zzso Many of the tested candidates exhibited higher zzso efficiency than zzso suggesting that structural modifications could enhance its activity zzso
