The purpose of this study was to investigate the correlation between model observer and human observer performance in CT imaging for the task of zzso detection and zzso when the zzso location is zzso 

Two zzso rods zzso and zzso zzso were placed in a zzso zzso zzso water phantom to simulate zzso with zzso zzso contrast at 120 zzso The phantom was scanned 100 times on a zzso CT scanner at each of four dose levels zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of interest zzso around each zzso were extracted to generate images with zzso with each zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso images were generated from images without zzso mimicking zzso The location of the zzso zzso in each zzso was randomly distributed by moving the zzso around each zzso Human observer studies were performed by having three trained observers identify the presence or absence of zzso indicating the zzso location in each image and scoring confidence for the detection task on a 6-point zzso The same image data were analyzed using a zzso zzso model observer zzso with zzso zzso Internal noise was added to the decision variables for the model observer zzso Area under the curve zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were calculated using a zzso zzso The zzso rank order correlation between the average performance of the human observers and the model observer performance was calculated for the zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso for both the 3- and zzso diameter zzso 

In both zzso and zzso zzso zzso values for the model observer agreed well with the average values across the three human zzso The zzso rank order correlation values for both zzso and zzso analyses for both the 3- and zzso diameter zzso were all zzso indicating perfect rank ordering agreement of the figures of merit zzso between the average performance of the human observers and the model observer zzso 

In CT imaging of different sizes of zzso zzso zzso zzso the performance of zzso with zzso channels was highly correlated with human observer performance for the detection and zzso tasks with uncertain zzso location in CT imaging at four clinically relevant dose zzso This suggests the ability of zzso zzso model observers to zzso assess CT image quality for the purpose of zzso scan protocols and radiation dose levels in detection and zzso tasks for zzso zzso
