zzso spectral imaging was applied on zzso zzso zzso from colon and skin zzso zzso These samples were deposited onto different zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso and embedded using two types of zzso zzso fixation followed by zzso embedding is the gold standard in tissue zzso It can preserve molecular structures and it is compatible with zzso However, zzso zzso bands are significant in the zzso region and can mask some molecular zzso of the zzso zzso data processing was applied on spectral images without any chemical zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Signal Correction was used to correct the spectral contribution from zzso For this purpose, the signal of zzso was zzso using Principal zzso Analysis and zzso zzso were removed from the raw images based on an zzso zzso Then, zzso images were zzso by zzso zzso in order to highlight zzso structures of zzso This robust zzso methodology was applied on the two zzso zzso areas were successfully demarcated from the rest of the tissue in both colon and skin independently of the embedding material and of the zzso
