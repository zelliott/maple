Since the early 1960s, small organic molecules derived naturally from microbes and plants have provided a number of useful cancer zzso zzso The search for naturally occurring lead compounds of this type has continued in recent years, with the constituents of marine zzso and zzso as well as those of zzso zzso and plants being investigated for their zzso zzso In the present short review, selected novel compounds that have been obtained from organisms of diverse biological origin, or their zzso are discussed in terms of their potential use as cancer zzso zzso Such promising lead compounds tend to generate considerable interest among scientists such as synthetic organic chemists and zzso zzso the supply of a given precious natural product sample may be zzso and it may be possible to determine a preliminary notion of zzso relationships and of its potential mechanism of zzso
