The tumor zzso can promote tumor growth and reduce treatment zzso zzso can occur in many sites in the body, but how surrounding normal zzso at different anatomical sites affect tumor zzso and their subsequent response to therapy is not zzso demonstrated that tumors from zzso zzso or prostate cell lines in zzso locations responded to zzso consisting of three zzso zzso termed zzso to a much lesser extent than the same tumor type located zzso A zzso response to zzso was confirmed by ex zzso separation of subcutaneous zzso or zzso tumor cells from zzso cells, followed by zzso of tumor cells into the opposite zzso Compared with SC tumors, zzso tumors had a zzso associated with a type 2 immune response, related to zzso and an involvement of alternatively activated zzso in the kidney zzso zzso kidney tumors were more highly zzso than SC zzso zzso the zzso and zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 or zzso led to a significantly improved therapeutic zzso This study highlights the importance of the tissue of zzso in zzso the tumor zzso These are important fundamental issues in tumor biology and crucial factors to consider in the design of experimental models and treatment zzso
