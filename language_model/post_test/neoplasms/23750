zzso zzso acid zzso is an zzso agent that has undergone extensive study in Phase I zzso zzso plasma protein binding has been demonstrated in zzso at zzso of total drug that are achieved in zzso Moreover, zzso total systemic clearance has been described when zzso has been administered as a short zzso zzso When administered as a prolonged 24-hr infusion, total zzso zzso plus zzso plasma zzso are well described with a zzso zzso zzso However, measurement of zzso zzso zzso and zzso infusion in eight patients revealed a twofold increase in fraction of zzso zzso in plasma zzso We attempted to fit zzso structural models of varying complexity to the zzso zzso alone and simultaneously to the zzso and bound zzso plasma zzso The data were adequately described only by a model that incorporated simultaneous zzso plasma protein binding and a zzso process for zzso A comparison among models is zzso as well as zzso zzso estimates for zzso in zzso These clinical data are consistent with predictions of the clearance model in which both zzso protein binding zzso in a zzso increasing zzso zzso and zzso elimination zzso in gradually decreasing zzso intrinsic zzso are zzso
