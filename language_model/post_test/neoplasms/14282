Previous studies have shown a high prevalence of syndromes in children with zzso We described four patterns of zzso zzso abnormalities indicating new zzso predisposition zzso These patterns were named after their zzso zzso zzso zzso folds zzso zzso lower limbs zzso and Sydney creases zzso zzso The purpose of our study was to identify structural zzso zzso possibly involved in these zzso predisposition zzso 

In 49 zzso (13 from zzso nine from zzso 20 from zzso and seven from SC patterns zzso zzso was zzso Copy number variation zzso in zzso DNA of the zzso was zzso to detect zzso using zzso zzso FISH and zzso chain reaction zzso experiments were done to validate events identified by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso analysis showed an inherited inversion of zzso 15, zzso zzso in a zzso with zzso zzso of the genes at the zzso made it unlikely that these explained the zzso and zzso in this zzso Eleven zzso events met our inclusion zzso three inherited zzso events involved an zzso A zzso involving zzso was identified in a zzso diagnosed with zzso zzso A zzso involving zzso was identified in a zzso diagnosed with zzso Both zzso showed the zzso of zzso zzso A deletion involving zzso was identified in two zzso from the zzso diagnosed with zzso and zzso zzso 

We report on structural zzso zzso in zzso cancer patients with newly zzso zzso predisposition zzso We identify three zzso events which we suggest to be zzso zzso
