The aim of this study is to briefly review proliferation markers that can be applied in zzso with special emphasis on the zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso with a nuclear zzso present in all zzso cells which are in the active parts of the cell cycle, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but which is absent in zzso zzso Thus, with the help of this zzso a determination of the growth fraction of a given human cell population is zzso The use of this method in human tumor zzso is illustrated by three examples: zzso melanoma, breast zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results show that evaluation of the growth zzso by zzso is not only a diagnostic importance, but also has independent zzso zzso In addition, preliminary data on the zzso characterization of native and zzso zzso zzso are zzso In zzso analysis, zzso detects a zzso with apparent molecular weights of greater than 300 zzso Furthermore, our data show that zzso clones isolated from Lambda zzso zzso libraries zzso for parts of the zzso zzso and must contain the sequence that encodes for the zzso recognized by the zzso zzso
