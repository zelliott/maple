zzso and prospective zzso and clinical data have demonstrated an association between chemotherapy dose intensity and both clinical efficacy and zzso The optimum tolerable and effective dose and schedule of zzso agents is based on data from zzso studies and early clinical zzso There is considerable evidence that reductions in the recommended dose intensity often occurs in actual clinical practice, particularly among overweight and obese patients with zzso With increasing rates of zzso and variation and uncertainty about appropriate dosing of chemotherapy in obese patients, zzso has generated clinical practice guidelines for appropriate chemotherapy dosing for obese adult patients with zzso Without evidence of any increase in zzso toxicity among obese patients receiving chemotherapy, the guidelines recommend that, after considering any accompanying zzso chemotherapy dosing should be calculated based on body surface area using actual weight, rather than an estimate or zzso of zzso While further research is needed, zzso studies support the use of actual body weight to calculate chemotherapy doses for most chemotherapy drugs in obese zzso We highlight the issue of chemotherapy dosing in this population, how a more personalized approach can be zzso as well as discussing areas for further zzso
