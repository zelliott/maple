We report the isolation of a novel human zzso domain zzso gene named zzso The zzso domain of the zzso zzso protein is highly related to the zzso domain potentially zzso by the rat zzso sequence and to that of the zzso zzso zzso outside of the zzso region, zzso is unrelated to any previously characterized zzso The zzso gene is expressed almost exclusively in normal zzso and transformed cells of neural zzso In the developing mouse and human zzso zzso is expressed in a zzso and temporally restricted pattern that suggests a critical role in the differentiation of zzso zzso In addition, zzso is expressed in a unique subset of tumors of the peripheral nervous system including zzso and Ewing's zzso but not zzso Based on its unique structural characteristics and expression pattern, we discuss potential functions for the zzso zzso
