The expression of zzso zzso protein associated with the nucleus in the X zzso gene family has been reported in many tumors, such as melanoma, zzso glioblastoma, breast zzso zzso cancer, zzso germ cell tumors, and zzso zzso However, no systematic approach has so far been devised to estimate the percentage of cancer cells expressing zzso This study was undertaken to zzso the expression of zzso proteins in zzso The expression of zzso proteins was evaluated by zzso in normal skin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and benign zzso zzso zzso 10), using a zzso zzso raised in our zzso zzso of the 21 zzso zzso examined expressed zzso zzso A high percentage of their cells zzso zzso zzso stained positively for zzso proteins compared with no expression found in normal skin zzso zzso zzso had an intermediate number of cells expressing zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso which resulted significantly higher than normal skin cells and significantly lower than skin melanoma zzso In melanoma cells, the labeling was mostly zzso sometimes incomplete or limited to the zzso wall, even if zzso zzso was also seen in zzso tumor zzso In contrast, the 5 of 10 zzso zzso had a clear nuclear zzso of the zzso These data suggest that the zzso protein family is expressed in the vast majority of the zzso zzso The zzso which brings up zzso gene expression and the role of these proteins are not zzso
