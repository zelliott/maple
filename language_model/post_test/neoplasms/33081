The objective of this study is to genetically engineer zzso zzso for biological zzso and evaluate their zzso activity in a zzso mouse zzso Mouse zzso zzso were incubated on the surface of a culture dish which had been coated with the complex of a zzso zzso and zzso zzso DNA complex plus a cell zzso zzso zzso for gene zzso zzso zzso When compared with the conventional zzso where zzso were zzso in the medium containing the complex, the level of gene expression by the reverse method was significantly high and the time period of gene expression was zzso zzso microscopic observation revealed that the zzso DNA was localized in the cell nucleus to a higher extent by the reverse zzso zzso Following the reverse zzso of zzso by the zzso DNA of a zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso the zzso protein was zzso at a higher amount for a longer time period in contrast to the conventional zzso of free zzso zzso The zzso zzso exhibited a stronger zzso activity for in zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso When injected zzso into mice carrying a mass of zzso tumor cells, the zzso engineered were accumulated in the tumor tissue and showed significant zzso zzso It is concluded that the zzso injected functioned as the natural carrier of tumor targeting for zzso zzso zzso resulting in enhanced suppression of tumor growth at a high zzso
