Solid tumors must recruit and form new blood vessels for zzso growth and zzso of zzso zzso drugs that block zzso zzso is thus an important approach in cancer treatment and has given rise to multiple in zzso and in zzso zzso The present hybrid individual zzso model incorporates some underlying zzso events relating more closely the classical Cellular zzso Model zzso parameters to zzso mechanisms and to the zzso of specific signaling zzso The model spans the three fundamental biological zzso at the zzso level a continuous model describes zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso at the cellular level, an extended lattice zzso based on a system energy reduction, reproduces cell dynamics such as migration, zzso and zzso at the zzso level, a set of zzso equations describes a simplified zzso zzso zzso zzso The results agree with the known interplay between calcium signals and zzso dynamics and with their role in zzso zzso Moreover, the analysis of the link between the microscopic zzso dynamics and the zzso cell behaviors confirms the efficiency of some pharmacological interventions that are currently in use and, more interestingly, proposes some new therapeutic approaches, that are zzso but potentially zzso
