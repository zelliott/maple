zzso electron beam zzso is increasingly performed using mobile zzso delivering therapeutic radiation doses in zzso operating zzso While no special zzso problem should arise for operation at 10 zzso or less, it is not clear whether this holds true for operation at higher zzso This paper reports the measured zzso production from a zzso mobile electron zzso operated at 12 zzso and compares the results with those from a conventional zzso also operated at 12 zzso in electron zzso zzso leakage zzso were performed by means of passive bubble detectors in the scattering foil, patient and floor zzso zzso dose equivalent rates per unit of electron dose delivered by the zzso at its normal treatment distance zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso at the accelerator head, zzso zzso zzso in the patient plane at 15 zzso from the beam axis and zzso zzso zzso at the floor plane, on the beam axis and under the beam zzso For a weekly workload of 250 zzso the weekly zzso dose zzso at 12 zzso for the zzso at a distance of 300 zzso from the scattering foil were zzso and zzso zzso for floor below and adjoining areas on the same floor, zzso zzso dose equivalent rates generated from zzso are at least one order of magnitude lower than ones produced by a conventional zzso operated at the same energy in electron zzso zzso can be used at 12 zzso in an zzso operating room for a weekly workload of up to 250 zzso if the zzso zzso are zzso to negligible zzso
