Human zzso reverse zzso zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso is responsible for the synthesis and maintenance of the zzso repeats at the zzso ends of human zzso zzso expression is zzso in normal human cells and is activated in zzso cells and during zzso but the mechanism by which zzso expression is regulated is not fully zzso Previous studies have shown that zzso stimulates zzso zzso through the binding sites located on the zzso zzso In this study, we sought to determine whether zzso zzso zzso zzso through its direct interaction with zzso In zzso cancer cells, zzso increased zzso expression by zzso and zzso completely zzso this zzso A zzso in the zzso site zzso of the zzso promoter resulted in the loss of zzso by zzso and in the loss of zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso domain in zzso resulted in the loss of zzso ability to inhibit zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso associates with zzso and zzso the binding activity of zzso to the zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso is involved in regulating cellular zzso through the zzso of zzso on the zzso zzso
