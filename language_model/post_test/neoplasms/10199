zzso of zzso zzso in cancer zzso genes represent a limited but high-risk population characterized by a high probability of cancer development, frequently with its manifestation in early age and with a 50% chance of zzso zzso inheritance by zzso In case of zzso disorders, zzso genetic diagnosis zzso could be used for characterization of the DNA region affected by zzso zzso in the early stages of an zzso created by in zzso zzso zzso zzso the transfer of unaffected zzso could be performed based on the results of zzso zzso enabling the development of offspring not carrying the zzso zzso 

Here we present the consensus of the collaborative group of the Society for Medical zzso the Czech Society for Oncology and other professionals for use of zzso in the Czech Republic for carriers of zzso in cancer zzso zzso We address the conditions, zzso and limits of practical application of this zzso We also point out specific issues of zzso zzso in carriers of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso anticipating the increased risk of zzso dependent breast and zzso zzso zzso 

We assume that a narrow but zzso zzso of cancer zzso gene zzso carriers may benefit from zzso are mainly individuals deciding to undergo zzso and zzso recruited from zzso carriers with extreme concerns about zzso the zzso to their zzso The zzso in these individuals should be managed by a closely cooperating multidisciplinary team of professionals responsible for indication of zzso giving complete information regarding the zzso and zzso procedures including their limits, evaluating individual risks and performing instrumental and laboratory procedures with respect to up-to-date good laboratory and clinical zzso
