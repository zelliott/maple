The effect of zzso zzso hypertension on tumor zzso fluid pressure zzso and tumor blood flow zzso was investigated to examine blood flow and pressure regulation in solid zzso zzso zzso were made before and after administration of zzso II using the zzso method in zzso tumor zzso Relative zzso was continuously monitored by laser zzso zzso The effect of host strain on zzso was evaluated in zzso zzso zzso transplanted in zzso and zzso mice, and showed no significant zzso The effects of tumor types were evaluated by comparing two zzso tumors, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and a human tumor zzso zzso zzso transplanted in zzso zzso zzso zzso was elevated in all three tumor lines to significantly different zzso zzso hypertension zzso 150 zzso zzso had a variable but tumor zzso effect on zzso and zzso The increase in zzso was correlated with the baseline zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that in addition to blood flow zzso due to the steal phenomenon, zzso control of zzso and zzso exists within these solid zzso however, the extent of control is tumor line dependent and less than that in normal zzso Moreover, parallel increases in zzso and zzso do not support the hypothesis that elevated zzso causes vascular collapse and thus decreases zzso
