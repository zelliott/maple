A regional cancer network has been set up in the zzso region in zzso The aim of the project is to improve the quality of care and to zzso prescriptions in the zzso In this network, we assessed the impact of the zzso of a clinical practice guidelines project by assessing the conformity of practice with the guidelines and comparing this with the conformity in an external matched control group from another French region without a regional cancer zzso Four hospitals zzso and zzso accepted to assess the impact of the clinical practice guidelines on the management of breast and colon cancer in the experimental group and three hospitals zzso and zzso in the control zzso In 1994 and 1996, women with zzso breast cancer zzso and zzso patients in the experimental group, zzso and zzso patients in the control group, zzso and all new patients with colon cancer (95 and 94 patients in the experimental group, and 89 and 118 patients in the control group, zzso were zzso A controlled zzso study, using institutional medical records of patients with breast and colon zzso The medical decisions concerning the patients were analyzed to assess their compliance with the clinical practice zzso When medical decisions were judged to be zzso we verified if they were based on scientific evidence in a published article, if they were not, the medical decision was classified as having zzso convincing supporting scientific zzso The compliance rates were significantly higher in 1996 than in 1994 in the experimental zzso zzso zzso out of zzso vs zzso zzso out of zzso and zzso zzso out of zzso vs zzso zzso out of zzso zzso for breast and colon cancer, zzso zzso in the control group the compliance rates were the same for the two periods; zzso (12 out of zzso vs zzso (12 out of zzso zzso and zzso zzso out of zzso vs zzso zzso out of zzso zzso In the experimental group, in 1994, 101 of the 282 medical decisions zzso and 27 of the 103 zzso for breast and colon cancer, respectively, were classified as having zzso convincing supporting scientific zzso compare with 72 out of zzso in 1996 zzso for breast cancer, and 21 of the 123 zzso for colon cancer zzso Whereas in the control group these results were 106 out of zzso in 1994 zzso and 90 out of zzso in 1996 zzso zzso for breast cancer and 28 out of 96 in 1994 zzso and 30 out of 126 in 1996 zzso zzso for colon zzso The development and zzso strategy of the clinical practice guidelines zzso for cancer management results in significant changes in medical practice in our cancer zzso These results would suggest that introducing guidelines with specific zzso strategy might also increase the compliance rate with the zzso and zzso zzso
