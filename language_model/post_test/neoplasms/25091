Maintenance of normal cell growth and differentiation is highly dependent on coordinated and tight zzso regulation of zzso In cancer, genes zzso growth regulators are zzso zzso zzso zzso of tumor zzso genes under the control of zzso modifications is a major underlying cause of zzso cellular proliferation and zzso Thus mechanisms, which regulate zzso structure and gene zzso have become attractive targets for zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso that modify zzso structure and contribute to zzso gene expression in zzso Research over the past decade has led to the development of zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso In addition to their effect on zzso and zzso mechanisms, zzso zzso also modify the zzso state of a large number of cellular proteins involved in zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso The current zzso will review the role of zzso zzso in zzso mechanisms and the current zzso status and prospects for their zzso in cancer zzso
