We created the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso or zzso or zzso in order to stimulate zzso but complimentary elements of the immune zzso We found that the physical zzso of two functionally distinct zzso as a zzso hybrid allowed for synergistic zzso not seen by the simple combined use of parent zzso Indeed, despite how these zzso are zzso zzso that serve essential roles in the maturation of zzso T cells and zzso cells, the zzso were remarkably different from one another, with zzso and zzso promoting and zzso zzso zzso The common zzso to the zzso of these zzso was their ability to zzso the zzso machinery associated with common to their respective zzso zzso zzso radically altering the zzso status of responding zzso zzso By studying the zzso we found that both zzso and cell surface factors presented by zzso zzso cells were required to zzso the immune responses in zzso models of multiple sclerosis and zzso The ability of zzso to co-opt the normal zzso machinery of zzso receptors leads to the acquisition of functional zzso cell zzso unparalleled in zzso These novel properties provide opportunities to alter zzso immune responses in health and zzso
