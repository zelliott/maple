zzso is a zzso with zzso activity against a variety of human zzso zzso zzso is thought to derive mainly from a stabilization of zzso as a result of enhanced zzso zzso that leads to an zzso of cells in the zzso zzso phase of the cell zzso Because cells in this phase of the cell cycle are known to be zzso it was thought that zzso in addition to its direct zzso may also sensitize tumor cell populations to zzso Studies evaluating the zzso potential of zzso in cultured cells have been zzso with only approximately 50% of the tested cell lines showing zzso To explain this zzso we advanced the hypothesis that the ability of zzso to zzso cells may be zzso correlated to the efficiency with which it zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, we studied zzso zzso and zzso in seven human tumor cell zzso zzso one-half of these cell lines showed zzso that was associated with a low zzso index zzso after a zzso treatment with 10 or 20 zzso zzso The results suggest that the level of zzso after zzso treatment, may predict for zzso zzso and that it could be introduced as a zzso for the zzso of combined treatment zzso
