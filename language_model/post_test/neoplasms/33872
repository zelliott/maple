The efficacy of energy conservation and activity management zzso for fatigue reduction and maintenance of functional performance has never been evaluated in adults with cancer who are undergoing zzso 

A zzso clinical trial compared an zzso intervention with a control intervention focused on zzso zzso initiating chemotherapy, zzso or concurrent therapy for cancer were zzso to receive either the zzso zzso intervention zzso zzso zzso or the control intervention zzso zzso zzso Participants in each group participated in 3 telephone sessions with an zzso nurse during the first 5 weeks of zzso Data on fatigue and limitation of functioning were obtained before cancer treatment and at two follow-up points that coincided with times of high fatigue for each type of zzso The outcomes of interest included perception of fatigue and functional zzso 

A zzso analysis of zzso using the type of cancer treatment as a zzso revealed a significant study zzso interaction indicating that the zzso group experienced a greater decrease in fatigue over time compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The intervention was not associated with changes in overall functional zzso 

zzso who received the zzso intervention derived a modest but significant benefit from zzso To achieve a more robust clinical benefit from the intervention, it may be necessary to manage other key symptoms in addition to zzso Research is needed to examine symptom clusters or combinations associated with negative outcomes as well as combination strategies for symptom zzso
