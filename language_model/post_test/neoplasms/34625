European population genetic zzso was examined in a diverse set of zzso individuals of European zzso each zzso with zzso K zzso Both zzso and principal component analyses zzso showed the largest zzso component zzso differentiated northern from southern European zzso A second PC further separated Italian, Spanish, and Greek individuals from those of zzso Jewish ancestry as well as distinguishing among northern European zzso In separate analyses of northern European participants other zzso relationships were discerned showing a west to east zzso Application of this zzso information was critical in examining a real zzso in whole zzso association zzso analyses for zzso arthritis in European Americans to reduce false positive zzso In addition, two sets of European zzso ancestry zzso markers zzso were identified that provide substantial zzso zzso The results provide further insight into European population genetic zzso and show that this information can be used for improving error rates in association testing of candidate genes and in replication studies of zzso zzso
