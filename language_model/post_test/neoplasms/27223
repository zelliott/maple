Several lines of evidence indicate that diet and dietary behaviors can contribute to human cancer zzso One way that this occurs is through the zzso of food zzso zzso zzso result from a zzso interactions where the environment includes zzso and zzso zzso In this article, we define environment as dietary zzso in the context of zzso zzso Food zzso cause different types of DNA zzso zzso zzso and gross zzso zzso Most zzso begin their action at the DNA level by forming zzso zzso which result from the zzso binding of a zzso or part of a zzso to a zzso However the effect of food zzso in zzso can be modified by zzso traits, zzso zzso genes that affect zzso exposure of DNA through zzso zzso and zzso or cellular responses to DNA damage through DNA repair mechanisms or cell zzso There are some clearly identified zzso zzso and suspected zzso zzso zzso aromatic zzso or zzso zzso food zzso The target zzso for these agents are numerous, but there is zzso specificity for zzso zzso however is not the only zzso that links dietary zzso and zzso There is growing evidence that zzso factors, including changes in the DNA zzso pattern, are causing cancer and can be modified by dietary zzso Also DNA damage may be indirect by triggering zzso DNA zzso When considering the human diet, it should be recognized that foods contain both zzso and components that decrease cancer risk such as zzso Thus nutritionally related zzso ultimately develop from an imbalance of zzso and zzso The best way to assess nutritional risks is through zzso but there is no single zzso that has been sufficiently zzso Although panels of zzso would be the most appropriate, their use as a reflection of zzso risk remains to be zzso Also even when new zzso are developed, their application in target zzso is problematic because zzso are not readily zzso For now most zzso are used in surrogate zzso zzso blood, zzso oral cavity zzso that presumably reflect biological effects in target zzso This article reviews the role of food zzso in zzso and zzso and how their effects are modified by zzso traits and discusses how to identify and evaluate the effects of food zzso
