zzso proteins are regulatory zzso platforms that enable the assembly of zzso zzso Here, we report the functional and zzso analysis of human zzso protein zzso with zzso zzso zzso a member of a novel zzso protein family with zzso capacity in zzso zzso and zzso zzso recently identified as zzso zzso Our zzso analysis divides the zzso protein family into two zzso groups that fold into zzso zzso zzso modeling identified two evolutionary zzso interaction sites in zzso zzso one of which may bind zzso Human zzso has zzso signature motifs for nuclear zzso interactions and binds zzso and zzso receptors in zzso zzso human zzso genes were found zzso expressed in a variety of matched tumor zzso including zzso pancreatic and skin zzso We found that zzso zzso protein zzso in part with the zzso marker zzso at zzso zzso structures in human melanoma zzso In addition, zzso accumulated in large zzso and zzso structures in the zzso when zzso was induced by zzso zzso These zzso zzso were blocked by zzso a classic inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso proteins share an evolutionary zzso function in zzso and that zzso capacity may be compromised in human zzso
