zzso syndromes zzso are zzso zzso stem cell zzso Among them, zzso occur after chemotherapy and/or zzso and are called zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to identify genetic markers in zzso 

A prospective cohort of 59 zzso patients zzso de zzso zzso 20 zzso was zzso A total of zzso single zzso zzso zzso selected among genes involved in DNA repair, drug metabolism and zzso signal zzso and zzso were zzso using a custom-made zzso zzso 

Two zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso in complete linkage zzso were significantly associated with zzso zzso and zzso with a raw p value of zzso zzso zzso and a corrected p value after zzso correction of zzso Other associations tested between clinical and zzso features and zzso chip gene zzso gave corrected p values above zzso A validation cohort was separately constituted of 43 patients (24 de zzso zzso 19 zzso and the two zzso zzso were zzso it confirmed a significant association between the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

We thus identified a putative marker of the risk to develop zzso after cancer zzso
