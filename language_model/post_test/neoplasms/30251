The organ or tumor activity is not uniform due to zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso of the tumor zzso However, most zzso three-dimensional zzso methods for zzso zzso have dealt with zzso activity zzso A zzso activity sample zzso zzso without artifacts is presented to calculate the dose of the zzso activity distribution for zzso zzso 

The source particle location is sampled according to the activity spatial zzso The source particle weight is imparted by the relative activity concentration of its zzso zzso This zzso is applied to calculate the dose volume zzso for multiple independent activity regions with zzso diffusion activity zzso and then compared with the level partition method zzso The minimal response and the mean tolerant initial total activity threshold required by tumor control probability and normal tissue complication probability for zzso zzso also were evaluated by the zzso sample zzso and the zzso The effective clearance zzso is assumed to be equal to its physical zzso zzso zzso days for zzso 

The result shows that the new zzso is more consistent with the weighted zzso of the zzso activity distribution than the zzso especially for the multiple independent activity regions composed of different amounts of zzso The new zzso effectively avoids the zzso artifacts to the zzso activity zzso The zzso simulation also showed that the minimal response initial total activity threshold of tumors will be much more than the mean tolerant initial total activity threshold of normal zzso zzso zzso with the activity zzso grade zzso 

A zzso is presented to simulate the dose of the zzso activity distribution for zzso zzso The new zzso effectively avoids the zzso artifacts to the zzso activity zzso
