The zzso system is implicated in zzso fluid balance regulation, immune cell trafficking, zzso and cancer zzso However, the sequence of events that initiate and coordinate zzso vessel development zzso remains zzso In effect, the understanding of zzso regulation of zzso zzso has been overshadowed by the greater emphasis focused on zzso and delayed by a lack of specific zzso thereby limiting this field to no more than a descriptive zzso Recently, new insights into zzso research have been due to the discovery of zzso markers and growth factors of vascular zzso growth factor zzso family, such as zzso and zzso Studies using transgenic mice zzso zzso and zzso have demonstrated a crucial role for these factors in zzso zzso zzso of zzso development has now been zzso at the molecular level, providing an interesting target for innovative zzso This review highlights the recent insights and advances into the field of zzso vascular research, outlining the most important aspects of the zzso development, structure, specific markers and methods applied for studying zzso Finally, molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of zzso are zzso
