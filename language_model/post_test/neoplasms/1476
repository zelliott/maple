zzso radiation zzso is an ever-present hazard to humans primarily due to its zzso zzso and cell killing zzso In addition to causing DNA damage, zzso zzso a plethora of signal zzso zzso responsible for maintaining cellular zzso and promoting interactions with neighboring zzso zzso changes in gene expression have also been found after zzso and zzso have helped discern these subsequent zzso zzso While some studies have focused on low zzso experiments, others have analyzed the gene expression response of zzso compared to other DNA damaging zzso Very few genes have been found to be consistently zzso by zzso but that set includes zzso zzso and genes associated with the zzso zzso repair zzso Overall, the immediate zzso responses to zzso have implications for DNA repair, cell cycle arrest, growth control, and cell zzso Additionally, there is a substantial zzso component to the zzso profile that could be exploited to increase the effectiveness of zzso zzso zzso of the persistent responses to zzso yielded a completely different profile than observed immediately after zzso This profile is zzso shifting even over the course of one set of zzso zzso analysis of radiation responses has also been applied to clinical response to zzso identifying genes linked to zzso and resistance in zzso chronic zzso leukemia and cervical zzso Overall, these large-scale gene expression studies have added to the understanding of the complicated biological responses to zzso and when combined with other data sets will yield a complete picture of the short and long-term consequences of zzso
