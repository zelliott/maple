The zzso zzso zzso content of DNA from normal zzso varies considerably in a zzso zzso By zzso liquid zzso we have examined the zzso contents of zzso zzso of DNA from 103 human tumors including benign, primary zzso and secondary zzso zzso The diversity and large number of these tumor samples allowed us to compare the range of DNA zzso levels from zzso zzso to that of normal zzso from zzso Most of the zzso zzso had significantly lower zzso zzso contents than did most of the benign zzso or normal zzso The percentage of primary zzso with zzso DNA was intermediate between those of zzso and benign zzso These findings might reflect an involvement of extensive zzso of DNA in tumor zzso Such zzso could be a source of the continually generated cellular diversity associated with zzso
