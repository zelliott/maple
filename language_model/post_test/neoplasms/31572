The identification of genes that zzso a growth advantage on zzso cells and the understanding of the genetic zzso responsible for their zzso have made possible a direct genetic approach to cancer treatment using zzso acid zzso Moreover, the ability to block the expression of individual genes that promote zzso provides a powerful tool to explore the molecular basis of normal growth regulation, as well as the opportunity for therapeutic zzso One technique for turning off a single activated gene is the use of zzso zzso and their zzso for zzso of gene zzso The zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso responses to external signals, such as growth factors, hormones, and zzso and are involved in cell proliferation and zzso Described zzso are recent studies supporting the potential use of zzso targeting these zzso as zzso agents for cancer zzso The zzso zzso included here are protein zzso A, protein zzso C, and zzso zzso
