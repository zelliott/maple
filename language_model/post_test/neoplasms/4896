The design and zzso of zzso interaction zzso has attracted a great deal of interest in the development of new zzso zzso zzso zzso studies on 98 zzso zzso interaction zzso were carried out using linear and the zzso mathematical zzso At first, a forward zzso linear zzso model zzso was proposed with reasonable statistical parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Then, enhanced replacement zzso linear zzso zzso and support zzso machine zzso zzso were applied to set up more accurate models zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Furthermore, the reliability and application value of the zzso and zzso model was also validated in virtual screening through receiver operating characteristic zzso
