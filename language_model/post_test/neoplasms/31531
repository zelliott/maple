In recent years, zzso has increased the understanding of many zzso zzso is a rapidly growing research area that encompasses both genetic and environmental zzso The protein composition represents the functional status of a biological zzso The five approaches presented here resulted in the detection of zzso zzso zzso B was zzso in zzso cancer, and zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso in a rat model during zzso In these two zzso attention was focused on one zzso obviously differing in amount, directly after two-dimensional zzso zzso Additional methods, such as zzso activity zzso and zzso confirmed the disease association of the two candidates resulting from zzso zzso zzso The following three investigations take advantage of the holistic potential of the zzso zzso The comparison of zzso patterns from zzso zzso patients with those of controls revealed 25 statistically significant intensity differences, from which 12 were identified by zzso acid analysis, zzso degradation or zzso laser zzso zzso zzso A human zzso zzso database was constructed, containing 3300 protein spots and 150 identified protein zzso The number of identified proteins was limited by the capacity of our group, rather than by the principle of zzso Another field where zzso proves to be a valuable tool in identifying proteins of importance for diagnosis is zzso analysis of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso disease) and zzso zzso zzso zzso from patients with early or late symptoms of zzso zzso contained zzso of various classes against about 80 zzso each, containing the already described zzso zzso B and C, zzso zzso and zzso Similarly, zzso zzso to seven different marker zzso of zzso zzso allowed differentiation between acute and zzso zzso an important diagnostic tool in both pregnancy and zzso zzso
