zzso solid tumors were identified in 36 zzso of zzso cardiac transplant recipients who survived more than 30 zzso Two patients had two types of skin tumors zzso cell and zzso zzso The tumors included the following zzso skin zzso lung zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso and zzso cell zzso Four zzso regimens based on zzso A or zzso zzso were used during this zzso 

There was no association between the zzso of solid tumors and the use of zzso zzso After the diagnosis of tumor was made, the zzso zzso survival rates of recipients with skin, zzso and other solid tumors were zzso zzso and zzso zzso Eight of 10 patients with lung cancer were in stage zzso or higher at the time of zzso 

zzso and lung tumors are the most frequent solid tumors in heart transplant zzso zzso tumors (except zzso cell zzso and zzso usually have a benign course, whereas lung and other tumors developing in cardiac transplant recipients carry a poor zzso Advanced disease stage at the time of diagnosis is responsible for the dismal outcome of recipients in whom solid tumors zzso Close zzso tumor surveillance after cardiac transplantation is zzso
