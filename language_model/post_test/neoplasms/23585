The zzso zzso zzso is being used increasingly to replace zzso blocks when shaping radiation zzso When the zzso has a stepped edge in relation to the planning target volume zzso there might be concern that the zzso is not equivalent to the use of a zzso This concern is countered by studying the effect on the zzso control probability of varying the distance between the stepped edge of the zzso and the zzso of the zzso It is observed that provided an adequate margin is added to the zzso when using the zzso the zzso is not zzso The meaning of adequate has been accurately zzso as being zzso or zzso 7 zzso when the projected leaf zzso is 10 zzso at the zzso This is the margin which when added to the outline of the planning target volume will ensure no reduction in zzso compared with the use of a zzso
