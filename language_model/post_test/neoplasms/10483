This article presents a validation study of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso response questionnaire developed by zzso et zzso in 2004 to assess zzso in advanced cancer zzso 

One hundred Irish zzso with advanced zzso cancer completed the zzso zzso and measures of depression, hopelessness, quality of life, and personal zzso 

Principal component analysis of the zzso zzso yielded four similar factors found by zzso et zzso (2004), zzso loss of meaning, zzso zzso and sense of zzso A new factor, the zzso factor, was also found in the current zzso The reliability of the five factors was good, ranging from zzso to zzso zzso to the findings of zzso et zzso zzso study, divergent zzso of the zzso zzso was not zzso zzso patients were significantly more likely to be depressed than those that did not score highly on the zzso zzso In addition, this study found significantly lower levels of zzso in general compared with zzso et zzso zzso zzso 

The results of the current study show that, in an Irish zzso care context, zzso is not differentiated from zzso Additional factor zzso studies are needed to validate the zzso zzso
