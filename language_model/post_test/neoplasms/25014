DNA vaccines have emerged as an attractive approach to generate zzso zzso immune zzso Nevertheless, the potency of DNA vaccines still needs to be improved for cancer zzso In this study, we explored whether functional linkage of a zzso zzso zzso to a model tumor zzso human zzso type 16 zzso zzso enhanced DNA vaccine zzso zzso linkage changed the location of zzso from the nucleus to the zzso zzso and led to the zzso of functionally zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, this linkage drastically enhanced the zzso processing of zzso zzso through zzso class zzso More importantly, we found that zzso mice zzso vaccinated with zzso DNA exhibited a dramatic increase in the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and, consequently, were strongly resistant over the long term to zzso tumors compared to mice vaccinated with zzso zzso zzso Thus, because of the increase in tumor zzso zzso immune responses obtained through both enhanced zzso presentation and zzso vaccination with DNA zzso zzso linked to a tumor zzso holds great promise for treating zzso
