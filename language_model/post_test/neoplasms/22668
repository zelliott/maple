Finding reliable gene markers for accurate disease zzso is very challenging due to a number of reasons, including the small sample size of typical clinical data, high noise in gene expression zzso and the zzso across zzso In fact, gene markers identified in independent studies often do not coincide with each other, suggesting that many of the predicted markers may have no biological significance and may be simply artifacts of the analyzed zzso To find more reliable and zzso diagnostic zzso several studies proposed to analyze the gene expression data at the level of groups of functionally related zzso such as zzso Studies have shown that zzso markers tend to be more robust and yield more accurate zzso zzso One practical problem of the zzso approach is the limited coverage of genes by currently known zzso As a result, potentially important genes that play critical roles in cancer development may be zzso To overcome this problem, we propose a novel method for identifying reliable zzso markers in a human zzso interaction zzso zzso 

In this method, we overlay the gene expression data with the zzso network and look for the most zzso linear paths that consist of zzso genes that are highly correlated to each zzso The overlapping linear paths are then zzso combined into zzso that can potentially serve as effective diagnostic zzso We tested our method on two independent large-scale breast cancer zzso and compared the effectiveness and zzso of the identified zzso markers with zzso and zzso zzso We also compared the proposed method with an existing zzso zzso 

The proposed method can efficiently find reliable zzso markers that outperform the zzso and zzso markers in terms of zzso power, zzso and zzso zzso zzso markers found by our method are highly enriched in common GO terms, and they can more accurately zzso breast cancer zzso compared to markers found by a previous zzso
