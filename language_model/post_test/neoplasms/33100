A novel zzso vaccine candidate built on a zzso scaffold has been zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso have been clustered onto a zzso scaffold bearing an zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the synthetic construct has been investigated by zzso of mice in zzso zzso zzso has evidenced that the zzso construct stimulates a higher production of zzso zzso zzso zzso when compared to an analogous zzso zzso This result is zzso to an zzso cluster effect and makes the reported vaccine candidate a good mimic of the natural motifs present on the zzso zzso
