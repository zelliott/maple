The mechanism of action, zzso clinical zzso adverse effects, and dosage and administration of zzso are zzso zzso is a zzso converted by alkaline zzso to the active zzso compound zzso zzso protects normal cells by scavenging free zzso zzso hydrogen zzso to free zzso depleting zzso and binding to active derivatives of zzso zzso The immediate conversion of zzso to zzso its small volume of distribution, and the limited amount of drug and zzso recovered in the urine suggest that zzso is rapidly zzso and enters cells as its active zzso The selectivity of zzso for normal tissue is hypothesized to be a results of the decreased zzso of tumors, decreased activity of alkaline zzso in tumor cells, and pH dependence of zzso zzso In clinical studies, zzso decreased the frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has demonstrated an ability to decrease the zzso toxicity of zzso zzso zzso and zzso drug zzso zzso has zzso labeling for use in reducing cumulative zzso toxicity in patients receiving repeat doses of zzso for advanced zzso cancer and zzso lung zzso The recommended dose in adults is 910 zzso administered as a 15-minute infusion 30 minutes before the start of zzso The major adverse effects of zzso include zzso and zzso The benefits of zzso must be weighted against its potential adverse effects, and the drug's impact on the efficacy of zzso should be further zzso zzso has shown promise in protecting zzso cells from the toxic effects of zzso apparently without compromising toxicity against cancer zzso
