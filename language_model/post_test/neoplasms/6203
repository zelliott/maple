zzso dose delivery to zzso tissue in zzso is of paramount importance for treatment efficacy while minimizing morbidity of surrounding normal zzso Current conventional imaging techniques, such as magnetic resonance imaging zzso and computerized zzso zzso are used to define the three-dimensional shape and volume of the tumor for radiation zzso In many cases, these zzso imaging zzso techniques are ambiguous or provide limited information with regard to tumor margins and zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and single zzso zzso zzso that can characterize tumor zzso are rapidly becoming routine in radiation zzso However, their inherent low spatial resolution zzso tumor zzso for the purposes of radiation treatment zzso This review will focus on applications of zzso to zzso imaging zzso in order to accurately zzso as well as subsequently target, tumor zzso Furthermore, using such zzso for imaging, simultaneous zzso of novel zzso including zzso can be delivered specifically to the tumor to maximize tumor cell killing while sparing normal zzso
