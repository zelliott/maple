Thin viable slices of normal or pathological human zzso were incubated in zzso with zzso zzso Later, zzso sections and zzso sections from the same samples embedded in zzso were examined by an zzso method using a zzso zzso zzso zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso cells proved zzso The zzso of the technique depends on the concentration of zzso in the culture medium (160 zzso the duration of incubation (not less than two zzso the method of DNA zzso zzso or zzso zzso and the dilution of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso application of the zzso method permits a quantitative assessment of the zzso activity of a tissue as well as the direct location of the actively replicating cells in zzso zzso
