zzso lines of Lewis rat zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells were used to study the changes in membrane potential, input resistance and the capability to form zzso junctions upon zzso zzso The drop of zzso in zzso cells was accompanied by the acquisition of temperature zzso The input resistance was simultaneously zzso This was considered to be a consequence of the decrease in zzso current across the cell membrane and of a change in the mechanism of zzso transport which became energy zzso zzso of fluorescent zzso zzso zzso diffusion which was negative in the zzso situation in both cell lines confirmed only the relative independence of these cells in zzso In the zzso situation zzso in contact with normal mouse zzso zzso gave positive results whereas zzso were almost zzso
