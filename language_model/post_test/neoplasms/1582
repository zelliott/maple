The use of a zzso mouse model for cancer is an effective approach for studying the impact of specific zzso and the occurrence of zzso zzso We studied the novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse model because these mice contain a zzso zzso zzso and one functional zzso tumor zzso zzso both of which occur frequently in human zzso Our aim was to characterize the short-term control and chemically induced tumor spectrum in this novel zzso Mice were placed on zzso zzso diet containing zzso soy protein for 2 weeks prior to random allocation to zzso zzso 15 male and 15 female mice were administered corn oil vehicle alone or containing zzso (20 zzso body zzso via oral zzso 2 times per week for 10 weeks with subsequent observation for 18 zzso Mice exhibited zzso characteristic of zzso zzso zzso and zzso mouse zzso However, an array of unique, novel zzso were observed including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting zzso interactions of the 2 zzso Thus, this zzso model may provide further insight into the zzso interaction of 2 genes commonly zzso in zzso
