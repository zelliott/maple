All solid zzso share characteristic traits, including unlimited cellular zzso evasion of immune regulation, and the propensity to zzso The authors have previously described that a zzso structure, the zzso compartment zzso is associated with the zzso zzso in solid tumor cancer zzso The percentage of cancer cells that contain zzso zzso zzso is indicative of the zzso of a tumor both in zzso and in zzso and thus PNC prevalence is a marker that reflects zzso capability in a population of tumor zzso Although the function of the PNC remains to be determined, the PNC is highly enriched with small zzso and zzso binding zzso The initial chemical biology studies using a set of zzso drugs that zzso zzso revealed a direct association of the structure with zzso zzso PNC prevalence reduction as a zzso marker can be used to identify compounds that target cellular processes required for PNC maintenance and hence used to zzso the nature of the PNC zzso Here the authors report the development of an automated zzso screening zzso that is capable of detecting PNC prevalence in prostate cancer cells zzso zzso expressing a green fluorescent protein zzso protein that zzso to the zzso The zzso was zzso using known zzso drugs and zzso zzso zzso After zzso the zzso of the zzso was zzso with a collection of zzso compounds and was shown to be robust and capable of detecting known and novel zzso compounds, making it the first reported zzso zzso screen for small changes in nuclear zzso
