zzso of approximately 30 zzso drugs vary by 50% or more according to zzso rhythms in mice or zzso Despite zzso parameters of zzso drugs vary according to dosing time in zzso cellular rhythms appear as the main mechanisms of their zzso zzso changes in zzso activities involved into zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso rhythms in reduced zzso involved into cellular protection against zzso effects of zzso drugs, platinum complexes and zzso rhythms in cellular proliferation of rapidly renewing zzso such as bone zzso or zzso zzso Furthermore, chemotherapy injection at the least toxic time allows to increase its zzso efficacy against several transplanted zzso tumor zzso zzso of these results for improving therapeutic index of chemotherapy in cancer patients was based upon the hypothesis that rhythms in metabolism or proliferation of healthy zzso were tightly coupled to the zzso zzso cycle, both in zzso and in zzso zzso pumps allowed to test the clinical relevance of zzso principle in patients with cancer zzso Phase I clinical trials with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggested that zzso zzso of chemotherapy delivery rate both improved drug zzso and allowed to increase its safe zzso zzso activity of such zzso regimens, usually involving several drugs, appeared as superior to that achieved by standard protocols in Phase II clinical trials, especially in patients with zzso cell cancer receiving zzso and in patients with zzso cancer treated with zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso (so called zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso trial validated the clinical relevance of the zzso principle in zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared to flat zzso infusion and resulted in 2 to 10 times fewer severe toxic effects and a zzso of its zzso zzso objective response rate being 51% with zzso and zzso with flat zzso zzso zzso zzso These results have warranted to test further the relevance of zzso in patients with breast, lung or pancreatic cancer zzso and to develop basic research on the role of biological rhythms upon cancer zzso
