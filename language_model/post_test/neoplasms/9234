zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor that has been shown to have zzso activity against several types of zzso but the effect of zzso on zzso B cells is zzso We report that zzso can induce the zzso of zzso B cells through zzso zzso zzso triggered the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso zzso of zzso into the zzso disruption of zzso membrane potential, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and subsequent zzso Moreover, we found that zzso exposure activated the zzso of zzso and zzso and suppressed the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso blocked zzso and zzso membrane disruption but did not affect zzso production after zzso zzso These findings provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms driving zzso cell death and suggest that zzso could be a potential therapeutic drug for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso
