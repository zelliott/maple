Natural killer zzso cells and zzso zzso have been implicated in immune surveillance against zzso We demonstrated the critical role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso effect in zzso zzso zzso And, we recently reported that TRAIL is zzso expressed on a substantial proportion of zzso zzso cells in the liver, and which is responsible for spontaneous zzso and the zzso activity against zzso tumor cells along with zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the TRAIL expression on liver zzso cells appeared to be regulated by zzso produced zzso Consisting with this finding, zzso and zzso cell specific zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso effect, and which was zzso by TRAIL expressed on zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso is a type II zzso protein belonging to the zzso family, which zzso zzso zzso cell death in various tumor cells in zzso zzso studies in mice and nonhuman primates have shown that administration of zzso soluble forms of TRAIL could suppress the growth of zzso tumor zzso with no apparent systemic zzso These studies suggested a potential utility of TRAIL as a cancer zzso although TRAIL expression at protein levels and its zzso roles in tumor surveillance has remained zzso Presented findings provide the first evidence for the zzso function of TRAIL as a tumor zzso
