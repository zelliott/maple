zzso knowledge about cell death and cell survival mechanisms and how these pathways are impaired in neurodegenerative disorders and cancer forms the basis for future drug development for these diseases that affect millions of people around the zzso 

In neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease zzso cell death pathways are inappropriately zzso resulting in zzso cell zzso In contrast, cancer cells develop resistance to zzso by regulating zzso proteins signaling via zzso zzso evidence shows that zzso function is central in both cancer and zzso Cancer cells typically shut down zzso zzso zzso in zzso and switch to zzso for zzso production, making them resistant to zzso In zzso for example, zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxygen species impair zzso zzso zzso therefore also switch to zzso to maintain zzso production and to produce molecules involved in zzso metabolism in an attempt to zzso 

One critical difference between cancer cells and zzso is that cancer cells can survive without zzso while zzso are dependent on zzso for long-term zzso 

This review will focus on these abnormalities of zzso function shared in zzso and cancer and discuss the potential mechanisms underlying links that may be key steps in the development of therapeutic zzso
