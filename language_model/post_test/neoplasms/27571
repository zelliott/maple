The study of phenomena occurring in the tumor zzso is a challenging task because of technical difficulties, particularly when dealing with zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso is a new laboratory technology that has been recently introduced to overcome the limitations of other traditional zzso By combining the properties and the advantages of flow zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso allows the investigator to obtain objective information on DNA content, protein expression and cellular zzso is combination with zzso zzso It has been already shown that zzso results are reliable compared to more traditional technologies, and its zzso in the clinical routine is under zzso Its use in zzso which is rapidly zzso spans from zzso analysis to DNA content zzso and tumor cell zzso Here we describe the technology underlying this novel zzso device, review its use in zzso by zzso the phenomena occurring in the tumor zzso and propose its application for the zzso follow-up of zzso zzso undergoing zzso zzso
