This paper presents an assessment of lifetime risks of cancer zzso associated with the drinking water standard for zzso established by the zzso Environmental Protection Agency zzso this standard is an zzso maximum contaminant level zzso of zzso zzso zzso This risk assessment has several defining zzso zzso an accounting of uncertainty in all parameters that relate a given concentration of zzso in drinking water to lifetime risk (except the number of days of consumption of drinking water in a year and the number of years of zzso and an accounting of correlations of uncertain parameters to obtain probability zzso that represent uncertainty in estimated lifetime risks of cancer zzso zzso inclusion of a radiation effectiveness factor zzso to represent an increased biological effectiveness of low-energy electrons zzso in zzso of zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso use of recent estimates of risks of cancer zzso from exposure to zzso zzso including the dependence of risks on an zzso gender and age, in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso inclusion of risks of zzso of skin cancer, principally zzso cell zzso By assuming zzso of zzso in drinking water at the zzso over an average life expectancy of 80 y in females and 75 y in zzso zzso credibility intervals of lifetime risks of cancer zzso obtained in this assessment are zzso zzso zzso zzso in females and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso Mean risks, which are considered to provide the best single measure of expected risks, are about 3 zzso zzso in both zzso In comparison, zzso point estimate of the lifetime risk of cancer zzso assuming a daily consumption of drinking water of 2 L over an average life expectancy of zzso y and excluding an zzso for zzso and zzso of skin cancer, is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of annual equivalent doses to the whole body associated with the drinking water standard for zzso also were zzso Means and zzso zzso of maximum annual doses to females and zzso which occur at age zzso zzso all are less than the annual equivalent dose of 40 zzso used by zzso to establish the zzso
