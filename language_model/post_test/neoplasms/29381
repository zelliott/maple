Combining extant zzso with differing outcome measures, an economical method to generate evidence guiding older adults' cancer care, may introduce zzso leading to invalid study zzso We recently conducted a study combining extant zzso from five zzso zzso clinical trials zzso zzso using zzso scoring to zzso the differing outcome zzso The purpose of this article is to describe and analyze our methods in the recently completed zzso Despite addressing and controlling for zzso our analysis found statistically significant zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso trends among the five parent zzso We concluded that assessing zzso in combined extant zzso with differing outcome measures is important to ensure similar magnitude and direction of findings across parent zzso Future research should include investigating reasons for zzso to generate hypotheses about zzso differences or differing measurement zzso that may have an impact on zzso
