We investigated cancer risk among patients with multiple sclerosis zzso and whether variation by age at zzso diagnosis helps to zzso mechanisms underlying the previously reported reduced cancer zzso We also studied cancer risk among parents to ascertain if zzso zzso genes may zzso protection against cancer in zzso 

Cox zzso hazards regression, adjusted for age, sex, area, and socioeconomic index, estimated cancer risk among zzso patients with zzso and zzso individuals without zzso using Swedish general population register zzso Similar analyses were conducted among zzso fathers and zzso mothers of patients with zzso compared with zzso fathers and zzso mothers of zzso 

With an average of 35 years of zzso there was a decreased overall cancer risk among patients with zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso Increased risks were observed for brain tumors zzso zzso and urinary organ cancer zzso zzso Parents of patients with zzso did not have a notably increased or decreased overall cancer zzso 

The reduction in cancer risk in patients with multiple sclerosis zzso may result from behavioral change, treatment, or we speculate that some zzso characteristics of zzso disease activity improve zzso zzso The lack of association among parents indicates that a simple inherited characteristic is unlikely to explain the reduced cancer risk among patients with zzso zzso is associated with increased risk for some zzso such as of urinary zzso and brain tumors (although surveillance bias may be zzso
