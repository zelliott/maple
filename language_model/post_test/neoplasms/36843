Drug resistance in zzso zzso is arguably the greatest challenge currently facing infectious disease zzso In addressing this problem, researchers have been intrigued by similarities between drug-resistant zzso zzso and zzso zzso For example, it was originally thought that the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins was central in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, recent work has questioned the precise role of zzso proteins in zzso zzso In addition, recent zzso work in identifying zzso associated with zzso drug resistance might have led to identification of yet another parallel between drug-resistant zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso intriguing zzso in zzso zzso zzso discussed here by Paul zzso and James zzso This further underscores an emerging paradigm in zzso zzso
