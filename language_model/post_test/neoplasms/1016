Network and zzso analysis tools are traditionally used to interrogate gene expression data in order to understand the biological processes affected by a particular manipulation or zzso of zzso A zzso understanding of the biological processes affected in particular disease states can allow one to identify candidates not only for pharmaceutical intervention but also for potential zzso and diagnostic markers for the zzso However, network and zzso analyses are currently zzso in the interpretation of large-scale genetic association study zzso While simple zzso overtly zzso diseases are easily understood in the context of a single genetic zzso the vast majority of diseases follow more complex patterns of inheritance and are influenced by a large number of genes and environmental zzso zzso association studies investigating complex diseases that exploit network and zzso analysis tools can shed light on the genetic networks affected by particular genetic variations and sequence zzso just as gene expression studies can reveal genes zzso in a particular disease zzso In this chapter, we describe the steps required to undertake network analysis of large-scale genetic association data - in particular single zzso zzso zzso genetic association data - in terms of data zzso zzso weighting schemes, and zzso analysis zzso We provide two illustrative examples that demonstrate the application of this approach: one involving the analysis of cancer tumor zzso studies and another involving a zzso association study zzso
