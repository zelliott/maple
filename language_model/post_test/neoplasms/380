Human adherent cells from peripheral blood were cultured with zzso zzso zzso wall, or zzso preparation zzso for 3 days, and the zzso activity of the adherent cells on human tumor cells was zzso The cells cultured in the presence of an zzso exhibited increased zzso activity and the number of zzso sheep red blood cells zzso per cell zzso zzso cells cultured without the zzso showed slight zzso activity of 8 approximately zzso zzso cells, derived from Hodgkin's disease, and zzso and zzso cells derived from zzso cervical cancer were more susceptible than zzso cells to the adherent cells activated by zzso or zzso cell zzso zzso between population doubling time and zzso to the zzso effect zzso by the activated adherent cells was not zzso The zzso from the activated adherent cells was also effective in zzso DNA synthesis of the rapidly zzso target cells, zzso cells and zzso zzso However, the proliferation of the other two cell lines was zzso The effect of activated adherent cells on tumor cell proliferation and its relation to zzso were examined and zzso
