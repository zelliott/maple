To evaluate the feasibility of risk zzso of children with cancer and zzso zzso using a simple set of criteria from data available to the zzso at the time of the patient's zzso 

This study is a retrospective cohort study of all children with cancer admitted to a single institution with fever and zzso zzso as an absolute zzso count zzso 500 zzso in a zzso zzso Patients were defined a zzso as low risk if they were zzso at the time of presentation with zzso zzso had an anticipated duration of zzso less than 7 days, and had no significant zzso All others were considered high zzso Data was analyzed by first admission for each patient and zzso for all admissions for zzso zzso 

There were 188 admissions in 104 patients for zzso zzso during the study zzso Of these zzso were high risk and zzso were low zzso The duration of fever was not significantly different in the two zzso However, the duration of zzso and the length of hospital stay were significantly longer in the high-risk zzso The frequency of zzso other documented infection, and serious medical complications was significantly different in the two zzso Overall, the rate of any adverse event was zzso in the low-risk group versus zzso in the high-risk zzso 

zzso criteria available to the zzso at the time of evaluation of the child with cancer who has fever and zzso allow the selection of a population at low risk for zzso or serious medical zzso A prospective study is planned using these risk criteria, evaluating zzso oral zzso therapy in low-risk children with zzso
