A common thread interwoven throughout the literature of cancer biology is a wide-ranging zzso of gene regulation, zzso by zzso of protein zzso This phenomenon encompasses virtually every means of identification of zzso including zzso hormones, growth factors, membrane zzso and zzso Studies by the author and others of the activities of zzso existing in multiple forms zzso zzso in a series of rat zzso ranging widely in growth rate, degree of zzso and other zzso properties has extended this concept and added to it a dimension of functional zzso zzso that are in high activity in adult liver and that are geared zzso to catalyze specific zzso functions are lost in varying degrees and generally depend on the growth rate and degree of zzso In fast growing, poorly differentiated zzso these are replaced by high activities of zzso that are normally low or absent in adult zzso In many instances, the zzso that are expressed in poorly differentiated zzso are present also in fetal liver, thus pointing to zzso of genes that were active in the fetus but were zzso during normal embryonic zzso The loss of zzso that are under rigid host zzso control, as well as other proteins that maintain the differentiated state, and the zzso of genes coding for fetal or zzso proteins are probably crucial factors in the initiation and maintenance of cellular zzso
