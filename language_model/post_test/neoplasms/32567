Most of the zzso zzso in the tumor zzso zzso map to its zzso core zzso Many of them zzso zzso by decreasing its zzso zzso We have previously designed the zzso quadruple zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which specifically restore activity and stability in several zzso zzso Here we present the zzso structure of this quadruple zzso at zzso A resolution, which was solved in a new crystal form in the absence of zzso This structure reveals that the four point zzso cause only small local structural changes, whereas the overall structure of the central zzso and the zzso surface is zzso The zzso zzso zzso results in an altered hydrogen bond pattern connecting strands zzso and zzso thus bridging the two sheets of the zzso scaffold in an energetically more favorable zzso The second zzso zzso zzso which is located in close proximity to the zzso surface in loop zzso seems to reduce the plasticity of the structure in large parts of loop zzso as indicated by decreased zzso temperature zzso The same is observed for zzso in the vicinity of the zzso zzso This increase in rigidity provides the structural basis for the increase in zzso and an understanding how zzso and zzso rescue some of the common cancer zzso
