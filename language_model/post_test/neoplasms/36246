Body cavity fluid examination sometimes presents a diagnostic challenge in zzso zzso This study was undertaken to evaluate efficacy of zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso and DNA flow zzso zzso in detection of zzso cells in zzso One hundred zzso (55 zzso 44 zzso and 1 zzso zzso were studied by zzso zzso and zzso There were 29 zzso and 71 benign zzso On zzso 28 of 29 zzso cases were zzso With no false zzso the sensitivity and specificity was zzso and zzso zzso zzso detected zzso in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso benign zzso zzso was positive in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso benign zzso zzso had lower sensitivity than zzso zzso versus zzso zzso and specificity of zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso had lower sensitivity than zzso zzso versus zzso zzso increased to zzso zzso zzso zzso when the combinations of zzso plus zzso or zzso plus zzso were applied compared to zzso alone zzso Also, the combination of zzso plus zzso had higher sensitivity than zzso alone zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso and combined zzso plus zzso had higher sensitivity than zzso alone zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso The study demonstrates the usefulness of zzso and DNA zzso as zzso to zzso to diagnose zzso in zzso zzso in combination with zzso can be further developed to reduce number of zzso cases on zzso and add objectivity to zzso doubtful or zzso zzso
