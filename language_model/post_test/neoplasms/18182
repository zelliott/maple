The present review represents an overview of the potential opportunistic use of computerized zzso zzso to enhance our understanding of abnormal body zzso specifically lean and zzso tissue changes in cancer zzso 

One of the characteristics of cancer zzso is the depletion of muscle with or without zzso tissue zzso zzso a body composition tool that specifically zzso between these zzso is essential in assessing this zzso Cancer patients are routinely evaluated by high resolution imaging such as CT for the purpose of diagnosis and zzso Recent work exploiting CT images for body composition analysis has revealed the natural history of cancer zzso including progressive zzso in skeletal muscle, zzso zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso of skeletal muscle has permitted identification of individuals with zzso and links between zzso and functional status, chemotherapy zzso time to tumor zzso and zzso 

CT images routinely acquired from health records of cancer patients can be used to zzso specific lean and zzso zzso to interpret body composition in zzso studies, and to evaluate individual patients in a clinical and therapeutic decision-making zzso
