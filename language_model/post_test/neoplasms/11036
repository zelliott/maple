zzso cages have the potential to serve as zzso for the targeted therapeutic and imaging zzso As an effort to exploit small heat shock protein zzso cages as zzso zzso we demonstrate that chemically and genetically modified zzso cages zzso the cells via cancer cell binding and subsequent zzso zzso and can image zzso activity in the live zzso Moreover, we report here that these functional zzso cages can be specifically accumulated to tumor zzso of zzso mice when administered zzso through the lateral tail zzso These zzso properties could be explained by the prolonged in zzso circulation and enhanced zzso and retention zzso effect as well as the zzso binding to cancer zzso Furthermore, when combined with the zzso sensing ability, our zzso cage allows us to monitor the therapeutic evaluation after zzso drug treatment by imaging the zzso activity within zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso cages have zzso scaffolds amenable to genetic and chemical modifications without loss of the zzso architecture and can be exploited as biomedical materials including drug or imaging agent zzso
