We have performed a series of investigations involving zzso zzso beta chain zzso zzso gene zzso in benign and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These studies provide the conceptual basis and the operational approach for the use of T beta gene zzso as markers of zzso zzso zzso and zzso analogous to zzso gene zzso in B zzso Southern zzso zzso analysis for T beta gene zzso can now be zzso to identify and distinguish between zzso cells, zzso T cells, and zzso T zzso zzso of T beta gene zzso will play an important role in the further investigation and zzso of zzso zzso However, the identification of a genetic marker of zzso for T cells has significant diagnostic and zzso value as zzso For example, determination of the T beta gene zzso unique to a particular zzso zzso clone provides a specific genetic marker for that zzso zzso zzso This genetic marker of the zzso clone may provide a useful tool for monitoring the patient's therapeutic response and clinical course for early signs of zzso Nonetheless, our studies demonstrate that the lineage specificity of zzso and T beta gene zzso is not zzso It appears that only a zzso approach combining extensive zzso zzso zzso analysis, in zzso testing for functional help and suppression, and Southern zzso zzso analysis for zzso and T beta gene zzso allows the conclusive and unequivocal demonstration of the zzso or zzso derivation of all zzso zzso zzso zzso that cannot be assigned to the zzso or zzso lineage following this extensive zzso analysis are zzso zzso
