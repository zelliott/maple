The complex integrity of the cells and its sudden, but often predictable changes can be described and understood by the zzso and dynamism of cellular zzso All these networks undergo both local and global zzso during stress and development of zzso Here, we illustrate this by showing the zzso structural zzso of the zzso zzso interaction network zzso In an zzso state, the zzso zzso is highly zzso and the centrally organized zzso have a large zzso During stress, several original zzso became more zzso and a number of novel zzso also zzso A few basic functions such as zzso preserve their central zzso however, several functions with high energy demand, such the zzso regulation loose their original zzso during zzso A number of key zzso protein complexes, such as the zzso zzso zzso gain zzso in the stressed zzso zzso zzso zzso heat zzso or stress proteins became established as key elements in our molecular understanding of the cellular stress zzso zzso form complex interaction networks (the zzso with each other and their zzso Here, we show that the human zzso recovers the segregation of protein zzso and stress-related zzso observed in zzso zzso zzso of zzso and human zzso shows that zzso 1) are zzso zzso of zzso interaction networks, which 2) often bridge hubs and 3) are favorite candidates for extensive zzso Moreover, zzso 4) become more central in the organization of the isolated zzso of the stressed zzso zzso interaction network, which highlights their importance in the decoupling and zzso of network zzso during and after zzso zzso zzso of cellular networks may play a key role in cellular adaptation during stress and various zzso and chronic diseases, such as cancer, diabetes or zzso
