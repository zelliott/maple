zzso is an oral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine the recommended phase 2 dose, zzso zzso effects, and preliminary zzso activity of zzso in a pediatric zzso 

Patients who were 2 to 21 years of age with zzso solid tumors were eligible if they had measurable or zzso disease and met baseline organ function zzso Patients received zzso once daily for 28 days followed by a zzso break between each zzso zzso levels of 15 and 20 zzso were zzso with dose escalation based on a 3 + 3 zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were also evaluated during the first zzso 

zzso patients were treated zzso age zzso years; range, zzso zzso The most common zzso were zzso zzso elevated liver zzso gastrointestinal symptoms, and zzso Two patients developed zzso reductions in cardiac ejection fraction prompting a protocol amendment to exclude patients with previous exposure to zzso or cardiac zzso In patients without these cardiac risk factors, the maximum tolerated dose zzso was 15 zzso zzso plasma zzso were reached by day zzso No objective responses were zzso Four patients with zzso and zzso had stable disease for 2 to 9 zzso 

zzso toxicity precluded determination of a recommended dose for pediatric patients with previous zzso or cardiac radiation zzso The zzso of zzso for patients without risk factors for cardiac toxicity is 15 zzso for 28 days followed by a zzso zzso
