The adoption of zzso techniques in biological and medical research provides a new way for cancer diagnosis and zzso In order to perform successful diagnosis and treatment of cancer, discovering and zzso cancer types correctly is zzso Class discovery is one of the most important tasks in cancer zzso using zzso zzso Most of the existing works adopt single zzso zzso to perform class discovery from zzso zzso However, single zzso zzso have limitations, which include a lack of zzso stability, and zzso In this paper, we propose a new cluster ensemble approach called knowledge based cluster ensemble zzso which incorporates the prior knowledge of the data sets into the cluster ensemble zzso Specifically, zzso represents the prior knowledge of a data set in the form of zzso zzso Then, the spectral zzso zzso zzso is adopted to generate a set of zzso zzso Next, zzso zzso zzso constraints into confidence factors for these zzso zzso After that, a consensus zzso is constructed by considering all the zzso solutions and their corresponding confidence zzso The final zzso result is obtained by zzso the consensus zzso zzso with single zzso zzso and conventional cluster ensemble approaches, knowledge based cluster ensemble approaches are more zzso stable and zzso The experiments on cancer data sets show that: 1) zzso works well on these data zzso 2) zzso not only zzso most of the state-of-the-art single zzso zzso but also zzso most of the state-of-the-art cluster ensemble zzso
