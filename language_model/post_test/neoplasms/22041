Biological effects of substance P zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso that exists as a full-length and as a zzso truncated zzso in zzso Although zzso zzso zzso and binding sites have been detected in certain zzso little is known about the cellular and zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein in human zzso zzso We developed and characterized a novel zzso zzso to the zzso region of the human full-length zzso zzso zzso of the zzso was demonstrated by zzso detection of a broad band zzso at molecular mass zzso Da in Western blots of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso after SP exposure; and zzso abolition of tissue zzso by zzso of the zzso with its zzso zzso Distribution of zzso receptors was investigated in 72 zzso zzso human tumors showing that zzso receptors were frequently expressed in zzso and breast and pancreatic zzso zzso zzso receptors were clearly confined to the plasma membrane and zzso present on nearly all tumor zzso Development of this novel zzso zzso zzso allows the efficient zzso of zzso zzso protein in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with this simple and rapid zzso method will facilitate identification of tumors with a sufficient zzso zzso for diagnostic or therapeutic intervention using SP zzso
