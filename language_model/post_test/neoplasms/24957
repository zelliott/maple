zzso control is one of primary regulation mechanisms of gene zzso zzso zzso control mainly occurs at the initiation step, the zzso step, which involves more than ten translation initiation factors zzso zzso initiation zzso zzso the level or function of these zzso results in abnormal translation of specific zzso and consequently abnormal growth of cells that leads to human diseases, including zzso zzso evidence from recent studies showed that the expression of many zzso was associated with zzso zzso cancer zzso as well as gene expression zzso In the present paper, we perform a critical review of recent advances in understanding the role and mechanism of zzso action in zzso control and cancer as well as the possibility of targeting zzso for therapeutic zzso
