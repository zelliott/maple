zzso for the Mexican-American city of zzso Texas, have been assembled by computer from individual civil and church records of birth, marriage, and zzso Documentation is available on vital events in the lives of over 300,000 individuals, about zzso of the city population from zzso These data were collected to determine the degree to which death from cancer is more clustered in families than would be expected by chance alone; methods specific to this data base have been developed to accomplish this zzso A statistically significant excess of familial cancer was observed overall when all cancer sites were zzso but no evidence was observed for excess familial risk at single sites except for breast cancer and perhaps for zzso zzso The excess of breast cancer risk is comparable to that observed in other zzso A few zzso manifest excess familial risk, most notably those involving and dominated by breast cancer and certain zzso system zzso We do not confirm the degree of familiarity observed elsewhere for zzso of the zzso zzso stomach, or other sites in this generally low-risk zzso Even where we find evidence of excess risk, the degree of excess is small and the number of multiply affected families too small to test zzso models by segregation zzso The absence of excess familial risk does not appear to be due to inadequate numbers of cases, since breast cancer is familial with no more zzso in zzso than other zzso These results differ to some extent from those found in a similar study of Utah zzso but it is unclear whether this is because of differences in risk patterns or statistical properties of the zzso methods used in the two zzso
