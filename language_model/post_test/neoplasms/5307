The protein zzso by the human gene zzso zzso expressed in zzso contains zzso zzso acids and a long series of zzso zzso repeats at its zzso zzso zzso protein is expressed most abundantly in the S and M zzso of rapidly dividing cells but not in terminal differentiated zzso It zzso to the zzso of zzso cells, and a portion distributes to zzso during M zzso zzso of zzso by zzso of specific zzso zzso into cells during zzso severely zzso the subsequent zzso zzso sister zzso alignment and zzso as well as the formation of zzso cells with zzso fragmented zzso are common features zzso These results suggest that the zzso protein may play an important role in zzso segregation during M zzso
