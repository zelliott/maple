zzso zzso zzso represent promising agents for targeted cancer zzso To allow rational selection of human zzso with favorable characteristics for zzso development a screening tool was designed obviating the need of preparing individual zzso linked zzso zzso zzso was designed as a fusion protein consisting of a human zzso light chain binding zzso zzso and a truncated version of zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically bound to human zzso light chains of human or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically inhibited proliferation of zzso cell lines at low toxin and zzso zzso zzso zzso that efficiently delivered zzso in the novel zzso system were used to generate zzso zzso linked zzso These molecules efficiently triggered zzso of target cells, indicating that zzso identified in our zzso system can be converted to functional zzso Finally, a panel of human zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso was zzso favorable characteristics with zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso with potential for zzso zzso zzso zzso development can be identified using the novel zzso zzso
