zzso cells initiate cell cycle arrest at different zzso of the cell cycle in response to various forms of zzso stress to allow time for DNA repair, and thus preserving their zzso zzso The protein zzso checkpoint zzso 1 zzso checkpoint zzso 2 zzso and zzso protein zzso protein zzso 2 zzso have all been shown to be involved in cell cycle checkpoint zzso Recently, cell cycle checkpoint zzso has been proposed as one way to sensitize cancer cells to zzso agents due to the expected induction of zzso zzso Due to their overlapping zzso zzso and redundant functions, it is still not clear which zzso is mainly responsible for the cell cycle arrests zzso by clinically relevant zzso Thus, the issue remains about which zzso is the most zzso relevant target and, more importantly, whether multiple zzso might need to be targeted to achieve the best efficacy in light of recent studies showing superior efficacy for zzso zzso zzso zzso To clarify this issue, we investigated the roles of the three zzso in response to different zzso stresses through small interfering zzso specific target zzso Our result showed that only the zzso of zzso but not of zzso or zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso arrest or zzso zzso zzso This was followed by zzso catastrophe and zzso Moreover, double zzso of zzso and zzso failed to achieve better efficacy than zzso zzso alone; surprisingly, zzso of zzso in addition to zzso suppression, partially reversed the checkpoint zzso and negated zzso zzso We further showed that this is due to the fact that in zzso cells, zzso zzso which is critically required for the zzso progression following checkpoint zzso becomes greatly zzso In zzso our findings show that zzso is the only relevant checkpoint zzso as a cancer drug target and zzso of other checkpoint zzso in addition to zzso would be zzso
