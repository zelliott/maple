The problem of comparing human cancer, a disease of long evolution, with experimental models in short life span animals is zzso It is suggested that zzso tumors are more common in long life span animals because of the requirement of long periods of time for tumor zzso Increased zzso may result from the ability of tumor cells to change, coupled with the long exposure of the zzso cells to the selective forces of the zzso and the zzso It is proposed that the dynamic nature of tumors and the time required for changes to be zzso should be taken into account in the study of the changing biological behavior of tumor cells and their changing responses to zzso The use of zzso tumors which increase in zzso during successive zzso artificially zzso the existence of the zzso cells in zzso zzso permitting thereby tumor zzso zzso zzso occurs during a period which is accessible to the zzso This dynamic process should be of primary interest to cancer researchers and zzso
