zzso replicating zzso zzso which selectively replicate in tumor cells but not in normal cells, show great promise as zzso agents for cancer zzso The principal zzso activity of these viruses derives from their replication within tumor cells, which results in cell destruction and the production of progeny zzso that can spread to adjacent tumor zzso However, one potential limitation of this approach is that viral gene deletions zzso tumor selectivity also result frequently in reduced potency of the virus in zzso zzso strategies designed to enhance the potency of current zzso viruses will likely increase their chance of clinical zzso Here we report the construction of an zzso zzso zzso virus zzso of which the infection also causes strong cell membrane fusion zzso zzso In zzso characterization on a variety of human tumor cells of different tissue origins showed that the plaques from this virus zzso are zzso unique and are significantly larger than those from the parental zzso virus, a zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso formation caused by this virus depended on zzso zzso indicating that cell membrane fusion will only occur in dividing cells (such as tumor zzso where the virus can undergo a full infection cycle but not in normal cells where the viral replication is zzso zzso administration of zzso into mice with established lung zzso breast cancer resulted in a dramatic therapeutic zzso These studies demonstrate that incorporation of zzso function into an zzso virus can significantly increase the potency of viral zzso this may lead to an enhanced clinical performance, especially in late-stage cancer zzso
