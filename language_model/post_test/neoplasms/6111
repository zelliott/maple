The zzso factor zzso proteins are zzso zzso regulators with an expanding tumor zzso zzso zzso is one of the prominent members of the family because of its diminished expression in zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we show that zzso zzso of zzso occurs in cancer cells through direct zzso repression zzso by the zzso group protein zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso of zzso is also associated with a gain of zzso zzso 27 zzso zzso and a depletion of zzso zzso 2 of zzso zzso Upon depletion of zzso by zzso zzso short hairpin zzso or use of the small zzso zzso A, the expression of zzso was zzso The zzso of zzso in cells with zzso zzso showed a significant zzso effect, both in culture and in zzso nude zzso In this last setting, zzso zzso was also associated with decreased dissemination and lower mortality zzso In zzso cells, which characteristically have lower zzso the induction of zzso depletion zzso partially the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso repression has an important role in zzso zzso Most importantly, the translation of the described results to human primary samples demonstrated that patients with prostate or breast tumors with low levels of zzso and high expression of zzso had a shorter overall zzso
