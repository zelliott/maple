zzso is commonly prescribed to treat type 2 diabetes, and has additional potential as a cancer zzso and zzso zzso activates zzso that in turn can launch a zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions between zzso and radiation are poorly zzso Since zzso signaling also involves zzso and zzso we investigated their importance in zzso responses to zzso and zzso 

zzso cells, zzso cells zzso or knockout for zzso or zzso zzso or double knockout for zzso and zzso were zzso in the presence or absence of zzso The impact of zzso on oxygen consumption and proliferation rates was determined, as well as zzso radiation zzso 

zzso resulted in moderate radiation protection in all cell lines, irrespective of zzso and zzso Loss of zzso zzso cells to the zzso effects of zzso while loss of zzso promoted both the growth zzso and toxic effects of zzso zzso overall cell death after radiation was similar with and without zzso irrespective of zzso or zzso zzso 

The zzso activity of zzso may zzso benefit in combination with zzso and this benefit is intensified upon loss of zzso or zzso zzso
