The complement system and zzso receptors zzso are key innate defense systems which might interact zzso on zzso cells zzso to reinforce zzso zzso In a previous work, we found that the extra domain A from zzso zzso (an zzso zzso for zzso can zzso zzso delivery to DC and induce their zzso Given the potential of zzso to cause inflammation and zzso of zzso cells, we hypothesized that a fusion protein between zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso together with an zzso might improve the zzso of the zzso Naked DNA zzso with a construct expressing the fusion protein between zzso zzso and the zzso T cell zzso zzso from zzso induced strong zzso specific T cell zzso The zzso zzso fusion protein zzso induced zzso of zzso cells, the production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso presenting cell migration and zzso cell zzso As compared to zzso the fusion protein zzso did not induce the production of the zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso by zzso Moreover, zzso induced strong specific T cell responses in zzso and protected mice against zzso tumor growth more efficiently than zzso or zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that fusion proteins containing zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso may serve as a suitable strategy for the development of zzso or zzso zzso
