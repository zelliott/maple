The zzso fusion zzso resulting from a zzso zzso plays a key role in the zzso of Ewing zzso Previously, we have shown that zzso zzso designed against zzso inhibited tumor growth in nude mice provided they were delivered zzso by zzso or by zzso zzso In this study, we have used two types of zzso zzso as type 1 and type 2 zzso stabilized with zzso for both zzso and systemic administration of zzso zzso of the tumor growth in zzso was found to be dependent on the carrier type as well as on zzso zzso zzso Indeed, whereas both types of zzso were efficient in reducing tumor growth after zzso injection, we have obtained only with type 2 zzso an zzso effect after intravenous injection in a preliminary zzso Additionally, the zzso efficacy of a localized modification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso In cell culture the zzso inhibit cell growth by their zzso zzso Further investigations are needed in zzso to learn the mechanism of action of the zzso
