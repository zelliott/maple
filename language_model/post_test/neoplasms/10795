The aim of this study was to zzso an automated and customized severity of illness score as a means of predicting death among adult cancer patients admitted to the intensive care unit zzso 

We conducted a retrospective study of zzso zzso between January 1, 2001, and December 31, 2005, in a university comprehensive cancer zzso We randomly selected training and validation samples in 2 zzso groups zzso and surgical zzso We used zzso zzso to calculate the probabilities of death in the zzso and zzso death in training samples and applied these probabilities to the validation samples to calculate sensitivity and zzso construct curves, and determined the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso 

We included zzso zzso In predicting zzso zzso the zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso for the medical validation group and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the surgical validation zzso For zzso zzso the zzso for the groups of medical and surgical patients were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The modified zzso zzso Failure Assessment score is a good and valid predictor of cancer patients' risk of dying in the zzso and/or hospital despite the modifications needed to automate the score using existing electronic zzso
