This Phase I study was performed to assess the feasibility of administering zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso as a continuous zzso infusion for 7 days every 3 weeks and to determine the recommended dose for subsequent zzso zzso This study also sought to characterize the pharmacological behavior of zzso and to determine whether the desired biological effect, zzso of protein zzso could be detected and assessed during zzso Patients with advanced solid zzso were treated with zzso as a continuous zzso infusion for 7 days every 3 weeks at doses ranging from 35 to 1120 zzso On the basis of zzso studies, toxicity assessments included cardiac zzso zzso and zzso in addition to more routine safety monitoring laboratory zzso Plasma sampling was performed to characterize the zzso of zzso and peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were sampled to detect and monitor the zzso effects of zzso on the zzso of zzso a zzso protein that zzso zzso Twenty-five patients received 51 complete courses of zzso An unacceptably high zzso of zzso zzso consisting of grade 4 zzso significant zzso of the zzso zzso and profound fatigue, was observed at the 1120 zzso dose zzso At the next lower zzso dose level, zzso zzso seven new patients had no unacceptable zzso Instead, zzso was mild to moderate and zzso zzso was zzso zzso were zzso and zzso plasma zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso exceeded zzso values zzso zzso zzso required for growth zzso and zzso in zzso zzso The systemic clearance of zzso averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso and the terminal zzso of elimination was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso for the duration of the drug infusion in a zzso manner, but seemed to plateau above zzso zzso At the zzso zzso dose level, the mean percentage of zzso protein in its zzso form increased from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) and declined to zzso zzso zzso one week after drug zzso zzso zzso zzso administered as a continuous zzso zzso infusion for 7 days every 21 days is well tolerated at doses of zzso zzso and results in biologically relevant zzso and consistent zzso of zzso zzso in zzso Although the relationship between drug-related zzso of zzso zzso in zzso and both zzso of relevant proteins and growth zzso in tumor cells is unknown, serial analyses of zzso zzso provide a zzso marker of protein zzso that may be useful in zzso the development of drugs targeting zzso
