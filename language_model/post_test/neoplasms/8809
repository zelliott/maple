zzso zzso zzso are exposed to multiple zzso cues in tumors, which collaborate to zzso these cells with zzso zzso zzso caused by an imbalance in oxygen supply and demand because of a poorly organized zzso is often a prominent feature in solid zzso However, to what extent tumor zzso regulates the zzso zzso in zzso is zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso in mouse lung zzso tumors encompasses two zzso distinct zzso zzso subsets, designated as zzso and zzso zzso both of which were derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso express higher levels of zzso zzso markers and reside in more hypoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso contain higher zzso levels for zzso genes than their zzso zzso To assess the in zzso role of zzso on these zzso features, cancer cells were zzso in zzso zzso domain 2 zzso mice, resulting in zzso zzso Interestingly, reduced tumor zzso did not alter the relative abundance of zzso zzso nor their zzso marker zzso but specifically lowered zzso gene expression and zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso The same observation in zzso zzso zzso bone zzso zzso also suggests organization of a zzso zzso Together, our results show that zzso is not a major driver of zzso subset zzso but rather specifically zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso
