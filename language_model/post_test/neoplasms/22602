Drug resistance is one of the major obstacles limiting the activity of zzso zzso zzso of DNA repair mechanism often accounts for increase resistance to cancer zzso 

We present evidence that zzso a zzso zzso currently in clinical zzso acts through a mechanism of action different from classical zzso requiring an intact zzso zzso repair zzso system to exert its zzso zzso made resistant to zzso show increased sensitivity to zzso zzso We have zzso the mechanism of resistance and discovered a previously unknown mechanism resulting from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Restoration of zzso activity through zzso gene transfer or treatment with zzso agents restored sensitivity to zzso Furthermore, we found that a significant proportion of zzso tumors present zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso of a zzso zzso as described here, is a completely new mechanism of drug resistance and this is the first evidence that zzso gene expression can be influenced by an zzso zzso The reported zzso of zzso gene could be an important zzso of the response to platinum based zzso In addition, the mechanism of resistance reported opens up the possibility of reverting the resistant zzso using combinations with zzso agents, molecules already employed in the clinical zzso
