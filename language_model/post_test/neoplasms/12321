The availability of zzso models with precisely defined genetic zzso has greatly increased our understanding of the genetic control of cell death, with functional dependence established for a wide range of genes including zzso others) the zzso and zzso gene family members, the mismatch repair zzso genes and the zzso binding domain family member zzso These studies raised the attractive hypotheses that zzso predisposition may be explained in terms of failed cell death, and also that zzso zzso may be initiated through zzso of an zzso zzso The studies that have addressed these notions have revealed complex consequences of a failed death zzso such that these simple hypotheses have not always been zzso zzso however, some zzso show more predictable responses than others, most apparent in the contrast between the zzso and the zzso zzso This review will focus upon a discussion of these zzso and will also consider the relevance of some of these findings to zzso predisposition and zzso
