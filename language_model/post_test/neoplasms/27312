Cancer in patients with zzso zzso zzso the most common genetic disorder in zzso has been a rare zzso However, more patients now reach adulthood, and more patients undergo organ zzso associated with an increased cancer zzso Our aim was to assess the risk of cancer in zzso and transplanted zzso zzso 

We followed 28 zzso patients whose data were reported to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation patient registry from 1990 through 1999 and compared the number of zzso observed in transplanted and zzso patients to the number expected from zzso cancer zzso zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

In 202 999 zzso of observation of zzso zzso patients, 75 zzso were observed, but zzso were expected zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso tract tumors were observed, but zzso were expected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso More zzso than expected were observed of the small zzso zzso and zzso tract but not of the stomach or zzso We found that the deficit of zzso tract tumors was not statistically significant zzso observed versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso In zzso zzso of observation of zzso transplanted patients, 13 zzso were observed, but zzso were expected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and more zzso tract tumors (four observed versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso observed versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were observed than zzso 

We observed an increased risk of zzso tract zzso among adult zzso patients, particularly of the small zzso zzso and zzso zzso This increased risk appeared to be more pronounced in patients who had had an organ zzso
