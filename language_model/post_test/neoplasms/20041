Low zzso rates in clinical trials present a barrier to the development of novel cancer zzso Currently, only zzso of patients with cancer participate, and many studies fail to achieve necessary zzso The objective of this study was to evaluate whether a screening intervention to identify potentially eligible patients zzso would increase zzso zzso 

Over a zzso intervention period, zzso for 21 phase zzso breast, zzso zzso zzso and lung cancer trials were identified by a screening zzso This individual reviewed the electronic medical records of patients attending zzso clinics and flagged zzso for 10 medical zzso at the BC Cancer zzso Patients who were already documented to be trial eligible by physicians were not zzso zzso were surveyed regarding the zzso and accuracy of the zzso 

During the intervention period, 73 patients were zzso compared with 61 patients enrolled in the 4 months prior and 51 patients in the 4 months zzso A total of zzso charts were zzso and 120 zzso were identified during the intervention period, resulting in 19 zzso who enrolled and four zzso who declined a clinical zzso Relative zzso rates adjusted for zzso appointments were zzso zzso zzso zzso before and zzso zzso zzso zzso after, relative to the intervention zzso zzso surveys indicated that zzso of flags were zzso and zzso were zzso 

In this study, manually screening patient records increased zzso to specific clinical zzso A screening intervention process, involving a dedicated screening coordinator, should be considered to improve clinical trial zzso
