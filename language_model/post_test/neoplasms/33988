zzso evidence has identified a mechanism potentially responsible for the zzso of tumor zzso zzso namely zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso A previous study has shown the loss of zzso zzso due to zzso zzso of its zzso island, in gastric cancer cell lines, suggesting that zzso is a target for zzso gene zzso in gastric zzso However, there are limited data on the zzso status of zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso in various types of human zzso including gastric zzso Here, we report that zzso of gastric cancer cell lines and zzso of primary gastric zzso zzso were zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso colon zzso zzso zzso and zzso cervical zzso zzso zzso showing that zzso zzso is not restricted to gastric zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso was especially frequent in tumors from zzso of a zzso zzso that is, the stomach, liver, zzso and zzso Next, the zzso status of zzso in various zzso zzso was zzso including the zzso zzso of gastric zzso The zzso zzso was found in zzso of chronic zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of gastric zzso zzso and zzso of gastric zzso zzso but not in chronic zzso B, normal prostate and colon zzso even though in cases of chronic zzso the zzso frequency of its zzso zzso was very zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso is frequently found in human zzso including gastric cancer, and is mostly cancer specific, with the exception of the stomach, and thus, might be useful as a potential diagnostic zzso of zzso
