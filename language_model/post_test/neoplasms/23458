zzso evaluation of kidney function is essential to determine chemotherapy dosing based on established treatment protocols in children undergoing zzso stem cell zzso zzso C has been widely studied as a marker of the zzso zzso rate zzso although data regarding its use in stem cell transplantation are zzso We evaluated the performance of zzso zzso equations and determined their sensitivity to detect a nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso in children undergoing zzso zzso We performed a retrospective cohort analysis in 16 children undergoing 26 zzso using a modified zzso analysis to account for repeated zzso zzso zzso equations published by zzso Le zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Schwartz (the New zzso zzso Disease in Children formula, New zzso zzso were evaluated and compared to the zzso modified Schwartz zzso We found that zzso zzso equations demonstrated improved sensitivity to detect a nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso compared to the zzso modified Schwartz zzso which significantly overestimated zzso Most zzso zzso zzso however, tended to underestimate the nuclear zzso The New zzso formula, combining zzso C and zzso offered a sensitivity of zzso and a specificity of zzso for detecting a nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso should be aware of the specific prediction formula and zzso measurement techniques available at their center, as each zzso performance can vary zzso As more research becomes available, this easily measured marker should become a valuable component of zzso zzso providing cost savings (a nuclear zzso is zzso times more costly than a zzso zzso and reducing radiation zzso
