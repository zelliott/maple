A novel zzso zzso with a molecular mass of 23 zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso led to the conclusion that zzso is a zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso did not affect the proliferation of zzso cells in zzso it significantly inhibited tumor growth in zzso mice zzso with zzso cancer zzso Moreover, zzso significantly induced the proliferation of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso were increased significantly in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso the percentage of zzso cells in both zzso zzso and zzso T cells and tumor zzso zzso and zzso T cells and enhanced the zzso activity of zzso cells and zzso These results indicate that zzso is a novel effective zzso that has zzso activity associated with induced zzso zzso
