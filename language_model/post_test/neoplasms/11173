Cancer stem cells are presently viewed as carriers of the growth initiating potential, zzso capability and drug resistance in zzso However, many of these fundamental properties of cancer are zzso modified by zzso interactions and/or dependent on zzso Indeed, it is well established that zzso of cancer cells with their zzso zzso zzso counterparts, or with zzso can significantly increase their tumor forming capacity zzso the attribute presently associated with cancer cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso factors zzso zzso can promote such capacity in certain cell zzso Moreover, injection site zzso zzso zzso zzso may significantly zzso tumor take in experimental zzso These observations cannot be zzso with the paradigm that tumor initiation potential is a zzso zzso and cell autonomous feature of a subset of cancer cells expressing stem cell markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso Instead, it is proposed here that zzso in cancer (perhaps unlike in normal self renewing zzso rather then being assigned to a particular readily identifiable cell zzso could be a property of interactive clusters of cancer cells (perhaps including, but not limited to cells with stem cell zzso Such zzso zzso would become equipped with properties zzso perceived as zzso zzso the capacity to initiate tumor growth, when they express the capacity to induce zzso It is also zzso here that, while the pursuit of zzso of cancer cells zzso stem cell markers has been fascinating and revealing, due to aforementioned limitations of the present stem cell concept and presumed zzso zzso zzso of such cells, further therapeutic promise may reside in a better definition of zzso zzso cancer stem zzso
