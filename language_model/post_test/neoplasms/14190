Feature selection is a key problem in tumor zzso and related zzso This paper presents a tumor zzso approach with neighborhood rough zzso feature zzso First, some uncertainty measures such as neighborhood zzso conditional neighborhood zzso neighborhood mutual information and neighborhood conditional mutual information, are introduced to evaluate the relevance between genes and related decision in neighborhood rough zzso Then some important properties and zzso of these measures are investigated, and the relationships among these measures are established as zzso By using improved zzso combined with sequential forward greedy search strategy, a novel feature selection zzso with low time complexity is zzso Finally, several cancer zzso tasks are demonstrated using the proposed zzso Experimental results show that the proposed zzso is efficient and zzso
