A comparative treatment planning study has been undertaken between standard zzso delivery zzso intensity modulated zzso methods and spot scanned zzso in order to investigate the merits and limitations of each of these treatment zzso 

Plans for each zzso were performed using CT scans and planning information for nine patients with varying indications and zzso sites and the results have been zzso using a variety of dose and volume based zzso 

Over all cases, it is predicted that the use of zzso could lead to a reduction of the total integral dose by a factor three compared to standard zzso techniques and a factor two compared to IM zzso zzso In addition, in all but one zzso at zzso zzso for one case, zzso are predicted to reduce both mean zzso dose and the zzso volume at the 50% mean target dose level compared to both zzso zzso However, when considering the volume of an zzso zzso to zzso or more of the target dose, little difference could be shown between zzso and intensity modulated zzso zzso On comparing the magnitude of dose hot spots in zzso resulting from the zzso and IM zzso plans, more variation was observed, and the ranking of the plans was then found to be case and zzso zzso 

The use of zzso has been found to reduce the medium to low dose load zzso about zzso of the target zzso to zzso and all zzso zzso compared to both standard and zzso planned zzso but that the use of intensity modulated photons can result in similar levels of high dose zzso to that afforded by zzso However, the introduction of inverse planning methods for zzso is necessary before general conclusions on the relative efficacy of photons and zzso can be zzso
