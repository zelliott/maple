Most zzso pairs of DNA replicate zzso during the S phase of the cell zzso However, some genes frequently replicate zzso zzso genes on the X zzso and imprinted zzso Earlier studies demonstrated an zzso pattern of replication in some zzso and invasive zzso zzso of the zzso as well as in multiple zzso A high rate of zzso pattern was found in: zzso zzso of individuals with solid tumors as well as in other zzso zzso zzso of zzso with an extra zzso 13, 18 and zzso zzso zzso of young mothers of a Down syndrome zzso The zzso pattern was not locus specific and was found in all zzso zzso These findings suggested that the mechanism controlling the zzso order of replication could be altered in cells with a genetic predisposition to cancer or zzso In this study, we found a higher rate of zzso pattern in zzso carrying zzso 2 and 9 and in balanced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an even higher rate in cases with a zzso balanced zzso The process of zzso may begin with a change in cell cycle regulation which includes the duplication, replication and segregation of genetic zzso However, it remains unknown whether individuals with balanced zzso zzso are at increased risk of developing cancer later in zzso
