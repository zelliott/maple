We have developed a rapid and sensitive method to measure oxygen consumption of tumor cells by zzso zzso This method could be used as an in zzso screen for potential zzso zzso Previous techniques have lacked either the sensitivity or the speed required for use as an effective clinical zzso This method was modified from a technique previously developed in our laboratory for measuring oxygen in zzso Standard zzso agents were tested against Walker 256 zzso zzso zzso was harvested from 20 rats on each of 50 days, incubated briefly with drugs, and zzso zzso time was measured zzso Individual controls were established for each zzso group, and oxygen zzso measured after one hour of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibited tumor cell oxygen consumption by zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results correlated with the known in zzso effects of these drugs on Walker zzso zzso this sensitive method could potentially be used directly on tumor cells removed from biopsy material so that the testing of zzso drugs could be completed on the day of zzso
