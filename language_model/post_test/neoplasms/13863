Mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso against human zzso cancer cell lines were tested for zzso zzso zzso by human blood zzso cells, using a zzso zzso release zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be more effective than zzso zzso zzso Moreover, when four pairs of drug-resistant and their parent sensitive human cancer cells were tested for zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso only the drug-resistant cell lines were susceptible to zzso zzso When highly zzso zzso zzso than zzso and zzso zzso than zzso were isolated from blood zzso cells by zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoted both zzso and zzso tumor cell killing, whereas zzso induced only a zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso zzso may be a useful therapeutic agent in zzso of drug-resistant cancer cells expressing zzso through zzso zzso
