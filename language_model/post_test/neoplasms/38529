There is growing evidence that a fraction of cancer patients, perhaps as high as zzso is radiation sensitive because of the action of specific zzso It seems likely that in the near future we shall be able to identify these patients by DNA zzso zzso we have calculated the impact on radiation therapy of removing these patients and treating the rest more zzso In particular, we assumed that the radiation zzso will treat with an effective therapeutic dose corresponding to a zzso risk of serious normal tissue zzso Our results, in several instances, show a considerable increase in local control when the 5, 10, or zzso of the most zzso patients are removed from the treated zzso This is so, even if we assume that the tumor cells, as well as the normal cells, in zzso patients are more zzso than the tumor cells in patients of normal zzso
