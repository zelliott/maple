The effects of heat treatment on the viability and zzso potential of four cultured human zzso cell lines, zzso cells zzso lung zzso cells with highly zzso potential zzso melanoma cells zzso and zzso cells zzso determined by measuring their levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its specific zzso zzso were investigated by comparing them with those of human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso incubated at 43 degrees C for 120 zzso exhibited no decrease in viability but exhibited an increase in both zzso and zzso zzso and zzso showed a moderately high zzso zzso zzso that correlated with the reduction of zzso but not zzso On the other hand, zzso and NY cells, with poor zzso zzso zzso exhibited stronger zzso zzso activity when they survived at 43 degrees C for 120 zzso Since the zzso system is directly involved in the zzso and zzso potential of zzso cells, zzso would alter the biological activity of these zzso zzso
