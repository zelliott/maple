zzso is an evolutionary process that establishes the zzso of zzso by natural selection of cell clones that have acquired advantageous zzso zzso zzso adaptation has also been proposed as a mechanism that promotes drug resistance during systemic cancer zzso This review zzso the evidence for the evolution of resistance to zzso and targeted zzso drugs according to zzso models and highlights the roles of zzso instability and high zzso genetic zzso as major zzso of this evolutionary zzso Clinical implications and strategies that may prevent the evolution of resistance or target the origins of genetic zzso are zzso New technologies to measure zzso zzso and zzso research on serial zzso of cancer zzso during and after therapeutic intervention are identified as key areas to further the understanding of zzso and mechanisms of the evolution of drug zzso
