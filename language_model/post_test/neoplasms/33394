Despite numerous zzso clinical trials and zzso zzso studies, evidence on the potential effectiveness of statins for prevention of cancer remains zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the relation between zzso zzso use and cancer zzso 

We conducted a retrospective zzso study based on a medical administrative database in the province of zzso Canada zzso Patients aged 45 years or more and discharged from the hospital alive after admission for acute zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso use were defined as a filled prescription, within 3 days after index zzso at or above (below) the zzso target dose, for any of the 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso was defined as zzso of any statins while simultaneously using major zzso cardiac zzso A total of zzso patients, including high-dose zzso users zzso zzso zzso users zzso and zzso zzso were followed for up to 7 zzso zzso Cox zzso analyses were performed to estimate associations between zzso dose category and the zzso of admission to hospital with a diagnosis of any type of zzso 

The crude zzso rates of hospital admission with the diagnosis of any type of cancer were zzso zzso and zzso per 1000 zzso in zzso high-dose users, zzso users, and zzso zzso The estimated adjusted hazard ratios were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso for zzso use at high dose and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso use at low zzso No significant zzso of the effect of statins at either dose was zzso 

The use of zzso statins at sufficiently high dose might be associated with a clinically important reduction in the zzso of zzso
