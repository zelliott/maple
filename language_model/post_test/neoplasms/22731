Currently, zzso of the dose distribution and clinical acceptance are almost entirely based on the physical dose distribution and zzso control probability zzso is far from being routinely used as objective in treatment zzso For future zzso zzso strategies, a reliable patient specific simulation model, taking into account zzso zzso features, is needed to predict and improve treatment zzso 

To approach these demands, a single cell and zzso based model was developed, which enables three-dimensional zzso growth and radiation response zzso zzso cells were zzso by zzso features such as age, intrinsic zzso proliferation ability, and zzso status, while zzso cells were considered as sources of a zzso oxygen zzso Response to radiation was simulated by the zzso model, taking into account the lower zzso of poorly zzso zzso zzso 

The present study shows the influence of the model components and demonstrates the impact of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the treatment zzso 

The simulation model adequately zzso the importance of the above described selected parameters on zzso control zzso providing an insight into the interplay of different physical and biological zzso and its relevance for an individual zzso zzso
