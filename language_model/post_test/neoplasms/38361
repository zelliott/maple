The goal of this study was to determine if radiation therapy zzso of human cancer enhances or diminishes zzso zzso zzso This is important if zzso is to be harnessed to improve the outcome of cancer zzso 

zzso were isolated from zzso cancer zzso patients before, zzso and after zzso zzso Similar samples were taken from prostate cancer patients receiving standard zzso The level of zzso T cells capable of binding zzso for the zzso zzso zzso which is zzso in both cancer types, was zzso in zzso patient zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were also zzso to evaluate zzso changes in zzso zzso For zzso patients, most of whom were enrolled in a clinical trial, zzso response data were available, as well as biopsy and zzso zzso which were stained for zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso T zzso were detected in the peripheral blood of zzso and prostate cancer patients and increased after therapy in some, but not all, zzso zzso were more common in zzso patients whose tumor was zzso after zzso zzso specimens from this cohort generally had higher nuclear to zzso zzso zzso zzso cells generally increased in the circulation following therapy but only in zzso zzso 

This study indicates that zzso may increase the likelihood of some cancer patients responding to zzso and lays a basis for future investigations aimed at combining radiation and zzso
