Maintenance zzso required after organ transplantation creates a zzso environment in which cancer cells can zzso because of lack of natural zzso zzso With more than a decade of clinical experience, this report is the first to address the risk of de zzso cancer after zzso zzso 

A total of zzso consecutive zzso transplant recipients zzso children and 82 zzso were zzso of whom zzso were male and zzso were zzso zzso zzso and End zzso data was used to count expected rates of de zzso zzso in the general population matched for age, sex, and length of zzso 

With a mean follow-up of zzso months, 7 zzso patients developed zzso de zzso cancer, with a cumulative risk of zzso at 5 years and zzso at 10 zzso Of these zzso one was zzso zzso With zzso being the expected rate of zzso for the general population, the risk among zzso recipients was zzso times higher zzso zzso Such morbidity was significantly higher zzso zzso among younger patients zzso zzso with a slight male zzso zzso zzso was associated with early onset of de zzso zzso Patient survival after diagnosis of de zzso cancer was zzso at 1 year, 57% at 2 years, and zzso at 5 zzso 

With conventional zzso zzso recipients are at a significantly higher risk of developing de zzso cancer when compared with the general zzso Thus, a novel zzso zzso strategy has been recently implemented to reduce the lifelong need for zzso
