To determine the efficacy of real-time zzso zzso compared with our previously proposed prediction model, in the detection of zzso in cervical zzso zzso zzso 

One hundred and zzso patients underwent zzso fine needle aspiration biopsy zzso zzso after ultrasound and zzso zzso The formula of the zzso scoring system was a zzso visual scale, based on a previously determined zzso The formula of the prediction model was: zzso see zzso An extended model was constructed with four previous zzso and elasticity scores, using a zzso zzso zzso 

Final zzso revealed 77 benign and 54 zzso zzso In the elasticity score system, sensitivity was zzso specificity was zzso the positive zzso value zzso was zzso and the negative zzso value zzso was zzso In the prediction model system, sensitivity was zzso specificity was zzso the zzso was zzso and the zzso was zzso When the extended and the original model were zzso the areas under the receiver operating characteristic curve zzso was zzso and zzso respectively zzso 

zzso zzso offers no additional value over conventional ultrasound in predicting zzso in cervical zzso 

zzso An ultrasound system can help in the assessment of cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso and power zzso ultrasound remain fundamental for neck zzso zzso zzso zzso real-time zzso provided no additional value compared with current prediction zzso
