zzso zzso zzso activity was studied zzso during early development of the sea urchin, the zzso the chick and the rat zzso After zzso fixation and embedding in zzso zzso the zzso reaction was carried out in serial zzso zzso Independent from zzso zzso appears in every embryonic zzso in a very early stage of zzso It disappears from the embryonic cells after they have assembled into zzso organ zzso Thus, zzso plays a role in embryonic development which is different from its known function in the zzso zzso zzso activity present in zzso cells during a limited phase of development, is termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was invariably found in cells engaged in zzso zzso This observation has led us to suppose that the zzso in involved in the regulation of cellular movements during zzso zzso In particular, embryonic zzso is described in the following locations: a) During sea zzso zzso zzso is present in the primary zzso cells zzso from the zzso wall and in the zzso cells which are known to bring about the zzso movement by contraction of their zzso b) In the early chick zzso zzso active zzso zzso are described which are supposed to emigrate from the zzso layer in order to form the zzso c) During development of zzso and zzso during closure of the neural tube and development of the head zzso the close correlation of zzso activity with various zzso movements is zzso zzso appears during zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The active zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as the neural plate, is also accompanied by zzso activity in zzso zzso
