The primary objective of this study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose zzso of zzso zzso zzso administered in combination with a fixed oral dose of zzso and zzso in patients with zzso solid zzso 

A fixed oral dose of zzso of 4 zzso was given every 12 h zzso 3 doses starting 12 h prior to zzso zzso zzso zzso was administered zzso over 1 h on weeks 1, 3, and weekly zzso The starting zzso dose level was 57 zzso and escalation occurred in zzso of three patients until the zzso was zzso zzso was given at a fixed oral daily dose of 250 zzso starting at week 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies were performed on day 1 zzso + zzso and on day 15 zzso + zzso + zzso 

A total of 20 patients were zzso zzso zzso was observed in two out of the four patients receiving zzso zzso of zzso Mean zzso peak serum zzso concentration zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the systemic exposure zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The relationship between zzso dose and either C zzso or zzso was linear over the zzso zzso dose zzso 

The addition of a low dose of zzso allowed the safe escalation of zzso to the zzso of 125 zzso This dose level resulted in serum zzso zzso that are associated with zzso zzso zzso However, no zzso activity was noted clinically in patients with solid zzso
