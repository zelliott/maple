The zzso system, and in particular zzso zzso are targets for therapeutic intervention in human zzso zzso zzso zzso have reached clinical use for treating pulmonary zzso hypertension, and are under clinical investigation for several other diseases, such as cancer, zzso or zzso zzso We review the molecules that have been evaluated in the main clinical trials, from the point of view of zzso selectivity and of their chemical characteristics which were important for efficacy in pulmonary zzso We will also discuss future use of zzso to zzso zzso in several human diseases and what should be the necessary properties of the future molecules for efficacy in diseases where the presently tested molecules displayed zzso zzso
