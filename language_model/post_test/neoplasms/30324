zzso genes associated with cancer development is typically accomplished by comparing mean expression values in normal and tumor zzso which identifies zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso variation zzso in gene expression is indirectly included in DE gene identification because given the same absolute differences in means, genes with lower zzso tend to have lower zzso We explored the direct use of IV in gene expression to identify candidate genes associated with cancer zzso We focused on prostate zzso and lung zzso zzso and compared IV in the expression level of genes shown to be cancer related with that in all other genes in the human zzso Compared with all those other zzso zzso genes tended to have greater IV in normal zzso and a greater increase in IV during the transition from normal to zzso zzso Genes without significantly different mean expression values between tumor and normal zzso but with greater IV in tumor than in normal tissue zzso the zzso approach completely ignores those zzso had stronger associations with clinically important features like zzso score in zzso or tumor zzso in zzso than all other genes zzso Our results suggest that analyzing IV in gene expression level is useful in identifying novel candidate genes associated with cancer zzso
