zzso growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso play a pivotal role in regulating cell zzso migration, differentiation and survival, in response to injury and tissue zzso zzso expression of this zzso in cancer opened the way to the development of targeted therapy to achieve zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso administration has been demonstrated to zzso oral zzso resulting from zzso besides protecting zzso cells against zzso zzso 

This review focuses on the potential therapeutic interest of zzso in two different zzso selective zzso of zzso signaling for the treatment of zzso characterized by zzso of this zzso and administration of zzso to protect zzso cells from induced zzso The review presents an overview of therapeutic strategies in both zzso 

zzso signaling can contribute to enhancing the zzso potential of zzso cells and to promoting zzso On the other hand, the therapeutic use of zzso in cancer patients provides zzso protection, reducing chemotherapy side zzso zzso have become attractive zzso targets and various zzso have been used to contrast tumor cell zzso The identification of zzso molecules might represent a promising therapeutic strategy that could increase the window of available agents and treatment zzso
