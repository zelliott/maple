Numerous animal and clinical studies have shown that injection of T zzso from a major zzso complex matched donor can cure subjects with zzso zzso zzso This zzso effect, which represents the most conclusive evidence that the immune system can cure cancer in humans, is zzso primarily if not exclusively by T cells specific for host minor zzso zzso Since minor zzso zzso are present on all zzso and zzso injection of zzso donor T cells also causes graft zzso host disease, which drastically limits the use and benefits of this zzso Recent studies in mice have shown that adoptive transfer of primed T cells targeted to a single major zzso complex class I restricted zzso minor zzso zzso can eradicate leukemia cells without causing any toxicity to the zzso We present the promises and zzso of this and other new approaches for adoptive T cell zzso of zzso
