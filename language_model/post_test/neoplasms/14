zzso analyses of zzso human zzso X zzso hybrid cell populations have provided tentative evidence for the correlation of loss of a single copy of zzso 11 and 14 with zzso of zzso In this study paired combinations of zzso and zzso zzso zzso X zzso hybrid cells from two independent fusion events were examined for the presence or absence of normal zzso 11 and zzso In human hybrid cell lines the parental origin of zzso can be distinguished on the basis of restriction zzso length zzso Genes for zzso insulin, and zzso zzso on zzso 11 and a zzso locus zzso on zzso 14 were used as Southern zzso zzso Analysis of DNA from the parental zzso and zzso cell lines and their zzso and zzso hybrids showed the loss of a zzso zzso 11 in four of the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso 11 in a fifth hybrid cell zzso This latter zzso has, interestingly, also lost a copy of zzso 14 of zzso zzso There was no obvious correlation of loss of a copy of normal zzso 14 and zzso of zzso in any of the other hybrid cell zzso Our conclusion from these observations is that zzso that map to normal zzso 11 might be involved in control of zzso expression in these human hybrid zzso
