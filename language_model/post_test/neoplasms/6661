Many cancer patients become zzso as a result of therapy and, as such, are likely to have fever during zzso zzso zzso 20 percent of these episodes have an associated zzso rod zzso these infections occur among the most profoundly zzso patients and are associated with the highest zzso Most infections are caused by one of three zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso or zzso zzso The standard approach to therapy has been the zzso zzso of an zzso zzso most often an zzso with either an zzso zzso or a zzso In patients for whom concern about zzso zzso or zzso is high, a double zzso combination has been zzso Also, with the introduction of increasingly active, exceptionally zzso zzso zzso therapy with single agents has been zzso zzso combinations more often than not are zzso although antagonism can be detected on zzso Some double zzso combinations demonstrate zzso whereas in other cases, zzso or at least partial zzso can be zzso zzso combinations can be evaluated through in zzso models, such as the zzso model system, or through animal models designed to mimic the zzso state with zzso zzso to determine potential agents or combinations of agents for this patient zzso These zzso approaches have suggested that some agents may prove effective as zzso and, indeed, have been comparable in activity to some of the standard zzso zzso However, clinical trials have had insufficient numbers of particularly high-risk patients with profound, persistent zzso and zzso rod zzso to be able to assess their usefulness in such zzso In general, it still appears to be advantageous to use combinations such as those used in the most recent European Organization for Research on Treatment of Cancer zzso trial, which compared zzso with zzso In order to reduce zzso zzso patients were randomly assigned to receive zzso either for a short period or for the entire length of zzso The study should help to determine whether it is possible to maintain the advantages of zzso combinations while reducing the disadvantages of prolonged zzso zzso
