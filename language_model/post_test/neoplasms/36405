zzso growth factor zzso is the most potent zzso of zzso growth and DNA synthesis zzso it is now known to be the same zzso as scatter factor, which increases the zzso of a variety of cell zzso zzso is becoming recognized as one of the most important factors in the regulation of liver zzso after surgical zzso or chemical zzso zzso is produced by several zzso including zzso it can therefore provide a stimulus for increased zzso of zzso cells by both a zzso and zzso zzso The zzso for zzso has been identified as the product of the zzso zzso raising the possibility that this gene plays a key role in zzso cellular zzso zzso may therefore be important not only for liver cell growth but also in zzso This article summarizes the current position of research on zzso and presents both clinical and scientific evidence that strongly implicates this factor in liver zzso and cancer invasion and zzso
