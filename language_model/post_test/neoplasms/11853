Human cell lines, whether derived from spontaneous tumors or transformed in zzso with zzso virus 40, were found to contain a zzso zzso zzso in contrast to normal human cells in which this protein was not zzso zzso focusing showed that zzso comprised several species in both zzso virus zzso and tumor zzso zzso of the zzso species from the various cell lines by partial zzso showed that they were similar but not zzso Among the 13 tumor cell lines zzso only 1 line, zzso did not contain zzso zzso All the other tumor cell lines contained zzso and it is suggested that this protein may be associated with their transformed zzso
