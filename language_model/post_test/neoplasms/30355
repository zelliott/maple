zzso cells need to disrupt zzso pathways to escape the zzso action of zzso zzso and zzso stress during the zzso zzso However, the zzso action of classical chemotherapy, and zzso includes the induction of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso resistance of tumor cells contributes to the failure of chemotherapy and zzso During the last two decades, extensive research aimed at an improved understanding of the complex signaling pathways that control zzso execution in normal cells and of the zzso factors that mediate zzso resistance of cancer zzso Among these, the zzso protein family attracted major attention for the development of compounds that specifically target zzso resistance of cancer zzso zzso proteins are master regulators of the intrinsic zzso zzso that is crucial for zzso execution in response to zzso The review will highlight current knowledge on the regulation of zzso pathways and discuss several approaches that target the zzso zzso to counteract tumor cell intrinsic zzso resistance that may therefore be of value for a biological zzso of zzso zzso
