We studied differences in zzso patterns and the spatial zzso of zzso of zzso 11 during the cell cycle between normal peripheral blood zzso zzso and human zzso leukemia cells zzso using zzso in zzso zzso The zzso in both cells were located at the periphery during zzso zzso phase, but moved towards the nuclear center in zzso and zzso zzso During zzso the zzso of zzso continued to move towards the nuclear center whereas those of zzso returned to the zzso The angle defining the spatial location of two zzso in reference to the center of the nucleus, increased in zzso cells from a mean of 67 degrees during zzso phase to 106 degrees during zzso phase zzso zzso zzso and the two zzso remained wide apart throughout the entire cell zzso In zzso the angle also increased during zzso but then decreased during zzso and zzso zzso Both cells exhibited zzso signals during zzso that were round and zzso and the entire zzso was loosely zzso The signal became more loose and dispersed during the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso signal varied during zzso and was generally zzso or zzso with zzso of the entire zzso or zzso Our results suggest that subtle but important differences in spatial zzso of zzso are present during the zzso between normal zzso and zzso zzso
