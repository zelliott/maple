zzso targeting has become a prominent concept in cancer treatment and heat shock protein 90 zzso zzso are suggested as promising zzso zzso The zzso complex is one of the zzso that facilitate the zzso of unfolded or zzso proteins and plays a role for key zzso proteins such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso currently under clinical development as an zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein complexes leads to zzso degradation of client proteins and cell zzso The aim of the current study was to use a combination of the zzso zzso zzso zzso model and zzso zzso zzso zzso to investigate the effects of zzso on zzso growth and its relation to PET zzso zzso for the selection of appropriate PET zzso A further aim was to evaluate the concentration and time dependence in the relation between growth zzso and PET zzso zzso as part of zzso imaging zzso 

zzso of two breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso one zzso cell line zzso and one colon zzso cell line zzso were zzso Initially, we investigated zzso growth pattern and zzso incorporation in zzso after continuous exposure to zzso in order to determine dose zzso Then the short-term effect of the drug on the four PET zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was correlated to the long-term effect zzso in growth zzso to determine the adequate PET zzso with high zzso Next, the growth zzso effect of different dose schedules was evaluated to determine the optimal dose and zzso Finally, the effect of a zzso exposure to the drug on growth pattern and zzso zzso was zzso 

A zzso zzso of growth and decrease of zzso zzso was observed with zzso growth zzso in the dose range zzso zzso and 50% zzso reduction in the range of zzso zzso with the most pronounced effect on zzso zzso The effect of the drug was best detected by zzso The results suggested that a complete zzso of growth of the viable cell volume was achieved with about 50% zzso of zzso zzso 3 days after continuous zzso zzso growth zzso was observed at all doses and all exposure time zzso zzso exposure to zzso generated a growth zzso which persisted dose zzso up to 10 zzso The zzso of zzso per viable zzso volume was reduced by just zzso with 300 zzso treatment of the drug, whereas the zzso zzso decreased up to zzso in correlation with the growth zzso and zzso 

Our results indicate a prolonged action of zzso in this cell culture, zzso is a suitable zzso for the monitoring of the effect and a zzso PET study within 3 days after treatment can predict the treatment outcome in this zzso If relevant in zzso this information can be used for efficient planning of animal PET studies and later human PET zzso
