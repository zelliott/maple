The interactions between tumor cells and zzso or other components of the zzso zzso have been shown to play an important role in tumor invasion and zzso These interactions are zzso by different cell surface zzso including the zzso 67 zzso zzso zzso This zzso appears to be very peculiar since so, far only a full-length gene zzso a 37 zzso precursor protein has been isolated and the mechanism by which the precursor reaches the mature form is not zzso Based on clinical data, which clearly demonstrate the importance of the zzso in tumor zzso studies were conducted to define the structure, zzso and function of this zzso zzso as a step toward developing therapeutic strategies that target this zzso The data suggest that zzso of the precursor is the key mechanism in maturation of the 67 zzso zzso The function of the membrane zzso is to stabilize the binding of zzso to cell surface zzso acting as an zzso zzso although zzso of the gene zzso the zzso precursor with other genes suggests additional zzso zzso of the zzso expression on tumor cells might open new therapeutic approaches to decrease tumor zzso
