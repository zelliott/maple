zzso is frequent in cancer patients and its zzso increases with zzso The probability of requiring zzso also increases with zzso zzso zzso impacts survival and zzso fatigue in cancer zzso Cancer promotes inflammatory zzso production, which suppresses zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso agents zzso improve zzso and reduce zzso needs in anemic cancer patients receiving zzso However, zzso have shown an increased risk of zzso zzso events with zzso use during chemotherapy, but not increased zzso mortality or reduced overall zzso Three reasons have been proposed to explain why zzso might have adverse effects in anemic cancer zzso tumor progression due to stimulation of tumor cell EPO zzso increased risk of zzso and reduced zzso However, zzso is not an zzso nor is the EPO zzso It has also been demonstrated that zzso does not stimulate tumor zzso Increased TE risk associated with zzso is probably a consequence of increased blood zzso due to excessive zzso mass zzso with zzso plasma volume contraction, zzso oxide zzso and zzso cell zzso Increased zzso dosing may also impact survival zzso because EPO contracts the plasma volume and stimulates inflammatory zzso production independently of increasing zzso Furthermore, zzso themselves are associated with an increase in TE and plasma volume contraction, and these events are zzso when zzso are given with zzso An update on the management of anemia in zzso the potential adverse events of zzso the benefits and risks of zzso and zzso are discussed in this zzso
