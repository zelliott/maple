zzso zzso zzso and zzso play essential roles in several biological zzso among which zzso transformation and zzso zzso In this paper, we review the zzso process together with the highly appealing use of zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso In addition, we report our results concerning zzso in a cellular model system for zzso transformation developed in our zzso Here we show that zzso and zzso expression increases during zzso zzso together with the zzso levels of zzso Furthermore, we demonstrate a greater effect of the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso on cellular viability in zzso transformed cells compared to normal zzso and we show that prolonged zzso administration to zzso cells causes a decrease in zzso zzso Taken together, our data support an active involvement of zzso in zzso transformation and zzso length maintenance and confirm the relevant role of zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso
