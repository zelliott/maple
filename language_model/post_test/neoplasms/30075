This study presents a rapid and sensitive method for detecting cancer cells occurring at low zzso The method involves the simultaneous detection of two zzso of T helper cancer zzso One zzso zzso with zzso magnetic zzso zzso enabling the separation of the T helper cells from a mixed population of zzso The other zzso is used for detection during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The specific T helper cells can be zzso according to their zzso zzso values following magnetic zzso The experimental results demonstrate that zzso zzso can function as magnetic sensors and separate specific T helper cells from a mixed population with high efficiency and high zzso zzso with the zzso technique, the zzso zzso can simultaneously detect rare zzso zzso indicated increasing zzso with increasing T cell number (from 10 to zzso The total detection time was less than 15 minutes, even at a low T cell zzso The advantages of the proposed method for detecting specific cells at low concentration include ease of preparation, low cost, rapid zzso and high zzso The proposed system can be adopted to detect circulating tumor cells in early tumor stages for diagnostic or zzso zzso
