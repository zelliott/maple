Blood lead levels above zzso zzso (10 zzso in adults have been associated with increased risk of zzso cancer, and zzso zzso The objective of the present study was to determine the association between blood lead levels below zzso zzso and mortality in the general US zzso 

Blood lead levels were measured in a nationally representative sample of zzso adult participants of the Third National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso recruited in 1988 to 1994 and followed up for up to 12 years for zzso and zzso zzso The geometric mean blood lead level in study participants was zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso adjustment, the hazard ratios zzso zzso for comparisons of participants in the highest zzso of blood lead zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with those in the lowest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso to zzso zzso across zzso zzso zzso for zzso mortality and zzso zzso to zzso zzso across zzso zzso zzso for cardiovascular zzso Blood lead level was significantly associated with both zzso zzso and stroke zzso and the association was evident at levels zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso 2 zzso There was no association between blood lead and cancer mortality in this range of zzso 

The association between blood lead levels and increased zzso and cardiovascular mortality was observed at substantially lower blood lead levels than previously zzso Despite the marked decrease in blood lead levels over the past 3 decades, environmental lead zzso remain a significant zzso of cardiovascular mortality in the general population, zzso a major public health zzso
