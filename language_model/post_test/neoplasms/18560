Although targeting the zzso zzso remains a promising zzso strategy, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in clinical development are likely to be limited in their ability to produce durable clinical responses due to the emergence of acquired drug zzso To identify potential mechanisms of such resistance, we established zzso zzso clones of human zzso colon cancer cells zzso zzso that harbor the zzso zzso zzso cells were specifically resistant to zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso with drug-induced zzso of zzso and their downstream targets primarily accountable for drug zzso We identified zzso zzso as a molecular mechanism responsible for zzso zzso zzso In an zzso cell system that extended these findings into other cancer cell lines, the zzso zzso exhibited higher intrinsic zzso activity than zzso zzso zzso leading to potent zzso of zzso and downstream zzso The zzso zzso also strengthened binding to zzso suggesting an underlying mechanism of higher intrinsic zzso zzso zzso the combined use of zzso and zzso zzso overcame the observed drug resistance and exhibited greater zzso in zzso cells than the zzso zzso parental zzso Overall, our findings suggested that zzso in zzso can lead to acquired resistance in patients treated with zzso zzso and that a combined zzso of zzso and zzso may be potentially useful as a strategy to bypass or prevent drug resistance in the zzso
