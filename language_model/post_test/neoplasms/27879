Nearly all patients with cancer manifest laboratory evidence of zzso and some develop clinical zzso disease zzso zzso laboratory studies of blood zzso have been performed in several large, prospective trials of the use of zzso drugs in cancer zzso The results of these studies, as well as data from several smaller studies of more sensitive tests of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F1 + zzso indicate that the levels of some zzso proteins parallel disease zzso However, no studies of sound zzso design have yet been performed to indicate that any of these tests of blood zzso can serve as adequate zzso of zzso in patients with zzso In addition to the important role played by zzso zzso several other mechanisms may be involved in the zzso of zzso events in patients with cancer, including stasis and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the relative importance of these mechanisms in the zzso of zzso may exist among patients with different types of zzso The risk for zzso associated with surgical procedures in cancer patients is substantial and zzso zzso therapy should be considered for most of these zzso zzso and hormonal therapy of cancer probably increases the likelihood of zzso particularly in those subjects with zzso zzso zzso This risk has been particularly well-studied in patients with breast cancer treated with tamoxifen plus zzso zzso The zzso mechanisms may be complex but vascular injury is likely as a zzso cause of zzso access zzso zzso and can be prevented with low dose zzso zzso The utility of low dose zzso zzso in reducing the risk for zzso during breast cancer treatment is unknown but is currently being tested in a large, zzso zzso Since chronic zzso zzso of cancer patients, and single pulse dose zzso prior to intravenous chemotherapy, both prevent zzso generation, these agents may be of use in reducing the risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso should be considered for high risk zzso
