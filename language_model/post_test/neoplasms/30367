zzso is used to zzso tumor changes during exposure to zzso zzso zzso are zzso as complete response zzso partial response zzso stable disease zzso or progressive disease zzso Clinical trials dictate a patient's management options based on the category into which his or her response zzso However, the association between response and survival is not well studied in the early trial zzso 

To study the correlation between response as zzso by zzso and overall survival zzso the zzso survival zzso we analyzed zzso participants of 24 phase I trials conducted between October 2004 and May 2009, of whom zzso had quantifiable changes in tumor zzso zzso of zzso estimates of zzso by response and zzso zzso zzso of Cox models were the primary outcome zzso All analyses are landmark zzso 

zzso analyses revealed strong associations between change in tumor size by zzso and survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 1 zzso zzso The relationship was found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and confirmed by the residual zzso No clear inflection points were found to exist in the relationship between tumor size changes and zzso 

zzso zzso of response zzso with survival, zzso zzso use in phase I zzso However, the lack of apparent boundary values in the relationship between change in tumor size and zzso demonstrates the arbitrary nature of the zzso categories and questions emphasis placed on this categorization zzso Describing tumor responses as a continuous variable may be more zzso than reporting zzso responses when evaluating novel zzso zzso
