This study evaluated whether or not the efficiency of utilizing energy zzso and nitrogen differs among cancer and control patients during zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso acid metabolism across the leg were measured in cancer patients who had lost approximately zzso of their body weight and were compared with that of patients without cancer with similar zzso zzso zzso balances across the leg were evaluated relative to food zzso energy zzso energy balance, nitrogen balance, and urinary zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso All zzso were performed twice in each zzso first in the zzso state and second during nutrition after 14 days of a controlled zzso infusion of a formula diet of 35 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of metabolism across the leg before and after 14 days of zzso nutrition were compared with changes in nutritional zzso Whole body zzso of energy and of nitrogen were not significantly different among cancer patients and controls, whereas the simultaneously measured net balances of zzso and free fatty acids across the leg of cancer patients were statistically significantly more negative during the constant infusion of the formula zzso The results in this study emphasize that zzso cancer patients are quite comparable with patients with benign zzso in terms of whole body and peripheral metabolism both before and in the response to zzso zzso
