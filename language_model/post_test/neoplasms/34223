zzso cells in culture do not accumulate zzso acid unless zzso acid or zzso acid is available in the zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the activity found in the invasive zone of zzso and acid zzso in zzso cells cultured under normal conditions, are unaffected by zzso acid, but are reduced in cells deprived of zzso These reduced zzso levels, but not acid zzso are restored to the values of normal zzso cells by zzso zzso The relevance of these findings is considered in the context of zzso growth and zzso
