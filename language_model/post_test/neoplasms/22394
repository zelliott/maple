zzso was discovered nearly 40 years ago as a zzso zzso zzso Recent data suggest that zzso may also be an effective cancer zzso In this case, zzso targets an zzso the zzso translation initiation factor zzso elevated in approximately zzso of zzso including many zzso and zzso Specifically, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transformation by acting as an inhibitor of zzso In a phase II clinical trial, zzso treatment led to substantial clinical benefit in patients with zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso Here molecular targeting of zzso correlated with clinical zzso zzso also targets a key zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso zzso and also zzso zzso zzso with known zzso mechanisms could be zzso however, after 40 years, these are not entirely zzso The zzso effects of zzso appear zzso zzso This variation likely arises for many reasons, including cell specific variations in zzso metabolism as well as virus specific zzso Thus, it seems that the mechanisms for zzso action in cancer therapy may also vary in terms of the zzso under zzso Here we review the zzso activities of zzso and discuss the possible utility of incorporating zzso into diverse cancer therapeutic zzso
