The identification of zzso zzso has opened up new approaches to cancer zzso While past research focused on zzso zzso zzso responses, accumulating evidence suggests that zzso T cells also play an important role in orchestrating the host immune response against zzso In this article, we zzso new strategies for the identification of major zzso complex zzso class zzso zzso zzso and discuss the importance of engaging both zzso and zzso T cells in cancer zzso The cloning of zzso class zzso or class zzso zzso has made it possible to develop synthetic and zzso cancer vaccines that express specific zzso zzso There are three major types of synthetic and zzso cancer zzso zzso viral and bacterial zzso naked DNA or zzso zzso and zzso protein and zzso zzso In this article, we also discuss a new generation of zzso cancer vaccines, zzso DNA and zzso zzso Studies on the mechanisms of zzso zzso acid vaccines revealed that the enhanced zzso was not due to an enhanced zzso zzso suggesting that the quantitative difference may not be as important as the qualitative difference in zzso zzso The presence of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso acid vaccines mimics zzso infection, which triggers the innate zzso pathways of the host zzso Studies on how viral and cellular zzso of the innate zzso pathways affect vaccine function should provide molecular insights crucial to future vaccine zzso
