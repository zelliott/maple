zzso zzso is a toxic metal, targeting the zzso liver, zzso and zzso following acute zzso and causing zzso zzso zzso and tumors after prolonged zzso zzso oxygen species zzso are often implicated in zzso zzso This zzso focused on direct evidence for the generation of free zzso in intact animals following acute zzso overload and discussed the association of zzso in chronic zzso toxicity and zzso zzso zzso zzso hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso in zzso have been detected by the electron spin resonance zzso which are often accompanied by zzso of zzso sensitive zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso gene zzso It is generally agreed upon that zzso stress plays important roles in acute zzso zzso However, following long-term zzso exposure at zzso low levels, direct evidence for zzso stress is often zzso zzso in zzso gene expression during chronic zzso are also less significant compared to acute zzso zzso This is probably due to induced adaptation mechanisms zzso zzso and zzso following chronic zzso zzso which in turn diminish zzso zzso zzso In chronic zzso cells, less zzso signals are detected with zzso zzso zzso zzso tolerance renders damaged cells to zzso with inherent zzso DNA zzso potentially leading to zzso Thus, zzso are generated following acute zzso overload and play important roles in tissue zzso zzso to chronic zzso exposure reduces zzso production, but acquired zzso tolerance with zzso gene expression plays important roles in chronic zzso toxicity and zzso
