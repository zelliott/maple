zzso zzso zzso signals DNA damage and zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso are being evaluated in zzso with defective DNA repair mechanisms or in combination with zzso therapy or zzso We evaluated the zzso zzso zzso in combination with chemotherapy using in zzso and in zzso pediatric solid tumor zzso 

The zzso of zzso alone and in combination with zzso agents was determined in 10 pediatric solid tumor cell zzso zzso was assessed using the combination index of zzso zzso alone and in combination with zzso was evaluated in zzso models of Ewing zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity was evaluated in cell lines and tumor zzso 

zzso induced growth zzso median zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibited zzso activity in pediatric solid tumor cell zzso The addition of zzso to DNA damaging agents resulted in additive to synergistic zzso In zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso activity by zzso as a single agent and zzso when administered with zzso Although the addition of zzso did not antagonize the activity of zzso clear evidence of zzso could not be zzso 

In pediatric solid tumor cell lines, clinically achievable zzso of single agent zzso caused growth zzso Although the in zzso data demonstrated synergistic efficacy of zzso when added to the zzso and zzso agents, zzso was not discernible in zzso Clinical trials of zzso zzso in combination DNA damaging agents are necessary to establish the role of zzso zzso in childhood zzso
