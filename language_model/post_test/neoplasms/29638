In this work, we zzso investigated zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The goal of the study was to investigate the therapeutic effects of treatment conditions including laser zzso power, exposure time, zzso of tailored zzso and zzso properties of the tissue that is under zzso It was found that using absorbing preferential zzso as the zzso agent zzso zzso rate zzso in terms of lowering zzso rate zzso and reducing laser penetration zzso However, the local enhancement in laser zzso zzso induced by zzso is so significant that the reduced zzso rate will be balanced out, and the eventual medical zzso is greatly prompted by using zzso Also, the results of zzso simulations indicated that with constant laser zzso an increase in zzso concentration beyond a certain range has only an insignificant impact on zzso
