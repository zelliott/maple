zzso constantly undergo various stresses within their life span, which can damage their zzso In order to maintain zzso stability and counteract the development of unwanted zzso zzso organisms have evolved a zzso response zzso to protect their zzso Due to the critical roles played by zzso in zzso stability, its defects can lead to cellular transformation and potentially zzso zzso this also provides the opportunity to specifically target tumor cells due to a weakened ability to tolerate zzso zzso In this lies a treatment strategy in which the zzso of remaining zzso pathways can zzso tumors to zzso agents while minimizing deleterious effects to healthy zzso Therefore it is important to understand the zzso background of specific tumors to determine which zzso pathways remain and can be targeted for zzso zzso therapies based on the zzso are ideal not only as a means of increasing the effectiveness of current zzso but also as a means to selectively target tumor cells while leaving healthy cells zzso Thus, targeting zzso components as a means of increasing effectiveness and discrimination of current zzso tumor treatments is currently the focus of many studies and clinical zzso
