Despite remarkable progress in modern laboratory testing and imaging technology in recent years, diagnostic errors still zzso To assess whether diagnostic performance in a primary referral hospital improves with new diagnostic tools and zzso autopsy reports were analyzed over a zzso period to monitor diagnostic zzso 

Medical reports from 1997 to 2006 were compared zzso with autopsy zzso A diagnostic error was assumed when the main clinical diagnosis was missed, independently of whether this influenced the patient's survival or whether this error led to incorrect treatment without effect on zzso Two cardiovascular markers with high sensitivity, namely cardiac zzso T and zzso testing and two zzso for zzso pain and zzso disease were introduced during the study zzso 

970 cases were zzso the autopsy rate was zzso zzso diseases were zzso in zzso followed by infectious diseases in zzso zzso zzso and neurological diseases in zzso The most commonly missed diagnoses were zzso zzso pulmonary embolism and zzso zzso however, the rate of errors for cardiovascular diseases decreased over the 10 years zzso zzso diagnostic sensitivity and specificity rose from zzso to zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso 

zzso remains a valuable tool to measure diagnostic zzso Errors occur most frequently in cardiovascular events, whereas in zzso and neurological diseases they are zzso The significant improvement of diagnostic accuracy for cardiovascular diseases is associated with the introduction of new sensitive laboratory tests and zzso for zzso pain and zzso zzso
