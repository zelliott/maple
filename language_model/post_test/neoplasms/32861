A previous study of the zzso test showed promising zzso We have attempted to repeat the study using a blind coded series of 210 blood samples from normal subjects and patients with either benign or zzso zzso Using standard criteria the false negative rate for cancer patients averaged zzso and the false positive rate for zzso patients averaged zzso The results indicate that the test at the present time, under routine laboratory conditions, is not reliably zzso and does not have the ability to effectively discriminate between benign and zzso zzso It is suggested that blind coded studies be used more frequently in assessment of tests with cancer detection zzso
