zzso protein zzso zzso T zzso is frequently zzso in human zzso including zzso zzso zzso and skin zzso More than half of the identified zzso zzso are located in the zzso part of zzso However, the functional significance of those zzso domain zzso remains to be zzso Here we report that the zzso domain of zzso mediates zzso zzso zzso This zzso interaction is very specific because zzso does not interact with its closest zzso zzso in a cell zzso zzso We further showed that all five zzso zzso located in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to varying zzso their ability to form cell zzso indicating that those zzso are zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso may play an important role in zzso zzso and that zzso zzso of this zzso could promote tumor migration and zzso
