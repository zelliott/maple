zzso zzso have been shown to have sensitive imaging properties for neuroendocrine zzso and their zzso The potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a new zzso agent for PET has been zzso zzso was used as a surrogate of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso were investigated by using two nude mouse zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity profile of zzso on zzso zzso with human zzso zzso zzso was assessed by using zzso zzso These studies revealed that zzso is an zzso zzso which presents the highest affinity ever found for the zzso zzso zzso The rate of zzso into the zzso cell line also was the highest found for any zzso zzso zzso studies, performed in nude mice bearing an zzso zzso or a zzso zzso zzso zzso showed high and specific zzso in the zzso and in other zzso zzso which reflects the high zzso binding affinity and the high rate of zzso The zzso differences between zzso and zzso are discussed in terms of the structural parameters found for the zzso models zzso and zzso whose X-ray structures have been zzso Both zzso show zzso coordination in zzso zzso
