The major copper influx zzso copper zzso 1 zzso controls the cellular zzso of zzso in zzso zzso The goal of this study was to determine the pattern of zzso expression in normal and zzso human zzso zzso zzso were stained with an zzso specific for zzso using standard zzso zzso Particularly strong zzso was noted in the alpha cells of the pancreatic zzso zzso cells of the gastric zzso and zzso C cells of the zzso and a subset of cells in the anterior zzso zzso and intensity of zzso zzso in zzso zzso reflected the levels found in their normal tissue zzso For example, neither normal prostate nor prostate zzso expressed zzso whereas it was commonly expressed in both normal zzso zzso and in colon zzso Strong zzso was observed in a limited number of cases of zzso tumors, Ewing's zzso and zzso zzso Although all zzso require copper, expression of zzso was highly variable among normal zzso and among the major human zzso with the highest levels found in zzso zzso No zzso expression was found in several common types of cancer, suggesting that zzso expression is not commonly enhanced by zzso
