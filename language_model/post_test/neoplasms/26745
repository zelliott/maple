zzso zzso of proteins is increasingly being suggested as a zzso player in zzso zzso Despite this, few studies have investigated how zzso of a protein can alter individual biological processes that contribute to cancer zzso Using Ras as a model of zzso we investigate how zzso of the polarity protein zzso contributes to its zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to zzso zzso protein zzso zzso transformation both in zzso and in zzso By utilizing a construct that carries a zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso resulting in a zzso rather than the usual zzso zzso we report that discrete tumor zzso properties of zzso are zzso sensitive to the zzso of zzso We find that although the zzso zzso zzso zzso can no longer suppress zzso invasion or zzso to zzso transition zzso zzso zzso can still suppress zzso cell zzso This study illustrates that the manner in which protein zzso contributes to cancer is likely complex and highlights the need for careful interrogation as to how cell polarity protein zzso its secondary consequences, and the zzso that give rise to their zzso may contribute to specific aspects of cancer zzso
