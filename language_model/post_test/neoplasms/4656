In this zzso we discuss the zzso and pathological roles of zzso zzso zzso and its family, zzso proteins zzso in relation to prognosis of major zzso The number of reports on zzso family is zzso We have decided to review the articles that were recently published zzso past 5 zzso Experimental techniques in molecular biology have advanced surprisingly in the past zzso zzso the results of the studies are more zzso Most studies reached the same zzso a higher zzso or zzso expression is associated with a poor zzso zzso experiments have already started aiming for clinical application, and the results are zzso zzso zzso or zzso activities resulted in lower cell zzso in collagen gel and, moreover, succeeded in reducing zzso in zzso zzso family members were originally recognized as molecules that zzso collagen fibers in the zzso zzso Recent studies demonstrated that they are also involved in a phenomenon called zzso zzso Transition zzso This may affect cell movement and cancer cell zzso zzso and zzso are regulated by zzso a major factor in the failure of cancer zzso Here we discuss the molecular biology of the zzso family in relation to its role in tumor zzso
