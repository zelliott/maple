zzso variations in the zzso gene may increase cancer zzso by affecting the capacity for DNA zzso Several studies have investigated this zzso however, the conclusions remain zzso zzso we did a systematic review and executed a zzso to explore the zzso From 56 studies, a total of 61 comparisons included zzso cases and zzso controls concerning the zzso zzso zzso 35 comparisons included zzso cases and zzso controls in the case of zzso 312 zzso were zzso In this analysis, small associations of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with cancer risk for zzso cancer zzso zzso versus zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and acute zzso leukemia (for zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso Overall, individuals with the zzso zzso have a small cancer risk compared with zzso zzso for the reviewed cancer in total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but significant cancer risk was observed for the zzso zzso 312 zzso zzso in zzso cancer (for zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No significant associations were found for other zzso separately and all the reviewed cancer in total assessed for the zzso 312 zzso zzso Our study suggests that zzso is a candidate gene for cancer zzso regardless of environmental zzso
