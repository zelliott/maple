The unique characteristics of the zzso zzso such as short zzso simple molecular structure, and high copy number, have made monitoring zzso changes of zzso DNA zzso quantity an interesting molecular tool for early tumor detection with many advantages over the nuclear zzso zzso Recently, circulating zzso zzso zzso in blood has emerged on the platform as a zzso diagnostic and zzso zzso for many forms of solid zzso zzso evidence demonstrate that plasma or serum zzso zzso levels are significantly different between cancer patients and healthy zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso levels in circulation may assist in identifying patients from zzso healthy zzso This zzso attempts to zzso our recent findings in this very promising field of cancer zzso The potential technical challenges that we have encountered during the quantitative analysis of zzso zzso and zzso in general are also briefly zzso Prospective studies with a larger cohort of patients in various cancer entities are beneficial to precisely define the clinical importance of assessing the zzso zzso amount for diagnosing and tracking zzso diseases and their zzso
