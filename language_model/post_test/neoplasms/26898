zzso are dynamic zzso that occur in zzso cells and play important roles in cell division, zzso transport and zzso They form during the process of zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a significant and heavily researched molecular target for zzso zzso zzso are natural zzso that exhibit zzso properties in cultured cancer cells in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso that binds to zzso at the zzso site and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is currently in clinical trials as a zzso agent for cancer zzso Numerous series of zzso zzso have been studied in search of potent zzso agents with the requisite zzso zzso zzso agents include numerous zzso and zzso zzso and other synthetic zzso zzso zzso these agents are active in both tumor cells and immature zzso cells of tumor blood vessels, where they inhibit the process of zzso Recently, zzso virtual screening was used to select potent zzso zzso This review covers the role of zzso derivatives as a class of zzso agents that act by targeting zzso assembly zzso Additionally, we present the results of molecular modeling of their binding to specific sites on the zzso and zzso zzso This has enabled the zzso of the mechanism of zzso zzso and is useful in the design of novel agents with improved zzso zzso zzso agents are believed to have the potential to play a significant role in the fight against zzso
