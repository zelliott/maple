There have been considerable efforts to search for naturally occurring substances for the intervention of zzso Many components from dietary or medicinal plants have been identified that possess substantial zzso zzso zzso a yellow zzso from zzso zzso exhibits zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although its precise mode of action has not been zzso so far, studies have shown that zzso action of zzso might be due to its ability to induce zzso zzso cell zzso in cancer zzso This original study was conducted in order to estimate whether zzso enhances the radiation sensitivity of cancer zzso For this purpose, zzso zzso ranging from 0 to 200 zzso was applied to human cancer cell cultures zzso zzso and zzso with or without zzso zzso comprised between 0 and 8 zzso Cell proliferation was monitored by zzso blue zzso For the zzso of zzso changes in cell zzso and flow zzso analysis zzso content and presence of the zzso zzso were zzso zzso examination of the zzso cells (with zzso above 100 zzso showed a characteristic zzso of zzso Furthermore, cells treated with zzso exhibited a zzso peak from which the magnitude was zzso to the concentration of zzso zzso alone induced zzso and zzso of the three cell lines, zzso to the doses of zzso with a marked difference in radiation sensitivity between the cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, when radiation and zzso were applied together, our results showed that in zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a radiation zzso effect only at the dose of 200 zzso zzso This result may open a perspective of zzso therapy at the condition to also address the intrinsic toxicity of zzso on normal zzso
