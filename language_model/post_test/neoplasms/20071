Most studies characterizing zzso properties of zzso natural killer T zzso cells have used the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso strong, long-lasting zzso of zzso cells, which could be a major detriment for clinical zzso A novel zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso strong zzso immunity through a mechanism distinct from that of zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso was determined by ex zzso analysis of zzso from mice zzso with zzso cell zzso as well as in the zzso lung zzso in zzso tumor zzso 

zzso activated zzso cells without inducing long-term zzso The zzso of zzso induction correlated with a shortened duration of zzso zzso on zzso cells activated with zzso compared with zzso Moreover, whereas mice zzso with zzso were unable to respond to a second zzso stimulation to induce tumor protection for up to 2 months, mice zzso with zzso were protected from tumors by a second stimulation zzso to zzso zzso 

The lack of long-term functional zzso induced by zzso which allows for a second dose to still give therapeutic benefit, suggests the strong potential for this zzso cell zzso to succeed in settings where zzso has zzso
