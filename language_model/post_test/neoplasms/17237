Cancer has been increasingly recognized as a systems biology disease since many investigators have demonstrated that this zzso zzso emerges from abnormal zzso regulatory and zzso interactions induced by simultaneous structural and regulatory changes in multiple genes and zzso zzso the identification of zzso interactions and zzso signaling networks is crucial for better understanding zzso As experimental techniques for determining such interactions and signaling networks are zzso and zzso the development of a zzso approach capable to accomplish this task would be of great zzso For this purpose, we present here a novel zzso approach based on network zzso and machine learning capable to predict zzso interactions and extract relevant zzso signaling zzso from an integrated network of human genes interactions zzso This approach, called zzso is twofold: first, it assigns zzso scores to all interactions in the zzso and then these zzso scores are used as edge weights to extract zzso signaling zzso from zzso Regarding the prediction of zzso zzso we showed that zzso is able to recover zzso of known zzso interactions with a precision of zzso Moreover, the interactions that received high zzso scores are enriched in genes for which zzso have been zzso implicated in zzso We also demonstrated that zzso is potentially useful in zzso zzso signaling zzso more than zzso of constructed zzso contain more than 50% of original interactions in their corresponding zzso linear pathways present in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the potential zzso signaling zzso discovered by zzso are supported by experimental zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso can be a useful tool for investigators involved in cancer research interested in detecting signaling networks most prone to contribute with the emergence of zzso zzso
