zzso zzso zzso is associated with significant mortality and zzso The aim of the present study was to assess the long-term survival of patients with zzso and to assess zzso the mortality in these patients by comparing their survival with that of an zzso and zzso sample of the general zzso 

A retrospective zzso cohort study of adults with zzso as determined by the modified Duke criteria, was admitted to a zzso referral center between January 1998 and December zzso zzso survival was analyzed using the zzso zzso The zzso test was used to compare the different groups, and zzso Cox zzso hazards zzso analyses were carried out to identify zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 191 consecutive patients with zzso was evaluated zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso surgery was performed in zzso of cases, and the median follow up was zzso zzso The cumulative long-term survival was 59% after 10 years of follow up, the main causes of death being zzso heart failure zzso and different type of zzso zzso zzso and zzso survival in the general population was zzso zzso and zzso after follow up periods of one, five, and ten years, zzso The main predictor of long-term mortality was cancer, while surgery had a positive effect on long-term zzso 

Despite diagnostic and therapeutic advances, zzso is associated with a high long-term zzso Compared to the general Dutch population, the survival of patients with zzso was significantly zzso Even in the event of zzso being zzso the survival of these patients may be diminished compared to that of the general zzso zzso a careful follow up of these patients is zzso
