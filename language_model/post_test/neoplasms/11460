For the past 5 years, combined zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso has grown because the PET portion provides information that is very different from that zzso with other imaging zzso However, the paucity of zzso landmarks on PET images makes a consistent zzso zzso to zzso zzso data extremely zzso Clinical experience indicates a single zzso zzso of CT to PET improves specificity foremost, but also sensitivity, and the addition of PET to CT adds sensitivity and specificity in tumor zzso Thus, zzso is a more accurate test than either of its individual components and is probably also better than side-by-side viewing of images from both zzso The synergistic advantage of adding CT is that the zzso correction needed for PET can also be derived from the CT data, an advantage not zzso by zzso PET and magnetic resonance zzso This makes zzso zzso faster than PET alone with standard zzso methods, leading to higher patient zzso and a more comfortable examination, which typically last 30 minutes or zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to provide relevant information in the staging and therapy monitoring of many tumors, including lung zzso zzso zzso cancer, lymphoma, melanoma, and many others, with the notable exception of zzso zzso For zzso cancer, zzso derivatives may become useful zzso The published literature on the applications of zzso zzso in zzso is still zzso but several zzso studies have demonstrated the benefits of zzso
