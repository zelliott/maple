Human zzso cells that had grown out from a zzso zzso were examined for their responsiveness to putative zzso factors in a zzso zzso Among the factors zzso bovine brain zzso zzso growth factor zzso at 1 to 10 zzso significantly promoted DNA synthesis of the cells in the presence of 5 zzso zzso whereas type beta transforming growth factor inhibited it in a zzso zzso Fetal bovine serum at zzso inhibited DNA synthesis of the cells by approximately zzso but no significant influence was observed at higher zzso up to zzso zzso growth factor, bovine zzso zzso zzso and basic zzso exhibited no significant effect on DNA synthesis of the zzso The present result suggests that zzso zzso a known zzso for zzso cells, is also zzso for human zzso cells derived from zzso zzso
