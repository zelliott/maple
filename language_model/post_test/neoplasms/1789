Response rates for zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso are approximately zzso Higher doses of zzso have been recommended for susceptible zzso zzso zzso zzso we describe the outcome of 20 patients with solid tumors and zzso treated with high-dose zzso zzso at The University of Texas zzso Anderson Cancer Center zzso 

Patients were identified either by searching the zzso laboratory database or through direct referral from primary zzso services to the zzso Diseases zzso zzso A retrospective review of cases was zzso zzso was defined as zzso or zzso zzso 

Five patients were treated with 600 zzso whereas 15 patients received 800 zzso Only one patient was zzso The median zzso II score at the onset of zzso was 12 zzso zzso The most common species identified were zzso zzso zzso patients, zzso and zzso zzso zzso patients, zzso Of 19 patients whose quantitative data were available, eight zzso had high-grade zzso zzso or zzso colony forming units zzso Fifteen zzso of 18 zzso were zzso zzso and two (both zzso zzso were zzso resistant zzso 64 each) in zzso zzso patients zzso responded to zzso zzso The only zzso failure occurred in a patient with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The other patient with zzso zzso zzso zzso infection responded to zzso Central zzso zzso were removed from all patients with zzso or zzso zzso zzso All patients with high-grade zzso responded to zzso The median duration of zzso therapy was 16 zzso zzso zzso No significant toxicity zzso 

Although our data are zzso zzso appears to be well tolerated and may be associated with higher response rates than zzso zzso in a selected group of patients with solid tumors and zzso caused by species that are susceptible to this zzso
