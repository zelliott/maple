The problems of why zzso zzso develop zzso resistance to all available therapies, and how this might be zzso are the most pressing in cancer zzso It is likely that such resistance involves a combination of mechanisms including changes in drug zzso targets, reduction in the degree of drug-induced zzso loss, and increased rate of zzso zzso following zzso Current research must consider not only which mechanisms zzso eventually relating this to individual patients with cancer, but also what strategies might be zzso to counter each of the important resistance zzso A considerable amount of work has been devoted to the development of zzso of zzso transport proteins such as zzso which mediate drug zzso This work is now being zzso by approaches that target cell death pathways such as those zzso by release of zzso proteins and by zzso of surface receptors such as zzso Rapid progress has been made in developing zzso drugs that influence the rate of zzso for instance by binding to the zzso family of proteins regulating zzso zzso zzso approaches aimed at reducing zzso zzso and thus increasing the rate of cell death, are also showing zzso zzso of zzso zzso provides a further approach but has not received as much attention as other aspects of zzso zzso New therapeutic approaches will have to be zzso by improved diagnostic tests to evaluate the contributions of different resistance mechanisms in individual patients with zzso
