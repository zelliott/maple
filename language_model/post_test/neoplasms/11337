One third of all lethal zzso are associated with excessive zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso of its signaling components or by increased responsiveness of cells to the zzso zzso zzso signaling through the zzso zzso factors leads to increased cell proliferation by zzso of the zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso and by expression of S phase zzso In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the zzso zzso can integrate zzso signaling to zzso the activity of zzso Using zzso zzso cells, we show that zzso zzso acting through protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fully stimulate the zzso activity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso as assessed by zzso reporter zzso and induce the expression of zzso zzso and zzso target zzso as assessed by reverse zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso by Sonic zzso also requires zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of activated zzso and zzso or zzso induced a zzso synergistic increase in zzso activity that was totally blocked by zzso The zzso region of zzso zzso acids zzso is required for sensing the zzso pathway, as deletion of this domain produces active zzso protein with greatly reduced response to zzso by zzso Basic zzso growth factor zzso of the zzso zzso also zzso zzso activity through its zzso zzso Our results identify zzso and zzso as essential, positive regulators of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, our findings suggest that tumors with zzso zzso and zzso zzso to stimulate cell proliferation zzso
