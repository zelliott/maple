Clinical and experimental results with zzso and chemotherapy for the treatment of cancer emphasize the necessity of giving treatment with both zzso with the greatest intensity possible in the initial phase of induction zzso This can best be accomplished by utilizing new approaches, such as alternating the chemotherapy with newer methods of delivery of zzso which has the potential for greater destruction of tumor within acceptable limits of host zzso The clinical data from Institut Gustave zzso zzso shows that alternating chemotherapy and zzso produced an excellent complete response rate of zzso and a 4 year zzso survival rate of zzso in 109 patients with limited small cell lung zzso Based on 5 year survival criteria, approximately zzso of the patients can be considered cured in 1 more year if no further change zzso The results of the University of Virginia experimental studies have also demonstrated the superiority of alternating zzso and zzso in three courses of induction therapy over conventional methods of delivery of the two zzso Using the experimental solid tumor zzso a cure rate of 50% or greater was obtained with this protocol with acceptable toxicity to the host, as opposed to no cures from three or more courses of either zzso zzso One of the major zzso to tumor cure with zzso chemotherapy and zzso has been excessive zzso which can be avoided by zzso separation zzso 7 zzso of the delivery of the two zzso without a significant loss of therapeutic zzso zzso clinical protocols to determine how to more effectively interact chemotherapy with zzso offer some of the greatest potential for a more rapid improvement in zzso
