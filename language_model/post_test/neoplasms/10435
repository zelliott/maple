A prevailing paradigm zzso that zzso Group zzso proteins maintain stem cell identity by zzso differentiation zzso and abundant evidence points to an zzso role for zzso proteins in human zzso Here we show using zzso zzso that a conventional zzso complex can also have a potent tumor zzso zzso zzso in any core zzso component cause pronounced zzso of eye zzso zzso accompanied by deregulation of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is strongly and specifically activated in zzso zzso zzso is driven by zzso zzso of zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso family zzso We show here that zzso genes are direct targets of zzso repression in zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is sufficient to induce zzso whereas reduction of zzso activity suppresses the zzso zzso tumor zzso These findings show that zzso proteins can restrict growth directly by zzso zzso signaling zzso shedding light on an zzso mechanism underlying tumor zzso
