Data regarding the risk of gastrointestinal and zzso zzso in Crohn's disease zzso and zzso colitis zzso are needed to understand the clinical course of inflammatory zzso diseases zzso and their zzso 

We performed a nationwide historical cohort study using Danish health care zzso We identified patients with a diagnosis of CD or zzso recorded from 1978 through 2010, and followed them up until the first occurrence of cancer, death, or zzso We used standardized zzso ratios zzso to compare cancer zzso in CD and UC patients with that expected in the general zzso 

Excluding zzso diagnosed within 1 year of zzso diagnosis, zzso cases of invasive cancer occurred among zzso patients with CD zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso occurred among zzso patients with UC zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CD was associated zzso with gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the strongest associations for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between UC and gastrointestinal and zzso zzso were weaker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative risk of zzso zzso among patients with zzso was relatively stable over time, although the risk of gastrointestinal zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso particularly CD, are at increased risk for gastrointestinal and zzso zzso The relative risk of gastrointestinal zzso has decreased since 1978, without a zzso increase in the risk of zzso zzso
