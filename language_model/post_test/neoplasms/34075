The fact that zzso zzso the degradation products of the zzso zzso protein zzso are zzso for numerous cell types, promote cell cycle progression and induce release of zzso zzso by zzso and cancer cells, strongly suggests that their presence in zzso could contribute to zzso zzso Thus, zzso peptides qualify as zzso zzso peptides originating from the fragmentation of zzso proteins and presenting biological zzso After a brief description of their origin, the biological activities of these peptides are zzso zzso their potential role in zzso The nature of their zzso and the zzso events it controls are also zzso Finally, the structural selectivity of the zzso complex zzso is zzso leading to the concept of zzso zzso originating from zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides presenting a zzso similar to that of zzso zzso peptides and mimicking their zzso
