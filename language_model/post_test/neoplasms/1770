zzso of steady state during indirect zzso zzso of resting energy expenditure zzso is necessary to reduce error and ensure accuracy in the zzso Steady state is often defined as 5 consecutive zzso zzso zzso during which oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production vary by zzso These criteria, however, are stringent and often difficult to zzso This study aimed to assess whether reducing the time period for steady state zzso SS or zzso zzso produced zzso of zzso that were significantly different from zzso zzso zzso was measured with the use of zzso indirect zzso in 39 subjects, of whom only 21 zzso met the zzso SS zzso In these 21 subjects, median biases in zzso between zzso SS and zzso SS and between zzso SS and zzso SS were zzso and zzso zzso For individuals, zzso SS measured zzso within a clinically acceptable range of zzso of zzso zzso whereas zzso SS measured zzso within a range of zzso of zzso zzso zzso prediction equations estimated zzso for individuals within zzso of zzso zzso zzso the time period of steady state to 4 zzso produced zzso of zzso for individuals that were within clinically acceptable, predetermined zzso The limits of agreement for zzso SS fell outside the zzso limits of zzso however, both zzso SS and zzso SS criteria greatly increased the proportion of subjects who satisfied steady state within smaller limits than would be achieved if relying on prediction zzso
