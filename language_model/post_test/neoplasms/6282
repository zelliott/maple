zzso zzso and zzso zzso transitions occur in the development of human zzso and are part of the natural history of the process to adapt to the changing zzso In this setting, the zzso family is recognized as a master regulator of the zzso zzso by targeting zzso and zzso two important zzso zzso of the cell adherence zzso and polarity zzso and zzso zzso Recently, the putative DNA zzso associated zzso of various zzso members has been described in zzso zzso we show that the zzso and zzso transcripts undergo a dynamic zzso regulation linked to zzso or zzso zzso in tumor zzso The zzso islands of both zzso zzso were found zzso and coupled to the expression of the corresponding zzso in human cancer cell lines with zzso features, such as low levels of zzso and high expression of zzso zzso and zzso while zzso island zzso zzso was observed in transformed cells with zzso zzso The recovery of zzso and zzso expression by stable zzso in the zzso cells restored the zzso markers and inhibited migration in cell culture and zzso growth and zzso formation in nude zzso We also discovered, using both cell culture and animal models, that the zzso zzso zzso is not an zzso and fixed process but it can be shifted to zzso or zzso zzso island status corresponding to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso In fact, careful laser zzso in human primary zzso zzso unveiled that in normal colon zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso already are zzso and zzso at these zzso zzso and that the zzso tumors undergo selective zzso zzso of their zzso zzso These findings indicate that the zzso zzso plasticity of the zzso family contributes to the evolving and adapting zzso of human zzso
