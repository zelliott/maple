How a cancer is initiated and established remains elusive despite all the advances in decades of cancer zzso Recently the cancer stem cell zzso hypothesis has been revived, challenging the long-standing model of zzso zzso for cancer development and implicating the zzso of a potential cure for cancer zzso The recent identification of zzso stem cells zzso in cancer, an early stage of zzso development, however, implicates that the zzso zzso is not contradictory to the zzso hypothesis, but is rather an aspect of the process of zzso development zzso The discovery of zzso has revealed and will continue to reveal the volatile properties of zzso with respects to their zzso differentiation and zzso capacity during initiation and zzso Both zzso and zzso might also serve as precursors of tumor zzso components such as tumor zzso zzso cells zzso Thus, the zzso hypothesis covers the developing process of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer, a cellular process that should parallel the zzso process of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The embryonic stem zzso cell and zzso stem zzso cell genes are zzso in zzso Especially the zzso cell protein zzso may play an important role during the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and this protein may be used as a common zzso for early zzso zzso and treatment of zzso As cancer stem cell research is yet in its zzso definitive conclusions regarding the role of zzso can not be made at this zzso However this review will discuss what we have learned from zzso and how this has led to innovative ideas that may eventually have major impacts on the understanding and treatment of zzso
