A new approach to the treatment of various zzso zzso and associated genetic and zzso zzso for example, infectious DNA or zzso induced diseases is proposed utilizing zzso and frequency modulated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a general expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and associated quantum genetic zzso such as zzso associated zzso viral zzso acids and growth factors, may be induced zzso into zzso and zzso states based upon various quantum phenomena zzso new zzso techniques in zzso zzso to zzso cancer and zzso zzso A specific mathematical framework is presented by which to determine the appropriate zzso zzso (from about 4 zzso zzso zzso to about 4 zzso zzso zzso and frequency (from about zzso to zzso zzso to subject biological systems zzso zzso atomic crystal lattice structures to zzso extensions of zzso zzso and atomic magnetic zzso which are vital to zzso and zzso
