zzso organisms depend on an intricate and evolutionary zzso cell cycle to control cell zzso The cell cycle is regulated by a number of important protein families which are common targets for zzso zzso or zzso in human zzso The zzso D and E families and their zzso zzso partners initiate the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso protein and subsequent transition through the cell zzso zzso activity and therefore control of cell division is restrained by two families of zzso dependent zzso zzso A greater understanding of the cell cycle has led to the development of a number of compounds with the potential to restore control of cell division in human zzso This review will introduce the protein families that regulate the cell cycle, their aberrations in zzso progression and pharmacological strategies targeting this important zzso
