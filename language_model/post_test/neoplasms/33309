zzso regulation of gene zzso has recently been the subject of a fast growing interest particularly in the field of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso groups of zzso zzso from zzso zzso represents major molecular zzso mechanisms controlling gene zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso represent the two families of zzso in charge of the control of the level of zzso of the zzso zzso By removing the zzso groups that abrogate the positive charge of the zzso zzso that maintain the zzso tails attached to DNA, zzso repress zzso In zzso these latter zzso form three groups of related zzso based on their sequence zzso and are classified as zzso I, II and zzso Global zzso of the zzso I and II groups results in cell growth arrest and zzso of cancer cells and alters tumor growth in in zzso experimental zzso Their surprisingly low general toxicity and their impressive efficiency in zzso cancer models has led to consider zzso zzso as very promising new zzso pharmacological zzso In this review, we attempt to give a comprehensive overview of the role and the involvement of zzso in zzso as well as the current progress on the development of zzso general and specific zzso as new cancer zzso
