Members of the zzso zzso family of proteins are involved in multiple aspects of cell migration by acting both as zzso between the zzso receptors and the zzso zzso and as regulators of zzso molecules that are implicated in cell zzso cell polarity and zzso zzso evidence suggests that the regulation of cell zzso and the zzso by zzso proteins is crucial during cancer zzso Thus, both their expression levels and zzso zzso would affect zzso zzso High expression of zzso proteins has been shown in a variety of zzso zzso of zzso proteins reduces the ability of cells to form zzso contacts and, therefore, promotes an invasive zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso proteins zzso the formation of zzso complexes and alters the transmission of signals in response to growth factors, thereby zzso zzso zzso In this Commentary, we address the structure, function and regulation of zzso proteins under normal zzso conditions as well as in cancer zzso with particular emphasis on zzso of zzso origin, such as those from breast, lung and zzso We also discuss any recent developments that have added to the understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms and zzso pathways these proteins are involved in during cancer zzso
