A new zzso zzso zzso zzso device using an zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso This paper reports the evaluation of the heating characteristics of the zzso using a computer simulation and clinical zzso parameters obtained during treatment of superficial and zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso is a zzso square zzso zzso whose bottom plate is set to face the heating zzso The zzso has advantages over zzso zzso heating, such zzso generating less heat in the subcutaneous fat zzso less zzso of electric line of force at the edge of the zzso and no physical contact with the target zzso The induced magnetic fields and electrical currents within the heating substance are simulated using zzso design software for zzso zzso A total of 40 superficial and subsurface zzso are treated with the zzso zzso zzso is performed continuously for 110 sessions using zzso zzso of an optical zzso zzso parameters zzso zzso zzso are assessed based on the zzso size and zzso The treated zzso are zzso into three groups according to zzso zzso group 1 zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso group 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and group 3 zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso The computer simulation shows that induced electrical currents run without zzso parallel to the surface of the heating zzso All zzso parameters of group 3 are significantly higher than those of group 1 and 2 zzso zzso zzso indicating that the larger zzso tend to zzso a higher temperature zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso zzso using the zzso results in effective temperature zzso in superficial and subsurface zzso with large zzso being most effectively zzso
