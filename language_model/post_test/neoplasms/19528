Over the past decade, zzso zzso zzso have been used extensively in the context of cancer gene zzso Two basic strategies have been pursued for the use of Ad zzso in cancer gene therapy: 1) approaches aimed at direct tumor cell killing through delivery of replicating zzso viruses or zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso suicide genes or zzso zzso and 2) zzso approaches aimed at inducing host zzso immune responses that can destroy tumor cells at both primary and zzso zzso Both strategies offer the potential of selective tumor cell destruction without damage to normal zzso zzso zzso and clinical studies have been conducted based on these zzso zzso results have been obtained but robust clinical efficacy remains zzso Several obstacles limiting the therapeutic activity of Ad zzso have been encountered, including efficiency of tumor cell zzso and zzso of efficacy by zzso host immune zzso However, expanding knowledge in the areas of Ad biology and tumor biology continues to lead to increasingly sophisticated approaches to address these zzso A review of various zzso cancer gene therapy approaches and recent progress in the area are presented zzso
