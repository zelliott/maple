During the past two decades, the zzso of zinc for man has been zzso zzso of zinc in man due to nutritional factors and several diseased states has been zzso High zzso content of cereal proteins decreases availability of zzso thus the prevalence of zinc zzso is likely to be high in a population zzso mainly on cereal zzso zzso is known to cause zzso and thus may play a role in producing zinc zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the liver, chronic zzso disease and other chronically debilitating diseases may similarly induce zinc zzso in human zzso A severe zzso of zinc has recently been recognized to occur in patients with zzso cell anemia and a beneficial effect of zinc therapy in such patients has been zzso Growth zzso male zzso skin changes, poor zzso mental lethargy and delayed wound healing are some of the manifestations of chronically zzso human zzso Taste zzso zzso with zinc zzso have been observed in zzso zzso Recently, abnormal dark adaptation related to zinc zzso in patients with zzso of the liver and zzso cell disease has been zzso In severely zzso patients, zzso manifestations, zzso zzso mental disturbances and zzso infections predominate and if zzso the condition becomes zzso zzso zzso is known to affect zzso functions adversely in man and zzso This effect of zinc is at the end organ level and it appears that zinc is essential for zzso and testosterone zzso zzso is involved in many zzso zzso Several zinc zzso have been recognized in the past zzso zzso is required for each step of cell cycle in zzso and is essential for DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from various sources and zzso DNA zzso from viruses have been shown to be zzso zzso zzso also regulates the activity of zzso thus the zzso of zzso appears to be zzso The effect of zinc on protein synthesis may be attributable to its vital role in zzso acid zzso The activities of many zzso zzso have been shown to be affected adversely in zzso zzso Three zzso alkaline zzso zzso and zzso zzso appear to be most sensitive to zinc restriction in that their activities are affected adversely within three to six days of institution of a zzso diet to experimental zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
