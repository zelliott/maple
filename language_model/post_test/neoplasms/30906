The two zzso zzso genes that are most commonly zzso in human cancer are the zzso gene on zzso 17 and the zzso zzso gene on zzso zzso Recent studies of both gene products suggest that they are able to act as powerful negative regulators of cell zzso The zzso gene seems to exert this activity by physically zzso to a variety of specific zzso factors and zzso their zzso The capacity of zzso protein to bind these factors is regulated by zzso The zzso protein can therefore be seen to act as a zzso for these zzso The zzso protein also may act in part by regulating zzso but may also interact directly with the DNA replication zzso The growth zzso function of zzso is induced by DNA damage leading to an attractive model of zzso as an essential checkpoint zzso The zzso protein interacts with members of the zzso zzso family which we now show can regulate its zzso
