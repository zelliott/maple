Many zzso demonstrate both qualitative and quantitative species differences in zzso Since many zzso must be zzso to zzso zzso to elicit their zzso effects, the observed species differences may have a zzso zzso A number of examples exist that support the concept that zzso differences are the underlying cause of species variation in zzso Such differences are most often of a quantitative nature, but qualitative differences in zzso may also be due to differences in rates and/or pathways between zzso There are also many instances in which there is no clear evidence that metabolism explains species differences in zzso zzso studies are often performed at much higher doses than those encountered by zzso Since zzso processes may become saturated at high tissue zzso the rates and pathways of zzso zzso and zzso may be different at high doses from those at lower zzso Such zzso variation can lead to differences in target tissue doses, resulting in altered tissue responses at high doses in relation to lower zzso In situations in which no zzso of the zzso pathways occurs, tissue zzso are zzso to the administered zzso Scaling of doses from those used in experimental animals to those experienced by humans has often involved simple conversion factors, such as body weight or surface zzso Since the reactions involved in zzso metabolism may differ both for high and low doses and for various species, much more realistic extrapolations from animal to human can be obtained using zzso based kinetic zzso The metabolism of zzso in humans shows large zzso variation, which in turn may be reflected in differences in individual zzso The occurrence of genetic zzso in zzso zzso zzso indicates that zzso of the population may experience zzso risks distinctly different from those of the rest of the zzso
