In this review article we present basic principles of zzso induced heat generation of magnetic zzso for application in magnetic particle zzso After explanation of heating mechanisms, the role of zzso as well as zzso interactions is discussed with respect to achievable heating power of the particles inside the zzso On the basis of heat transfer theory at the zzso the balance between generated and dissipated heat inside the zzso and the resulting damaging effects for biological tissue is zzso The heating zzso as a function of zzso size is examined in combination with feasible field strength and zzso zzso calculations and experimental investigations are used to show the lower zzso size limit for zzso heating to zzso suitable zzso In zzso this article illuminates practical aspects, limitations, and the state of the art for the application of magnetic heating in magnetic particle zzso as zzso treatment of small zzso
