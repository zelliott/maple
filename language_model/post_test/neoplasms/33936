In the present study, a series of 32 zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were prepared and evaluated for their in zzso zzso to zzso gap zzso zzso communication zzso and to activate the zzso hydrocarbon zzso zzso and the zzso zzso alpha zzso in well-established liver and zzso cell zzso The rat liver zzso cell line zzso was used for in zzso determination of zzso zzso the zzso activity was determined in the rat zzso zzso cells zzso zzso with a zzso reporter zzso zzso activity was measured in two breast zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso under the control of zzso responsive zzso Acute zzso of zzso potentially associated with tumor promotion, was detected after treatment with all zzso under study, with the persistent zzso being the strongest zzso Several compounds were found to significantly induce the zzso activity, including zzso 79, a zzso of zzso 77, and zzso and zzso and zzso Low molecular weight zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso significant zzso activity and zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso determined in the presence of zzso were found for persistent zzso zzso zzso zzso and some low zzso zzso zzso However, no apparent association between induction of zzso activity and zzso was zzso The majority of the zzso suppressed the zzso response only at zzso zzso zzso rank correlations were calculated for these biological data and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso volume, zzso log D, and zzso zzso zzso correlations were found between potency to zzso zzso and log P and zzso volume (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso effects were also zzso correlated with zzso and zzso zzso No significant correlations among other biological end points and the zzso zzso were observed for the entire set of zzso These results show that zzso zzso zzso are capable of multiple adverse effects, including gap junction zzso zzso activity, and zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso represents a novel mode of action of both the lower zzso and the zzso high molecular weight zzso
