Experimental studies support the zzso effect of zzso but several clinical studies have reported contradictory zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether a low zzso zzso concentration is related to mortality from major causes of death, especially zzso 

The subjects were zzso participants zzso men and zzso zzso from a zzso zzso cohort study in Japan (The zzso Medical School cohort zzso The average age at registration was zzso years, and the median observation period was zzso zzso As the estimated hazard ratio was high for both the low and very high zzso levels, we defined two zzso groups: a low zzso group zzso zzso and an zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso Participants who died from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cardiovascular disease zzso or other causes zzso during the observation period were zzso 

zzso zzso plots showed higher cumulative death rates for the low zzso group than for the zzso zzso group for zzso cancer, and zzso deaths zzso p zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso Cox zzso hazards analyses with the sex and age of the participants, body mass index, and smoking and drinking histories as zzso showed that a low zzso level was a significant risk for zzso cancer, and zzso deaths zzso p zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso The hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso of a low zzso level for cancer deaths was almost the same as that for a male sex zzso zzso 

This is the first report to describe the association between a low zzso level and zzso or cancer death, supporting the zzso effect of zzso Further zzso studies are needed to confirm the present zzso
