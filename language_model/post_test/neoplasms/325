The grave prognosis associated with zzso zzso occurring in zzso patients with cancer suggests that zzso zzso are frequently zzso We have evaluated 67 episodes of zzso zzso studied in four consecutive zzso trials, in order to correlate zzso zzso of zzso These patients had a median absolute zzso count of zzso at the time of zzso zzso zzso regimens were begun at the first evidence of suspected zzso zzso zzso were employed only as clinically indicated by inadequate patient response to zzso zzso Among the 29 patients who had an increase in their zzso count of greater than or equal to zzso over the subsequent 14 days, 27 zzso per zzso recovered whereas among 38 patients who had no appreciable increase in their zzso count, 21 (55 per zzso improved zzso zzso zzso In this latter group of patients with no zzso recovery, the zzso of the zzso to the initial zzso zzso regimen was of major zzso None of four patients responded when the pathogen was resistant to both antibiotics initially zzso six of 14 (44 per zzso patients responded when there was zzso to one antibiotic, and 15 of 20 (75 per zzso patients responded when there was zzso to both antibiotics zzso less than zzso We conclude that patients with zzso zzso and persistent zzso will often respond to zzso therapy alone provided the initial choice of zzso antibiotics is appropriate and that their use is instituted zzso zzso zzso need not be added unless clinical evaluation indicates inadequate zzso
