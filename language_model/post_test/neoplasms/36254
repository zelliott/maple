The human zzso zzso E6 zzso is fundamental to the ability of these viruses to induce human zzso A defining characteristic of the zzso E6 zzso found in zzso zzso types is the presence of a zzso binding motif at their extreme zzso Through this zzso E6 is able to interact with a large number of cellular proteins that contain zzso zzso Many of these cellular proteins are involved in regulation of processes associated with the control of cell attachment, cell zzso cell polarity and cell zzso How E6 targets multiple proteins containing the same recognition domain is still an open zzso In this review, we highlight aspects of E6 function and biology that help to answer this question, and thereby provide insight into the role of these zzso during development of zzso zzso
