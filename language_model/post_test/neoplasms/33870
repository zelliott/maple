The authors compared approaches to participants and methods of collecting zzso cell samples by mail in the Black Women's Health zzso a follow-up study of geographically dispersed African-American zzso Outcomes of interest were within group participation rates, yield of DNA, and zzso zzso 

Six hundred fifty six participants were zzso to four groups: Groups 1 and 2 used the cheek zzso method and Groups 3 and 4 used the zzso zzso zzso Groups 1 and 3 were mailed collection kits together with consent forms, whereas Groups 2 and 4 were mailed a kit only after returning a signed zzso 

Participation rates were similar regardless of the method used for sample collection or mailing of the zzso samples were returned by zzso of Group 1, 37% of Group 2, zzso of Group 3, and zzso of Group zzso The median DNA yield was zzso zzso for the zzso method and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso method zzso zzso analyses were successful in zzso of zzso samples and zzso of zzso zzso 

Because of its higher yield of DNA, the zzso zzso method is preferable for collection of zzso cell samples by zzso
