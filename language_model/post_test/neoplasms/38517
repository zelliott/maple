zzso are benign zzso tumors that form during an abnormal zzso process in genetically susceptible zzso Although growth of normal and zzso cells did not differ in medium containing zzso zzso fetal bovine serum, zzso cultures grew to significantly higher zzso than normal cells in medium containing zzso zzso plasma or zzso fetal bovine zzso zzso medium from zzso cultures did not stimulate growth of normal cells in plasma nor did it contain zzso zzso growth factor or zzso growth zzso zzso zzso responded differently than normal adult zzso to transforming growth factor zzso Whereas transforming growth factor beta reduced growth stimulation by zzso growth factor in cells from normal adult skin or zzso it enhanced the activity of zzso growth factor in cells from zzso zzso and zzso zzso also responded differently to zzso growth was zzso in normal adult cells and unaffected or inhibited in zzso zzso Fetal zzso resembled zzso cells in their ability to grow in plasma and in their response to zzso The ability of zzso zzso to grow to higher cell zzso in zzso medium than cells from normal adult skin or from normal early or mature scars suggests that a reduced dependence on serum growth factors may account for their prolonged growth in zzso zzso between zzso and fetal cells suggest that zzso may result from the untimely expression of a zzso mechanism that is zzso zzso
