zzso zzso zzso zzso alone or in combination with computer zzso zzso is increasingly used in target volume zzso A standardized way of converting PET signals into target volumes is not available at zzso 

Assuming a uniform signal zzso from a zzso and surrounding normal zzso a zzso method was developed to determine a relative threshold level zzso for gross zzso volume zzso Two zzso consisting of zzso and zzso sources of diameter ranging from zzso to 43 zzso in a tank and zzso activities ranging from zzso to zzso zzso for tank and sources, respectively, were used for zzso zzso A zzso was calculated that best corresponded to the physical diameter of the zzso zzso Software zzso was generated to automatically delineate volumes based on this zzso The SW was validated for in zzso and in zzso PET zzso 

The zzso best representing the source diameter was zzso zzso confidence zzso of the zzso zzso The mean zzso for sources of diameter zzso or zzso zzso was zzso or zzso zzso The zzso was constant for diameters zzso or zzso zzso For source diameters zzso zzso the zzso level zzso the real source diameter by a factor depending on the zzso In an in zzso zzso the SW was capable of zzso solitary PET volumes to within zzso zzso zzso For zzso signals in a clinical zzso minimal manual intervention is presently required to separate target from zzso zzso The SW may slightly underestimate target volumes when compared with zzso volumes, but works well as a first zzso The volume can be manually adapted to give the ultimate target zzso 

zzso automatic zzso of the volume of zzso activity is feasible and highly zzso Volumes can be subsequently modified by the zzso if zzso This approach will increase the efficiency of the planning zzso
