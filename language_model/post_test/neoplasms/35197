zzso killer cells zzso zzso are potent zzso of adoptive zzso in advanced cancer zzso We have undertaken fundamental experiments and a clinical pilot study in order to search for an efficient way of applying this zzso zzso of zzso zzso Human peripheral blood zzso were zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso The main activity was located in the zzso fraction (less than zzso zzso which corresponded to the zzso zzso However, the behavior of zzso cells against zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso was quite different from that of zzso zzso zzso cells are resistant to zzso zzso and are zzso to zzso zzso zzso opposite to the behavior of zzso All the zzso sorted by zzso using zzso and zzso expressed zzso zzso This phenomenon was missed because zzso cells are sensitive to zzso which is usually contained in buffers of zzso and in the running solution of cell zzso zzso zzso The side effects and efficacy of zzso transfer were evaluated using zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso No side effects were observed and significant efficacy was obtained in mice whose tumors were located in the lung or abdominal zzso Human pilot zzso The pilot study was conducted in 25 patients with advanced zzso zzso efficacy was obtained in patients for whom local transfer was undertaken rather than systemic zzso
