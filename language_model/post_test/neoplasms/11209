To examine whether patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso undergo cancer screening according to established guidelines, to compare their reported screening practices with information from the general population, and to examine potential zzso of screening within our zzso zzso 

We conducted a patient survey of cancer screening practices within the Montreal General Hospital lupus zzso We compared zzso frequency of cancer screening to guidelines suggested for the general population, and to figures for cancer screening reported in the general zzso We also developed zzso zzso models to establish potential zzso of screening for patients with zzso with cervical cancer screening being the outcome of interest in our primary zzso 

Of 48 women aged zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso had had a mammogram in the past 12 months, compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso for similarly aged Quebec zzso Of 51 subjects aged 50 and older, only zzso zzso zzso zzso reported screening zzso zzso blood check with or without zzso within the recommended time frame, compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso screening for persons zzso 50 in the general zzso Only 9 of 27 patients with zzso aged less than 30 had Pap tests in the past 12 months zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with a general population rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso for similarly aged Quebec zzso Our zzso zzso model suggested that, among the zzso patients, zzso those with lower education, and those with higher disease damage scores were less likely to undergo cervical Pap zzso 

These data suggest that appropriate cancer screening may be overlooked in patients with zzso
