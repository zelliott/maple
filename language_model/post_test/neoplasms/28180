The characteristics of specific binding of human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of sites and their zzso and proliferation responses to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso truncated zzso analogue zzso were determined in cultured human zzso and in zzso zzso zzso The cells were zzso with zzso zzso of human zzso or its truncated analogue zzso After zzso (2 zzso both peptides induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso This process was specific for zzso zzso receptors and was much more intensive in zzso zzso zzso acting mostly through its zzso induced nearly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso a wide spectrum protein zzso zzso significantly reduced, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso attenuated the zzso of zzso receptors induced by zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso receptors was prevented by zzso of the cells with the zzso zzso blocker zzso The zzso cell proliferation was attenuated by zzso of the cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and it was only partially reduced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
