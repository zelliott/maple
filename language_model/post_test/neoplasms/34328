The results of basic research of proliferation zzso and zzso as well as comparative clinical studies led to the development of therapeutic principles for zzso zzso Thus zzso is to be preferred to zzso in most types of zzso To prevent primary resistance only those zzso should be combined which have been proved effective or could be expected to be effective zzso The relative cell cycle specificity of zzso should be taken into account by combination of drugs acting at different zzso of the tumor cell zzso The different growth behavior of tumor and normal zzso suggest the use of intermittent zzso therapy for the zzso of normal tissue in the zzso zzso
