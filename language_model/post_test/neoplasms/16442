To investigate the role of achieved age in father or mother for long-term prognosis in men with respect to fatal and nonfatal coronary events, and mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all zzso 

Prospective follow-up zzso 

City of zzso zzso 

A total of zzso men aged zzso out of zzso men who took part in the second screening of the zzso Prevention Study in zzso and who had stated the age of both mother and father at death, or their current age, if they were still zzso 

zzso and nonfatal coronary events, and mortality from cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all causes during follow-up until zzso 

Of the men zzso whose father had died before the age of 70, zzso per 1000 observation years died from coronary disease during zzso zzso mortality decreased continuously with increasing age in the father and in those whose father had achieved an age of 90 or more zzso per 1000 years died zzso ratio zzso after adjustment for coronary risk factors, zzso status, and history of zzso zzso in either parent, zzso zzso zzso zzso P for trend zzso This was reflected in reduced risk of mortality from any cause zzso for trend after adjustment zzso No association with cancer death was zzso With respect to hospitalization for zzso zzso men whose father had survived to at least 90 had an adjusted zzso of zzso zzso compared with men whose father died before 70 zzso for trend zzso The effect of achieved age in the mother was weaker and after adjustment trends were zzso significant for death from cardiovascular and all causes zzso and zzso respectively), but not for any other zzso 

zzso but not zzso longevity appears to protect against coronary disease, by mechanisms that are largely zzso
