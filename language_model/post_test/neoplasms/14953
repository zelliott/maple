In recent years, the relevance of vitamin D zzso zzso gene restriction zzso length zzso for various types of cancer has been investigated by a great number of zzso It has been hypothesized that zzso zzso may influence both the risk of cancer occurrence and zzso However, studies investigating the associations between specific zzso zzso and cancer often show controversial zzso We have now performed a systematic review of the literature to zzso the relevance of zzso zzso for individual zzso including cancer of the skin, zzso breast, zzso zzso kidney and zzso 

An analysis of studies evaluating the association between vitamin D zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as some zzso combinations and cancer risk has been zzso Data were extracted from zzso using the key words zzso zzso in combination with breast cancer, prostate cancer, skin cancer, zzso cancer, zzso cancer, zzso cell zzso or zzso zzso 

This analysis was performed with the intent of giving an up-to-date overview of all data concerning the relevance of zzso zzso for zzso Obviously, at present it is still not possible to make any definitive statements about the importance of the zzso zzso for cancer zzso It seems probable that interactions with other factors such as calcium and vitamin D zzso zzso plasma levels and zzso radiation exposure play a decisive role in cancer occurrence and should not be zzso Other risk factors such as zzso smoking status, parity status, energy intake and others are also frequently mentioned as being more or less important for zzso depending on the zzso zzso Moreover, it is often noticed that the same zzso zzso has a different effect depending on the type of cancer, or may be only decisive for more or less aggressive staging of the zzso 

zzso associations with zzso zzso have been reported in cancer of the breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso skin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso However, conflicting data have been reported for most zzso After careful evaluation of the actual literature, it can be summarized that data indicating an association of zzso zzso and cancer risk are strongest for breast cancer zzso zzso prostate cancer zzso and zzso melanoma zzso zzso Data indicating an association of zzso zzso and cancer prognosis are strongest for prostate cancer zzso breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso
