The purpose of this study was to assess the feasibility of administering zzso an zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso gene to patients with advanced zzso characterize the pertinent zzso zzso identify evidence of viral zzso in both normal and tumor zzso and seek evidence of zzso zzso 

Patients were treated with escalating doses of zzso zzso over 30 minutes on days 1, 2, and 3, every 28 zzso The clearance of circulating zzso zzso zzso DNA was characterized in the plasma and paired tumor and skin zzso were performed in patients treated at the two highest dose levels to assess zzso zzso into zzso 

zzso patients received 36 courses of zzso at doses ranging from 3 zzso zzso to 3 zzso zzso virus particles zzso zzso zzso zzso and fever were common, but rarely zzso zzso of zzso zzso including decreases in zzso and increases in zzso degradation products at 3 zzso zzso precluded additional dose zzso zzso DNA could be detected in the plasma by zzso chain reaction zzso in the majority of patients at 14 days and 28 days at doses of 3 zzso zzso and zzso Six patients treated at 1 zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso dose levels had zzso DNA detected within paired tumor tissue collected day zzso 

zzso can be safely and zzso administered up to 1 zzso zzso zzso daily for 3 consecutive zzso The absence of severe zzso the presence of circulating zzso 24 hours after administration, and zzso zzso zzso within tumor tissue distant from the site of administration demonstrates that systemic therapy with this zzso zzso containing zzso is zzso
