As a consequence of the dramatic progress that has been made in recent years towards zzso the diverse molecular events involved in the development and zzso of zzso disease, there is now no shortage of genes that can be exploited or targeted in the context of cancer gene zzso Many of these have been shown to be effective both in zzso and in various animal models, and a number have progressed to the zzso The results of these later studies, although generally encouraging, are perhaps less dramatic than one might have zzso Although a number of factors undoubtedly contribute to this finding, it is evident that a major reason relates to the difficulties implicit in achieving efficient in zzso gene transfer, particularly in a clinical zzso zzso gene therapy, not to the zzso population, but instead to the zzso upon which the survival and growth of a zzso depends constitutes an alternative approach that overcomes some of the delivery problems associated with established zzso zzso zzso
