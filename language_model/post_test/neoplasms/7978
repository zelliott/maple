zzso from cancer patients exhibited up to fivefold higher zzso zzso activities than control zzso from normal subjects and also similarly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso was used instead of free zzso zzso the zzso was dependent on zzso zzso zzso This was reflected in the zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso appeared to be zzso upon incubation with free zzso zzso the zzso associated with zzso was located in nearly equal parts in zzso and plasma zzso Part of zzso zzso binding to the membrane was zzso as indicated by its resistance to zzso zzso A zzso with zzso zzso depressed subsequent zzso zzso zzso activity and binding of zzso zzso to zzso zzso but it failed to inhibit the transfer of labeled zzso to zzso zzso On the other hand, incubation with zzso zzso did not result in a similar zzso binding of zzso to zzso zzso In line with this finding, a zzso with zzso zzso was not zzso on subsequent zzso zzso reaction and zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso zzso activities were found also in zzso zzso membrane proteins and, after size zzso mainly in a protein fraction of around zzso zzso
