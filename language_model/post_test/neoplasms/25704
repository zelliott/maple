To study zzso the relationship between intrinsic zzso zzso and both the zzso zzso response zzso and the amount of zzso recovery zzso 

A total of 53 sets of experimental data obtained with 44 human cell lines were collected from the literature and the above relationships were zzso 

Analysis showed a statistically significant correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 sets of zzso and a statistically significant inverse correlation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 36 sets of data, AT zzso Furthermore, the analysis of the relationship between the challenge dose zzso (after a zzso zzso zzso and that of the zzso zzso (27 sets of data, AT zzso showed a statistically significant correlation zzso which deviates from, and becomes higher than, the zzso relationship for zzso zzso suggesting that the final response to zzso zzso in zzso cells might not be predictable on the basis of simple zzso of survival from the zzso zzso 

The comparison between the two zzso zzso and zzso suggests some zzso indicating that these two phenomena may be zzso correlated and could be attributed to induced resistance mechanisms that might be triggered differently in sensitive and resistant cell zzso
