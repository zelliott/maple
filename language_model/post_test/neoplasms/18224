Testing for tumor specific zzso on routine zzso zzso zzso zzso may predict response to treatment in Medical Oncology and has already entered zzso with zzso zzso assessment as a zzso The highly sensitive real time zzso zzso methods developed for this purpose are usually standardized under optimal template zzso In routine zzso however, zzso templates pose the zzso zzso we addressed the zzso of sequencing and two zzso methods on zzso assessed diagnostic cases for zzso zzso 

zzso zzso from 135 diagnostic and 75 low-quality control samples was obtained upon zzso tested for fragmentation and assessed for zzso zzso with zzso and with two zzso methods zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with relatively well preserved DNA could be accurately analyzed with sequencing, while zzso methods yielded zzso results even in cases with very fragmented DNA zzso with zzso sensitivity and specificity vs each zzso However, zzso efficiency zzso zzso also depended on zzso zzso zzso methods were sensitive to zzso zzso cells, provided that samples yielded cycle thresholds zzso but this condition was met in only zzso of diagnostic zzso In comparison, zzso samples zzso could accurately be analyzed at a sensitivity level of zzso zzso validation of zzso zzso DNA quality and tumor cell content were the main reasons for zzso zzso results zzso 

zzso targeted zzso assessment on zzso is very efficient with zzso methods in comparison to zzso However, DNA zzso capacity and tumor DNA content must be considered for the interpretation of zzso results in order to provide accurate information for clinical decision zzso
