The availability of the human zzso sequence has revolutionized the strategy of employing zzso acids with sequences complementary to specific target genes to improve drug discovery and target zzso Development of zzso DNA or zzso zzso that can block the activity of selected zzso genetic sequences offers the possibility of rational design with high zzso lacking in many current drug treatments for various diseases including cancer, at relatively inexpensive zzso zzso technology is one such example that has shown promising results and boasts of yielding the only approved drug to date in the zzso zzso However, in zzso delivery issues have yet to be completely overcome for widespread clinical zzso In contrast to zzso zzso the mechanism of zzso an zzso gene by the introduction of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or virus is called zzso gene zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso is a natural mechanism zzso zzso cells suppress expansion of genes when they come across zzso molecules with the same zzso Short interfering zzso is currently the fastest growing sector of this zzso field for target validation and therapeutic zzso zzso in theory, the development of zzso agents to inhibit gene expression is simple and straightforward, the fundamental concern relies upon the capacity of the zzso to gain access to the target zzso This paper summarizes the advances in the last decade in the field of zzso using zzso interference approaches and provides relevant comparisons with other zzso approaches with a specific focus on zzso zzso
