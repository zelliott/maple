zzso is a zzso protein that exists as several zzso zzso and functionally distinct zzso zzso zzso interact with a diverse array of molecular targets and regulate a wide range of cellular zzso including zzso survival, transcription, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso domain of zzso interacts with zzso molecules and this is considered important for many zzso zzso The ability of zzso to regulate such a wide variety of cellular processes suggests it might play an important role in many cancer zzso For example, regulation of nuclear hormone zzso function and zzso to zzso might have a major impact on cancer development, progression and response to zzso There is also increasing evidence that zzso expression is altered in a variety of human zzso relative to normal cells, and with further understanding of zzso function it might become a powerful zzso marker in human zzso This review describes the structure and function of zzso zzso and the potential clinical implications of their expression in zzso zzso
