The current state of the art in cancer treatment by radiation zzso beam intensity zzso such that tumors receive high dose radiation whereas damage to nearby healthy zzso is zzso It is common practice to deliver the radiation over several weeks, where the daily dose is a small constant fraction of the total zzso Such a zzso zzso is based on traditional models of zzso response where normal tissue cells possess the ability to repair zzso damage done by zzso This capability is significantly less prominent in zzso Recent advances in quantitative functional imaging and biological markers are providing new opportunities to measure patient response to radiation over the treatment zzso This opens the door for designing zzso schedules that take into account the patient's cumulative response to radiation up to a particular treatment day in determining the fraction on that zzso We propose a novel approach that, for the first time, zzso explores the benefits of such zzso zzso This is achieved by building a stylistic zzso decision process zzso model, which incorporates some key features of the problem through intuitive choices of state and action spaces, as well as transition probability and reward zzso The structure of optimal policies for this zzso model is explored through several simple zzso zzso
