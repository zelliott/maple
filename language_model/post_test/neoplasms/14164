In addition to zzso transformed cells, tumors are zzso that contain host zzso including zzso cells, vascular cells zzso and their zzso and immune zzso All these constituents interact with each other at the cellular and molecular levels, resulting in the production of an intricate and zzso complex of cells and zzso defined as the tumor zzso Several pathways involved in these interactions have been investigated both in pathological and zzso scenarios, and diverse molecules are currently targets of zzso and preventive zzso Many zzso and their derivatives show the ability to inhibit tumor zzso zzso and zzso exerting effects on the tumor zzso In this review, we will outline the principal players and mechanisms involved in the tumor zzso network and we will discuss some interesting compounds aimed at interrupting these interactions and blocking tumor zzso and zzso The considerations provided will be crucial for the design of new preventive approaches to the reduction in cancer risk that need to be applied to large populations composed of apparently healthy zzso
