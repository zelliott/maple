zzso of the folding machinery of the zzso protein 90 zzso zzso protein is crucial for cancer zzso The two zzso zzso zzso and zzso play different roles in response to zzso To identify zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso we developed a zzso zzso and zzso reporter system for zzso screening zzso and monitoring the efficacy of zzso zzso in cell culture and live zzso zzso of a zzso zzso chemical library in cell culture identified a compound, zzso zzso that binds to zzso and displays characteristics of zzso zzso zzso degradation of zzso client proteins and zzso of cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activity, in multiple cancer cell zzso The efficacy of zzso in zzso zzso interactions and cell proliferation in tumor zzso was evaluated by zzso repetitive zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging, zzso At 38 h zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso led to selective disruption of zzso as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso in the same cohort of mice showed that zzso treatment zzso zzso led to a zzso decrease in zzso zzso in tumors relative to carrier zzso zzso However, zzso did not lead to significant degradation of zzso client proteins in zzso We performed a structural activity relationship study with 62 zzso of zzso and identified A17 as the lead compound that outperformed zzso in zzso zzso interactions in cell zzso Our efforts demonstrated the power of zzso of zzso with zzso molecular imaging and led to identification of zzso zzso
