There is no reason to believe that a single zzso or tissue factor will hold the key to understanding the of dietary zzso effect on reducing the risk of colon zzso In fact, the data suggest that zzso interacting factors will be zzso After years of research, it appears that the zzso acid hypothesis is not nearly as strong as first zzso Additionally, the theory that zzso protect against colon cancer has little clinical or experimental zzso There is no doubt that identification of genetic zzso and their controlling factors, will play a major role in our understanding of this zzso The appeal of the original fiber hypothesis has not diminished but simply requires updating based on discoveries made since it was first zzso It is this author's opinion that dietary fiber will likely be found to zzso human colon cancer and the mechanisms of its beneficial effect will probably be through multiple actions within the zzso and at the level of the target zzso Based on our current knowledge of the zzso of colon cancer we cannot make definitive statements about what percentage of colon cancer might be prevented by a specific type or amount of dietary fiber but it is reasonable to conclude that consumption of zzso diets is associated with reduced risk of colon zzso It is quite plausible that the combination of dietary zzso or its zzso in conjunction with other zzso may be necessary to realize zzso of the zzso zzso
