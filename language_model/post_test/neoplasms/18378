zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso offers zzso assessment of cell proliferation in zzso The most important application refers to the evaluation of zzso zzso activity, representing a key feature of zzso Most data to date suggest that zzso is not a suitable zzso for staging of zzso This is because of the rather low fraction of zzso cells that undergo replication at a given time with subsequently relatively low zzso zzso zzso In addition, generally, the high zzso zzso in liver and bone zzso limits the diagnostic zzso We describe the current status on zzso and clinical applications of zzso including our own experience in brain zzso The future of zzso probably lies in the evaluation of zzso response to therapy and more importantly, in the prediction of early response in the course of zzso The level of zzso zzso in zzso depends on zzso zzso 1 activity and on the zzso zzso of the salvage zzso and expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso agents that cause arrest of the cell cycle in the zzso may initially increase zzso zzso rather than reducing the zzso cell zzso In addition, agents that block the zzso zzso zzso may lead to zzso of the salvage zzso and increase zzso zzso zzso In contrast, many therapeutic agents inhibit both pathways and subsequently reduce zzso zzso zzso Further studies comparing zzso with zzso zzso will be important to determine the complementary advantage of zzso in early cancer therapy response zzso Further research should be facilitated by simplified synthesis of zzso with improved yields and an increasing commercial zzso
