The study of the molecular recognition and zzso properties of peptides has emerged in recent years as a very active and diverse field of research, ranging from zzso to biotechnology and even to material zzso In the case of zzso peptides can be used as zzso of biological receptors to gain insights into the zzso zzso and chemical zzso underlying the formation of complexes and identify new zzso of biological processes of zzso In the case of biotechnology and material science, short sequences have been used to understand the sequence zzso of the formation of ordered zzso structures of zzso zzso In this work, we will describe our research activities in these two areas of modern chemical zzso In the first part, we will describe the development of a new, specific, zzso and selective zzso zzso and its use to obtain the information needed to identify a zzso small molecular lead to be used as an inhibitor of cancer zzso In the second part, we will describe the introduction of a new method for the description of the zzso process at the basis of the growth of ordered zzso structures held together by weak, zzso yet specific zzso
