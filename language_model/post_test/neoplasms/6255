As there is continuing controversy over the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging in radiation therapy zzso planning, we performed a phantom study to assess the feasibility of zzso gross tumor volume zzso zzso The phantom set, consisting of an elliptical bowl and 6 spheres measuring from zzso zzso in diameter, were filled with zzso to obtain 3 zzso ratios zzso of 4, 8, and zzso The ratio to maximum intensity at zzso intervals was applied as the threshold for zzso The ratio between zzso and actual volumes zzso zzso was zzso and the threshold ratio was selected to provide a volume ratio close to zzso To consider the clinical application, we applied the threshold value zzso intensity zzso threshold zzso for the largest zzso sphere to the 6 zzso The threshold ratio and the volume ratio in 6 spheres with 3 zzso were compared using the Friedman zzso zzso ratios ranged from zzso they were higher for smaller spheres zzso zzso zzso and lower zzso zzso zzso zzso The volume ratios with the threshold value for the largest zzso sphere were lower in smaller spheres zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that smaller zzso and higher background activities require a higher threshold ratio and smaller zzso a lower threshold zzso zzso imaging should not be used as a single zzso but rather to obtain supplemental information in zzso zzso The contoured zzso should be adjusted based on clinical data including conventional zzso
