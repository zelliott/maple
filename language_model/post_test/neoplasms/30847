Cooperative integration of laboratory and clinical trial data has provided striking improvement in the treatment of pediatric zzso conditions over the last 2 zzso If attempts are made to zzso therapy to the specific disease and zzso treatment zzso for each pediatric zzso condition, the combination of surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy can put the vast majority of patients into a complete clinical zzso with apparent cure for more than half of these zzso Depending on the disease type, treatment failure, when it occurs, is usually the result of zzso distant, zzso disease that is zzso to prior treatment and simultaneously zzso to treatment approaches not yet used for the patient who has had a zzso The clinical research challenge with these pediatric zzso zzso is to identify those children who are harboring microscopic amounts of residual tumor before their zzso and develop effective combined zzso treatment approaches that can be initiated in those zzso These additional treatment approaches should complement rather than duplicate the zzso mechanisms that had been used to initiate zzso to eradicate residual tumor without cross zzso zzso laboratory and clinical research approaches are developing and testing the potential of zzso zzso The broad application of these principles to clinical zzso will be facilitated by the integrated zzso testing that is being accomplished through cooperative pediatric clinical research zzso
