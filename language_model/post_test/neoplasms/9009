zzso zzso zzso and zzso body radiation therapy zzso also known as zzso zzso radiation therapy zzso are rapidly becoming accepted practice for the radiation therapy of certain zzso Typically, zzso and zzso involve the delivery of 1 or a few zzso zzso of 8 to 30 zzso per zzso a major paradigm shift from radiation therapy practice over the past 90 years, when, with relatively large amounts of normal zzso receiving high doses, the goal was to maximize tumor response for an acceptable level of normal tissue zzso The development of zzso and zzso have come about because of zzso advances in image guidance and treatment delivery techniques that enable the delivery of large doses to tumors with reduced margins and high zzso outside the target, thereby minimizing doses to surrounding normal zzso Because the results obtained with zzso and zzso have been impressive, they have raised the question whether classic zzso zzso and the zzso zzso model, are appropriate for large doses per zzso In addition to objections to the zzso model, the possibility of additional biological effects resulting from zzso cell damage, enhanced tumor zzso or both have been raised to account for the success of zzso and zzso In this review, we conclude that the available zzso and clinical data do not support a need to change the zzso model or to invoke phenomena over and above the classic 5 zzso of zzso and radiation therapy, with the likely exception that for some tumors high doses of zzso may produce enhanced zzso zzso Thus, we suggest that for most tumors, the standard zzso concepts of the 5 zzso are sufficient to explain the clinical data, and the excellent results obtained from clinical studies are the result of the much larger biologically effective doses that are delivered with zzso and zzso
