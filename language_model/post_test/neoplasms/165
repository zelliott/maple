We identified six zzso zzso zzso in zzso human zzso We used computerized zzso of zzso protein profiles to measure the relative rates of synthesis and abundance of the individual zzso zzso and zzso the two major structural constituents of zzso In zzso human zzso zzso the rates of synthesis of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were greatly decreased relative to normal zzso parental zzso and to zzso In contrast, related zzso zzso zzso which are zzso and zzso independent exhibited both slight zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Thus, zzso zzso switching from the predominance of the larger more avid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the smaller, less avid zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso was a zzso change correlated with zzso in human zzso
