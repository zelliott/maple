Cancer cells contain abnormal number of zzso zzso which is a prevalent form of genetic instability in human zzso zzso in a cell cycle surveillance mechanism called the zzso checkpoint contribute to zzso instability and zzso In response to zzso zzso in zzso the zzso checkpoint zzso the zzso zzso activity of the zzso complex or zzso zzso thus preventing precocious zzso segregation and ensuring the accurate partition of the genetic zzso We review recent progress toward the understanding of the molecular mechanism of the zzso checkpoint and its role in guarding zzso integrity at the zzso zzso
