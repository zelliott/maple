zzso zzso an analogue of zzso exhibits reduced toxicity but wide zzso zzso of its zzso zzso zzso of the zzso dose is therefore zzso Although various formulas have been developed for this purpose, major side effects have been reported on zzso administration by short-term infusion zzso or 1 zzso We therefore propose a new schedule of zzso zzso Instead of a dosing method based on the zzso of zzso function when a classic administration schedule is used, we propose a zzso dosing method zzso zzso zzso zzso is given by continuous infusion for 120 zzso First, zzso was given to 21 patients to determine the population zzso parameters of zzso Then, on the basis of total platinum plasma concentration zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso it was possible to zzso the zzso dose within the first 24 h of the zzso This new protocol for zzso administration was evaluated in 36 new patients zzso zzso Three theoretical end points at the end of the infusion were zzso For a given theoretical end point, 20 courses were taken into zzso The theoretical end points zzso 1, zzso and zzso zzso were compared with the zzso measured at the end of the infusion, which were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso dosing method can easily be used in clinical practice, and the determination of zzso performances has shown that the method is precise and zzso With no more toxicity or practical difficulties than those produced by other methods, and with acceptable zzso it was possible to reach a median dose that was zzso higher than the usual dose zzso zzso 190 zzso as compared with 400 zzso In conclusion, this new schedule of zzso administration appears to be interesting in terms of zzso However, new studies are required to confirm that this new scheme leads to equal or better efficacy than the classic zzso
