zzso zzso are zzso cell fragments generated by all cell zzso They comprise a recently recognized new system of zzso communication, believed to play a pivotal role in information transfer between cells, as they display a large number of zzso enclosed within the membrane as well as in the membrane zzso The zzso of the donor cell is reflected in the zzso protein content, which also allows the identification of the original zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in several zzso and pathological zzso most notably in zzso zzso zzso may serve as zzso zzso they were detected in blood plasma and in other body zzso Their size varies between 30 and 1000 zzso All of them reflect the special potential of tumor cells for survival and for the expansion of the zzso independently from zzso zzso zzso zzso have the potential to facilitate the escape of tumor cells from immune surveillance through their protein and zzso content, at the same time they are involved in the establishment of a beneficial environment for newly formed and zzso tumor cells, influencing zzso and the reorganization of the zzso zzso zzso the properties of zzso zzso should increase our understanding in tumor biology and open new perspectives in cancer zzso zzso zzso are involved in zzso at multiple level and drugs themselves can be zzso from tumor cells via zzso zzso interfering with the formation, release and propagation of these zzso can be a novel and alternative issue in cancer zzso The present review is an overview of the roles of membrane zzso in zzso showing also the potential to consider them as new targets in tumor zzso
