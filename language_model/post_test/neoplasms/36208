zzso cell death and DNA repair are two fundamental biological processes that play essential roles in cell fate and genetic zzso The zzso role of zzso family members is the regulation of programmed cell zzso zzso numerous studies from different laboratories have shown that although zzso increases cell survival, it also zzso all DNA repair systems, resulting in zzso zzso zzso affects the mechanistically distinct DNA repair systems via different zzso These effects are generally independent of the regulation of zzso revealing additional roles for zzso The targets of zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso should be of particular importance because this might impact many essential cellular processes in which zzso is involved, including zzso zzso zzso zzso end joining zzso base zzso repair, zzso regulation, cell death, zzso zzso of the zzso transcription, and protein zzso zzso the pathological consequences, zzso of DNA repair by zzso can be, in contrast, zzso used in some zzso situations: zzso repression of excessive zzso HR, thus protecting against the zzso of toxic zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso might protect against zzso zzso zzso it has been proposed that zzso of mismatch repair might also favors zzso at zzso zzso Finally, because zzso affects the maintenance of zzso stability, one can suggest zzso might play a role in molecular zzso zzso family members control cell death through complex zzso zzso zzso DNA repair proteins to such an elaborate network should allow for a fine tuning of the coordinated control of cell viability and genetic zzso zzso between DNA repair and regulation of cell death represent exciting challenges for future prospects and are essential for the development of promising new strategies against zzso
