zzso variations of zzso zzso zzso produced by 8 human tumor cell lines of various organ zzso derived from zzso one from zzso one from zzso and 2 from lung zzso investigated on the basis of zzso with several zzso zzso recognizing either the zzso or the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from all the cell lines revealed nearly uniform zzso with the zzso zzso recognizing the zzso zzso and no difference was observed between the zzso of zzso released into culture medium zzso and of those extracted from cells zzso On the other hand, with each of 4 zzso zzso recognizing the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso were found to be highly variable from one cell line to another, and a marked difference was detected between the zzso of zzso and of zzso in every cell zzso In general, zzso reacted much more strongly than zzso with these zzso The zzso of some of the zzso with 2 out of 4 zzso to sugar zzso increased significantly after treatment of zzso with zzso These results suggest that distinct structural changes in the zzso zzso may occur during the releasing process of zzso from cells, and that, in some cases, some zzso may be masked by attachment of zzso acid zzso
