zzso metabolism is thought to play an important role in zzso through its involvement in both DNA zzso and zzso zzso A common zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene leads to a disturbed folate metabolism and is associated with decreased zzso DNA zzso We previously reported that the zzso zzso zzso was associated with increased cancer mortality in men from a zzso cohort of subjects ages zzso or zzso 85 zzso To further explore the deleterious effects of the zzso zzso we studied the association of the zzso with cancer risk in 860 men ages zzso years who were followed zzso years zzso zzso zzso During zzso 149 new cases of cancer occurred among the 793 men without cancer at zzso The risk of developing cancer was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso higher among men with the zzso zzso than among men with the zzso zzso Except for lung cancer zzso risk zzso zzso the risks of common forms of zzso were significantly increased among men with the zzso zzso zzso of the prostate zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso the kidney and zzso zzso zzso The risks of cancer were particularly increased among men with a lower folate and a higher alcohol intake and men of an older zzso In conclusion, our current and previous studies in two independent populations indicate that a common zzso zzso in the zzso gene is a risk factor for cancer in elderly men from the general zzso The mechanism underlying this association might involve zzso instability as a result of insufficient zzso of zzso zzso
