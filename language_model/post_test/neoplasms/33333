zzso of zzso function should be performed as part of the follow-up during and after chemotherapy in pediatric cancer zzso The aim of this study was to compare an isotope clearance method zzso zzso zzso rate zzso with alternative methods to determine zzso in such zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso zzso was measured in 36 children zzso zzso and compared with simultaneously measured zzso clearance zzso serum zzso zzso and zzso C zzso zzso as well as the results of Schwartz, zzso and zzso zzso using general linear mixed zzso Our results showed a significant association between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No linear relationship was observed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso As expected, the results of zzso zzso zzso and zzso had significantly zzso zzso zzso better correlation to zzso than the results of a formula based on weight zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite significant linear zzso zzso correlation zzso showed poor zzso Tests of similarity between zzso estimates showed differences between average values of zzso zzso determination of zzso remains the method of choice in zzso of zzso in cancer zzso In our study population, zzso of serum zzso was the most reliable alternative method to measure zzso zzso
