A generic method for three-dimensional zzso evaluation of target volume zzso in multiple imaging zzso is zzso The evaluation includes geometrical and statistical methods to estimate observer differences and zzso in defining the Gross zzso Volume zzso in relation to the diagnostic CT and zzso zzso The geometrical method is based on mapping the 3-D shape of the target volume to a zzso zzso thus enabling a one-dimensional statistical zzso The statistical method zzso observer and zzso related zzso which are expressed in terms of three error zzso random observer zzso systematic observer differences, and systematic zzso zzso zzso Carlo simulations demonstrate that the standard errors of each of the three model parameters are zzso zzso to the square root of the product of the patient group size and the number of observers and zzso to the zzso zzso For 18 patients and 3 observers the standard errors of the estimated systematic zzso and observer differences are zzso and zzso of the zzso standard zzso zzso A zzso representation of the shape of the zzso delineated by 3 observers for 18 patients, was obtained by sampling the distance between the average center of gravity of the prostate in CT and the prostate surface for a large number of directions zzso using polar zzso Observer zzso and differences were obtained by applying the statistical method to the samples zzso The zzso variation for CT was largest in regions near the seminal zzso zzso 3 zzso and the zzso zzso 3 zzso The systematic observer variation in CT was largest in a region near the zzso zzso at the zzso side of the prostate zzso 2 zzso The sensitivity for the choice of origin was tested by using the average center of gravity from zzso zzso instead of zzso The results were almost zzso The polar map measures distances in the scanning zzso A correction procedure to get the zzso in directions perpendicular to the surface of the prostate yielded variations that were a factor of zzso smaller for all zzso It is concluded that by separating the shape evaluation in a geometrical and a statistical part, the complexity of the analysis of 3-D shape differences can be significantly zzso The method was successfully applied to a group of prostate patients, where we demonstrated that zzso zzso is zzso with the largest variations occurring near the seminal zzso and the zzso
