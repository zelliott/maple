The administration of chemicals at the maximum tolerated dose zzso in standard animal cancer tests is zzso to increase cell division zzso which in turn increases rates of zzso and thus zzso The animal data are consistent with this zzso because a high zzso zzso all chemicals tested zzso natural or zzso are indeed zzso zzso We conclude that at the low doses of most human zzso where cell killing does not occur, the hazards to humans of zzso zzso may be much lower than is commonly zzso The zzso significance of zzso to synthetic chemicals is examined in the context of zzso to naturally occurring zzso We calculate that zzso (by zzso of the pesticides in the American diet are chemicals that plants produce to defend zzso Only 52 natural pesticides have been tested in high-dose animal cancer tests, and about half zzso are zzso zzso these 27 are shown to be present in many common zzso We conclude that natural and synthetic chemicals are equally likely to be positive in animal cancer zzso The zzso of synthetic chemicals is compared to that of natural zzso which represent the vast bulk of the chemicals to which humans are zzso It is argued that animals have a broad array of zzso general defenses to combat the changing array of toxic chemicals in plant food zzso zzso and that these defenses are effective against both natural and synthetic zzso zzso toxins such as zzso are compared to natural zzso such as zzso zzso (in zzso and zzso The finding that in high-dose tests, a high proportion of both natural and synthetic chemicals are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for each zzso undermines current regulatory effects based on these tests to protect public health from low doses of synthetic zzso
