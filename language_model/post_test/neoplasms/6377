zzso of zzso zzso zzso is a critical step for producing zzso zzso in the zzso zzso However, the incompatible surface of the active site of the zzso and the zzso site of zzso conventional zzso become the limiting zzso Because zzso zzso possess the potential to zzso bind to the active site of zzso due to their small size and long zzso we have developed a novel approach to produce zzso with zzso activities by exploiting the molecular mimicry of camel zzso By screening the zzso variable region of the heavy chain zzso zzso display library with zzso we obtained an zzso zzso zzso that recognizes the active zzso Further screening with zzso from the same variable domain of the heavy chain of a zzso zzso library led to a higher zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso showed the highest activity that can be inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso competitive inhibitor zzso and significantly suppressed the zzso tumor cell growth in the presence of zzso in zzso The results highlight the feasibility of producing zzso via zzso zzso zzso
