The ability to use zzso zzso to inhibit gene expression zzso zzso zzso or zzso is currently zzso science and medicine zzso Numerous zzso studies are evaluating zzso as a novel therapeutic zzso in the battle against zzso zzso dominant diseases, cancer, and viral zzso One emerging concern is that zzso zzso might ultimately fail to control viruses that can escape zzso by zzso and/or zzso zzso Thus, sophisticated strategies are being developed that aim to avert viral resistance by combining zzso zzso with each other or with further gene expression zzso Several reports already validate this new concept of zzso zzso zzso and illustrate its versatility by describing zzso of zzso triggers directed against single or zzso viral or zzso zzso Other studies document the successful delivery of these triggers with additional zzso or zzso zzso Moreover, zzso have been engineered to blend zzso gene zzso with conventional gene replacement zzso zzso these efforts open up exciting new therapeutic avenues but could also augment the inherent risks of zzso technology, including immune responses, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Here, we critically review all zzso strategies and discuss the requirements for their transition into clinical zzso
