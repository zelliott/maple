The zzso of natural killer zzso and zzso cells zzso plays an important role in the induction of the zzso immune response against zzso During the last decade, our advanced understanding of the immune system led to the development of new therapeutic strategies in the field of zzso and cellular zzso However, these zzso concepts have not been as successful as initially expected because of their inability to counteract zzso zzso zzso Some of the major difficulties of effective cellular zzso are the highly zzso factors induced by tumor cells themselves or by their zzso zzso one major challenge in zzso is the question: zzso to enforce zzso cell & DC action under zzso zzso This review focuses on the current knowledge on the tumor zzso the zzso of zzso cells and zzso as well as their deregulation in the complex interplay with the zzso tumor zzso We further discuss possible strategies to minimize the negative impact of the tumor zzso on the immune zzso
