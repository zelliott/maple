The objective is to zzso the findings from recent (June zzso studies that have examined the potential benefits of exercise training for the treatment of wasting associated with zzso cancer, chronic zzso zzso zzso arthritis, zzso and zzso In many clinical conditions, protein wasting and unintentional weight loss are zzso of morbidity and zzso The zzso of protein wasting in these conditions can be different, but the fundamental mechanism is an imbalance between muscle protein synthetic and zzso zzso The muscle proteins most affected and the precise zzso in their synthetic and zzso rates that occur in each zzso condition are still under zzso 

Regular exercise, or sometimes just a modest increase in physical activity, can mitigate muscle protein zzso zzso exercise training primarily alters zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso while progressive resistance exercise training predominantly increases zzso protein zzso Previous studies indicate that resistance exercise acutely increases the muscle protein synthetic rate more than muscle zzso such that the muscle zzso acid balance is increased for up to 2 days after zzso Progressive resistance exercise training increases muscle protein synthesis and muscle mass, but zzso the zzso in zzso that results from a single bout of resistance zzso The cellular mechanisms that produce these adaptations are not entirely zzso 

In general, patients with wasting conditions who can and will comply with a proper exercise program gain muscle protein mass, strength and zzso and, in some cases, are more capable of performing the activities of daily zzso
