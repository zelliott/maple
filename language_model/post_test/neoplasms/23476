Half of all the patients with a solid zzso tumor will receive radiation therapy zzso with a zzso or zzso intent during the course of their zzso zzso effects may result in acute and chronic zzso that reduce the long-term zzso quality of life of these zzso zzso zzso enables precise beam delivery that zzso closely to the shape of tumors yielding an improved zzso zzso However, sophisticated zzso will not completely prevent toxicity in the zzso field, especially as normal tissue constraints are offset by dose escalation or concurrent zzso zzso agents can be used before or after zzso to reduce side effects and are classified based on the timing of zzso zzso zzso used as a molecular zzso strategy before zzso are mostly based on zzso zzso Currently, zzso is the only zzso approved for use in the zzso zzso given during or shortly after zzso reduce the action of cellular zzso radiation on normal zzso before the emergence of zzso Lastly, a zzso is the administration of an agent once symptoms have developed in order to reverse those that are mostly due to zzso This review presents the major known zzso mechanisms involved in radiation response and tissue damage for which potential pharmacological candidates are zzso We discuss the potential clinical relevance of such zzso in the era of zzso zzso
