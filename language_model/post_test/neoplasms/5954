Four human cell lines (one zzso two melanoma and one zzso were evaluated for their responses to zzso and zzso For mild zzso zzso degrees zzso there was little to no chronic zzso development during protracted heating for up to 72 zzso In addition, there was no significant zzso for zzso zzso during mild zzso For high temperature zzso zzso beta was more zzso sensitive than zzso sensitive zzso alpha + delta + zzso zzso zzso zzso but during mild zzso zzso relative sensitivities were zzso zzso beta was resistant to mild zzso and zzso alpha was very zzso Within each cell line there was a correlation between zzso alpha zzso and the degree of zzso zzso and amongst the cell lines the most radiation resistant cell line had less zzso alpha zzso than the most sensitive cell line for similar values of zzso These data indicate that, amongst the cell lines, zzso and zzso alpha sensitivity may influence zzso and that for a given cell line, or possibly zzso zzso alpha zzso may have potential as an indicator to determine zzso for mild zzso treatments in zzso to low dose zzso
