The effect of zzso C administration on the generation of zzso cells, induced by in zzso zzso of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso with zzso was studied in patients with various zzso The ability of zzso to generate zzso killer zzso cell activity against zzso cell targets was significantly zzso 5 and 7 days after a single intravenous dose of 12 zzso zzso C, when compared to that of zzso obtained before zzso C zzso Further, zzso cell activity against zzso tumor cells was also significantly increased after the drug zzso The distribution of zzso zzso exhibited a significant increase in the percentage of zzso cells after injection, with the zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the proportion of the zzso zzso zzso which identifies zzso of suppression, was significantly zzso Thus, the decrease in the proportion of zzso zzso of zzso might be at least zzso responsible for the zzso generation of zzso cells after zzso C zzso
