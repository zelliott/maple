To evaluate the structure quality zzso staff, linear accelerators, and zzso of zzso units based on the clinical audits by the zzso zzso (this institution is based on federal German zzso in zzso 

External audits zzso by at least two radiation zzso one radiation physicist, and a member of the zzso of recently completed charts by designated zzso using appropriate zzso developed by the federal task group zzso zzso were zzso 

In the zzso from 2005 to 2007, 60 linear zzso in 24 zzso units served a population of approximately zzso million inhabitants zzso zzso zzso zzso people with zzso tumors were treated in these units in zzso These patients were served by zzso radiation zzso 83 radiation physicists, and 235 zzso The ratio of patients zzso annually to staff would become 222 zzso zzso for a radiation oncologist, 339 for a radiation physicist zzso zzso and 120 for a zzso zzso zzso In five of seven departments zzso new staff was employed following the recommendations of the zzso 

Clinical audits by the zzso zzso are highly effective to evaluate the structure quality of zzso zzso Based on these audits realistic data for staff requirements were zzso Making use of these data, guidelines for average minimum personnel necessary for good patient care were zzso zzso requirements may vary related to specific needs zzso zzso of the treatment program and should be accounted for when discussing with the zzso The recommendations of the zzso of the zzso zzso resulted in the new employment of additional zzso
