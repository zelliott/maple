A concept of zzso based upon zzso and zzso principles, states that zzso are caricatures of tissue renewal, in that they are composed of a mixture of zzso stem cells, which have a marked capacity for proliferation and a limited capacity for differentiation under normal zzso conditions, and of the zzso possibly benign, progeny of these zzso zzso The concept brings order to the facts about zzso has zzso value for zzso and indicates possibilities for differentiation zzso One such possibility assumes on the basis of zzso in zzso that zzso stem cells can be induced to differentiate into zzso cells by application of zzso Another suggests study of naturally occurring substances which regulate cell proliferation and differentiation in adult zzso The other possibility, based upon experiments in zzso and in zzso indicates that embryonic fields are capable of converting their closely corresponding zzso lineages into apparently normal lineages responsive to zzso zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso has been achieved in zzso with improvement in longevity of the host and in some cases with apparent zzso However, ultimate success of treatment based upon turning zzso cells into benign cells will depend upon the nature of the benign zzso Will they remain zzso
