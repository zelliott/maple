zzso are key components of the cell cycle progression zzso They activate their zzso zzso zzso and target them to respective zzso proteins within the zzso zzso zzso of specific sets of proteins drives the cell through particular zzso or checkpoints of the cell zzso During zzso growth of normal cells, the timing of expression of several zzso is zzso occurring at discrete and zzso periods of the cell zzso zzso detection of zzso in relation to cell cycle position zzso zzso by zzso flow zzso techniques has provided a new approach to cell cycle zzso This approach, like no other method, can be used to detect the zzso expression of zzso zzso the presentation of zzso zzso by cells in zzso and of zzso zzso by zzso cells, without the need for cell zzso By use of zzso flow zzso and laser scanning zzso analysis, we correlated the expression of zzso B1 with cell cycle position in normal zzso zzso to zzso by the zzso zzso and in 28 primary human tumors of different organ and zzso zzso of the 28 tumors expressed the zzso B1 in more than zzso of cells zzso zzso and the rest showed zzso expression from zzso to zzso zzso zzso In normal zzso the expression of zzso B1 was restricted to very late S and zzso + M zzso of the cell zzso In 15 of 18 primary tumors zzso the expression of zzso B1 was zzso zzso to particular zzso of the zzso The data suggest that the zzso expression of zzso B1 might be a common zzso in zzso
