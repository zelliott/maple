zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso targeted against zzso We hypothesized that the complementary zzso of zzso signaling would have synergistic therapeutic zzso 

Patients had advanced solid tumors, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1, and good zzso zzso A phase I zzso trial of zzso and zzso was initiated at zzso zzso doses because of possible overlapping zzso zzso 200 zzso orally twice daily and zzso zzso at 5 zzso zzso level zzso 1) or 10 zzso zzso every 2 zzso Additional patients were enrolled at the zzso dose zzso 

Thirty-nine patients were zzso zzso was the zzso and administered in cohort 2 (N zzso zzso zzso toxicity in zzso was grade 3 zzso and zzso zzso events included hypertension, zzso syndrome, zzso zzso and zzso zzso responses zzso were seen in six zzso of 13 patients with zzso cancer zzso duration range, 4 to zzso zzso and one of three patients with zzso cell cancer zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso or disease stabilization zzso 4 months zzso 6 zzso range, 4 to zzso zzso was seen in 22 zzso of 37 zzso zzso The majority zzso required zzso dose reduction to 200 zzso at a median of four cycles zzso one to 12 zzso 

Combination therapy with zzso and zzso has promising clinical activity, especially in patients with zzso zzso The zzso and frequency of zzso dose reductions indicates that zzso at 200 zzso twice daily with zzso 5 zzso every 2 weeks may not be tolerable long term, and alternate zzso dosing schedules should be zzso
