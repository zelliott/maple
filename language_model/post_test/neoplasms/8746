zzso are theoretically capable of zzso an zzso immune response, but are often poorly zzso zzso viruses zzso have recently emerged as a promising strategy for the zzso delivery of zzso zzso zzso to cancer zzso However, safe and effective zzso therapies have not yet been zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso based on zzso virus zzso can inhibit tumor growth and activate the innate immune system in zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso carrying a zzso generate a dramatically enhanced therapeutic effect in mice bearing zzso zzso and lung zzso zzso zzso efficacy was not dependent on tumor cell zzso but was characterized by the transient expression of zzso in zzso zzso draining the injection zzso Early zzso zzso at this site was followed by a robust influx of zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso T cells into the tumor site, subsequently leading to the generation of long-lasting memory T cells which zzso protection against zzso with zzso as well as zzso tumor zzso By combining in zzso imaging, flow zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis, we investigated the relationship between these events and propose a model for zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso
