An zzso phase I study with intravenous zzso was carried out in 12 patients with a zzso proven diagnosis of advanced gastrointestinal or breast cancer zzso to previous conventional zzso zzso doses of zzso were administered as a zzso intravenous infusion, once a week for at least 4 weeks in groups of 3 zzso zzso was administered as an intramuscular injection of 3 zzso 3 times a week for 4 consecutive zzso Physical and laboratory parameters were assessed at baseline and then weekly until the end of zzso 

The treatment with zzso was stopped at 5 zzso since this level corresponded to the maximum monthly dosage reported in the literature zzso zzso No severe toxicity was recorded up to this drug zzso
