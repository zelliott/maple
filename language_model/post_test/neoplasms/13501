In zzso studies that showed zzso could cause growth arrest and differentiation of zzso leukemia and zzso led to clinical trials of zzso in zzso and zzso that increased survival for both of those zzso In the case of zzso zzso has been the drug of choice, and zzso and clinical data support direct combinations of zzso with zzso zzso For zzso a phase I study defined a dose of zzso which was tolerable in patients after zzso therapy, and a phase III trial that showed zzso therapy with zzso improved zzso for patients with high-risk zzso zzso studies in zzso indicate that zzso or zzso can antagonize zzso chemotherapy and radiation, so use of zzso in zzso is limited to maintenance after completion of zzso chemotherapy and zzso A limitation on the zzso benefit of zzso in zzso is the marked decrease in drug levels that occurs during therapy as a result of induction of drug zzso resulting in a shorter drug zzso and decreased plasma zzso Although early studies sought to overcome the zzso limitations of zzso therapy in zzso the demonstration that zzso is active against zzso in zzso patients has led to a focus on studies employing zzso Use of zzso in zzso has avoided the decreased plasma levels seen with zzso It is likely that zzso disease seen during or after zzso therapy in zzso is due to tumor cell resistance to zzso differentiation zzso Studies in zzso cell lines resistant to zzso and zzso have shown that they can be sensitive, and in some cases zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor cell zzso rather than zzso acts independently from zzso zzso and in initial phase I trials has been well zzso Clinical trials of zzso alone and in combination with zzso zzso are in zzso
