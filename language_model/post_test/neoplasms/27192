Novel zzso derivatives bearing zzso zzso were prepared and their chemical structures as well as the relative zzso were zzso All the zzso compounds were evaluated for their zzso zzso zzso activity and their zzso against the cell lines zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Several potent compounds were further evaluated against zzso zzso Most compounds displayed moderate to excellent activity, and the zzso relationship studies identified the most promising compound 35 as a selective zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso 35 showed a zzso and zzso increase in zzso in zzso against zzso and zzso cells, respectively, compared to that of zzso Poor zzso effects of compound 35 were further confirmed by the zzso activity against the zzso zzso less sensitive zzso cell line zzso zzso
