To evaluate the zzso of cancer in persons with zzso disease zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso in persons with zzso 

This was a cohort study in Northern Italy on more than 1 million zzso Cancer zzso was derived from the local health authority zzso tumor registry and zzso zzso zzso from zzso of drug prescriptions, hospitalizations, and payment zzso zzso cases of zzso zzso were calculated by applying the zzso zzso and calendar zzso zzso rates observed in the whole population to the zzso constituted of persons with newly diagnosed zzso during the observation period zzso The same calculations were carried out for zzso in patients with zzso zzso Separate analyses were carried out for the time period preceding or following the index diagnosis for survivors and zzso until the end of 2009 and for different types and sites of zzso 

The risk of cancer in patients with zzso zzso was zzso and the risk of zzso zzso in patients with cancer was zzso zzso This relationship was observed in almost all zzso zzso suggesting that some anticipated potential zzso factors did not significantly influence the zzso 

The occurrence of both cancer and zzso zzso increases zzso with age, but with an inverse zzso older persons with cancer have a reduced risk of zzso zzso and vice zzso As zzso zzso and cancer are negative hallmarks of aging and zzso we suggest that zzso zzso cancer, and zzso could be manifestations of a unique phenomenon related to human zzso
