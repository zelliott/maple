Some laboratories have reported zzso zzso integration in cancer patients diagnosed with zzso of zzso and zzso Usually, cancer patients undergo zzso besides chemotherapy and zzso It is hypothesized that radiation exposure would induce zzso zzso zzso nevertheless there is not any report on experimental procedures trying to demonstrate zzso gene expression in cells exposed to zzso zzso Anyway, earlier experimental works by Lieberman and Kaplan in 1959 succeeded to isolate zzso zzso the radiation leukemia virus zzso from zzso zzso of zzso zzso mice, assuming that zzso activated in the host by zzso radiation, is released and transported to the zzso where zzso generated during the zzso recovery phase, constitute an optimal target cell population for both replication of and eventual transformation by zzso Recent studies claim that besides zzso another zzso zzso also induced by zzso radiation is expressed and would be responsible for transformed cells of bone zzso zzso zzso studies coincidentally point out to high zzso of zzso infection in geographic areas displaying significant levels of zzso contamination as in Central Africa, Japan Islands and zzso zzso In our research work, we detected zzso zzso and viral zzso integration in cancer patients of zzso and zzso and health care workers, whose had been exposed to zzso radiation during zzso zzso zzso events among zzso zzso and other zzso elements in the host cell zzso under the zzso of zzso radiation from different sources could have zzso the phenomena occurrence or even ignited them to happen, generating zzso zzso related viral peptides and zzso zzso it is feasible that exposure to zzso radiation during therapeutic procedures could generate zzso zzso or induce the virus to be expressed in cells of cancer patients submitted to zzso as also in healthy subjects under the same conditions, in artificial or natural radiation zzso
