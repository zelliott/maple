Table 6 is a summary of the organisms discussed with a listing of the environmental source, the zzso source, the zzso factors including zzso and the zzso mechanisms by which the zzso can gain access to the zzso The evidence considered indicates that the entrance of one of these zzso into the zzso of a human being depends on the presence of zzso of zzso zzso In the majority of cases of zzso due to one of these unusual organisms, two or more zzso factors are zzso Certain zzso factors, such as cancer chemotherapy or intravenous zzso often provide a barrier break, while others, such as liver disease, may render the host immune system less capable of clearing organisms from the zzso For organisms such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso attributes that allow the invasion of a healthy host are present and seem to be enhanced by the simultaneous presence of a zzso condition, such as liver disease, in the zzso Although somewhat zzso a number of individual case reports describe zzso due to one of these organisms occurring weeks to years after surgery and after other therapeutic measures had zzso a supposed cure of a zzso It may be speculated that cancer patients, even after a zzso are still susceptible to zzso invasion by one of the aforementioned organisms by virtue of the presence of one or more zzso zzso zzso or zzso factors, even though these factors may be zzso The predominance of zzso zzso among cases of zzso due to these unusual organisms is also zzso zzso as pointed out by zzso zzso the reduction in the performance of immune function in zzso zzso compared with solid tumors is likely to be responsible, other associations of certain organisms with specific zzso warrant further zzso The frequency of zzso infections of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in Hodgkin's disease patients seems likely due to a particular mechanism which infection by these species is zzso The specific nature of these mechanisms remains to be zzso The recovery of any unusual zzso from blood should warrant a careful consideration of the possibility of underlying disease, especially zzso zzso should advise clinicians of the unusual nature of the identified zzso and provide the counsel that certain zzso zzso often accompanied by zzso render the human host susceptible to invasion by almost any zzso The recovery of such organisms as zzso zzso or zzso zzso should prompt the zzso to aggressively seek to identify an zzso zzso if one has not yet been zzso
