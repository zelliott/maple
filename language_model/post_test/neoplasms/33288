Cancer is a zzso disease resulting from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso While studying loss of zzso zzso in cancer zzso we zzso observed a low frequency of zzso in cancer patients compared with controls, raising the question whether zzso could play a role in cancer zzso 

To determine the frequency of zzso zzso in a large series of patients with 3 different types of solid tumors compared with zzso zzso 

zzso and corresponding tumor DNA isolated from 385 patients with zzso zzso breast, 116 zzso and 122 head and neck zzso were subjected to whole zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso at zzso markers in cancer cases vs controls and frequency of zzso zzso in zzso at zzso with the highest zzso 

We identified 16 zzso in common among the 3 cancer types, with significantly increased zzso zzso zzso in the cancer patients compared with controls zzso zzso zzso In the cases who happened to be zzso zzso at these 16 zzso we found a mean zzso zzso frequency of zzso zzso compared with 50% zzso at 197 markers without increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Across the zzso this relationship holds as well zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso We validated the association of specific zzso with high zzso zzso zzso in an independent, zzso zzso public data set of 205 lung zzso from white individuals zzso zzso zzso to P zzso zzso as well as the correlation between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

In our study of 4 different types of solid tumors zzso data for 3 types validated in a fourth zzso increased zzso zzso occurred at specific zzso When the zzso was zzso at these zzso high zzso of zzso imbalance occurred at these zzso in the corresponding zzso
