A Compton scatter scanner has been developed to image electron density zzso of zzso body zzso The imaging performance of this device has been measured and compared with calculated limits and with the present capabilities of X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso The use of Compton scatter images in zzso dose calculations has been investigated and a zzso curve has also been measured from patient images to convert CT number data to electron zzso for zzso in zzso Images have been produced with a spatial resolution of zzso zzso and an electron density accuracy of zzso for a radiation dose of zzso zzso (11 zzso to the zzso However, little potential remains for further development of the Compton scatter technique for zzso zzso
