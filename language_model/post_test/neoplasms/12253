Recent progress on the fronts of design, zzso and delivery with synthetic zzso has increased the potential of zzso approaches to attain therapeutic zzso However, a number of hurdles remain to be zzso On the one hand, we have the problem of producing and zzso stable, zzso complexes and on the other hand, we have to face the fact that in zzso delivery is probably too complex and multifaceted to be achieved successfully with a single carrier zzso in most zzso This review concentrates on this latter aspect and the design of artificial zzso zzso aimed at providing solutions to membrane zzso zzso escape and navigation through the nuclear zzso In many instances the solutions proposed have been inspired by natural mechanisms exploited by bacteria and zzso However, entirely novel chemical approaches such as zzso DNA zzso via zzso zzso or zzso disruption by zzso zzso are also being investigated and zzso The combination of these naturally inspired and zzso approaches is bringing us continually closer to the concept of constructing an artificial virus capable of delivering viable zzso zzso pharmaceuticals to defined cells in zzso This review considers the most successful current solutions to the main biological barriers to gene delivery including appropriate DNA zzso cell targeting and entry, zzso escape, nuclear import and in zzso zzso In the latter section, emphasis is placed on one of the most versatile zzso zzso currently available, linear zzso
