zzso time zzso is widely used for zzso of tumor growth zzso zzso is usually determined from two volume zzso with measurement time intervals comparable with or shorter than zzso Clinical data show that the frequency distribution of zzso in patients is positively zzso with some very long zzso values compared with the average zzso Growth rate can also be zzso using specific growth rate zzso zzso equal to zzso The aim of this work was to compare zzso and zzso as growth rate zzso Growth rate calculations were computer simulated for a tumor with zzso of 100 days, measurement time zzso of 1 to 200 days, and volume zzso uncertainty of zzso to zzso Growth rate variables were determined and compared for previously published clinical zzso The study showed that zzso is not a suitable variable for tumor growth rate because zzso for short measurement time zzso or high volume zzso mean zzso can either overestimate or underestimate the average growth zzso zzso zzso is not defined if the zzso estimated volumes are zzso and zzso the zzso frequency distribution of zzso makes it zzso for common statistical zzso In contrast, mean zzso and its equivalent zzso give the correct values for average growth rate, zzso is defined for all tumor volume changes, and it has a symmetrical frequency zzso zzso is also more accurate to use when zzso for example, growth zzso cell loss rate, and growth rate zzso within the zzso zzso should thus be used, instead of zzso to zzso tumor growth zzso
