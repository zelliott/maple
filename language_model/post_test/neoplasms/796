Human clinical trials in type 1 diabetes zzso patients using zzso stem cells zzso are presently zzso without prior validation in a mouse model for the zzso In response to this zzso we characterized bone zzso zzso zzso for their ability to zzso immune responses in the context of zzso as represented in zzso zzso In comparison to zzso mice, zzso mice were found to express higher levels of the negative zzso zzso zzso and to promote a shift toward zzso responses in treated zzso zzso In addition, transfer of zzso from resistant strains zzso zzso resistant mice or zzso but not from zzso mice, delayed the onset of diabetes when administered to zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso trafficking to the pancreatic zzso zzso of zzso mice was higher than in zzso mice provided zzso zzso Administration of zzso temporarily resulted in reversal of zzso in zzso of zzso mice zzso zzso zzso Transfer of zzso zzso imparted no such therapeutic zzso We also noted soft tissue and visceral tumors in zzso mice, which were uniquely observed in this setting zzso no tumors were present with zzso or zzso resistant zzso zzso The importance of this observation remains to be explored in humans, as zzso mice such as zzso may be more susceptible to tumor zzso These data provide important zzso data supporting the basis for further development of zzso zzso therapies for zzso and, zzso for other zzso zzso
