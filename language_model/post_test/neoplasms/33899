Among novel promising approaches that have recently entered the scene of zzso therapy zzso zzso and targeting zzso genes zzso zzso are of particular interest as potentially highly zzso One reason for this is that transforming genetic zzso driving cancer progression zzso zzso of zzso and/or zzso are thought to be zzso for the onset of tumor zzso and thereby responsible for build up of vascular supply which is essential for cancer cell survival, zzso growth, invasion and zzso However, many of the same genetic zzso that emerge during disease progression and repeated rounds of zzso and/or zzso causing therapy could alter cellular zzso growth zzso and zzso pathways in such a manner, as to also render cancer cells zzso zzso to the zzso consequences of poor blood vessel accessibility zzso zzso zzso and growth factor zzso As recent experimental evidence suggests, such cancer cells could therefore display a reduced vascular demand and remain viable even in poorly zzso regions of the tumor as well as possess an overall zzso zzso The latter circumstance may lead to zzso diminished efficacy of zzso agents in certain zzso zzso we propose that analysis of zzso pathways and gene expression profiling of cancer cells may lead to important clues as to potential efficacy of zzso therapies, the direct target of which is the host zzso but which are ultimately aimed at zzso zzso of the cancer cells zzso We also suggest that zzso zzso zzso therapies may help reverse diminished vascular demand of highly transformed cancer cells and thereby facilitate zzso tumors to) therapies directed against vascular supply of zzso and their zzso
