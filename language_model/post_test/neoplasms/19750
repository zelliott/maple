zzso zzso radiation lies between the infrared and zzso regions of the electromagnetic spectrum and is zzso We show that exposure of artificial human skin tissue to intense, zzso zzso zzso affects expression levels of numerous genes associated with zzso skin zzso psoriasis and zzso zzso Genes affected by intense zzso zzso include nearly half of the zzso differentiation complex zzso zzso zzso zzso which are mapped to the zzso human region zzso zzso for proteins that partake in zzso differentiation and are often zzso in conditions such as psoriasis and skin zzso In nearly all the genes zzso expressed by exposure to intense zzso zzso the induced changes in zzso levels are opposite to zzso zzso The ability of intense zzso zzso to cause concerted favorable changes in the expression of multiple genes implicated in inflammatory skin diseases and skin zzso suggests potential therapeutic applications of intense zzso zzso
