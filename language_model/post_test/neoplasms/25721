In order to avoid the zzso of harmful zzso in cells, living organisms have developed ways for their zzso Multiple zzso zzso zzso with variable but partially overlapping zzso properties play a key role in the elimination zzso These zzso are zzso by zzso of genes which, during the course of evolution, have evolved in a way that has made it possible for the different species to survive and take advantage of different zzso and diet containing a variable composition of harmful zzso As a result of this evolutionary process, species have achieved capacities to metabolize zzso which are appropriate for their survival but which may differ considerably from those of other zzso This evolutionary process may also explain the zzso and zzso zzso of drug metabolism in zzso Because many zzso are zzso of zzso zzso it is reasonable to assume that humans have a variable capacity to activate or zzso zzso This has been shown to be the zzso It appears that most of the zzso zzso are zzso by zzso they respond to environmental stimuli and therefore vary in their zzso Furthermore, many of the zzso genes are zzso and multiple zzso zzso relevant for the zzso may exist in human zzso Analysis of the genetic zzso that affects the capacity to metabolize zzso in humans has shown that a few members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene families may play an Important role in chemical zzso Yet for several zzso such a role has not been established until now, although their zzso properties and expression in human zzso suggest that such a role should zzso More studies on the role of individual zzso in chemical zzso are therefore zzso
