zzso receptors zzso are surface markers characterizing not only zzso associated with neuroendocrine identities but also zzso without neuroendocrine zzso Recently, the zzso analog zzso was labeled with zzso zzso 111, zzso Medical zzso zzso Holland) and introduced for the in zzso zzso in man of zzso zzso In the present report, zzso zzso is evaluated as a clinical tool for tissue characterization in correlation with zzso and zzso zzso zzso was focused and performed in cancer types without neuroendocrine tissue expression such as brain zzso zzso 6) and breast tumors zzso zzso 9) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed for comparison at 6 and 22 h after zzso application of 111 zzso (3 zzso of zzso In the breast cancer group, the primary tumor was zzso in all 9 women as well as in all 4 cases with palpable zzso zzso zzso Three women with a negative zzso zzso scan and zzso zzso had positive zzso In two cases, zzso zzso zzso involvement was zzso So far the role of zzso breast cancer zzso scans remains zzso It is tempting to speculate that in zzso women who are zzso and zzso zzso positive, it might be of value in the early detection of zzso zzso High zzso of zzso were present within both zzso the high-grade zzso and the zzso zzso of low- and high-grade zzso could not be successfully achieved because both grades showed intense zzso zzso even though high-grade tumors lack zzso The latter might be due to the damaged zzso barrier and the poor zzso zzso observed in high-grade zzso All five zzso could be detected due to the presence of activated zzso and zzso that express zzso at a sufficient zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso in zzso zzso does not seem to be reliable for an initial tumor staging but rather more suitable for a tissue characterization and extremely useful for monitoring changes of zzso expression after zzso
