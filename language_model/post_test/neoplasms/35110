The structure of the human zzso alkaline zzso gene from normal term zzso was studied by restriction zzso zzso and Southern zzso analysis using a zzso probe to the gene for the zzso zzso The DNA zzso fall into three distinct patterns based on the presence and intensity of an extra zzso zzso I zzso The extra zzso band is present in 9 of 27 zzso samples, and in 1 of these samples the extra band is present at double zzso No zzso was revealed by zzso with restriction zzso zzso zzso I, zzso or zzso zzso The extra zzso zzso site may lie in a zzso region of the gene because no correlation was observed between the restriction zzso length zzso and the common zzso alkaline zzso zzso identified by starch gel zzso In addition, because zzso alkaline zzso is frequently zzso in zzso we examined tissue from zzso zzso and zzso tumors and from zzso zzso cells in zzso The zzso zzso zzso patterns from these cells and zzso were identical to those seen in the normal zzso and term zzso The consistent zzso zzso patterns seen in DNA from normal and tumor tissue indicate that a major gene zzso is not the basis for the zzso expression of zzso alkaline zzso in zzso
