To develop zzso vaccine by fusion of zzso zzso cells and DC, and to study its protective and zzso effect against zzso zzso 

zzso vaccine was produced by zzso fusion of zzso and DC induced by zzso released from zzso zzso cells, sorted by zzso magnetic zzso zzso It was injected through the tail vein of the mice and the zzso zzso was detected in the liver, zzso and zzso In order to study the zzso and protective effect of zzso against tumor zzso two groups were zzso immune group and therapeutic zzso zzso group was further divided into zzso D, HD and H subgroups, zzso by zzso DC, zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and attacked by zzso zzso The tumor size, tumor weight, mice survival time and tumor zzso period were recorded and statistically zzso zzso group was divided into three zzso of zzso D and zzso and attacked by zzso then treated with zzso DC, and zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso were also applied to study the mechanism how the zzso vaccine attacked on the zzso zzso 

zzso No zzso was found in zzso lung and liver after zzso zzso zzso zzso vaccine zzso mice had strongest zzso zzso zzso In the immune group, zzso period was longer in HD zzso than that in zzso H and D zzso and tumor size and weight were smaller in HD zzso than that in zzso H and D zzso zzso In therapeutic group, tumor size was smaller in HD zzso than that in zzso D zzso 

zzso zzso tumor vaccine is safe without zzso in zzso zzso zzso vaccine can stimulate potent specific zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso vaccine has distinctive zzso effect on tumor zzso and can inhibit the tumor zzso
