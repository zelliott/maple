We applied the zzso E zzso zzso domain 2 zzso as the zzso linked zzso module to generate zzso fusion zzso By fusing a humanized zzso zzso variable zzso directed against zzso to the zzso of the zzso and a zzso zzso of TRAIL zzso to the zzso of the zzso we produced a zzso zzso fusion zzso The fusion protein retained its binding activity for zzso and TRAIL zzso In zzso the targeted zzso fusion protein exhibited an approximately 8- to zzso increased zzso activity compared with the zzso zzso fusion zzso This resulted in increased zzso activity in a subcutaneous zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso In zzso the zzso fusion protein combines target cell selectivity with an increased TRAIL activity leading to improved zzso zzso
