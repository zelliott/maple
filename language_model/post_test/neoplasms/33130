zzso zzso zzso gene is one of the most zzso genes in human zzso zzso zzso zzso and disruption of zzso protein have been described in almost all human zzso Its zzso by zzso zzso leads to the rare but severe familial zzso termed zzso zzso This syndrome is characterized by the early onset of different types of zzso including zzso zzso breast and brain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The key role of zzso in tumor suppression has been confirmed in animal models as zzso The zzso zzso and zzso animals were born alive but were tumor zzso In the late zzso two genes with high zzso with zzso were discovered, zzso and zzso zzso Animal models showed that zzso is an important player in zzso sensory pathways and zzso zzso The zzso is critical for the development of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso breast, and zzso Despite the structural similarities with zzso the function of these proteins in zzso is zzso On one hand, there are zzso that both, zzso and zzso animals are not tumor zzso on the other hand, there is evidence that such animals develop tumors later during their zzso Unlike in zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso genes are rare, however, zzso zzso in zzso are linked to the human zzso zzso In this zzso we describe the contribution of the zzso zzso and zzso to human pathology with emphasis on their different roles in development and zzso
