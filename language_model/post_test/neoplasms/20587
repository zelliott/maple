zzso zzso level is a zzso factor in different zzso as its increase reflects tumor mass and response to zzso zzso zzso is the consequence of the disruption of the cell membrane of a large fraction of dividing zzso cells whose zzso hallmark is zzso zzso that leads to increased zzso zzso zzso Moreover, as we have previously shown that spontaneous zzso release from cells represents a measure of cell membrane damage, and this zzso is used for the zzso of cell destruction in zzso zzso the aim of this study was to evaluate the characteristics of zzso activity of zzso of patients with different solid tumors zzso zzso zzso Hodgkin's zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer of zzso zzso and head & zzso zzso in all clinical stages of NHL and HD and in advanced clinical stages of disease for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso release from zzso was determined by the zzso method from zzso of 8 zzso zzso zzso cultured for 2 h in zzso zzso without zzso red using and zzso zzso zzso The total zzso activity was determined after zzso of zzso by zzso The obtained results indicate that zzso in all the investigated zzso compared to control zzso demonstrate a significant increase zzso in spontaneous zzso release act, which zzso with advanced clinical stage in all zzso except in Hodgkin's disease, in which the spontaneous zzso release was increased in all clinical zzso zzso to this, the total zzso activity was not increased in zzso in all investigated zzso However, the zzso of spontaneous zzso zzso was always increased, regardless of the total zzso activity, indicating that spontaneous zzso release is the consequence of zzso membrane damage present in advanced stages of different solid zzso
