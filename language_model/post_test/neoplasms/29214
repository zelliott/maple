zzso zzso zzso genes are transcribed in most zzso and are with the exception of zzso zzso zzso They are involved in early development, cell zzso and control of cell zzso Most zzso genes are activated in response to bacterial and viral infections, and the exact host immune defense mechanisms are still zzso zzso gene expression triggered by past or chronic inflammation could prevent spreading of pathogens by limiting host cell zzso zzso induction in cells with low zzso protein levels is sufficient to drive growth arrest and a zzso zzso On the other hand, loss of zzso levels in cancer is correlated with pronounced zzso thus, these genes are considered as tumor zzso However, several cancer cells have zzso high levels of zzso zzso indicating a tumor progression stage where at least one of the zzso zzso pathways has been zzso zzso analyses of the protein coding zzso sequences suggest a single zzso gene in the common zzso of zzso and zzso Biological functions studied so far may have evolved in zzso and functional characterization of zzso proteins will provide insight into innate immune defense, cancer development, and other zzso
