The low abundance proteins of the nuclear zzso zzso were separated from the intermediate filament zzso proteins and analyzed by two-dimensional gel zzso Three human breast zzso lines had virtually identical patterns of 37 zzso zzso In contrast, cell lines derived from diverse zzso had zzso different zzso protein zzso Together, the five cell types examined here had a total of 205 distinguishable zzso proteins with 125 of these proteins unique to a single cell zzso The remaining zzso proteins were shared among cell types to different zzso zzso zzso obtained by zzso with total zzso proteins as zzso zzso stained the nuclear interior and not the exterior zzso These observations suggest that the zzso zzso localized to the interior of the nucleus, vary in a zzso zzso
