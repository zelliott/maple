The discovery of zzso that are readily accessible through the circulating blood and are selectively zzso in pathological zzso has become a major research objective, particularly in the field of zzso zzso this group of molecules has a high potential to serve as an innovative tool for effective imaging and targeted cancer therapy zzso In this attractive therapeutic concept, specific cancer proteins are reached by zzso administered zzso that are coupled to zzso zzso Such compounds are able to induce cancer destruction while sparing normal zzso zzso to the performance of mass zzso technology, current zzso zzso analysis allows for the identification of a high number of proteins that are zzso expressed in the zzso zzso However, such approaches provide no information regarding the effective accessibility of the zzso and, therefore, the possibility for these discovered proteins to be zzso To bypass this major zzso which clearly slows the discovery of such zzso innovative zzso strategies have been developed to enrich the clinical specimens before the mass zzso zzso The focus is laid on the group of proteins that are necessarily located either at the exterior face of the plasma membrane or in the zzso zzso The present review addresses the current technologies meant for the discovery and analysis of accessible zzso from clinically relevant zzso
