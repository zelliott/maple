A series of new zzso zzso zzso have been zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The products zzso were characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The interaction studies of compounds zzso with DNA were carried out by employing gel zzso zzso and zzso zzso The gel zzso pattern revealed that compounds zzso bind to DNA and also demonstrated that the compound 6 alone or in presence of zzso zzso causes the zzso of zzso zzso The compounds 4 and 5 bind to DNA zzso through zzso and zzso interactions with zzso values found to be zzso and zzso zzso respectively, indicating the higher binding affinity of compound 4 towards zzso The zzso study suggested the zzso of compounds in between the zzso base zzso The zzso and zzso of the newly zzso compounds were checked by zzso and comet zzso respectively during which compound 6 showed potential zzso
