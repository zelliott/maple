The zzso sensitivity protein zzso and the zzso gene product both appear to function as negative regulators of cell division or abnormal cellular growth in some differentiated cell zzso Several types of zzso have been shown to be derived from cells that have extensively zzso both zzso of one or both of these zzso resulting in a zzso zzso In the case of the zzso zzso this zzso process appears to occur in two steps, with the first zzso at the zzso locus resulting in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene product enters into an zzso protein complex with the zzso zzso protein derived from the other normal zzso and such a complex is inactive or less efficient in its negative regulation of growth zzso This intermediate stage of zzso selects for the proliferation of cells with one zzso zzso enhancing the probability of obtaining a cancer cell with both zzso zzso The DNA tumor viruses have evolved mechanisms to interact with the zzso and zzso negative regulators of cellular growth in order to enhance their own replication in growing zzso zzso and zzso type 5 produce viral zzso proteins that also form zzso protein complexes with zzso and zzso presumably zzso their zzso These viral proteins are also the zzso products of these zzso Thus, the mechanisms by which cancer may arise in a host, via zzso or virus infections, have fundamental common pathways zzso the same cellular genes and gene zzso zzso and zzso
