The purpose of these studies was to compare the cell zzso zzso and tumor retention of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potential agent for zzso capture therapy zzso of zzso zzso zzso were engineered from zzso zzso zzso To obtain zzso zzso a folate zzso zzso acid chemically linked to zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso was included in zzso zzso Similarly, control zzso were coated with zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized based on size, size distribution, zzso zzso and tumor cell zzso In zzso studies were carried out in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor retention studies were carried out at zzso time intervals after injection of zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso did not zzso zzso or activate zzso The retention of zzso in the blood 8, 16 and 24 h zzso was zzso zzso and zzso of the injected dose zzso zzso A maximum zzso tumor zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso had comparable tumor zzso However, the cell zzso and tumor retention of zzso zzso was significantly enhanced over zzso zzso Thus, the benefits of folate zzso coating were to facilitate tumor cell zzso and retention of zzso in the tumor zzso The engineered zzso may have potential in zzso delivery of zzso thereby enhancing the therapeutic success of zzso
