zzso a member of the B7 family of zzso zzso may participate in the negative regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is detected in some tumors and it plays a role in the occurrence and development of zzso The aim of this study was to zzso the functional and structural properties of zzso 

We developed a zzso zzso zzso against the zzso domain of zzso through zzso of zzso mice with zzso cells which expressed zzso zzso A stable zzso cell line was zzso Then, we zzso the characterization of the zzso through zzso linked zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso western zzso zzso zzso and tested the biological activity of the zzso 

zzso zzso and western zzso analyses indicated that the zzso specifically recognized zzso In addition, flow zzso demonstrated that the zzso exhibits excellent zzso when applied to zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso stained in a predominantly diffuse zzso or zzso pattern when applied to certain tumor zzso The preliminary results of the zzso biological activity showed that the zzso could effectively inhibit the function of zzso in the zzso of T cell, while promoting the growth of T cells and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This zzso will be a valuable tool for the further investigation of zzso zzso
