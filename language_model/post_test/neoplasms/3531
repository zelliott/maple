Fifty patients with zzso zzso tumors were treated with multiple doses of zzso zzso zzso Forty patients were zzso after cumulative doses of at least 20 zzso up to 160 zzso zzso effects were seen in 21 zzso partial zzso in 1 patient, minor zzso in 6 patients, and stabilization of previously progressive tumors in 14 zzso Our results thus underscore the therapeutic potential of zzso zzso zzso The toxicity was generally mild bone zzso zzso but 3 of the 6 patients who received more than 100 zzso developed a zzso syndrome or zzso zzso we consider 100 zzso as the zzso tolerable zzso With a zzso radiation dose of zzso zzso (based on previous zzso a cumulative dose of 100 zzso zzso will lead to zzso on the zzso twice the accepted limit for external beam zzso However, no development of hypertension, zzso or significant changes in serum zzso or zzso clearance were observed in our patients including 2 patients who received 106 and 113 zzso zzso without protection with zzso zzso over a follow-up period of respectively 3 and 2 zzso These findings show that the radiation of the short-range zzso 10 zzso zzso electrons originating from the cells of the zzso zzso is not harmful for the zzso zzso The decrease in serum zzso B and zzso increase of serum zzso levels in men indicate that the zzso was zzso
