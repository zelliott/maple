To determine whether there is an increased cancer zzso and mortality in populations exposed to zzso zzso from TV zzso 

An ecological study comparing cancer zzso and zzso zzso in nine zzso three of which surround the TV towers and six of which are further away from the zzso zzso zzso radiation decreases with the square of the distance from the zzso Cancer zzso and mortality data were obtained from the then Commonwealth Department of Human Services and zzso Data on frequency, power, and period of broadcasting for the three TV towers were obtained from the Commonwealth Department of Communications and the zzso The calculated power density of the zzso radiation in the exposed area ranged from zzso zzso near the towers to zzso zzso at a radius of zzso and zzso zzso at 12 zzso 

Northern Sydney, where three TV towers have been broadcasting since zzso 

Rate ratios for zzso and brain zzso zzso and zzso comparing the inner with the outer zzso 

For all ages, the rate ratio for total zzso zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso Among children, the rate ratio for zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and for mortality it was zzso zzso zzso zzso The rate ratio for childhood zzso zzso (the most common zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso Brain cancer zzso and mortality were not zzso 

We found an association between increased childhood zzso zzso and mortality and proximity to TV zzso
