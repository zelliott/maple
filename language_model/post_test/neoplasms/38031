In zzso it is crucial that the performance of zzso is predictable and zzso In this study we tested the zzso and zzso variation between zzso zzso in two homogeneous zzso Also, a zzso setup was zzso zzso performance was defined as the time it takes one zzso to lower the temperature from 0 to zzso degrees C as measured by four zzso each at 3 zzso distance from the zzso In zzso eight zzso were tested during six freeze cycles, and in gel four zzso during four freeze zzso each freeze cycle in a different cup of zzso or zzso Using more accurate zzso zzso three zzso were tested in gel during two freeze zzso A zzso zzso with four zzso was tested during two freeze cycles in both zzso and zzso zzso analyses were done using zzso for repeated zzso There was no significant zzso variation, whereas both in zzso and gel there was a significant zzso variation zzso Mean performance in gel was better than in zzso zzso Also, there was a significant variation between the four zzso zzso Using bare zzso mean performance was zzso times faster compared to zzso by regular zzso zzso In a zzso zzso overall performance seems less variable and more zzso compared to a single zzso In conclusion, the performance of zzso differs depending on the medium and measuring device zzso zzso deliver zzso freeze cycles, although there is variation between different zzso In a zzso zzso performance seems less zzso
