Currently, information to improve health status and quality of life is derived from independently designed data systems that range from zzso health surveys to health records used in managing individual patient zzso But there is no coherent strategy for using these data sources in concert across diverse zzso Thus, it is frequently difficult to compare or combine results across studies to provide zzso zzso based on findings from specific zzso

The Health Outcomes zzso is intended to be a cooperative zzso It is proposed that the National Cancer Institute and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention take leadership roles not only by adopting a core health status and zzso instrument for use in current and future cancer data collection activities but also in encouraging industry and academic investigators to implement this core instrument in their cancer zzso Having a vertically integrated core instrument can lead to more representative data for zzso decision making and ultimately for obtaining a more equitable distribution of zzso
