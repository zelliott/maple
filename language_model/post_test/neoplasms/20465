Poor efficiency of gene transfer into cancer cells constitutes the major bottleneck of current cancer gene zzso We reasoned that because tumors are masses of rapidly dividing cells, they would be most efficiently zzso with zzso systems allowing zzso zzso We thus designed two zzso zzso zzso zzso one inherently zzso zzso and one defective zzso zzso by a helper zzso In zzso both systems achieved very efficient zzso zzso In zzso mice, zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor cells, whereas defective zzso zzso zzso under similar zzso It is noteworthy that viral propagation could be efficiently blocked by zzso in zzso and in zzso In a model of established brain tumors treated with suicide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were approximately 1000 times more efficient than defective zzso zzso These results demonstrate the advantage and potential of zzso and strongly support their development for cancer gene zzso
