A model of cellular survival, zzso and transformation is presented in accordance with information zzso A cellular system is considered to be stable with respect to its environment when the vital information the cell expresses at least equals the information requirements of the zzso Environmental agents, such as zzso zzso the cell's expression of information such that an imbalance occurs between the cell's information requirement and the cell's ability to express vital zzso This zzso which is interpreted as the intrinsic zzso of the cell, serves as a measure of biological cell zzso If the cell compensates for the altered ability to express information by adapting to a less restricted set of information requirements, then one may view the cell as having undergone a zzso to a less restricted zzso This paper will zzso the mathematical zzso of cellular survival, zzso and transformation and will relate these mathematical concepts to chemical zzso
