zzso beds are generated by zzso and zzso zzso and these processes have strong zzso zzso As a result, vascular patterns exhibit significant zzso with respect to the zzso arrangement of the individual vessel segments and the characteristics zzso number of zzso of different zzso zzso This structural zzso tends to cause zzso zzso of flow and oxygen availability in zzso However, these quantities must be maintained within tolerable ranges to allow normal tissue zzso This is achieved largely through adjustment of vascular flow resistance by control of vessel zzso While short-term diameter control by changes in vascular tone in zzso and small arteries plays an important role, in the long term an even more important role is played by structural adaptation zzso occurring in response to zzso and zzso zzso The effectiveness, stability and zzso of this zzso depend sensitively on the nature and strength of the vascular responses involved and their interactions with the network zzso zzso models are helpful in understanding these complex zzso and can be used to simulate the consequences of failures in sensing or signal transmission zzso For the tumor zzso this strategy of combining experimental observations with theoretical models, has led to the hypothesis that dysfunctional information transport via vascular zzso is a major cause of the observed vascular pathology and increased zzso in oxygen zzso
