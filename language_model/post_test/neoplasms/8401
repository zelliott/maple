Two lines of evidence have suggested that the loss of tumor zzso gene function contributes to the zzso process of zzso zzso and transformed zzso are frequently suppressed in zzso cell hybrids of tumor and normal zzso zzso zzso aberrations indicating gene losses and zzso have been found in zzso and sporadic human zzso zzso zzso genes can be zzso zzso even if the zzso protein products have not been characterized zzso Here we describe a functional zzso based on DNA zzso permitting the molecular identification of candidate human tumor zzso genes zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 85, zzso zzso A molecular clone has been identified capable of suppressing the zzso zzso induced by an zzso belonging to the family of zzso zzso whose zzso is frequently found in zzso
