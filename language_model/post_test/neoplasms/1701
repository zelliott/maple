Cancer risks in persons with AIDS are increased, but risks in elderly persons with AIDS zzso have not been previously zzso 

To determine the profile of cancer risks in zzso 

Using AIDS data from zzso zzso zzso were identified zzso years old) and their records were linked to data in local cancer zzso finding zzso zzso zzso case numbers were derived from the cancer zzso in the population matched for age, sex, race, calendar year, and zzso 

Compared with the general population, the relative risk zzso for zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso in the 2 years after AIDS zzso For zzso lymphoma, the zzso was zzso zzso No cervical zzso were reported in this zzso From 60 months before to 27 months after AIDS zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso The cancer types occurring at significant excess during this period were similar to those in younger adults with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso liver cancer zzso multiple myeloma zzso leukemia zzso and lung cancer zzso However, none was significantly elevated in the 2 years after the AIDS zzso zzso cancer risk was low overall zzso zzso zzso 

The profile of cancer risks in zzso generally resembled that in younger adults with zzso although zzso were lower because of higher background zzso zzso We speculate that prostate cancer risk was low because of reduced screening for this cancer in zzso
