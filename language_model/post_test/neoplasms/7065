The zzso of zzso and zzso flow is a distinct feature of tumor zzso due to high vessel zzso low zzso pressure zzso and absence of functional zzso system inside zzso We have previously studied the tumor zzso by using a zzso coupled zzso In this paper, we extend it to a zzso case with some new considerations, to investigate tumor blood zzso on a more realist zzso and the effects of vascular zzso by zzso therapy on tumor zzso The model predict the abnormal tumor zzso and the zzso hostile zzso zzso in the zzso vessels, blood flows slowly with almost constant pressure values, zzso is much lower which contributes to zzso and necrosis formation of the tumor zzso zzso the total zzso flux is at the same order of magnitude as zzso zzso the zzso appears inside of the zzso the ratio of the total amount of zzso flux to zzso flux is about zzso for the present zzso zzso the zzso pressure is zzso high throughout the tumor and drops zzso at the zzso which leads to an extremely slow zzso flow inside the zzso and a rapidly rising zzso flow oozing out from the tumor margin into the surrounding normal zzso The investigation of the sensitivity of flows to changes in transport properties of vessels and zzso as well as the vascular density of the zzso gains an insight into how zzso of tumor zzso by zzso therapies influences the blood zzso
