zzso are an important zzso of survival for patients requiring zzso replacement therapy zzso and influence other care processes such as dialysis access formation and transplant zzso The prevalence of zzso in incident zzso patients changes with age and varies between ethnic zzso This study describes these associations and the independent effect of zzso on zzso 

zzso patients reported to the UK Renal zzso zzso with zzso data in 2009 and 2010 zzso zzso zzso were included in analyses exploring the association of zzso with patient zzso treatment zzso zzso and zzso function at start of zzso For analyses examining association between zzso and survival, adult patients starting zzso between 2005 and 2010 in zzso reporting to the zzso with zzso data zzso zzso zzso were zzso The relationship between zzso and mortality at 90 days and one year after 90 days from start of zzso were explored using Cox zzso 

zzso of zzso data was zzso in 2010 compared with zzso in zzso Of patients with data, zzso had one or more zzso Diabetes zzso and zzso heart disease were the most common conditions, observed in zzso and zzso of patients zzso zzso of incident zzso patients in the zzso period were recorded as current zzso The prevalence of zzso increased with increasing age across all ethnic zzso In multivariable survival analysis, zzso and the presence of zzso zzso were strong independent zzso of poor survival at 1 year after 90 days from the start of zzso in patients zzso zzso 

zzso in prevalence rates of zzso illnesses in incident zzso patients may reflect variation in access to health care or competing risk prior to zzso zzso The zzso of these analyses continues to be limited by poor data zzso
