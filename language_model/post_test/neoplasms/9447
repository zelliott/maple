The zzso zzso is involved in early zzso zzso Two consensus zzso binding elements zzso were found to be prerequisite for zzso zzso by the zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso together with zzso in human zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso was reported to be zzso by zzso and zzso Using reporter gene zzso here we demonstrate that deletion of the two consensus zzso fails to abrogate zzso regulation by zzso in zzso and zzso zzso while it reduces zzso in zzso zzso zzso We identified a zzso sequence zzso downstream of the major zzso initiation site that binds zzso in zzso and in zzso and its zzso compromised zzso regulation by zzso zzso this study demonstrates that the two consensus zzso reported in zzso cells are zzso for zzso regulation in normal zzso which instead use a novel zzso sequence zzso This unprecedented finding may have important implications for zzso target genes involved in zzso
