The levels of zzso zzso in serum of cancer patients have been widely used for monitoring progression of cancer growth and the effectiveness of cancer zzso Previous studies have shown that the release of zzso by tumors in patients is a complex process which depends on the rate of cell damage caused by an increasing tumor mass, or by the tumor treatment, but is not in any simple manner correlated to the number of zzso cells or to the total tumor mass zzso The complexity of the zzso process has been analyzed by a computer model which mimics the progress of tumor growth, allows the introduction of different types of treatment zzso zzso chemotherapy and zzso and zzso the amount of zzso released by the zzso and the level of zzso in blood and blood zzso The computer model can be used to obtain a better understanding of the interactions of various factors, for scheduling of treatment and zzso zzso and for analyzing the effects of zzso
