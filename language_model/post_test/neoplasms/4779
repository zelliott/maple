zzso play a critical role in regulating many cellular functions including development, differentiation and zzso To date, over 518 proteins with zzso activity, zzso zzso of total cellular zzso have been identified from within the human zzso Interestingly, approximately zzso of zzso are zzso as zzso since they lack one or more zzso zzso zzso within their zzso domain and were originally thought to have no zzso zzso Recently, there has been strong evidence to suggest that some zzso can not only function as scaffold zzso but may also possess zzso activity leading to zzso of cell zzso zzso zzso activity of these zzso can result in impaired cellular function, particularly in zzso In this review we are discussing recent evidence that apart from a scaffolding role, zzso also orchestrate cellular processes as active zzso per zzso in zzso pathways of zzso zzso
