zzso has been shown to promote cancer progression and zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso to various chemotherapy agents in cancer cells originating from a variety of zzso In this chapter, we focus on the role of zzso in drug zzso zzso studies have shown that zzso is involved in classical zzso pathways including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also promotes protective zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso Another reported mechanism by which zzso regulates drug resistance is by increasing loading of zzso resistance gene zzso 1 zzso to the zzso thereby zzso zzso protein zzso More recently, a novel function for zzso as an zzso protein was zzso which has the potential to impact expression of drug sensitivity or resistance zzso Finally, zzso acts in zzso gene zzso via an interaction with zzso zzso and zzso domain containing 1, a component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and activity induced by zzso represent an additional way that zzso may cause drug resistance in zzso The multiple functions of zzso in drug resistance highlight that it is a viable target as an zzso agent for a wide variety of zzso
