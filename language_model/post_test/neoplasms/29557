It is essential to life that a balance is maintained between processes that produce zzso and those that consume zzso An obvious way to do this would be to have systems that monitor the levels of zzso and zzso although because of the zzso zzso reaction zzso zzso is actually a more sensitive indicator of energy stress than zzso Following the discoveries that zzso zzso and zzso were regulated by zzso and zzso Daniel Atkinson proposed that all zzso at branch points between zzso and degradation would be regulated by zzso zzso This turned out to be correct, but what Atkinson did not anticipate was that sensing of zzso would, in most cases, be performed not by the zzso zzso themselves, but by a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso occurs in essentially all zzso and consists of zzso complexes zzso zzso zzso zzso and regulatory zzso and zzso zzso of which the latter carries the zzso zzso Once activated by a zzso stress, it zzso numerous targets that alter zzso activity and gene expression to initiate corrective zzso In lower zzso it is critically involved in the responses to zzso for a carbon zzso Because of its ability to switch cellular metabolism from anabolic to zzso mode, zzso has become a key drug target to combat zzso disorders associated with zzso such as zzso diabetes, and some existing zzso drugs zzso zzso and many zzso work by zzso zzso usually via zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also potentially have zzso effects, and there is already evidence that zzso provides protection against the initiation of zzso Whether zzso zzso can be used to treat existing cancer is less clear, because many zzso cells appear to have been selected for zzso that zzso the zzso zzso However, if we can identify the various mechanisms by which this occurs, we may be able to find ways of overcoming zzso
