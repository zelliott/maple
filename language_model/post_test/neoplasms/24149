To assess the possibility of increasing the detection rates of zzso examination in zzso zzso by the selection of specific tumor markers for a given type of zzso we measured zzso CA zzso CA zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso from 89 patients with the following primary zzso zzso stomach, breast, liver, zzso zzso and zzso zzso examination was positive in only 35 of 89 patients zzso while the tumor markers were positive in 72 of 89 cases zzso However, apart from small cell lung and kidney zzso where the lack of a specific tumor marker resulted in no advantage, in the other types of tumors, the specific marker for each tumor identified correctly zzso zzso in 72 of 74 cases zzso In fact, zzso was positive in 11 of 11 zzso induced by zzso zzso CA zzso in 28 of 30 gastric cancer zzso while zzso and CA zzso were positive in breast cancer zzso zzso and zzso Finally, elevated zzso and zzso indicated zzso and prostate cancer, zzso In conclusion, in cancer patients with elevated zzso levels of specific tumor zzso the zzso could be considered of a zzso nature even without zzso zzso tumor zzso
