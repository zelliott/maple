Previous studies in our laboratory have indicated the presence of zzso zzso in tumors which were not detected in normal zzso Some of the zzso zzso produced in these studies were shown to identify a zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso of tumor zzso but not in normal human liver zzso A zzso zzso to a Mr zzso zzso protein zzso was produced by zzso of mice with a zzso extract of zzso cells which is enriched with this zzso The zzso zzso showed bright zzso zzso zzso in a broad range of human tumors including zzso of the gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, muscle, cartilage, and zzso The zzso zzso zzso was not detected in most normal human zzso or in benign tumors, with only weak zzso zzso observed in zzso of the zzso and in zzso regions of some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was extracted from zzso cell zzso by homogenization in a zzso M zzso buffer containing zzso zzso On zzso density zzso zzso the zzso remained zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was released from zzso following treatment with 4 M zzso zzso or zzso zzso mapping of zzso zzso zzso showed that it was distinct from other known zzso zzso Although it remains to be determined if the zzso zzso plays a role in cell zzso maintenance of the zzso zzso or in cell division, it may have value as a tumor marker or as a therapeutic zzso
