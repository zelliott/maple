During zzso zzso cells accumulate secondary zzso and/or zzso aberrations that generate genetic diversity within the zzso cell zzso This may result in the acquisition of new properties that increase zzso zzso such as zzso or resistance to zzso One of the important mechanisms of chemotherapy resistance is zzso or zzso zzso of ABC family zzso ABC zzso remove anti zzso drugs from the cell, reducing their zzso concentration and producing resistance against a wide range of chemically unrelated drugs, known as zzso resistant zzso zzso During recent decades, much effort has been devoted to the isolation of compounds able to inhibit the activity of these zzso However, few such compounds have reached clinical practice and zzso remains a serious complication in cancer zzso In an innovative approach to finding new ABC zzso we propose using zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso of zzso that would enable zzso screening of natural compounds and chemical libraries for molecules that zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tools provide zzso zzso and cell biological analysis, thereby zzso identification of drug zzso zzso zzso and zzso of ABC zzso could be used in combination with zzso drugs for the treatment of zzso resistant zzso
