The impact of pandemic zzso influenza zzso virus in pediatric cancer is zzso The objectives of this study were to characterize the clinical course of zzso and identify factors associated with severe zzso 

We conducted a Canadian zzso retrospective review of children with cancer and stem cell transplant zzso recipients who were diagnosed with zzso zzso infection between May 1, 2009 and January 31, zzso 

We identified 100 (19 in wave 1 and 81 in wave 2) cases of zzso zzso Median age was zzso zzso zzso had a zzso zzso and zzso received zzso Median duration of fever and illness was 2 and zzso days, zzso 51 zzso were hospitalized for a median of 5 days, with no deaths and only 1 requiring admission to the intensive care zzso zzso confirmed pneumonia was diagnosed in 10 zzso zzso of chemotherapy or conditioning occurred in 43 zzso In multivariable zzso age zzso years zzso to zzso 10 zzso and zzso were associated with hospitalization while zzso was associated with zzso Despite zzso use in zzso viral shedding was prolonged zzso 46 zzso and often persisted after symptom zzso However, an extended treatment course zzso zzso correlated with shortened duration of viral shedding zzso 

zzso infection in pediatric cancer and zzso patients infrequently caused complications but commonly interrupted cancer zzso zzso shedding of virus after illness resolution was zzso Further research is needed to verify this finding as it could have implications for treatment guidelines and infection control zzso
