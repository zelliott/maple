Gene expression in the cellular zzso is subject to changes caused by internal and external zzso Due to different expression of gene sets zzso cells show different zzso and functional zzso Environmental and occupational toxic agents may influence cells at the level of zzso and zzso The functional zzso attempts to explain those zzso Due to recent developments in molecular biology and zzso it has become possible to analyze protein transcript zzso and profile zzso This work reports new opportunities to study gene sequencing and expression by means of the DNA chip technique zzso analysis of the genetic zzso and the zzso technique zzso analysis of hundreds or thousands of zzso The authors report examples of some practical applications of zzso in the assessment of the effects of pathological zzso to environmental and occupational toxic zzso zzso and/or zzso agents, due to the development of new groups of zzso such as zzso of individual zzso zzso of toxic effects combined with the zzso of the relationship between a toxic agent and its dose, and the effect measured at the level of the cellular zzso and results of zzso and zzso zzso
