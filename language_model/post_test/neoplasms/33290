zzso zzso regions zzso are associated with many imprinted zzso In mice zzso at a zzso upstream of the zzso gene known as the zzso Control region zzso is acquired in the male zzso and influences the zzso status of zzso 100 zzso away in the adjacent zzso growth factor 2 zzso gene through long-range zzso In humans, zzso or zzso acquired zzso defects at zzso are associated with zzso zzso or repression of zzso resulting in the zzso growth disorders zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso cancer, zzso expression of zzso has been observed in association with loss of zzso at a zzso in zzso This zzso known as zzso has been shown to be zzso on the silent maternal zzso zzso presumably with a role in zzso The effect of zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso of zzso or zzso is zzso 

We zzso the zzso status of the zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso patients by conventional zzso sequencing and zzso We show here that, contrary to previous reports, the zzso zzso is actually zzso on the active paternal zzso in peripheral blood and zzso This is similar to the zzso zzso status and is inconsistent with the proposed zzso function of the maternal zzso zzso zzso and zzso patients with zzso zzso defects have similar zzso defects at the zzso zzso consistent with zzso regulating zzso at zzso in zzso In zzso zzso however, zzso profiles of zzso and zzso zzso are indicative of zzso changes occurring on both parental zzso rather than in zzso 

These results support a model in which zzso and zzso have opposite zzso to global zzso and zzso during zzso independent of the parent of origin zzso In contrast, during zzso zzso is zzso or zzso according to the zzso zzso imprint at the zzso indicating different mechanisms of zzso loss in zzso and zzso zzso
