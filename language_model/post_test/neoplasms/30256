zzso and zzso can result in zzso failure and premature zzso However, there is still a paucity of information on the zzso reserve and efficacy of assisted reproduction treatment zzso procedures in patients with cancer previously exposed to chemotherapy or zzso The aim of our study was to evaluate the zzso reserve and zzso response to zzso or in zzso maturation zzso treatment in women who had previously been treated with zzso 

In this retrospective cohort study, we compared 23 women with cancer who had undergone chemotherapy and subsequently underwent fertility treatment with zzso zzso or zzso zzso In the zzso group, patients mostly had zzso zzso zzso bone and soft tissue zzso whereas in the zzso group patients had zzso positive breast cancer, zzso and brain zzso The control zzso group consisted of 70 zzso women with male factor zzso undergoing the same treatment protocol zzso zzso and zzso zzso All women were zzso years and undergoing their first cycle of zzso 

There were no differences in age and zzso levels between the cancer and the control zzso However, the zzso zzso count zzso was lower in the zzso group zzso 5, zzso zzso than in the control group zzso 15, zzso zzso zzso Women with cancer treated with zzso had lower peak zzso levels on the day of zzso administration than controls zzso and lower number of zzso retrieved zzso zzso zzso zzso versus 12 zzso in zzso zzso In patients with cancer treated with zzso the AFC was lower than in the control group zzso 14, zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, the number of zzso retrieved was lower in the zzso group zzso 6, zzso zzso than that in the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The percentage of mature zzso II zzso was comparable in the cancer and control zzso 

The zzso reserve, response to zzso and number of zzso retrieved are adversely affected by previous zzso This study reports the first series of zzso outcomes in cancer patients with a prior history of zzso In women with zzso positive breast cancer, zzso of zzso with zzso of zzso or zzso is a viable zzso Since the efficacy of ART is significantly reduced after chemotherapy, early referral for fertility preservation before zzso treatment will give these young women the best chance to zzso
