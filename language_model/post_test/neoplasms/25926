To evaluate the impact of cardiac disease and second zzso zzso on late mortality rate and to identify risk factors for late mortality among 15-year survivors of cancer diagnosed during childhood or zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso disease, zzso standardized mortality ratios were zzso zzso survival estimates and Cox zzso analyses were performed to determine the relationship of several demographic and treatment variables to zzso 

Patients who survived for 15 years after diagnosis had excess subsequent zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso and cardiac mortality zzso No decrease in the late mortality rate by treatment era zzso to 1970, 1971 to zzso was zzso zzso factors for males included disease recurrence during the first 15 years after diagnosis, treatment with zzso and the diagnosis of Hodgkin's zzso Those for females included treatment with radiation therapy, treatment with an zzso agent, and disease recurrence during the first 15 years after zzso Cox zzso analysis demonstrated that only an initial duration of zzso of less than 15 years zzso zzso and treatment with zzso zzso zzso were significantly associated with shorter survival time for zzso No variable was significantly associated with shorter survival time for females in Cox zzso zzso 

zzso survivors of childhood cancer have excess zzso More effective treatments must be developed to reduce this excess zzso zzso zzso survivors did not have excess zzso This group will require continued observation to determine whether excess mortality will become apparent as more events zzso
