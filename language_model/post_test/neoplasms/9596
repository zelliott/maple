zzso advances in early detection of and treatment strategies for cancer have led to burgeoning numbers of cancer zzso While most therapeutic zzso for cancer are beneficial and zzso they are associated with adverse long-term and late zzso 

Literature review using zzso to identify studies examining adverse medical outcomes and zzso follow-up care among long-term zzso Emerging concepts in zzso research such as definitional issues, research zzso and zzso concerns were also zzso 

zzso or late adverse zzso are more zzso serious, and persistent than expected in survivors of pediatric and adult cancer, but remain zzso especially among those diagnosed as zzso zzso care relevant to zzso outcomes is neither standardized nor zzso or evidence based for most adult zzso and optimal practices have yet to be zzso 

zzso zzso contribute to burden of illness, health care costs, and decreased length and quality of zzso zzso very few studies have compared zzso outcomes zzso post zzso It is critical to examine zzso questions and zzso zzso zzso Regular follow-up care and monitoring of health status post cancer treatment should 1) permit the timely diagnosis and treatment of adverse zzso 2) enable timely diagnosis and treatment of zzso 3) facilitate screening and early detection of second zzso 4) allow for detection and management of zzso and 5) provide the opportunity for preventive strategies such as lifestyle zzso Research findings zzso underscore the need for continued cancer zzso research that will: inform our understanding of the mechanisms underlying adverse zzso lead to the design of less toxic zzso test the effectiveness of interventions - zzso zzso and behavioral - that reduce adverse zzso test models of zzso follow-up care; develop an evidence base for optimal follow-up care practices; and inform zzso and provider decision zzso
