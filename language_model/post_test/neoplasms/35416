A zzso zzso mixture model (which assumes that the data has a probability mass at zero and a continuous response for values greater than zzso with left zzso due to zzso zzso falling below detection limits has been applied to compare treatment groups in zzso clinical trials and zzso cohort zzso The sample size calculation (for a given type I error rate and a desired statistical power) has not been studied for this type of data under the assumption of equal proportions of true zeros in the treatment and control zzso In this article, we derive the sample sizes based on the expected differences between the zzso values of individuals in treatment and control zzso zzso for calculation of statistical power are also zzso When computing the sample sizes, caution is needed as some irregularities occur, namely that the location zzso is sometimes underestimated due to the mixture distribution and left zzso In such cases, the aforementioned methods zzso We calculated the required sample size for a recent zzso zzso trial zzso the effect of zzso on reducing zzso A zzso Carlo simulation study was also conducted to investigate the performance of the proposed zzso The simulation results illustrate that the proposed methods provide adequate sample size zzso However, when the aforementioned zzso occurs, our methods are restricted and further research is zzso
