Among recipients of zzso transplants, the zzso of zzso cancer and gastrointestinal cancer are higher and that of skin cancer is much lower in Japan than in Europe and North zzso 

The risk factors for the development of zzso tumors were examined in Japanese recipients of zzso zzso A total of 556 patients underwent zzso transplantation at the Department of zzso zzso University Faculty of Medicine between March 1, 1965, and April 31, zzso Of these patients, zzso were zzso studied in whom risk factors potentially related to the development of zzso could be evaluated on the basis of medical zzso The zzso of zzso survival rate, and risk factors for zzso were zzso 

The overall zzso of zzso was zzso zzso zzso Six of the 25 patients with zzso died of cancer, but there was no correlation between the occurrence of zzso and the survival rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A Cox zzso model identified treatment with zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and age at transplantation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as risk factors for zzso 

The results of zzso analysis suggested that age at transplantation and the use of zzso were independent risk factors for the development of zzso in recipients of zzso zzso
