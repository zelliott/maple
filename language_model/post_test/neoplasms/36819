To evaluate the zzso of sequencing (based on zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso at two dose levels with zzso zzso and zzso C zzso zzso zzso for 60 zzso 

Nine patients with zzso cancer were treated from October 1995 to June zzso The study zzso a total of 20 zzso treatment zzso Three patients were treated at zzso dose level I zzso zzso and six patients were treated at zzso dose level II zzso zzso zzso was delivered as a zzso intravenous infusion, 48 h prior to the combination of zzso and zzso zzso was given over 10 zzso at target temperature at a dose of zzso zzso zzso based on a previous phase I zzso zzso zzso was administered with an zzso radiant heat zzso 

zzso was the major toxicity associated with therapy, but there were no instances of bleeding or zzso zzso Grade 3 zzso was seen with zzso of zzso Regarding absolute zzso count, zzso of treatments were associated with grade 3 zzso and zzso with grade 4 zzso and regarding white blood cell count, 50% of treatments were associated with grade 3 toxicity and zzso with grade 4 zzso The zzso observed was equivalent to that seen in our earlier phase I study of zzso and zzso (without zzso Only mild zzso zzso 1 or 2) were associated with zzso these were seen with zzso of treatments and included zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso There were no instances of zzso There was no relationship between zzso observed and the two zzso dose zzso zzso zzso zzso were seen with less than zzso of zzso these included zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso included two complete zzso zzso melanoma, zzso dose level zzso breast cancer, zzso dose level zzso and two disease zzso (both zzso melanoma, zzso dose level zzso 

We conclude that the combination of zzso zzso and zzso is well tolerated at the dose levels zzso The clinical results justify further clinical investigation for this zzso treatment zzso
