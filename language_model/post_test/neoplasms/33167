A major role for zzso in the proliferation of normal cells is attributed to its ability to promote progression through zzso and into S phase of the cell zzso The absolute requirement of zzso for cell cycle progression in human tumor cells has not been zzso zzso In the present work, we used a zzso short hairpin zzso zzso expression zzso to zzso reduce zzso expression in a large number of human tumor cell lines and in three different types of normal human zzso In all cases, cell proliferation was severely zzso with normal cells ultimately undergoing zzso growth zzso In contrast, tumor cells demonstrated a much more variable cell cycle response with cells from several lines accumulating in S or zzso zzso Moreover, in some tumor lines, the phase of cell cycle arrest caused by zzso of zzso could be altered by depleting tumor zzso protein zzso or its zzso target zzso Our data suggest that, as in the case of normal cells, zzso is essential for sustaining proliferation of human tumor zzso However its zzso role in cell cycle control is variable and is zzso upon the status of other cell cycle zzso
