Since the discovery of zzso zzso as a zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 1997, our knowledge related to the function of this zzso has been extended from simple zzso zzso to complicated, zzso processes that involve interference of zzso zzso zzso and even DNA repair zzso However, despite the growing amount of knowledge related to zzso in the last ten years, the development of zzso zzso or zzso molecular therapies is surprisingly and relatively slow as compared to other therapeutic zzso for cancer zzso Here, the molecular functions of zzso and the progress of development of zzso therapies are discussed in zzso zzso differences between different zzso zzso are discussed from both structural and zzso point of zzso This review also reveals different challenges that scientists are currently facing in the development of zzso zzso for clinical zzso Finally, future directions for the development of zzso therapies are discussed in this zzso
