The aim of this study was to evaluate seven zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein was studied by zzso in zzso human archival normal and zzso zzso zzso zzso technique was used, and the seven zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were tested in various zzso using different zzso zzso All seven VT zzso specifically zzso the zzso of zzso of zzso cells in normal zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso tumor cells of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was confirmed by several controls, zzso Western zzso on proteins extracted from zzso tissue showed that the zzso zzso reacted specifically with a protein band of approximately 28 zzso corresponding to the molecular mass of zzso However, sensitivity varied with the different zzso Use of zzso zzso retrieval zzso and the zzso clone applied at low zzso demonstrated more intense zzso with the zzso cell types compared to the other six zzso Furthermore, when tested on a range of normal and zzso zzso zzso the zzso clone demonstrated zzso with all neuroendocrine cell zzso In conclusion, all seven zzso detected zzso protein in various normal and zzso zzso zzso but one zzso zzso was superior for zzso zzso of zzso in zzso tissue sections when using zzso
