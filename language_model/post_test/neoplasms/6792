The expression of zzso zzso a zzso member of a family of zzso zzso is frequently suppressed in many human zzso zzso evidence suggests that zzso zzso tumor zzso however, the mechanisms by which zzso suppresses tumor formation remain to be zzso To study this, we targeted the zzso zzso in a mouse by replacing zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso mice were not viable because of an early embryonic lethal zzso Although zzso mice appeared zzso normal, they displayed an increased zzso of a variety of spontaneous tumors as they zzso Moreover, zzso 6-week-old zzso mice developed an increased zzso of high-grade T cell zzso of zzso origin compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso mice exhibited an attenuated zzso response to zzso compared with zzso zzso Additionally, zzso primary mouse embryonic zzso demonstrated a defective zzso cell cycle checkpoint after zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is a zzso tumor zzso and, importantly, open new avenues for investigation into the mechanisms by which disruption of zzso pathways could play a role in zzso and response to zzso
