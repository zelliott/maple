zzso is a rare zzso disorder which, among other clinical signs, is characterized by an extreme sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso isolated from AT patients show zzso DNA synthesis and this has lead to the hypothesis that the product of the genetic zzso of AT may play a role in the zzso zzso or repair of double stranded DNA zzso The gene to zzso called zzso has been recently cloned and zzso It codes for a large zzso transcript of 13,000 zzso of which a 3,500 zzso protein is zzso The gene itself covers 150 zzso spread over 64 zzso The zzso acid sequence has revealed the existence, at the zzso end of the zzso of a domain presenting zzso to zzso zzso This characteristic has allowed the description of a new family of nuclear zzso in zzso zzso an human, functionally involved in DNA damage zzso It is interesting to note that a vast majority of zzso described in AT patients lead to the zzso of the protein and consequently to the elimination of the zzso domain, thus suggesting an important role in the normal function of the zzso An important question linked to AT zzso concerns the cancer risk associated to zzso zzso It is well established that AT patients, zzso for the zzso present a zzso fold increased risk of zzso zzso studies have described a 3-5 fold increase risk of cancer zzso breast cancer in zzso associated to the zzso zzso Knowing that the zzso of the zzso can be estimated to range zzso to zzso in the general population this question is of great importance in terms of public zzso
