Since initial reports of use of a human tumor cloning system to predict response or lack of response of a patient's tumor to chemotherapy, there have been approximately zzso clinical correlations zzso Overall, the percent true zzso has been zzso while the percent true zzso has been zzso Despite the high reliability of this system to predict patient response or lack of response, the cloning zzso has not been put into general clinical zzso zzso for this include the past inability to grow a majority of the patients' zzso and lack of controlled trials demonstrating an advantage of a cloning zzso choice over a zzso zzso Both of these problems are being addressed with greatly improved abilities to grow patient zzso zzso of patients' tumors can now be grown in zzso and the reporting of results of zzso controlled zzso zzso It is likely that the most significant limitation for the human tumor cloning zzso will be the lack of agents with in zzso zzso It is proposed that we are in the zzso zzso of in zzso drug sensitivity testing of human zzso It is unlikely any zzso zzso will be of major utility until a more active spectrum of agents becomes available for in zzso testing and in zzso zzso
