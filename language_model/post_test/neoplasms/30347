zzso zzso loaded zzso zzso were prepared using zzso assembly of the zzso over zzso zzso zzso was zzso to provide positive charge to the zzso which were subsequently coated with zzso zzso zzso acid zzso followed by coating of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of various process variables were carried out and zzso zzso was found to have particle size of zzso zzso of zzso zzso potential zzso and zzso efficiency of zzso The developed zzso was further subjected to zzso using a universal zzso freeze drying zzso The zzso zzso was found to be stable in simulated gastrointestinal zzso and at accelerated stability zzso zzso drug release studies revealed that zzso zzso was able to sustain the drug release for zzso release pattern being zzso zzso Furthermore, cell culture experiments showed higher zzso of zzso from lung zzso zzso cell lines as compared to free zzso This was subsequently zzso by zzso zzso which revealed zzso value of zzso for developed zzso zzso in contrast to zzso for free zzso The zzso zzso studies revealed about zzso fold increase in the overall oral zzso of zzso as compared to that of free zzso zzso zzso efficacy in zzso induced breast tumor model showed significant reduction in the tumor growth as compared to the control and comparable to that of zzso zzso In addition, the toxicity studies were carried out to confirm the safety profile of the developed zzso and it was found to be significantly higher as compared to zzso zzso the developed zzso strategy can be fruitfully exploited to improve the oral zzso of zzso deliver zzso
