The zzso zzso project was initiated by the Norwegian Cancer Society in zzso The serum bank comprises close to zzso million serum samples collected from 170,000 zzso From zzso consecutive samples are available from each zzso The zzso are stored at zzso degrees zzso At regular intervals the zzso is matched against the files of the Norwegian Cancer zzso From 1973 to 1991 almost zzso of the donors have developed some form of zzso Frozen serum samples collected from a few months to 18 years prior to clinical recognition of their disease are consequently available for research zzso The aim of the zzso is to search in these zzso zzso for chemical, zzso zzso or other changes that might be indicative of cancer development at early zzso Gas zzso zzso and two-dimensional protein zzso have been used to evaluate the stability of the frozen zzso Some recent findings are: zzso is elevated several months prior to diagnosis of zzso zzso serum zzso may be a zzso zzso marker in zzso of zzso zzso low level of zzso in serum reflects increased risk of zzso zzso and raised zzso in serum against zzso virus is a risk factor for development of Hodgkin's zzso zzso research includes trace elements and cancer, and studies on zzso diet and zzso The serum bank may in principle be used for other purposes, zzso in environmental zzso Analysis of sequential zzso may determine chemical substances in the zzso that might reflect differences in exposure to environmental pollutants in the period zzso
