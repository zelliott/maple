zzso loss of zzso zzso is a frequent event in various human zzso including mantle cell zzso zzso prostate cancer, head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso The tumor necrosis zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso are located within this zzso zzso Since recent studies demonstrate that chronic zzso leukemia zzso and prostate cells are TRAIL induced zzso zzso are strong tumor zzso candidate genes in human zzso exhibiting loss of zzso material in zzso However, no zzso of the TRAIL zzso genes has been reported in zzso zzso prostate cancer, zzso so zzso In this study we analyzed the complete coding region of zzso and zzso in a series of 32 zzso and 101 zzso samples and detected a single zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with tumor specific zzso zzso We examined zzso distribution in 395 samples of different tumor entities zzso cancer, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 40; zzso cancer, zzso zzso zzso and compared them to 137 samples from healthy zzso We found the rare zzso of zzso is more frequent in zzso zzso prostate cancer, zzso cancer and zzso The zzso zzso did not zzso with other zzso zzso previously zzso Thus screening for zzso zzso exchanges may become important in diagnosis and/or treatment of these zzso
