zzso zzso zzso was zzso from tumor tissue under mild conditions at neutral pH by a procedure that zzso affinity zzso on zzso zzso Further zzso by gel zzso provided zzso in 10 to zzso yield and zzso zzso zzso to this preparation was rendered specific for zzso by zzso on a column of normal liver proteins bound to zzso On reaction by zzso against a crude tumor zzso the zzso zzso produced two zzso lines, of which one was relatively zzso These two zzso lines fused completely with the two respective lines produced by zzso to zzso zzso zzso The major zzso found in crude tumor extracts and in zzso preparations zzso at neutral pH was nearly zzso in zzso acid extracts of tumor zzso Further investigations showed that 60 to zzso of the zzso in crude tumor extracts and in preparations isolated at zzso pH is destroyed and/or becomes zzso zzso zzso
