The restriction site zzso zzso method has been developed over the past 13 years as a sensitive zzso test which can detect zzso in restriction sites in any zzso Due to the fact that zzso of the main zzso hotspots in the zzso gene fall within restriction sites, zzso can zzso them for the presence of rare zzso (1 zzso in zzso zzso zzso After zzso the usefulness of zzso in detecting zzso zzso we recently turned our attention to looking for zzso zzso in zzso zzso We show here that zzso can detect early zzso zzso in zzso tissue of the zzso stomach, colon and zzso We can also use these clinical zzso data to speculate as to the zzso zzso involved in these cancer zzso We here use an example of zzso detected in gastric tissue and those induced in zzso by hydrogen zzso
