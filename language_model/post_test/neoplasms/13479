Previous studies from our laboratory revealed a novel protein of zzso zzso on the surface of zzso cell lines of zzso origin that exhibit zzso to zzso natural killer zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso was not detected on the surface of zzso zzso zzso cell lines or normal zzso We now report that this protein is zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell lines of both zzso and zzso origin compared with zzso zzso To characterize zzso further, we used a previously developed zzso zzso zzso to probe zzso expression libraries and subsequently performed zzso extension by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso analyses of these zzso clones reveal open reading frames zzso that include the previously identified zzso zzso from zzso native zzso and that have identical sequences to a gene of unknown function on zzso zzso zzso sequence data obtained from these zzso zzso as well as analysis of the zzso zzso permitted design of zzso for reverse zzso chain reaction zzso that resulted in a zzso clone zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso the clone was identical to a sequence zzso by an unpublished zzso in zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso in zzso 5 and against a zzso zzso zzso in zzso 1 both reacted with the same protein in zzso studies, providing further evidence of zzso zzso and Northern zzso analyses both demonstrated zzso gene transcripts in normal cells, zzso cell lines and zzso cell lines of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso studies revealed a greater level of zzso gene zzso in zzso cell lines compared with zzso zzso zzso analyses of protein expression confirmed and extended the latter studies by revealing substantially greater levels of the zzso zzso protein in whole cell extracts of zzso cell lines compared with zzso zzso zzso differences in detection of the zzso zzso protein and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso were not zzso These experiments suggest that the zzso gene zzso is widely expressed in human cells of different tissue origins but that elevated expression is associated with the zzso zzso
