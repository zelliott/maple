Cancer is the second biggest killer of zzso zzso For some zzso the mortality rate is more than three times higher in zzso people than for zzso zzso The zzso zzso of Cancer Care Study explored barriers to and zzso of cancer diagnosis and treatment among zzso and Torres Strait zzso people in New South zzso 

Our zzso includes both zzso and zzso zzso in-depth interviews between 2009 and 2010 with zzso people with cancer, their zzso and health professionals who care for zzso In this paper, we identify zzso patterns of zzso zzso in the 16 interviews with health care zzso We are particularly interested in how these frames assisted participants in constructing a professional position on what zzso zzso means for the design and delivery of cancer care services to zzso zzso 

Despite zzso zzso disciplinary and cultural diversity, these interview participants consistently drew upon six discursive zzso which we have interpreted as either zzso a discussion of difference zzso is the zzso and zzso is zzso or zzso that discussion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso difference zzso An additional strategy appeared to actively resist either of these positions but then tended to ultimately zzso the zzso zzso 

While none of our participants were dismissive of the idea that cultural identity might matter to zzso people, their reliance upon familiar narratives about what that means for cancer care services has the potential to both symbolically and practically exclude the voices of a group of people who may already feel disenfranchised from the mainstream health care zzso zzso zzso the zzso for zzso assumptions behind how health care professionals make sense of cultural difference can enrich our understanding of and response to the care needs of indigenous people affected by zzso
