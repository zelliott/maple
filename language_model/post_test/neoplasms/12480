Global gene expression analysis is beginning to move from the laboratories of basic investigators to large-scale clinical zzso The potential of this technology to improve diagnosis and tailored treatment of human disease may soon be zzso now that several comprehensive studies have demonstrated the utility of gene expression profiles for the zzso of zzso into zzso clinically relevant zzso and the prediction of clinical zzso In addition, new data from the emerging zzso platforms add another layer of molecular information to the study of human disease, as scientists attempt to zzso a complete inventory of the proteins zzso by the zzso and to establish a zzso profile of human health and zzso As a result, it is anticipated that, together, these technologies will facilitate the comprehensive study of zzso gene products and zzso pathways so that the objective of personalized molecular medicine can be zzso This paper will review the studies that best demonstrate how zzso and zzso technologies can be used to improve cancer diagnosis and treatment it will specifically highlight the important work being incorporated into clinical zzso
