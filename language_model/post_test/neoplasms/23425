zzso zzso is frequently present in stem cell zzso We investigated the value of this zzso modification in zzso DNA in order to establish the implications of zzso zzso for zzso zzso Therefore we used the restriction zzso zzso and zzso within a combined multiplex zzso and targeted zzso approach for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 544 zzso sites in zzso zzso gene regions, the zzso zzso status of the zzso breast cancer cell line and blood from healthy volunteers and childhood ALL was zzso zzso analysis of zzso data and subsequent zzso green based zzso on DNA zzso was applied to confirm the results from the zzso zzso 

The zzso experiments identified for the zzso cell line the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and in childhood ALL the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso upon restriction zzso did not confirm the presence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In ALL samples only zzso was found harboring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, applying zzso for multiple testing that zzso was not rated as statistically significant zzso We concluded that zzso zzso in 544 zzso sites analyzed did not change in tumor zzso Thus any change of the zzso zzso pattern is a minor event in zzso even if the stem cell markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed like in the zzso breast cancer cell zzso
