We find the dose distribution that zzso the zzso control probability zzso for a fixed mean zzso dose per zzso We consider a zzso zzso volume having a radiation response characterized by the linear zzso model with zzso zzso and zzso rate that may vary in zzso Using zzso calculus methods a general solution is zzso We demonstrate the spatial dependence of the optimal dose distribution by explicitly evaluating the solution for different functional forms of the zzso zzso For homogeneous zzso and growth rate, we find that the dose distribution that zzso zzso is homogeneous when the zzso cell density is zzso while for a zzso initial zzso density we find that the first dose fraction is zzso which zzso the zzso cell density, and subsequent dose zzso are zzso When the zzso properties have explicit spatial zzso we show that the spatial variation of the zzso dose distribution is insensitive to the functional zzso However, the dose distribution and zzso zzso density are sensitive to the value of the zzso zzso The zzso dose distribution yields a higher zzso than a typical clinical dose distribution or a homogeneous dose zzso
