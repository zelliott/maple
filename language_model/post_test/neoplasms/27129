To determine the zzso dose zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso profile of zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso 

In this zzso phase I study, zzso was administered orally, once daily in three weekly cycles to patients with advanced zzso using a zzso accelerated zzso zzso Three intermittent schedules were subsequently zzso four days zzso days zzso every Monday, Wednesday, Friday zzso and every Monday and Thursday zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinical efficacy were evaluated at each zzso 

zzso patients were treated in continuous daily zzso zzso and three intermittent dosing schedules zzso zzso zzso adverse events zzso fatigue, zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso zzso observed were predominantly zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso were fatigue and abnormal liver function zzso The maximum plasma concentration zzso and area under the plasma zzso curve zzso of zzso increased zzso with zzso zzso evaluation showed increased zzso zzso 3 in hair zzso skin and tumor zzso and in peripheral blood zzso cells as well as decreased zzso in skin and tumor zzso A partial response lasting five months was seen in one patient with zzso zzso disease was seen in eight patients zzso zzso zzso 

The adverse event profile of zzso was comparable with that of other zzso zzso schedules were better tolerated than continuous zzso On the basis of zzso zzso predictions, and zzso effects, the recommended dose for phase II studies is 12 zzso on the zzso zzso
