zzso disposal and zzso zzso zzso remain the two principal options for managing municipal solid waste zzso One critical zzso of the zzso of these options is the different health risks associated with zzso In this analysis relying on published data and exposure zzso we have performed health risk assessments for landfill disposal versus zzso treatment options for the management of New York City's zzso These are based on the realistic scenario of using a waste transfer station zzso in Brooklyn and then transporting the zzso zzso by truck to a landfill in Pennsylvania or using a zzso facility in Brooklyn and then transporting the zzso ash by truck to a landfill in zzso The overall results indicate that the individual cancer risks for both options would be considered generally acceptable, although the risk from zzso is approximately 5 times greater than from zzso zzso the individual zzso health risks for both options would be considered generally unacceptable, although once again the risk from zzso is approximately 5 times greater than from zzso zzso If one considers only the population in Brooklyn that would be directly affected by the zzso of either a zzso or a zzso facility in their immediate neighborhood, individual cancer and zzso health risks for both options would be considered generally acceptable, but risks for the former remain considerably higher than for the zzso These results should be considered preliminary due to several limitations of this study such zzso consideration of risks only from inhalation zzso assumption that only volume and not composition of the waste stream is altered by zzso zzso reliance on data from the literature rather than actual zzso of the sites considered, assuming zzso of the zzso However, the results of studies such as this, in conjunction with zzso socioeconomic and equity considerations, should prove useful to environmental managers, regulators, policy makers, community representatives and other zzso in making sound and acceptable decisions regarding the optimal handling of zzso
