zzso association studies using recently developed large scale single zzso zzso platforms are beginning to be performed, and results zzso zzso indications are that these studies are capable of discovering zzso associated with relative risks too modest to have been zzso through zzso linkage zzso However, as these studies initially test 500,000 or more zzso in a first series of cases and controls, the need for robust replication in one, or zzso several independent studies is paramount to zzso out the true positive results from the large number of expected false zzso We discuss the need for the formation of zzso to conduct these zzso studies, and stress the importance of full disclosure of zzso zzso in cases and controls from these studies in order to facilitate joint analyses across zzso to speed discovery of zzso associations, and to explore more complex associations such as zzso zzso zzso characteristics of studies in which zzso association studies will be most zzso are zzso The validation of genetic zzso that alter risk of specific zzso may be relevant to zzso the identification of high risk persons for zzso interventions, and the discovery of new biological mechanisms that may provide insight into cancer causes and preventive zzso
