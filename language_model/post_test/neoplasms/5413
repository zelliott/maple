zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may soon be routinely used as a proliferation marker in adult zzso zzso So far, no data have been available on normal or zzso zzso values in zzso Therefore the present study was designed to test the marker for the first time in pediatric zzso Using a commercial zzso kit zzso zzso serum zzso levels were determined in zzso healthy children and compared with various benign zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In healthy children, we found an zzso distribution of zzso zzso Median zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso at birth as determined from zzso zzso blood zzso zzso zzso By the end of the first week, the value rose to M zzso zzso zzso and then continuously decreased with age until reaching the adult level at around 14 zzso Patients with benign masses zzso zzso 29) did not show elevated serum zzso in contrast to children with zzso Advanced tumor stage, zzso and low dignity correlated with an increase in serum zzso In many cases, chemotherapy and especially surgical zzso of the tumor were followed by a decrease of the previously markedly elevated zzso zzso Severe infections and impaired zzso function were however related with very high values and this must be taken into account when judging the zzso of zzso zzso The marker appears useful for the differential diagnosis between benign and zzso zzso While previous investigators described its use exclusively in zzso tumors of adults, we cannot confirm this zzso in pediatric zzso Our data show that elevated zzso values in children can also be observed in zzso zzso
