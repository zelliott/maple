Within the past decade, clinical trials have shown that the presence of anemia can diminish the physical status, functional abilities, and overall quality of life zzso of cancer patients and can zzso influence the outcome of their zzso However, recent zzso and clinical studies have also shown that increasing zzso levels by administering zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso may zzso anemia and, in doing so, improve zzso and possibly result in better treatment outcomes following zzso chemotherapy, or a combination of these zzso Several mechanisms by which zzso may improve treatment outcome have been proposed, including correction of tumor zzso increased sensitivity of tumor cells to zzso and chemotherapy, correction of anemia and its associated symptoms zzso zzso and zzso effects of zzso on tumor zzso Improvement of tumor zzso by zzso could affect treatment outcome in two zzso First, correction of zzso results in the zzso of zzso factor 1 zzso a key regulator of cellular zzso responses to zzso zzso zzso including many pathways that are important for tumor growth and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso not only limits growth of the primary tumor but also reduces the potential for the development of more aggressive tumors and zzso spread, which could ultimately improve treatment zzso Second, within the zzso it is the hypoxic cells that are resistant to zzso zzso and chemotherapy, and improvement in their zzso would increase their sensitivity to the zzso effects of such zzso Correction of anemia and its associated symptoms, particularly fatigue, can have a beneficial effect on patient zzso and this in turn may translate into greater tolerance of zzso and chemotherapy, allowing patients to receive full doses and zzso zzso and thus have an increased likelihood of a therapeutic zzso Lastly, results of a study using a zzso model of multiple myeloma have indicated that zzso may induce an zzso zzso zzso zzso additional research is warranted to further explore the zzso actions of zzso and to determine their relevance to therapeutic zzso
