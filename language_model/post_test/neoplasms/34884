To determine the safety of zzso zzso zzso by analyzing errors and technical failures during zzso 

More than 1,300 patients underwent treatment with zzso zzso using five zzso remote zzso Most patients were treated with consecutive pulse schemes, also outside regular office zzso zzso were located in the breast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso orbit, zzso with a zzso group of small numbers, such as the lip, nose, and zzso zzso Errors and technical failures were analyzed for 1,300 treatment sessions, for which nearly 20,000 zzso were zzso For each tumor zzso the number and type of occurring errors were determined, as were which zzso were more error prone than zzso 

By routinely using the built-in dummy check source, only zzso of all zzso showed an error during the phase of the pulse when the active source was outside the zzso zzso treated using flexible zzso had greater error zzso than those treated with straight needles or rigid zzso zzso pulse zzso were in the range of zzso for the zzso on a classic version 1 zzso to zzso for zzso tumors using a version 2 zzso zzso the planned overall treatment time by zzso was observed in only zzso of all zzso Patients received their dose as originally planned in zzso of all zzso 

According to the experience in our institute with 1,300 zzso treatments, we found that zzso is a safe zzso treatment zzso both during and outside of office zzso
