In this paper, we present results of initial zzso and calculations of prompt gamma ray zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso from tissue equivalent zzso during zzso with zzso zzso zzso of prompt gamma ray zzso were made using a zzso zzso detector zzso either with lead zzso zzso or a Compton suppression system zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were performed using a model of both the passive and active shielding experimental zzso developed using the zzso zzso Carlo zzso From the measured zzso it was shown that it is possible to distinguish the characteristic zzso lines from the major zzso constituent atoms zzso O, zzso in the zzso zzso during delivery of zzso doses similar to those delivered during patient zzso Also, the zzso Carlo zzso were found to be in very good agreement with the measured zzso providing an initial validation of our model for use in further studies of prompt gamma ray zzso during zzso zzso
