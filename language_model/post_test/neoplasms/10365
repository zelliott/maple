Childhood pulmonary embolism zzso causes significant mortality and evidence suggests that it is zzso Clinical probability scores and zzso zzso to assess zzso probability have not been studied in children with suspected zzso 

This retrospective cohort study evaluated Wells simplified probability score for zzso in 50 children with zzso and 25 zzso negative control patients, and zzso values in 27 zzso positive and 12 zzso negative zzso 

zzso positive and zzso negative groups had similar rates of risk factors for zzso zzso zzso Wells simplified probability score showed a small difference between zzso positive and zzso negative children zzso zzso zzso positive, zzso zzso negative, 4; P zzso zzso children with zzso are more likely to obtain a zzso zzso score zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The difference was of slightly greater significance when the Wells score was adjusted to account for pediatric normal ranges for heart rate, P zzso zzso and zzso of upper limb zzso P zzso zzso Children with zzso were as likely as zzso negative patients to have a zzso value within the normal range zzso positive, zzso zzso negative, zzso P zzso zzso A combination of a zzso zzso score and normal zzso value occurred in zzso zzso of zzso negative zzso 

The Wells clinical probability score and zzso zzso may lack utility in the determination of zzso probability of zzso in zzso zzso of a pediatric clinical probability score, incorporating zzso zzso by prospective study, would be difficult as a result of the rarity of childhood zzso
