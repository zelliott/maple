The Medicaid program plays a critical role in providing insurance coverage for many low-income beneficiaries who are diagnosed with zzso Several states have increased their zzso requirements in the past few years and this provides a natural experiment to study the impact of zzso 

We used Medicaid administrative data linked with cancer registry data for the years 1999 to 2004 from Georgia zzso state with increases in zzso Texas zzso state zzso and South Carolina zzso state zzso to study the impact of zzso on adult zzso from 18 to 64 zzso Medicaid beneficiaries diagnosed with cancer zzso We report both zzso and zzso assessments controlling for zzso factors including zzso zzso cancer site, and stage at zzso 

After zzso were zzso the number of days of supply of prescription drugs in the intervention state decreased by zzso and zzso days compared with control state A and B, zzso Those with multiple zzso reduced their use of prescription drug the zzso The proportion of beneficiaries with emergency room visits also increased in the intervention state compared with the control zzso Overall, total zzso cost was more than zzso higher per patient in the intervention than the control zzso 

The results show that Medicaid patients with cancer when faced with even moderate zzso change their zzso zzso State Medicaid programs should reconsider the use of zzso as they do not decrease overall cost, but instead could potentially result in negative zzso
