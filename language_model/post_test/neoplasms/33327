The phrase zzso zzso conveys the idea of the pursuit of applications for the treatment of human zzso The zzso long known for having a role in zzso and for its presence in zzso conditions and zzso zzso is becoming a focus for zzso research, not least through its increasingly documented role as a zzso zzso In zzso conditions, cancer and tissue engineering, the zzso derived partly and possibly from circulating zzso cells and zzso zzso is attracting great zzso In cancer, this cell was initially regarded as a barrier to zzso zzso but there is now a growing body of evidence to indicate that it is an active participant in zzso zzso While the involvement of the zzso in these pathological processes is pushing the zzso into the limelight of zzso medicine as a target for potential zzso and zzso therapy, there are still numerous indications from the literature that the zzso is a poorly understood cell in terms of its zzso this is due to a failure to appreciate the contribution of electron zzso to understanding the nature of this zzso This paper, therefore, is devoted to detailing the principal zzso characteristics of the zzso and promotes the argument that understanding how the zzso carries out its roles in normal biological and in pathological processes will be enhanced by a sound understanding of its cellular zzso which in turn arguably demands a significant zzso zzso
