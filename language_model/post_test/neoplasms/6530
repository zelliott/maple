A rapid zzso short-term zzso has been investigated in which percent zzso of incorporation of the DNA precursor zzso is measured following exposure of tumor cells to the test zzso To evaluate the usefulness of the short-term zzso in providing a rapid reliable assessment of zzso response, the short-term zzso was compared with the soft zzso zzso zzso zzso to five zzso drugs was compared using three human tumor cell lines zzso zzso of the oral zzso pancreatic zzso and zzso zzso The short-term zzso produced results that were similar to results of the zzso zzso in two of the three tumors tested, for three drugs zzso zzso and zzso but did not detect responses to two zzso zzso and zzso in any zzso Further studies of this short-term zzso should focus on zzso agents and other zzso
