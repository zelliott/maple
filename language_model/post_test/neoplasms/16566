We propose the use of the zzso electron and zzso generator zzso zzso zzso d and zzso zzso for zzso zzso It combines zzso of zzso beta particles with zzso zzso The zzso beta particles have similar energies as those zzso by zzso Many cancer patients receiving zzso therapy have both bulk zzso which are best treated with zzso beta zzso and single spread cells or zzso which are preferably treated with low-energy electrons such as zzso and conversion zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso can be used to study zzso and zzso using zzso zzso and PET performance were investigated and theoretical zzso calculations were zzso PET resolution, recovery and quantitative accuracy were slightly zzso for zzso compared to zzso zzso absorbed doses to single cells were higher than absorbed doses from zzso and zzso zzso doses to spheres representing bulk zzso were almost as high as for zzso and a factor 10 higher than for zzso zzso absorbed doses, based on zzso of the zzso analogue zzso were higher for zzso than for zzso because of the zzso zzso zzso This initial study of the therapeutic possibilities of zzso is encouraging and justifies further zzso
