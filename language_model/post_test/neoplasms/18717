Efficiency and specificity are two key attributes of zzso drugs including genetic therapeutic zzso We suggest a way to improve specificity of gene therapy drugs based on the ability of zzso regions zzso of some zzso selectively stabilize transcripts only during cell zzso The zzso of genes zzso DNA zzso I zzso and zzso zzso zzso are among such zzso When inserted into genetic zzso designed to produce therapeutic protein in tumor cells, such zzso would lead to diminished effect of therapeutic protein on normal cells, which are characterized by low or absent zzso zzso However, when included in gene expression zzso these zzso might result in decreased zzso zzso thus, zzso the advantage of increased specificity of zzso We showed that zzso and to the lesser extent zzso zzso do not alter significantly therapeutic zzso expression level in tumor cells, thus, confirming the functionality of the proposed zzso
