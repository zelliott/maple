zzso research during the last quarter century has revealed that zzso oxygen species zzso produced in the body, primarily by the zzso play a major role in various zzso zzso Most risk factors associated with chronic diseases zzso zzso such as stress, zzso environmental pollutants, radiation, viral infection, diet, and bacterial infection, interact with cells through the generation of zzso 

zzso in turn, activate various zzso factors zzso nuclear factor zzso of activated B cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso resulting in the expression of proteins that control zzso cellular zzso tumor cell survival, tumor cell proliferation and invasion, zzso and zzso Paradoxically, zzso also control the expression of various tumor zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso Similarly, zzso and various zzso agents used to treat cancer mediate their effects through the production of zzso Interestingly, zzso have also been implicated in the zzso and zzso action of zzso derived from zzso vegetables, spices, and other natural products used in traditional zzso 

These statements suggest both zzso zzso and zzso zzso actions of the zzso Thus, similar to tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso act as a double-edged zzso This paradox provides a great challenge for researchers whose aim is to exploit zzso stress for the development of cancer zzso 

the various mechanisms by which zzso mediate paradoxical effects are discussed in this zzso The outstanding questions and future directions raised by our current understanding are zzso
