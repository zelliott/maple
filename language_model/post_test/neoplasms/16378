A zzso zzso model accommodating zzso with a power factor of the baseline cumulative zzso is investigated for analyzing data with crossing hazards zzso Since the approach of partial likelihood cannot eliminate the baseline zzso an zzso zzso equation zzso approach is introduced in the zzso zzso It zzso a model checking zzso is presented to test for the overall zzso of the zzso zzso Further, under the zzso model setting, we propose two statistics to test the zzso hazards zzso Implementation of this model is illustrated in a data analysis of a cancer clinical zzso
