zzso zzso and carbon zzso exhibit an inverse dose profile allowing for increased energy deposition with penetration zzso Additionally, heavier zzso like carbon beams have the advantage of a markedly increased biological effectiveness characterized by enhanced zzso density in the individual tracks of the heavy zzso where DNA damage becomes clustered and therefore more difficult to repair, but is restricted to the end of their zzso These superior zzso and biological profiles of particle beams over conventional zzso permit more precise dose zzso and make them highly attractive for treating zzso complex and zzso zzso tumors but without increasing the severe side effects in the normal zzso More than half a century since Wilson proposed their use in cancer therapy, the effects of particle beams have been extensively investigated and the biological complexity of particle beam zzso begins to unfold zzso The goal of this review is to provide an as comprehensive and up-to-date summary as possible of the different zzso aspects of particle beams for effective application in cancer zzso
