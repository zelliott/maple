zzso the formation of blood vessels from a pre-existing zzso is a process zzso zzso sprouts are formed in response to zzso supplied chemical zzso The sprouts then grow and zzso driven initially by zzso cell migration, and zzso themselves into a zzso connected zzso zzso cell proliferation near the zzso permits further extension of the zzso and ultimately completes the zzso zzso occurs during zzso wound healing, arthritis and during the growth of solid zzso In this chapter we first of all present a review of a variety of mathematical models which have been used to describe the formation of zzso networks and then focus on a specific recent model which uses novel mathematical zzso techniques to generate both 2 and 3 zzso vascular zzso The zzso zzso on key events of zzso such as the migratory response of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso by a solid zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cell interactions with zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso degradation; zzso zzso branching and zzso zzso simulations of the model, using zzso values based on experimental data, are presented and the theoretical structures generated by the model are compared with the zzso of actual zzso networks observed in in zzso zzso A final section discusses the use of the mathematical model as a possible zzso zzso and implications for chemotherapy zzso
