zzso zzso are widely recognized as having tremendous utility in cancer early zzso zzso and zzso zzso efforts have been put into searching of various molecular zzso for these purposes, yet there are few molecular zzso that have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for clinical zzso Discovery of novel molecular zzso is still urgently needed to create biological insights into early events of zzso and to predict the aggressiveness of early zzso zzso zzso zzso are relatively unexplored molecules identified only one decade zzso With research on the basic biology and mechanisms of zzso they have rapidly been linked to zzso of diseases, particularly zzso In this chapter, we will zzso zzso particularly zzso zzso a type of zzso as a new frontier for the discovery of cancer zzso in zzso zzso and their usefulness as markers for the risk assessment, early zzso and diagnosis of zzso
