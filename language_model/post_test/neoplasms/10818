The development of zzso agents for simultaneous tumor targeting and near infrared zzso zzso imaging is expected to have significant impact on future personalized zzso zzso to the very low tissue zzso and high tissue penetration depth in the zzso spectrum zzso Cancer zzso molecular imaging relies greatly on the development of stable, highly specific and sensitive molecular zzso Organic zzso have shown promising clinical implications as zzso agents for optical imaging in which zzso green has long been implemented in clinical zzso Recently, significant progress has been made on the development of unique zzso zzso with tumor targeting zzso Current ongoing design strategies have overcome some of the limitations of conventional zzso organic zzso such as poor zzso and zzso low quantum yield, insufficient stability in biological system, low detection sensitivity, zzso This potential is further realized with the use of these zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso by zzso with tumor specific zzso (such as small zzso zzso proteins and zzso for tumor targeted zzso Very recently, zzso zzso zzso zzso that can zzso accumulate in tumor cells without the need of chemical zzso to tumor targeting zzso have been developed and these zzso have shown unique optical and pharmaceutical properties for biomedical imaging with superior zzso contrast zzso The main focus of this article is to provide a concise overview of newly developed zzso zzso and their potential applications in cancer targeting and zzso The development of future zzso agents by combining zzso imaging and even therapeutic routes will also be zzso We believe these newly developed zzso zzso zzso will broaden current concept of tumor targeted imaging and hold promise to make an important contribution to the diagnosis and zzso for the treatment of zzso
