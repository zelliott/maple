Several publications showed that the standards for reporting zzso clinical trials zzso might not be entirely zzso Our aim was to evaluate the reporting of survival end points in cancer zzso 

A search in zzso databases identified zzso cancer zzso published in 2004 in four general medical journals and four clinical zzso zzso zzso articles were those that reported primary analyses of zzso with survival end zzso zzso reviewed and scored the articles according to seven key zzso prevalence of complete definition of survival end points zzso of origin, survival events, zzso zzso and relevant information about their analyses zzso or effect size, precision, number of events, patients at zzso zzso of key points was evaluated from a random zzso 

After zzso 125 articles were zzso 104 trials were phase III zzso and 98 publications zzso were obtained from zzso zzso Among these zzso a total of 267 survival end points were recorded, and overall survival zzso was the most frequent outcome zzso terms, zzso Survival terms were totally defined for 113 end points zzso in 65 articles zzso zzso information about analysis was retrieved for 73 end points zzso in 40 articles zzso The less zzso information was the number of patients at risk zzso The reliability was good zzso zzso zzso Finally, according to the key points, optimal reporting was found in 33 end points zzso or 10 zzso 

A majority of articles failed to provide a complete reporting of survival end points, thus adding another source of uncontrolled zzso
