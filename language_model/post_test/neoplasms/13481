The zzso of zzso and other cell surface receptors is altered in many transformed zzso zzso an increase in the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly with invasive growth of zzso An zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso V zzso which forms zzso zzso promotes zzso of a number of cell zzso It is shown here that the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso suppresses zzso branching of zzso zzso and the zzso growth factor zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso contains four zzso zzso zzso and its ability to influence zzso is localized primarily within the second and fourth zzso zzso zzso also interacts directly with the zzso domain of zzso zzso but its effects on zzso were independent of its binding to zzso zzso These data link cell surface zzso zzso to a component of the zzso responsible for zzso of the zzso zzso
