We defined the genetic landscape of balanced zzso zzso at zzso resolution by sequencing 141 zzso from zzso interpreted zzso and zzso We confirm that the recently described phenomenon of zzso zzso zzso shattering and zzso is not unique to cancer cells but also occurs in the zzso where it can resolve to a relatively balanced state with frequent zzso We detected a high zzso of complex zzso zzso and substantially less reliance on zzso zzso than previously observed in benign zzso zzso zzso We compared these results to zzso generated DNA zzso by sequencing seven transgenic animals, revealing extensive zzso of the zzso and host zzso with similar complexity to human zzso zzso zzso was the most common zzso suggesting that a combined mechanism involving template switching and zzso repair mediates the formation of balanced complex zzso that are viable, zzso zzso and transmitted zzso to subsequent zzso
