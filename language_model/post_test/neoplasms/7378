zzso were zzso and characterized from three zzso human zzso The relative molecular mass of the zzso was estimated to be 54 zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso different from human zzso zzso zzso zzso and 64 zzso and human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso The tumor zzso had completely identical zzso with human zzso and pancreatic zzso against zzso to human zzso zzso while the intensity of the tumor zzso was less than zzso of that of human zzso and pancreatic zzso on single zzso zzso On zzso zzso two of the three tumor zzso showed a major peak at pH zzso which corresponded to a major peak of human zzso zzso the other showed a major peak at pH zzso which corresponded to a minor peak of human zzso zzso The three tumor zzso showed similar zzso acid zzso different from those of human zzso and pancreatic zzso These findings suggest that tumor zzso have a zzso structure similar to that of normal human zzso but differ from them in zzso acid zzso
