In our ongoing efforts to combat cancer, zzso tumor vaccines are promising as one of the several alternatives used for cancer zzso and zzso We have attempted to identify zzso zzso suitable for the development of a zzso cancer vaccine directed towards zzso zzso of alkaline zzso zzso an zzso zzso After identifying zzso acid zzso specific to zzso and distinct from other close zzso zzso we have used zzso zzso tools zzso and zzso and conducted molecular modeling studies using zzso to investigate the binding affinity of the zzso containing the unique zzso with respective zzso class I zzso zzso zzso binding to different zzso of different class I zzso zzso were analyzed to get a population coverage that is zzso zzso affinity deduced from the modeling studies zzso the status of most of the zzso scoring high in zzso and zzso We have thus identified specific zzso from zzso that have a potential for binding to their respective zzso class I zzso with high zzso These peptides would be zzso in experiments to demonstrate their involvement in the induction of primary zzso zzso responses in zzso using respective zzso zzso in our way towards the development of an effective zzso vaccine in a background of diverse zzso zzso
