The identification of molecules that are zzso in zzso zzso is important for understanding tumor biology and their role in tumor zzso We compared the expression profile of four normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and a series of zzso zzso zzso cell lines using zzso zzso and confirmed the actual expression of the selected zzso and found zzso zzso to be zzso deficient in zzso zzso We also found zzso to be zzso in various cancer cell lines, including zzso zzso zzso zzso breast, zzso zzso zzso prostate cancer, and zzso Administration of zzso zzso zzso brought about a reduction in cancer cell growth through zzso zzso We generated zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso to study zzso expression and biological functions in cancer zzso zzso was detected in the tumor zzso regions, but not in the cancer cell per zzso in surgical specimens of liver zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso revealed that zzso was zzso in zzso zzso compared with normal zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we showed zzso zzso to be associated with promoter zzso as well as zzso zzso In zzso cancer cell lines, the zzso gene promoter zzso zzso were highly zzso Compared to normal cells, silenced zzso gene in cancer cells were found to have reduced zzso 3 zzso 4 zzso zzso and increased zzso 3 zzso 27 zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso zzso in zzso cancer cells occurs through zzso zzso
