zzso accuracy in zzso zzso is affected by organ zzso Motion tracking systems may be able to avoid zzso enlargement while preserving treatment times, however special attention is needed when zzso markers are used to identify the target can move with respect to zzso at risk zzso Ten patients treated by means of the zzso system were taken into zzso zzso of zzso volume and of complication probability were estimated by calculating treatment plans with a motion tracking system zzso zzso zzso CA, zzso and a zzso strategy for ten zzso Six patients were also evaluated for possible inaccuracy of zzso of dose to zzso due to relative movement between zzso and zzso during zzso zzso volume zzso zzso and zzso Uniform zzso zzso were calculated for the zzso at zzso In the cases for which the target moved closer to the zzso (three cases of zzso a small but significant increase was detected in the zzso and zzso of the zzso In three other cases no significant variation was zzso Mean reduction in zzso volume was 38% for liver cases, zzso for lung cases and zzso for zzso zzso zzso for liver reduced from zzso to zzso on average, for lung it reduced from zzso to zzso on zzso zzso uncertainty may arise from the use of a zzso device in determination of dose to zzso at risk due to the relative motion between zzso and zzso However, it is possible to limit this zzso The breathing phase in which the zzso is closer to the zzso should be selected for zzso A full understanding of the dose distribution would only be possible by means of a complete zzso zzso
