The Study to zzso zzso and zzso for Outcomes and zzso of zzso zzso project was a study of zzso seriously ill patients, zzso of whom died within 6 zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Project, was an ancillary study, in four of the five zzso hospitals, of zzso persons aged 80 years and older, 321 of whom died within 6 zzso This paper reviews the zzso and HELP literature to bring together insights concerning the time near death of seriously ill zzso 

We reviewed published reports from zzso and zzso specifically, demographics of zzso characteristics of a zzso model to estimate zzso patient symptoms near zzso patient preferences and decision-making near zzso ineffectiveness of the zzso zzso costs of dying while seriously zzso and the impact of serious illness on the zzso We also compared and contrasted the experience of patients with different zzso 

Patients in zzso who died were typically younger than age zzso Most zzso patients who died were male and most had an income of less than zzso although the older patients in HELP were even more likely to have had such low zzso Patients with zzso were much younger than most zzso and patients with cancer were less often zzso Most had serious symptoms close to zzso The place of death was more closely related to hospital bed supply than to decisions made by zzso providers or individual patient preferences or zzso zzso near death was quite uncertain, especially in patients with heart and lung zzso 

Although zzso aimed to describe and compare decision-making affecting seriously ill patients, it also illuminated many other aspects of their course near zzso
