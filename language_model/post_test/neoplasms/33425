zzso an intermediate filament zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso cells of zzso and zzso zzso and is identified as a zzso precursor cell zzso Recently, zzso was detected in some zzso such as zzso zzso melanoma, zzso gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the expression intensity of zzso exhibited significant correlation with the zzso grade of zzso 

To detect the expression of zzso in different zzso and to zzso the relationship between the expression of zzso and the zzso grade of the zzso 

zzso and zzso surgical samples of zzso zzso were obtained from the Department of zzso of Sun zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso zzso for zzso were zzso zzso were zzso by zzso zzso 

zzso was expressed predominantly in the zzso of zzso pancreatic zzso and zzso samples, and some zzso cells expressed in the zzso There was a statistically significant difference between the zzso of zzso in high zzso zzso zzso zzso and that in low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and also between that in high zzso zzso zzso zzso and that in low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not express zzso The zzso of zzso in high zzso pancreatic zzso zzso was zzso zzso and that in low zzso pancreatic zzso zzso was zzso zzso (no significant difference, p zzso zzso 

zzso suggest that the expression of zzso may play an important role in the development of some zzso such as zzso and zzso
