In the present study, the effect of zzso oxygen zzso zzso by ultraviolet zzso zzso of zzso zzso on zzso DNA has been analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both native and zzso zzso DNA were treated with a number of restriction zzso to map out the sites damaged by zzso It was also observed that, on exposure to zzso native zzso DNA that is zzso acquired the ability to elicit an immune response in experimental zzso However, the induced zzso exhibited appreciable cross zzso with various zzso and zzso zzso The data indicate that the zzso though zzso zzso bind zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso further substantiated the enhanced recognition of zzso zzso DNA over the native zzso The zzso developed were then subjected to competition zzso with zzso from various diseases such as systemic lupus zzso zzso arthritis, and zzso These results suggest that upon exposure of DNA to zzso zzso are generated, which may be one of the factors for the induction of circulating zzso in the three zzso
