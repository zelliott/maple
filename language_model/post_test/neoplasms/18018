The zzso zzso protein monitors proper attachment of zzso to zzso and links regulation of zzso attachment to zzso zzso Thus, disruption of zzso activity results in a loss of checkpoint control, zzso instability caused by a premature zzso and/or the early onset of zzso The mechanisms by which deregulation and/or abnormalities of zzso expression operate, however, remain to be zzso In this study, we demonstrate that levels of zzso expression are significantly increased by zzso zzso sequencing analysis revealed that the zzso status of two zzso sites in the essential zzso promoter appear to be associated with zzso expression zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with the zzso promoter were significantly relieved by addition of zzso an irreversible DNA zzso zzso However, zzso DNA isolated from 31 patients with zzso zzso exhibited a zzso zzso change in approximately zzso of patients, but this zzso had no effect on promoter zzso Our findings indicate that differential regulation of zzso expression is associated with changes in zzso promoter zzso patterns, but not with promoter zzso thus providing a novel insight into the molecular regulation of zzso expression in human cancer zzso
