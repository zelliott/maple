Flight attendants are exposed to zzso zzso radiation and other potential cancer risk factors, but only recently have zzso studies been performed to assess the risk of cancer among these zzso The aim of the present work was to evaluate the zzso of various types of cancer among female cabin attendants by combining cancer zzso estimates reported in published zzso 

All follow-up studies reporting standardized zzso ratio zzso for cancer among female flight attendants were obtained from online databases and zzso A zzso was performed by applying zzso zzso models, which take into account studies that reported zzso zzso 0 and natural zzso of zzso zzso

Although further studies are necessary to clarify the exact role of occupational exposure, all airlines should, as some companies do, estimate radiation dose, organize the schedules of crew members in order to reduce further exposure in highly exposed flight zzso inform crew members about health risks, and give special protection to pregnant zzso
