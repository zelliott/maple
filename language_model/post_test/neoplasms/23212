Rural populations have limited geographic access to radiation zzso The current study examines whether rural patients with cancer are less likely than urban patients with cancer to receive recommended radiation therapy, and identifies factors influencing rural versus urban differences in radiation therapy zzso 

The current study included zzso rural and zzso urban patients with 5 cancer types and stages for which radiation therapy was zzso The authors used 2000 to 2004 zzso zzso and End zzso zzso zzso Data from 8 zzso zzso Connecticut, Hawaii, Iowa, Kentucky, zzso New Mexico, and zzso and 3 zzso zzso rural Georgia, and zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso radiation therapy zzso rates were calculated by rural versus urban residence overall, for different zzso and cancer zzso and for different states based on zzso zzso analyses using general zzso equation methods to account for patient zzso by zzso 

zzso rates of radiation therapy zzso were lower for rural zzso than urban zzso patients with breast cancer zzso zzso zzso Among patients with breast cancer, radiation therapy zzso differed more by zzso characteristics zzso rural patients aged zzso 50 years had a zzso zzso rate, whereas those aged zzso 80 years had a radiation therapy zzso rate of zzso than rural versus urban zzso zzso rates of radiation therapy zzso were similar for rural and urban patients with other cancer types overall zzso vs zzso difference not zzso although there were differences between urban and rural patients with regard to radiation therapy zzso for patients with stage zzso zzso cell lung cancer zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso cancer types and zzso and state of residence appear to have a greater influence over zzso of radiation therapy than rural versus urban residence location, suggesting that factors such as social support, zzso of other cancer treatments, and regional practice patterns are important zzso of radiation therapy zzso
