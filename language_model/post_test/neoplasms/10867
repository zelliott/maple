The cracks in the paradigm of zzso zzso and zzso evolution as driving force of zzso zzso exposed by the dynamic zzso of zzso stem zzso or the diffuse results of cancer zzso sequencing projects, indicate the need for a more encompassing theory of cancer that reaches beyond the current zzso explanations based on individual genetic zzso One such zzso concept, derived from first principles of the dynamics of gene regulatory networks, is that zzso cell states are zzso states, just like normal cell types zzso Here we extend the concept of cancer zzso to illuminate a more profound property of cancer initiation: its inherent inevitability in the light of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso as a conceptual aid, for which we present a mathematical and evolutionary foundation, we propose that cancer is zzso linked to zzso and zzso This explanatory rather than enumerating review uses a formal argumentation structure that is zzso in modern experimental biology but may hopefully offer a new coherent perspective to reconcile many conflicts between new findings and the old thinking in the categories of linear zzso zzso
