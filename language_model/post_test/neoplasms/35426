In the treatment of cancer, patients commonly receive a variety of sequential zzso The initial treatments administered following diagnosis can vary, as well as subsequent salvage regimens given after disease zzso This article considers the situation where neither initial treatments nor salvage treatments are zzso Assuming there are no zzso zzso we estimate the joint zzso effects on survival of initial and salvage treatments, that is, the effects of zzso treatment zzso For each individual treatment zzso we estimate the survival distribution function and the mean restricted survival zzso Different treatment sequences are then compared using these estimates and their corresponding zzso zzso studies were conducted to evaluate the performance of the methods, including their sensitivity to the violation of the assumption of no zzso zzso The methods are illustrated by a retrospective study of patients with soft tissue zzso which motivated this zzso
