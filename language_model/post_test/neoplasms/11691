The DNA zzso for 12 human tumor cell lines were determined by flow zzso and the zzso were compared with other methods available for characterizing cultured zzso In four of ten cases where zzso had been done, there was a reasonably good correlation between DNA and zzso zzso but in six cases they zzso Two distinct zzso were present in two zzso The zzso by flow zzso can be carried out rapidly and easily and may be useful indicators of extraneous cell contamination or a special zzso cell population that has developed during culture zzso In addition, information is provided on the cell cycle zzso It is proposed that flow zzso zzso of the DNA zzso be used to help characterize cultured cell lines and to ensure their zzso
