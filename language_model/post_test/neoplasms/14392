zzso damage induced by the generation of zzso oxygen species zzso is thought to be related to human cancer zzso zzso stress can result in DNA damage, including oxidized zzso formation of DNA zzso and DNA strand breaks, as well as zzso zzso protein zzso membrane disruption and zzso zzso The effect of zzso oxygen species is balanced by the zzso action zzso antioxidants zzso vitamins A, C, zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso There are three main types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A variety of cancer cells are known to have lower zzso zzso activity when compared with their normal zzso Many studies have examined genetic variation in the genes coding for these zzso and their relationship to cancer zzso Only a few genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso in genes related to zzso zzso were found to be associated with breast, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, the results from these have been zzso Moreover, it is believed that environmental as well as genetic factors are implicated in the development of zzso and consequently it is important to assess both genetic (including zzso zzso and zzso zzso diet, zzso smoking and alcohol zzso zzso in the activities of zzso zzso in relation to zzso In this review we focus on the biological function of zzso zzso zzso and relationship between well-known zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes and genetic zzso to zzso
