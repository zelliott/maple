zzso gene zzso zzso by zzso zzso represents an zzso zzso cellular zzso Small zzso such as zzso zzso are part of the main regulatory mechanisms of gene expression in zzso The possibilities of harnessing this intrinsic natural mechanism of gene zzso for therapeutic applications was opened up by the discovery by Tom zzso team a few years ago that chemically zzso small zzso of zzso zzso zzso interfering zzso zzso could inhibit gene expression without induction of cellular zzso responses, zzso are especially of interest for cancer zzso because they allow specific zzso of zzso zzso and other genes that aid and zzso the growth of cancer zzso However, recent insights make it clear that zzso faces some major hurdles before it can be used as a zzso Some of these problems are similar to those associated with classic zzso approaches, such as lack of delivery to specific zzso zzso than the zzso or tumors, while other problems are more specific for zzso such as stability of the zzso molecules in zzso zzso effects, interference with the zzso zzso machinery, and immune responses toward zzso Chemical modifications of zzso may help prevent these unwanted side zzso zzso studies show that minimal modifications with locked zzso acids zzso help to reduce most of the unwanted side zzso In this chapter we will explore the limitations and possibilities of zzso zzso that may be used in future therapeutic zzso
