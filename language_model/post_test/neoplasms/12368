Since the end of 1996, we have treated more than 160 patients at zzso using zzso zzso The range of indications treated has been quite wide and includes, in the head region, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, we have treated bone zzso in the neck and zzso in the zzso zzso well as prostate cases and some soft tissue zzso zzso volumes for our treated cases are in the range zzso zzso indicating the flexibility of the spot scanning system for treating zzso of all types and zzso The number of fields per applied plan ranges from between 1 and 4, with a mean of just under 3 beams per plan, and the number of zzso modulated Bragg zzso delivered per field has ranged from 200 to 45 zzso With the current delivery rate of roughly zzso Bragg zzso per minute, this translates into delivery times per field of between a few seconds to zzso zzso Bragg peak weight analysis of these spots has shown that over all fields, only about zzso of delivered spots have a weight of more than zzso of the maximum in any given field, indicating that there is some scope for zzso the number of spots delivered per zzso Field specific zzso shows that these treatments can be delivered accurately and precisely to within zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso to the field direction and to within zzso zzso in zzso With our current delivery system the mean zzso of delivered pencil beams at the Bragg peak is about 8 zzso zzso for all zzso indicating that this is an area where some improvements can be zzso In addition, an analysis of the spot weights and energies of individual Bragg zzso shows a relatively broad spread of low and high weighted Bragg zzso over all energy steps, indicating that there is at best only a limited relationship between pencil beam weighting and depth of zzso This latter observation may have some consequences when considering strategies for fast zzso on second generation scanning zzso
