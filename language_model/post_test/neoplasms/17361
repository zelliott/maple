Many studies have highlighted the zzso properties of some natural peptides known to have zzso zzso Also, the increasingly higher resistance to conventional antibiotics has become a global public health issue, and the need for new antibiotics has zzso interest in finding and zzso new zzso zzso which may also be used as zzso zzso Relying on the literature, the purpose of our in zzso research was to assess the zzso potential of zzso II on a series of zzso cell lines, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The experimental results of our study revealed that the zzso effects of zzso II depend on its zzso Its efficiency is significant at zzso zzso and, although it is much lower, it persists even at zzso zzso The effects were insignificant at zzso zzso In our experimental research, the zzso effect of zzso II was not significantly dependent on the type of zzso cell line zzso
