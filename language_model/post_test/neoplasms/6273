zzso is a family of natural zzso that is widely under investigation for use as zzso carriers in novel drug delivery zzso The optimal drug delivery (and consequently maximum therapeutic zzso will be accomplished when carrier systems are used mainly for drugs with zzso activity, as they increase their blood zzso time, taking advantage of the increased mass that reduces kidney zzso 

This review summarizes the attempts that have been made in the development of zzso zzso and their zzso The manuscript describes zzso zzso the use of zzso of zzso in zzso oral delivery systems, colon drug delivery, reduction of zzso of drugs, production of zzso zzso zzso pharmaceutical carriers as zzso drug carriers, zzso zzso stabilization of zzso zzso of zzso diagnosis of solid tumors and zzso treatment and liver zzso 

zzso zzso has aided the design of new zzso zzso with different molecular zzso shapes, structures and with the functional groups needed for zzso at the desired positions in the zzso zzso zzso are very useful systems for achieving controlled drug release and drug zzso In particular, various zzso drug zzso enhance the effectiveness and improve the zzso effects of zzso zzso Future studies should concentrate on barriers for their clinical use and safety as a drug zzso
