zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso identified by the in zzso human tumor zzso zzso as an active agent in a variety of human solid zzso In this phase I study, 182 courses of zzso were administered zzso every 28 days to 88 patients at doses ranging from 18 to zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso was the zzso adverse effect at zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed at doses zzso zzso zzso Less common reactions included infusion site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso toxicity was not zzso Minor objective zzso responses were noted in 7 zzso 6 of the 7 responses occurred in patients with zzso cell lung zzso zzso of zzso studies were consistent with the zzso observations that zzso is highly bound to plasma zzso Plasma elimination followed a zzso zzso the mean zzso 1/2 alpha was zzso zzso zzso h and the zzso 1/2 beta was 52 zzso 6 h zzso zzso The total body clearance and the volume of distribution at steady state of zzso both increased with the dose zzso at steady state, zzso zzso total body zzso zzso zzso for doses of zzso zzso and may reflect zzso of the protein binding and zzso drug zzso Although inactive against common animal tumors in zzso screening systems both in zzso and in zzso zzso has demonstrated zzso activity in the human tumor stem cell zzso zzso as well as modest zzso activity in this phase I study in patients with advanced solid zzso The zzso results and the limiting effect of transient zzso suggest that considerably higher cumulative doses of zzso could be administered using a more frequent dosing zzso
