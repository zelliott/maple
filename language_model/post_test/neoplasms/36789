zzso were conducted to zzso the relationship between the changes in oxygen partial pressure zzso and blood flow in heated tumors with an ultimate goal of using mild temperature zzso zzso to increase tumor zzso 

The blood flow and zzso in the zzso zzso grown zzso in the right hind limbs of Fischer rats were measured immediately or 24 h after heating at zzso zzso degrees C for 30 or 60 zzso The blood flow was measured with the radioactive zzso method and the tumor zzso was measured zzso using an zzso zzso zzso 

The tumor zzso significantly increased immediately and 24 h after heating for 30 zzso at zzso zzso degrees C or for 60 zzso at zzso degrees and zzso degrees zzso On the other hand, in tumors heated at zzso degrees C for 60 zzso the tumor zzso immediately after heating was similar to the control value whereas that 24 h after heating was about zzso greater than the control tumor zzso zzso at zzso degrees C for 60 zzso resulted in a significant decline in zzso immediately after and 24 h after zzso The increase in tumor zzso immediately after heating appeared to be due to an increase in tumor blood zzso However, the changes in tumor zzso and tumor blood flow 24 h after heating, particularly after high zzso doses zzso 60 zzso heating at zzso degrees or zzso degrees zzso were not zzso 

zzso at mild temperatures zzso zzso zzso degrees C for zzso zzso caused zzso zzso increases in zzso in the zzso zzso tumors of Fischer rats during zzso h after zzso Such an increase in tumor zzso after zzso appeared to be due to an increase in tumor blood zzso
