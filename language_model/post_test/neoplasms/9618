zzso is an zzso zzso local cell signaling mechanism that zzso in a variety of cellular zzso cell fate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transition, migration, and zzso These processes can be zzso in zzso pathological zzso In the first part of this review, we will discuss the role of zzso in zzso central nervous system development, zzso cardiovascular and zzso development, with attention to the mechanisms by which zzso regulates cell fate zzso and patterning in these zzso In the second part, we will review the molecular aspects of zzso zzso where zzso can act as an zzso or as a tumor zzso From all these studies, it becomes evident that the outcome of zzso signaling is strictly zzso and differences in the strength, timing, cell type, and context of the signal may affect the final zzso It is essential to understand how zzso zzso zzso from other signaling pathways and how specificity is zzso because this knowledge may be relevant for future therapeutic zzso
