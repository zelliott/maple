Cancer cells undergo an increased zzso zzso condition compared to normal zzso Among the major zzso differences between cancer cells and normal cells is the dependence of cancer cells on zzso as a major source of energy even in the presence of oxygen zzso zzso In Warburg effect, zzso is zzso to zzso that is zzso through zzso zzso to the zzso of cancer cells, while in normal cells, zzso is zzso into zzso that is not zzso zzso is a potent zzso while zzso has no zzso zzso zzso in normal cells may be further zzso to zzso zzso and then through zzso cycle with production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso together with the reducing zzso zzso Through activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which zzso reduced form of zzso zzso zzso This enhances zzso capacities of normal cells, while cancer cells exhibiting Warburg effect may be deprived of all that zzso capabilities due to loss of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso Although intrinsic zzso stress in cancer cells is high, it may be prevented from reaching progressively increasing levels that are zzso to cancer zzso This may be due to some zzso effects exerted by zzso II zzso zzso and zzso produced through zzso zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells maintains a high zzso zzso stress in cancer cells and may be responsible for their zzso zzso Through zzso II, zzso fuels the energetic arm of zzso the zzso arm of zzso zzso synthesis through zzso shunt zzso and the zzso arm of zzso zzso synthesis through zzso acid zzso in addition to the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso All those critical three arms start with the zzso zzso that is a direct product of zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso may prove as a promising zzso and zzso agent based on zzso the Warburg effect and disturbing the zzso behavior in cancer zzso
