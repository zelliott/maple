zzso abnormalities of tumor cells offer opportunities of therapeutic zzso In contrast to normal cells, tumor cells have absolute requirement for zzso zzso an essential zzso zzso Many molecular mechanisms have been considered to explain Met zzso Several approaches have been used To reduce Met in zzso As the main Met source was food, synthetic Met free diet were widely zzso zzso Met restriction was zzso by the use of Met zzso or zzso degradation by zzso In animal models, Met restriction permit to limit tumor growth and to reduce tumor zzso However, interruption of Met restriction induce the regrowth of zzso zzso Met restriction induce several cells modifications suggesting its use in association with conventional zzso zzso studies have shown synergistic effect of the association of Met restriction and different zzso zzso Currently, few clinical investigations have been zzso to test this therapeutic zzso
