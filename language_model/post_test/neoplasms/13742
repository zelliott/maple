The zzso natural and synthetic derivatives of vitamin A, are active in cancer therapy and zzso Their biological effects are zzso through zzso interactions with zzso receptors that associate with specific zzso A better understanding of zzso zzso mechanisms is zzso Our prior work revealed that zzso acid zzso prevented zzso zzso transformation of cultured human zzso zzso zzso zzso signaled zzso arrest that permitted repair of zzso DNA damage caused by these zzso zzso triggered zzso arrest at least partly through zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso zzso D1 zzso To confirm that a specific zzso zzso was induced by zzso a degradation zzso was established using in zzso translated zzso D1 and cellular extracts from zzso or zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso but not the control cellular extracts with in zzso translated zzso D1 led to zzso zzso This degradation depended on the zzso domain of zzso zzso implicating zzso in this zzso zzso zzso zzso selective zzso demonstrated that zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso X zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso pathways signaled this zzso zzso zzso were extended to the zzso human zzso zzso differentiation model where a similar zzso was activated by zzso To determine whether zzso zzso were involved directly in zzso zzso zzso expression profiles for zzso D1 and E were zzso zzso expression of these zzso was frequent in zzso zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso Whether the zzso represent the optimal agents to activate this zzso is the subject of ongoing zzso These findings provide a rationale for combining the zzso in zzso trials with other agents that do not activate this zzso zzso What is now known about the zzso as cancer prevention agents will be zzso zzso is placed on zzso effects on cell cycle progression at zzso
