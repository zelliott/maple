Two different types of simple zzso models were investigated as tools for cancer zzso zzso The number of incident cancer cases by sex and site in Finland was predicted using a prediction zzso for each year from 1967 to 2003 on the basis of historical cancer zzso data obtained 5 to 15 years zzso Cancer sites where major zzso changes in zzso and zzso had occurred were zzso zzso Assuming that such changes had not occurred, the zzso prediction intervals based on normal errors of the zzso rate and on zzso models included the observed number in zzso of the zzso The zzso models produced, on average, shorter intervals and were more capable of indicating a site where the model assumptions did not hold zzso zzso zzso models may be used with some caution on coverage when there are no known factors that might make abrupt changes in the zzso development of cancer zzso On the other hand, they may be used for detecting the effects of such zzso
