zzso of de zzso zzso in cancer cells is increasingly recognized as a hallmark of aggressive zzso and has been implicated in the production of zzso for rapid cell zzso In the current report, we provide evidence that this zzso has a more profound zzso Using a mass zzso zzso analysis approach, we show that clinical tumor zzso that display the zzso zzso show an increase in the degree of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Reversal of the zzso switch in cancer cells by treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso A or by targeting zzso zzso with small interfering zzso leads to a marked decrease in saturated and zzso zzso species and increases the relative degree of zzso Because zzso zzso chains are more susceptible to zzso zzso of zzso increases the levels of zzso end products and renders cells more susceptible to zzso zzso cell zzso As saturated lipids pack more zzso zzso of zzso also alters lateral and zzso membrane dynamics as revealed by diffusion of zzso green fluorescent protein and by the zzso and response to zzso These data show that shifting zzso acquisition from zzso zzso toward de zzso zzso dramatically changes membrane properties and protects cells from both zzso and zzso zzso These findings provide important new insights into the role of de zzso zzso in cancer cells, and they provide a rationale for the use of zzso zzso as zzso agents and as zzso zzso
