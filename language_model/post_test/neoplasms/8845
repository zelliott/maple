This study aims to systematically review zzso studies evaluating the use of zzso zzso and risk of zzso of the jaw zzso among cancer zzso 

zzso zzso and Cochrane Library were screened from database inception to Aug zzso Two zzso independently identified cohort and zzso studies evaluating the use of oral or intravenous zzso zzso and the risk of zzso and extracted the characteristics of the studies and risk zzso zzso estimates of odds ratios and zzso confidence intervals were derived by random effects zzso zzso analyses were carried out according to patients' characteristics and route of zzso zzso 

We identified eight studies, including zzso cases and zzso zzso Use of zzso was associated with a significantly increased risk of zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso I zzso The summary OR was zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso for adjusted zzso IV zzso were associated with higher risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso than oral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso studies were associated with higher risk estimates than zzso zzso 

The available evidence suggests that use of zzso in cancer patients is associated with a substantial risk for zzso Patients receiving IV zzso are at the highest zzso It is important to assess oral health before initiating therapy and to avoid dental procedures during the active phase of intravenous zzso zzso
