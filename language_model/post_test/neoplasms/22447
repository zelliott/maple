Numerous studies have investigated the effect of serum zzso concentration on aging and different zzso diseases, zzso cardiovascular disease zzso and zzso zzso as well as increased levels have been reported to be associated with reduced life expectancy in zzso 

This study investigates the association of serum zzso concentration with zzso and zzso mortality of zzso older persons and the development of zzso and zzso 

Data were used from the zzso Aging Study Amsterdam zzso an ongoing multidisciplinary cohort study in the general Dutch population of older persons zzso zzso old) where serum zzso was measured zzso zzso zzso The mortality information was zzso using the International zzso of zzso 10th zzso and the presence or absence of zzso and cancer by self-reports with a follow-up of zzso zzso 

We measured zzso zzso and cancer mortality and nonfatal zzso and zzso 

zzso adjusted Cox zzso hazards models demonstrated an increased risk of zzso mortality for older persons with zzso values in the lowest zzso as compared to the middle zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso A more than zzso increased risk of zzso mortality was revealed for both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associations of serum zzso with nonfatal zzso and fatal and nonfatal cancer were not zzso 

zzso suggest a zzso relationship between zzso level and zzso with fatal zzso as the most critical outcome in zzso older zzso
