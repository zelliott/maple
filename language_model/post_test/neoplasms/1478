In both the zzso and zzso zzso sequencing eras, there has been an increase in the understanding of the molecular mechanisms influencing cellular sensitivity to DNA damaging agents such as zzso zzso Out of this work have arisen many cellular factors that could be specifically targeted, at the molecular level, to alter the functionality of a single protein or zzso involved in the response to radiation damage as a means to increase cell killing following radiation zzso As such, there are many promising new combination zzso therapy approaches being developed and assessed in zzso and clinical studies for several different zzso Combination of such zzso aims to increase the therapeutic index, giving rise to increased tumor cell killing with a simultaneous reduction in normal cell zzso zzso delivery and/or targeting zzso combined with zzso zzso regimes could provide significant local control of tumors, zzso their development into zzso disease, which poses a greater challenge for zzso and zzso zzso This review will zzso current and novel gene therapy strategies that are being developed aimed at enhancing the effects of zzso through the use of directed molecular targeting zzso
