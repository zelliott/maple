The proliferation of genetic zzso tests for complex diseases away from clinic settings increases the potential for zzso This study assessed whether people are likely to zzso themselves into or out of genetic testing depending on whether they believe they could cope with the zzso zzso between anticipated reactions to adverse genetic test results and interest in taking genetic tests for cancer and heart disease were examined in a community sample of English adults zzso zzso zzso Interest in genetic testing overall was zzso for cancer risk and zzso for heart disease zzso As predicted, there were differences by anticipated zzso People who anticipated regret about having taken a genetic test for cancer risk expressed lower interest than those who did not anticipate regret zzso zzso zzso and people who anticipated being glad to know of increased risk status zzso reduced zzso were more interested than those who did not look forward to reduced uncertainty zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar for heart disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The potential for harm from future genetic zzso tests may be less than feared if people who anticipate adverse reactions zzso themselves out of zzso However, given that a significant proportion of people who anticipated adverse reactions also expressed interest in testing, there is still a concern about zzso It remains to be seen whether the same patterns emerge in studies that actually offer genetic tests for common gene zzso in community zzso
