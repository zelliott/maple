Traditionally, screening for new markers involves using a slide from each of several different zzso A more efficient way is to have one slide that contains several minute zzso one from each zzso These slides are prepared by transferring zzso tissue zzso from many zzso blocks to one zzso zzso Each slide cut from this recipient block is called a tissue zzso zzso zzso It can have various zzso types of disease that need to be compared or can have the same zzso type but different behavior zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso are ideal for efficient screening of prospective zzso by a variety of different mechanisms including zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso acids zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and number of cases from patient zzso in a given zzso slide is amenable to statistical modeling to enhance analysis of zzso In addition, different zzso can be constructed to answer different scientific zzso The zzso can also be produced from retrospective zzso blocks of zzso cases, with clinical zzso The zzso slides can be zzso zzso This provides a mechanism to share results of experiments with other zzso There are also ongoing efforts to generate software tools for automated analysis of zzso zzso zzso There has also been a significant body of work done to zzso data capture, thus zzso subsequent exchange of zzso The preferred current mechanism is to use an zzso data capture and zzso There have also been efforts to create zzso zzso This has been attempted using zzso frozen zzso embedded in zzso zzso These samples are then arrayed into a recipient zzso zzso The presence of zzso can sporadically interfere with certain zzso However, it does provide a novel mechanism for zzso evaluation of frozen zzso with corresponding zzso of tissue zzso
