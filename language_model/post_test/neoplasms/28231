zzso scoring systems based on zzso parameters have been established in order to predict the outcome of zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that the zzso value of these scores is limited in patients following zzso stem cell transplantation zzso zzso we evaluated patients from the zzso pediatric stem cell transplantation center with regard to zzso factors and zzso variables for zzso treatment and zzso Between January 1989 and December 1998, 180 zzso have been zzso The clinical, laboratory and zzso parameters such as conditioning treatment, zzso zzso infections and zzso toxicity were zzso recorded and zzso zzso zzso pediatric scoring systems zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso patients required intensive care (16 male, 12 female, median age: zzso years zzso zzso to zzso zzso five zzso 13 zzso and 10 unrelated transplanted zzso zzso respiratory failure was the most frequent cause of admission to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Fourteen of 28 patients were discharged from zzso and six of 28 patients achieved a long-term survival (110 to zzso zzso At admission to the zzso impaired cardiovascular status, high zzso levels and presence of zzso bleeding were each associated with fatal outcome zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso score was not zzso significant at the zzso zzso zzso survival after discharge from the zzso correlated with zzso parameters such as the type of transplant and severity of zzso zzso zzso zzso By introduction of zzso related parameters such as severity of zzso zzso zzso 2 points; grade zzso 4 points), zzso zzso zzso 4 points), and presence of zzso bleeding (4 points) into the zzso score a new zzso zzso zzso score was zzso This score significantly correlated with the risk of mortality in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the new zzso score accurately characterizes the clinical situation of children requiring zzso treatment following zzso It zzso more appropriately between success and failure of zzso treatment following zzso than the standard zzso zzso It needs to be evaluated in future prospective studies of critically ill children after zzso Bone zzso zzso zzso
