zzso was discovered as the cellular zzso of the zzso zzso of several avian zzso The gene encodes a zzso factor, which forms a zzso protein complex with a partner protein termed zzso In zzso cells, zzso is a central regulator of cell proliferation and links external signals to the cell cycle zzso zzso also zzso cells to undergo zzso unless specific signals provided either by zzso or by zzso block the zzso zzso Recent progress sheds light both on the factors regulating the function and expression of zzso and on the downstream targets in the cell zzso Together, these findings suggest the existence of a novel signal zzso zzso regulating both zzso and zzso
