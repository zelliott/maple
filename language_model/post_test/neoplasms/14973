There are at least two findings that show DNA zzso plays a key role in zzso The first major evidence is that DNA zzso zzso target zzso and zzso instability with cancer zzso The second reason that cancer progression is associated with deepening DNA zzso Nevertheless, the evolution of this crucial zzso zzso in the zzso cellular zzso transformation remains zzso From some of the experimental data to be present, a key role of DNA zzso in early development of zzso zzso cancer biology is zzso We have observed the significant increasing of zzso zzso at the level of peripheral blood zzso taken from the patients with different solid zzso Similarly, zzso zzso DNA treatment of cultured healthy zzso zzso increased nuclear DNA zzso We argue that zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso DNA zzso during zzso is related to global zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso This results in disturbances of zzso zzso that are expressed in nuclear zzso on the basis of zzso zzso On the basis of literature searches and experimental findings, it is proposed that DNA zzso plays the role of an zzso in zzso zzso cancer zzso
