A surface immobilized optical protein sensor has been zzso to detect zzso zzso zzso an oral cancer marker, and can reach limit of detection zzso at zzso zzso in buffer without using zzso zzso Only after applying zzso amplification to increase the signal level by a few orders of zzso zzso can reach the zzso of 1 zzso zzso We then develop the zzso zzso based sensor for further reducing the optical noise and can extend the zzso of the surface immobilized optical protein sensor two orders in zzso These improvements have allowed us to detect zzso protein at zzso fM in zzso In addition, these sensitive zzso were achieved without the use of zzso signal amplification, such that the simplified protocol can further facilitate the development of zzso zzso The ultra sensitive optical protein sensor presented in this paper has a wide number of applications in disease zzso zzso for detecting zzso in clinical sample are much more challenging than the zzso in zzso due to high background noise contributed by large collections of zzso zzso We used clinical saliva samples to validate the functionality of the optical protein zzso Clinical detection of zzso zzso in saliva offers a zzso alternative approach to using blood or zzso Currently, the main challenge of using saliva as a diagnostic fluid is its inherently low concentration of zzso We compare the zzso of 40 saliva zzso half from oral cancer patients and half from a control zzso The data measured by the optical protein sensor is compared with the traditional zzso zzso zzso zzso values to validate the accuracy of our zzso These positive results enable us to proceed to using zzso optical protein sensor to detect other zzso which have much lower zzso
