This paper presents a zzso analysis to appraise zzso zzso zzso in farmed juvenile zzso zzso zzso at zzso disease zzso area in Taiwan, whereas zzso incremental lifetime cancer risk zzso and hazard zzso zzso models are also employed to assess the range of zzso for the zzso and zzso who eat the contaminated zzso We conducted a zzso exposure experiment to obtain zzso zzso whereas a simple critical body burden toxicity model was verified with zzso data obtained from a zzso acute toxicity zzso Acute toxicity zzso indicates that zzso zzso for juvenile zzso exposed to As is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our risk analysis for zzso reared in zzso area indicates a low likelihood that survival is being affected by zzso zzso Human risk analysis demonstrates that zzso probability exposure zzso for zzso in zzso area have orders of magnitude of zzso indicating a high potential zzso risk, whereas there is no significant cancer risk for zzso zzso around zzso All predicted zzso of zzso are less than 1 for zzso yet larger than 10 for zzso which indicate larger contributions from farmed zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that to increase the accuracy of the results, efforts should focus on a better definition of probability zzso for zzso daily consumption rate and As level in zzso Here we show that theoretical human health risks for consuming zzso zzso in the zzso area are alarming under a conservative condition based on a zzso risk assessment zzso
