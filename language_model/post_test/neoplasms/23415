zzso bodies zzso are unique zzso in the zzso zzso that contain zzso in their zzso zzso and incorporation of material into such zzso is a critical cellular process that has been intensely studied following discovery of the zzso zzso sorting complex required for zzso machinery just more than a decade zzso In this review, we zzso current understanding of the cellular functions of zzso and how the zzso machinery contributes to zzso zzso We also highlight the importance of zzso and zzso in human zzso We identify critical areas in which further zzso and zzso studies in living cells will advance this exciting area of zzso
