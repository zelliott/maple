As genetic information moves from basic research laboratories in to the clinical testing environment, there is a critical need for reliable reference materials for the quality assurance of genetic zzso A panel of 12 zzso clones containing zzso or point zzso within zzso zzso have been developed as reference materials for the detection of zzso zzso 

The goal of this study was to validate the reference materials in providing quality assurance for the detection of zzso zzso in clinical zzso 

We studied 33 zzso samples, 11 apparently normal samples and 22 zzso tumors of various zzso zzso were identified using zzso zzso zzso analysis with both slab gel and zzso zzso All DNA samples were amplified with zzso labeled zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

Of the 33 patient samples tested, zzso and zzso were found in six specimens in three of the five zzso zzso no zzso were found in zzso 7 or zzso Both a zzso and zzso were found in zzso specimens from the control zzso The zzso were confirmed by DNA sequence analysis of the regions zzso 

zzso and zzso were detected in the clinical zzso All of the zzso were silent except for one zzso zzso in zzso 5, zzso zzso This study demonstrates the usefulness of the National Institute of zzso and Technology zzso zzso reference panel in zzso zzso detection in clinical tissue zzso
