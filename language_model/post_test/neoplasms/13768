zzso intensity dose zzso are obtained by inverse zzso It requires an inversion zzso and an objective function that can be physical or zzso The biological objective functions aim at zzso the probability of the zzso end of the zzso The inversion zzso used is zzso and is based on the mathematical analysis of the singular values zzso It proposes as many solutions as there are elementary zzso From the zzso Control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and complication free zzso control, three biological assessment functions of the proposed solutions are compared with the least square difference between the prescribed and obtained dose zzso We used a simplified zzso zzso zzso dose prescription zzso zzso of a zzso and 9 beams zzso The choice by mean of biological criterion of the optimal solution makes it possible to increase the average dose in the zzso so as its zzso compared to physical zzso zzso the zzso at risk are then less zzso The laying down of relevant constraints makes it possible to obtain satisfactory dose zzso zzso the zzso of the models and data used, some limitations zzso At present time, it seems to exclude the use in clinical routine of an only biological zzso The future availability of new biological data will allow the development and in particular the clinical use of biological zzso
