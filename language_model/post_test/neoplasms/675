zzso are tightly controlled by the host immune response, with zzso zzso prevalent in zzso zzso Previously, infection of zzso mice with zzso 68 zzso showed that zzso controlled chronic infection, limiting chronic diseases including zzso and pulmonary zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso mice zzso develop zzso inflammatory zzso in the zzso zzso infection revealed a range of zzso from spontaneous zzso to pulmonary zzso By 12 months of infection, zzso of mice had zzso zzso or pulmonary zzso zzso of infected mice developed frank tumors between 5 and 12 months zzso with some mice showing systemic zzso zzso were composed of B zzso and contained zzso infected zzso Although zzso mice control chronic zzso infection poorly, both early and late zzso were indistinguishable between zzso and zzso virus infection, indicating that, in contrast with other previously described zzso zzso these chronic diseases were not dependent on the zzso of zzso zzso This distinct combination of zzso infection and defined host zzso led to a specific and consistent zzso zzso zzso this mouse model of zzso pulmonary zzso zzso closely mimics the full spectrum of human zzso zzso an zzso zzso with no effective zzso
