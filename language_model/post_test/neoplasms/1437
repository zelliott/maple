Although the cellular steps required for zzso are similar for all cancer cells, zzso involved in this process and their expression levels vary greatly between different cancer zzso Thus, the identification of these zzso activities represents a crucial issue in the understanding of cancer zzso Until now, zzso display zzso technology has been successfully employed for the characterization of zzso zzso but was never used with a mix of zzso In the present work, we report an easy protocol to identify multiple zzso activities zzso by cancer zzso We selected zzso from a zzso display library of high diversity using zzso media of three established prostate cancer cell lines zzso zzso and zzso with variable degrees of invasive zzso Some of these selected zzso zzso were zzso by the zzso proteins of all three zzso cancer cell lines, demonstrating similarities in their zzso zzso On the other hand, a few zzso were cancer cell specific, indicating differences in the zzso of zzso expression in prostate zzso This work reports for the first time the selection of zzso from a mix of zzso using zzso display technology and opens a new avenue for the direct identification of zzso activities for tumor zzso
