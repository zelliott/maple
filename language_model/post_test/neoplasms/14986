The risk of developing a range of solid zzso is increased in type 2 diabetes, and may be influenced by zzso zzso We examined the risk of development of solid zzso in relation to treatment with oral agents, human insulin and insulin zzso 

This was a retrospective cohort study of people treated in UK general zzso Those included in the analysis developed diabetes zzso years of age, and started treatment with oral agents or insulin after zzso A total of zzso patients were divided into four groups according to whether they received zzso with zzso or zzso combined therapy zzso plus zzso or zzso zzso users were grouped according to treatment with insulin zzso zzso human insulin, zzso analogue and human zzso zzso The outcome measures were progression to any solid zzso or cancer of the breast, zzso zzso or zzso zzso factors were accounted for using Cox zzso hazards zzso 

zzso zzso carried the lowest risk of zzso In comparison, the adjusted zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso Adding zzso to insulin reduced progression to cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The risk for those on zzso human insulin alone vs insulin zzso alone was zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with zzso insulin therapy increased the risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but did not influence the risk of breast or prostate zzso zzso were associated with a similar pattern of risk as zzso 

Those on insulin or insulin zzso were more likely to develop solid zzso than those on zzso and combination with zzso abolished most of this excess zzso zzso use was associated with lower risk of cancer of the colon or zzso but did not affect the risk of breast or prostate zzso Use of insulin zzso was not associated with increased cancer risk as compared with human zzso
