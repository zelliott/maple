The tumor zzso zzso is zzso zzso in approximately 50% of human zzso zzso one-third of the zzso lower the melting temperature of the zzso leading to its rapid zzso Small molecules that bind to those zzso and stabilize them could be effective zzso zzso The zzso zzso which occurs in approximately 75,000 new cancer cases per zzso creates a surface cavity that zzso the protein by 4 zzso at a site that is not zzso We have designed a series of binding molecules from an in zzso analysis of the crystal structure using virtual screening and rational drug zzso One of them, a zzso zzso zzso binds to the cavity with a zzso constant of approximately 150 zzso It raises the melting temperature of the zzso and slows down its rate of zzso We have solved the crystal structure of the zzso complex at zzso zzso The structure implicates key interactions between the protein and zzso and zzso changes that occur on zzso which will provide a basis for lead zzso The zzso zzso is an excellent zzso target for developing and testing novel zzso drugs based on protein zzso We point out some general principles in relationships between binding constants, raising of melting temperatures, and increase of protein zzso by stabilizing zzso
