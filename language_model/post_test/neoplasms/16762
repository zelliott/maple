A list of zzso zzso agents and processes is zzso zzso zzso are found with the zzso of zzso transfer reactions zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso groups zzso formaldehyde, open forms of reducing zzso degradation products of zzso or zzso degradation products derived from zzso zzso compounds represent additional zzso zzso reactions include leakage of the zzso zzso radical from terminal zzso and zzso cycles, zzso radical formation by the Fenton reaction from zzso hydrogen zzso and the formation of zzso zzso zzso instability by spontaneous zzso and zzso as well as zzso instability by zzso errors and in the presence of zzso metal zzso represent a third important class of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso could form the zzso basis for what is called zzso tumor zzso and explain the possibility of an increased tumor zzso after treatment of animals with zzso compounds exhibiting zzso activity zzso Individual differences are expected to be seen also with zzso DNA zzso The presence of zzso DNA damage implies that zzso zzso zzso give rise to an incremental damage which is expected to be zzso to the zzso dose at lowest zzso An increased tumor risk due to exposure to zzso zzso zzso could therefore be assessed in terms of the background DNA damage, for instance in multiples of the mean level or of the zzso zzso in a zzso
