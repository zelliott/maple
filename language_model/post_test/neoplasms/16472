The zzso zzso transgenic mouse has been developed as an zzso to the lifetime mouse zzso to predict the zzso potential of zzso Unlike the zzso zzso the zzso zzso mouse is sensitive to both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso officially designated zzso zzso contains multiple copies of the human zzso zzso and promoter within its zzso These mice develop spontaneous zzso zzso zzso life and in zzso zzso mice, zzso sensitivity to zzso The most common spontaneous zzso in control zzso zzso mice 8 to 9 months of age are lung zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso and skin zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated that 20 to 25 zzso group are required to provide the zzso with adequate statistical zzso Four of 6 known or suspected human zzso tested in zzso zzso mice were positive in this zzso For 19 zzso agents testing positive in conventional zzso zzso 7 chemicals were positive, 10 chemicals were negative, and 2 were zzso None of the 10 zzso zzso zzso that were negative in the zzso zzso mouse model are considered to be human zzso All zzso chemicals that were negative in the conventional zzso zzso were also negative in the zzso zzso zzso zzso for 15 of 18 zzso chemicals tested in zzso zzso mice agreed with the results of conventional zzso zzso and 3 results were zzso The zzso zzso mouse model appears to predict known or suspected human zzso as well as the traditional mouse zzso but with fewer positive results for zzso compounds that are not considered human zzso The zzso zzso mouse model is the most thoroughly tested in zzso zzso to the lifetime mouse zzso for zzso compounds administered by oral or zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso Assessment Committee has determined that the zzso zzso model has been adequately evaluated for consideration for zzso testing of pharmaceutical candidates and its use could contribute to the weight of evidence for zzso zzso The zzso will consider proposals to replace lifetime mouse zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso mouse studies to support pharmaceutical registration on a case-by-case zzso
