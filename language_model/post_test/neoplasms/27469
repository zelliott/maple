Several zzso zzso zzso zzso are now available for cancer zzso After injection, a large amount of the compound is zzso via the urinary zzso while a variable part is trapped in the zzso allowing the zzso zzso Unfortunately, the compound may also be trapped in critical zzso such as kidney or bone zzso As a consequence, a method for assessment of individual zzso and zzso is required to predict the maximum dose that can be safely injected into zzso However, zzso a pure zzso zzso cannot be used for quantitative zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that allows imaging of tissue zzso using a PET zzso In addition to the zzso zzso also zzso a multitude of prompt single zzso leading to significant zzso of zzso when using classical reconstruction zzso We propose a zzso correction method based on zzso tail fitting using an zzso point spread function zzso When applied to abdominal phantom acquisition data, the proposed correction method significantly improved the accuracy of the zzso the initial zzso of background activity by zzso was reduced to zzso while the initial error in respect of kidney zzso by zzso was reduced to zzso In patient studies, the mean zzso between PET total body activity and the activity expected from urinary collections was reduced from zzso to zzso showing the benefit of the proposed correction zzso
