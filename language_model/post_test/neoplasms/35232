Fusion of peptides to viral carriers has proven an effective method for improving cellular zzso In this study we explore the ability of a plant virus, zzso mosaic virus zzso to stimulate cellular immunity by interacting directly with immune zzso zzso labeled zzso was incubated in zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells, and near quantitative labeling of zzso was achieved after 2 zzso which persisted for up to 48 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso marker was measured in nearly all zzso cells zzso by flow zzso To demonstrate that zzso can also provide functional zzso delivery and immune stimulation in zzso two zzso zzso zzso that provide protection against tumor challenge in mice were fused to zzso coat protein by genetic zzso or by chemical zzso zzso of zzso mice zzso measurable cellular responses by zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso and resulted in significantly improved protection from tumor challenge in both the zzso and zzso melanoma zzso From these results we conclude that zzso was an effective zzso carrier for inducing cellular immune responses to less than 1 zzso of zzso
