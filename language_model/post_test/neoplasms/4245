The impact of cell zzso in the zzso of tumors has been studied almost exclusively in the context of invasion, zzso and zzso Here we review data supporting a major role for zzso zzso in the regulation of intrinsic or acquired resistance of solid tumors to various zzso zzso zzso interactions are known to protect cells from zzso and may help to explain zzso of solid zzso Recent data implicates zzso a zzso zzso zzso as a possible zzso of zzso drug zzso A model is described zzso zzso interactions signal the zzso of zzso which in turn causes growth arrest in the zzso phase of the cell cycle and resistance to zzso induced by zzso agents that target rapidly dividing zzso We focus on zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso as one potential zzso of intrinsic resistance of zzso A clearer understanding of how zzso zzso suppresses cell growth and zzso should aid in the development of novel, more effective zzso zzso
