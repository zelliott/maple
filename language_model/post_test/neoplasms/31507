The induction of zzso in T cells is one of several mechanisms by which tumors escape immune zzso We have investigated whether tumors induce zzso in zzso cells zzso by zzso of zzso or human DC with different tumor cell lines for zzso zzso Analysis of DC zzso features, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity, zzso V zzso and DNA fragmentation zzso revealed a zzso and zzso induction of zzso in DC by zzso zzso This finding is both zzso and target zzso The mechanism of zzso DC zzso involved regulation of zzso and zzso zzso Double zzso of both zzso and human tumor zzso confirmed that zzso DC undergo zzso death in zzso DC isolated from tumor tissue showed significantly higher levels of zzso as determined by zzso zzso when compared with DC isolated from zzso These findings demonstrate that tumors induce zzso in DC and suggest a new mechanism of tumor escape from immune zzso DC protection from zzso will lead to improvement of zzso zzso for cancer and other immune zzso
