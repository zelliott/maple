These cases demonstrate a few of the presentations that may occur with new onset zzso zzso While the transport phase of these children's care was not extraordinary, the development and management of the clinical issues might have been influenced by earlier zzso Would the outcome of Case 1 have been different if the abnormal zzso parameters demonstrated on the zzso laboratory results had been further zzso Would the institution of cerebral zzso measures before and during transport have offered this child a better chance of zzso Would the involvement of a specialized pediatric team earlier in the process have addressed some of those issues and would it have made a difference? Should the patient in case two have had cerebral zzso measures instituted at the referring hospital or during zzso In zzso this clearly would not have been useful or beneficial to the zzso But what if the initial CT interpretation of a brain tumor and increased zzso pressure with zzso zzso and zzso shift had been zzso Should the transport team have suggested or instituted a different level of therapy with the information that was available at the time of zzso The patient in Case 3 had a dramatic presentation of his zzso Were there signs and symptoms that should have alerted the referring hospital, transport command physician or transport team to the likely deterioration of that patient? If this patient had presented to a hospital a further distance away, would the impending cardiovascular collapse and respiratory failure have been anticipated or occurred during the zzso Would or should the mode of transport or team zzso have been zzso If this patient had deteriorated during the zzso would the transport team have had the skills to manage this potentially difficult zzso Should the patient in Case 4 have had zzso medication started at the referring hospital or during the transport zzso What are the guidelines for zzso intervention in this situation? If zzso therapy were instituted by the transport team, should this have affected time or mode of zzso or was it more prudent not to rock the boat by instituting zzso zzso Is hypertension a different issue with a liver mass, as suspected at the time of zzso or with a zzso zzso These cases afford us the ability to review several presentations of zzso zzso The questions above are but a few of the potential areas of discussion that can arise from these zzso We should use these cases as an opportunity to review and refresh our transport teams on the many faces of zzso and potential pitfalls in the care of those zzso
