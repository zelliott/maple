When a protein has a useful and unique function, the selective pressures of evolution conserve the DNA sequences zzso such zzso the conservation of these zzso may have pragmatic use in better understanding viral and spontaneous zzso in zzso zzso The unique functions of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and a few other zzso in growth regulation and zzso zzso zzso radiation and zzso could be used for the early detection of cancer using serum, or in follow-up zzso 

The zzso serum test was performed in the serum of patients by zzso using specific zzso directed against the zzso zzso acids 2 to zzso synthetic zzso of zzso according to previously described procedures zzso zzso zzso 

The data presented here indicate that zzso to zzso detect a zinc finger protein of Mr zzso zzso identified by zzso and sequencing as zzso in patients having various types of zzso zzso increases with zzso of cancer, irrespective of the cancer types studied in this zzso In healthy individuals of the same age range, the levels of zzso increase slowly and progressively at less than zzso per year as the patients zzso 

The zzso test may be useful as an aid in: zzso early detection of a wide variety of cancer zzso and zzso the prognosis and management of cancer patients by following the changes in the zzso of zzso in zzso Moreover, the results suggest that the combined use of zzso with physical methods of cancer detection such as zzso zzso zzso computer assisted zzso or magnetic resonance imaging techniques may significantly improve the chances of identifying an active tumor in early stages by zzso of zzso In patients having other diseases (such as zzso arthritis, which zzso as a zzso disease) or in healthy individuals having no evidence of disease, the identification of as yet zzso active zzso may be significantly improved by using zzso The data on zzso context analysis indicates that the presence of zzso in the blood is an indicator of zzso Thus, the test may be used to help prolong the life of the patients, if the cancer is detected zzso
