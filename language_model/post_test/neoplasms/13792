zzso is a very effective zzso agent, suppressing tumor promotion and early stages of tumor zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso exerts these zzso actions are not zzso zzso zzso C zzso is a zzso for certain tumor promoters and also plays a crucial role in events related to tumor zzso zzso it is not only a potential target for the zzso activity of zzso but also it has the structural basis for interaction with zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso particularly the zzso zzso by reacting with the critical zzso regions present within the zzso domain while, in some cases, also reacting with the zzso zzso present within the zzso of the regulatory zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso acting through zzso reverses the zzso of zzso induced by zzso Furthermore, zzso through a direct interaction involving its zzso center with the zzso of zzso can reverse the zzso modification of this zzso induced by zzso Thus the zzso toxicity is reversed by a zzso and therefore an zzso exists between these two mechanisms of zzso zzso Moreover, this also explains how a resistance to zzso develops in advanced tumor cells probably due to an zzso of functional zzso zzso zzso of zzso may, at least in part, be responsible for the zzso zzso of tumor promotion, cell growth, invasion, and zzso as well as for the induction of zzso
