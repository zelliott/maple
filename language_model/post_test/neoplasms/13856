The phenomenon of sister zzso exchange zzso is an interesting genetic event in zzso zzso even though its exact mechanism remains zzso The fact that zzso can take place, whether zzso or induced by various agents, is in itself important, for such an event, involving damage and possible repair of bilateral zzso in zzso presents opportunities for modification of the zzso structure and/or function zzso zzso zzso It has been assumed that under zzso circumstances, zzso does not lead to any change in the functional zzso although this may not apply to abnormal zzso The latter may be produced by a number of chemical agents (including various zzso that lead to a significantly increased zzso of zzso in normal and zzso cells either in zzso or in zzso In fact, zzso has been recognized and advocated as a most sensitive test for potentially zzso and/or zzso zzso Thus, the broad field of zzso studies becomes of direct interest for and subject to exploration by those involved with cancer causation and zzso In this review, a synopsis of our experiences with high zzso mechanisms in Bloom syndrome cell lines will be zzso in connection with high zzso zzso cell line derived from zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso
