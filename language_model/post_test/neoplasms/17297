zzso of the zzso weak zzso of zzso zzso growth zzso 14 zzso signaling zzso is observed in many diseases, including zzso zzso diseases, and zzso zzso of zzso signaling by zzso binding triggers cell invasion and survival and therefore represents an attractive zzso for therapeutic zzso Based on structural studies of the zzso zzso domain of zzso several zzso models of zzso were built to investigate plausible modes of zzso zzso Two promising models, centered on different zzso zzso of zzso zzso 176 and zzso zzso were zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso but not zzso resulted in the loss of zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso did not disrupt zzso zzso but failed to induce zzso nuclear factor zzso chain zzso of activated B cell zzso zzso The validated structural models were zzso in a virtual screen to design a targeted library of small molecules predicted to disrupt the zzso zzso 129 small molecules were screened zzso with identification of molecules producing up to 37% zzso of zzso zzso In zzso we present a zzso in zzso study revealing key structural elements of the zzso interaction, followed by experimental zzso serving as a guide for the design of small zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Our results validate the zzso interaction as a chemically zzso target and provide the foundation for further exploration utilizing chemical biology approaches focusing on zzso this system as a therapeutic target in invasive zzso
