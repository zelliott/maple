In recent years a theory that cancer biology is different in blacks and whites has gained prominence in reaction to zzso observations that blacks have poorer survival than zzso even when diagnosed with cancer of similar zzso Yet, few studies have evaluated whether zzso treatment and shorter overall life expectancy due to a greater burden of other illnesses may explain the survival zzso 

To estimate the magnitude of overall and zzso survival differences between blacks and whites who receive comparable treatment for zzso zzso 

We searched zzso for English-language articles published from 1966 to January 2002 that reported on overall survival for black and white patients treated similarly for zzso 

The abstracts or titles for zzso citations were independently examined by 2 zzso The full text was retrieved if the abstract mentioned both black and white patients, made some comment regarding either similarity of treatment received or presented an analysis based on the treatment received, and commented on zzso Studies were included if they included data for at least 10 black and 10 white zzso specified the cohort zzso method and what measures were undertaken to minimize loss to zzso summarized survival of both blacks and whites using zzso zzso presented outcomes within stage, adjusted for stage, or based on zzso with balanced stage zzso and specified that blacks and whites in the study received similar zzso We identified 89 unique zzso in 54 articles that met our inclusion zzso 

zzso survival rates and hazard ratios zzso for death for blacks relative to whites were zzso These were subsequently adjusted for rates of death due to causes other than the cancer under study to determine zzso survival and zzso zzso 

zzso represent 189 877 white and 32 zzso black patients with 14 different zzso Compared with zzso blacks had an overall excess risk of death zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso After correction for deaths due to other causes, the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the 14 zzso blacks were at a significantly higher risk of zzso death only for cancer of the breast, zzso or zzso 

Only modest zzso survival differences are evident for blacks and whites treated comparably for zzso zzso zzso differences in cancer biology between racial groups are unlikely to be responsible for a substantial portion of the survival zzso zzso in treatment, stage at zzso and mortality from other diseases should represent the primary targets of research and interventions designed to reduce disparities in cancer zzso
