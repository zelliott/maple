In this study we investigated whether the sodium transport zzso zzso originally isolated from zzso zzso was also elaborated by some other zzso cells in zzso Like culture medium from the zzso zzso zzso the media from two other zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso also showed significant zzso activity on zzso sodium zzso rate constant in normal zzso Similarly, culture media from three zzso cell lines zzso zzso and zzso also showed significant zzso zzso zzso Using zzso liquid zzso to isolate zzso culture media from zzso and zzso cells were zzso treated, and zzso isolated from zzso cells had the same retention time as that shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso and zzso sodium zzso rate constant from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso Like zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced sodium zzso and influx by equivalent amounts suggesting thereby that it is a zzso exchange zzso These studies show that a factor exhibiting zzso activity on zzso exchange is zzso by a variety of zzso and zzso cells in zzso
