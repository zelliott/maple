The integration of chemistry and molecular biology with imaging is providing some of the most exciting opportunities in the treatment of zzso The field of zzso imaging, where diagnosis is combined with therapy, is particularly suitable for a disease as complex as cancer, especially now that zzso and zzso profiling can provide an extensive zzso of each zzso Using this information, zzso agents can be shaped for personalized treatment to target specific zzso such as the tumor zzso zzso whilst minimizing damage to normal zzso These zzso agents can also be used to target multiple pathways or networks by incorporating multiple small interfering zzso zzso within a single zzso A decade ago genetic zzso were the primary focus in cancer zzso Now it is apparent that the tumor zzso zzso interactions between cancer cells and zzso cells, such as zzso cells, zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso and a host of zzso factors and zzso influence progression to zzso disease, aggressiveness and the response of the disease to zzso In this review, we outline some of the characteristics of the zzso describe the zzso agents currently available to target the zzso and discuss the unique opportunities the zzso provides for the design of novel zzso agents for cancer zzso
