A novel signal amplification strategy for zzso zzso detection of cancer zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso Specifically, a controlled radical zzso reaction is triggered after the capture of target molecules on the zzso zzso Growth of long chain zzso materials provides numerous sites for subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso which in turn significantly enhances zzso signal zzso The signal was further amplified through the use of zzso to modify the zzso surface to accelerate the electron zzso zzso generated electron transfer for atom transfer radical zzso zzso zzso was used in this study for its high efficiency in zzso zzso and better tolerance toward oxygen in zzso zzso zzso zzso was examined to provide excess zzso groups for zzso zzso In the zzso zzso eight carbon working electrodes, as well as their zzso zzso were zzso on a piece of square paper, and the same zzso reference and carbon counter zzso were shared with another piece of square paper via zzso Using the zzso zzso detection system, four cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso 125 zzso and zzso zzso 153 zzso were zzso A limit of detection of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was demonstrated, zzso The results show that the proposed strategy offers great promises in providing a sensitive and cost-effective solution for zzso zzso
