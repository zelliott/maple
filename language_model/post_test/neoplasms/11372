Recent research in cancer progression and treatment indicates that many forms of cancer arise from the development of a small zzso of abnormal cancer stem cells zzso that promote cancer growth and zzso Many potential treatments zzso interact with cells at certain stages of the cell cycle by either selective killing or halting the cell cycle, such as intense, zzso zzso electric fields zzso zzso mathematical models of zzso cancer cell populations at the plateau of their growth characteristics may estimate the long-term consequences of these treatments on zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso such a model with no transition from the zzso to zzso state shows that it is possible for the zzso cell population to fall below 1 if the zzso cell population zzso a sufficient competitive advantage with respect to zzso consumption and/or survival zzso zzso small, realistic transition rates did not appreciably alter short-term or long-term population zzso indicating that the predicted small cell population zzso zzso 1 zzso is not an zzso of the simpler zzso Experimental observations of zzso effects on the cell cycle suggest that such a model may serve as a first step in assessing the viability of a given cancer treatment in zzso prior to clinical zzso
