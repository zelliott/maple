zzso gene transfer into a tumor mass can be improved by combining it with zzso zzso zzso when both zzso zzso the same cancer zzso We investigated the efficiency of enhancing zzso expression and effectiveness of cancer killing of two zzso zzso one expressing zzso zzso and another expressing a truncated form of zzso that lacks the zzso domain zzso when combined with zzso zzso We found that zzso with zzso actually decreased zzso expression and viral replication through a mechanism apparently involving repression of the zzso promoter and decreased expression of early and late structural proteins necessary for viral zzso In contrast, zzso with zzso resulted in increased zzso zzso zzso zzso and cancer cell death both in zzso and in zzso These results indicate that zzso coupled with a zzso enhances zzso cancer cell zzso
