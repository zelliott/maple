The zzso zzso zzso sequence was zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso zzso were developed in our laboratory for use as ultrasound contrast zzso By zzso the surface of the agent with a targeting zzso it can be targeted to a specific address within the zzso This application is ideal for both targeted imaging and/or targeted drug zzso zzso are zzso proteins in cells that play a vital role in cell attachment and many other zzso The zzso zzso sequence targets zzso expressed during zzso zzso and zzso The zzso specific to zzso are more active during cancer and can be used as receptors for the zzso contrast zzso Although the generic zzso sequence is not specific to only zzso and zzso zzso it is an excellent candidate for proof of concepts studies such as described zzso zzso in zzso results indicate that the modified capsules remain highly zzso zzso enhancement of 20 zzso in zzso and adhere specifically to a breast cancer cell line zzso in zzso zzso However, no adherence is seen with either unmodified capsules zzso zzso or when cells that have been zzso with zzso zzso are contacted with modified capsules zzso zzso zzso targeting of ultrasound contrast agents could lead the way to imaging as a method for discrimination of zzso from zzso
