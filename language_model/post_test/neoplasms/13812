zzso is used in the production of acrylic and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gas barrier zzso and chemical zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso was nominated for study by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences because of its potential for human exposure, its zzso as a probable human zzso evidence of its zzso in rats, and the lack of zzso studies in a second animal zzso Male and female zzso mice received zzso zzso than zzso zzso in zzso water by zzso for 14 weeks or 2 zzso zzso zzso studies were conducted in zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso cells, cultured Chinese zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso and mouse peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso Groups of 10 male and 10 female mice were administered 0, 5, 10, 20, 40, or 60 zzso zzso body weight in zzso water by zzso 5 days per week, for 14 zzso All male and nine female mice in the 60 zzso groups and eight male and three female mice in the 40 zzso groups died on the first day of the zzso The mean body weight gain of 20 zzso males was less than that of the vehicle control zzso Clinical findings included lethargy and abnormal breathing in the 40 zzso zzso zzso and zzso counts were decreased in 20 zzso males and 40 zzso zzso and a minimal zzso anemia was observed in 40 zzso zzso Heart weights of 20 zzso males were significantly greater than those of the vehicle controls, and left zzso zzso weights of 10 and 20 zzso males were significantly zzso The zzso of chronic active inflammation and zzso in the zzso of 40 zzso females were significantly zzso zzso zzso Groups of 50 male and 50 female mice were administered zzso in zzso water by zzso at doses of 0, zzso 10, or 20 zzso 5 days per week, for 104 to 105 zzso zzso from five male and five female mice from each group was collected at 2 weeks and at 3, 12, and 18 months and analyzed for zzso and zzso zzso as markers of exposure to zzso Survival, Body zzso and zzso zzso zzso Survival of 20 zzso mice was significantly less than that of the vehicle control zzso Mean body weights of 20 zzso males and females were generally less than those of the vehicle controls throughout most of the zzso zzso increases in urinary zzso and zzso zzso occurred in all zzso groups at 2 weeks and at 3, 12, and 18 zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso cell zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso occurred with positive trends in males and zzso and were present in 50% or greater of mice administered 10 or 20 zzso The zzso of mild focal or zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in 20 zzso males and females and of mild diffuse or focal zzso zzso in 20 zzso males were zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso were significantly increased in all zzso groups of males and in 10 and 20 zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was significantly increased in 10 zzso zzso The zzso of benign or zzso zzso cell tumor zzso in the zzso of 10 zzso females was greater than that in the vehicle zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso in the zzso of 10 and 20 zzso females were significantly zzso The zzso of zzso zzso or zzso zzso in 10 zzso females was significantly zzso 

zzso was zzso in zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso liver zzso it was not zzso without zzso zzso in these two zzso No zzso activity was observed in strain zzso or zzso with or without zzso zzso was zzso in mouse zzso zzso cells in the absence of zzso it was not tested with zzso In cultured Chinese zzso zzso cells, zzso induced sister zzso exchanges with and without zzso zzso aberrations were significantly increased in the presence of zzso zzso Tests for induction of zzso zzso lethal zzso in germ cells of male zzso zzso were negative when zzso was administered in feed or by zzso A test for induction of zzso zzso in male zzso zzso was zzso In contrast to the induction of zzso damage by zzso in zzso cells in zzso no increase in the frequency of zzso zzso zzso was observed in peripheral blood samples from male or female mice administered zzso by zzso for 14 zzso In zzso zzso induced genetic damage in zzso in bacterial and zzso cells, but in zzso test results in zzso zzso and in mice were zzso 

Under the conditions of this zzso zzso study, there was clear evidence of zzso activity of zzso in male and female zzso mice based on increased zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and lung in female mice may have been related to administration of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso in males and of the zzso and zzso in females were associated with administration of zzso by zzso for 2 zzso
