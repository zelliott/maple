We briefly review zzso homogeneous zzso mathematical models describing the interactions between a zzso tumor and the immune zzso We begin with the simplest zzso zzso models for tumor growth and proceed to consider greater zzso detail (and zzso more zzso in zzso This approach allows us to clarify the necessity for expanding the complexity of models in order to capture the biological mechanisms we wish to zzso We conclude by discussing some zzso problems in the mathematical modeling of zzso system zzso
