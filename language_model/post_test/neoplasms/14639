An in zzso tumor immunity model is zzso zzso between zzso and zzso in zzso medium are being studied as well as the effect induced upon these interactions by the addition of zzso and zzso tumor zzso In our model, the tumor cells seem to be approached by the zzso before any contact with the zzso and then presented to the zzso The zzso may then acquire an zzso structure and display zzso zzso A pattern of in zzso cellular immunity is zzso This description may serve as a model for further study and understanding of the process of tumor zzso It is suggested that in contrast to generally accepted models of cellular zzso zzso can interact directly with zzso complexes and present them to zzso The latter would in turn be zzso become zzso and produce or accumulate immune zzso These cells seem to be an in zzso analog of the recently described tumor zzso zzso zzso which reside in zzso within spontaneous zzso
