zzso protect the zzso ends from unscheduled DNA repair and zzso zzso are zzso zzso composed of repetitive DNA zzso zzso bound to an array of specialized zzso The length of zzso repeats and the integrity of zzso proteins are both important for zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso length and integrity are regulated by a number of zzso zzso thus pointing to higher order control of zzso zzso In this regard, we have recently discovered that zzso are transcribed generating long, zzso zzso which remain associated with the zzso zzso and are likely to have important roles in zzso zzso In the past, we showed that zzso length and the zzso component of zzso zzso are critical zzso for the zzso of stem zzso These effects of zzso and zzso length on stem cell zzso anticipate the premature zzso and cancer zzso of zzso zzso zzso Recently, we have demonstrated the zzso activity of zzso by forcing zzso expression in mice with zzso cancer zzso zzso is the major protein complex bound to zzso zzso however, its potential relevance for cancer and zzso remained unaddressed to zzso To this end, we have generated mice zzso deleted for the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso The study of these mice demonstrates that zzso dysfunction, even if zzso are of a normal zzso is sufficient to produce premature tissue zzso acquisition of zzso aberrations and initiation of zzso zzso These new mouse models, together with the zzso mouse model, are valuable tools for understanding human zzso produced by zzso zzso
