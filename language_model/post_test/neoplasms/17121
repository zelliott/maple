The ability to evade host immune surveillance is critical for the survival of tumor cells and is correlated with poor clinical zzso Many tumor types have been found to zzso expression of genes involved in zzso production, processing and presentation to evade immune zzso Recent findings suggest that the mechanisms underlying these immune evasion phenomena extend beyond zzso in DNA sequence to include zzso modifications of DNA and associated zzso including zzso of DNA and altered zzso zzso zzso This review will zzso zzso in zzso presentation machinery identified in zzso cells, zzso mechanisms that can be employed in the zzso of genes relevant for zzso presentation and zzso strategies to target these processes to enhance the efficacy of zzso zzso
