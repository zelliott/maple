Early studies demonstrating the ability of dietary zzso to prevent infections have left open the possibility that the action of these zzso may be through their prior conversion to vitamin zzso zzso studies to demonstrate the specific action of dietary zzso have used zzso without zzso A activity such as zzso zzso lycopene and zzso In fact, these zzso A zzso were as active, and at times more active, than zzso in enhancing zzso and zzso immune response in animals and zzso Another approach to study the possible specific role of dietary zzso has used animals that are inefficient zzso of zzso to vitamin A, for example the domestic zzso zzso have similarly shown zzso by zzso A zzso based either on the relative activity or on the type of immune response affected compared to zzso Certain zzso acting as zzso can potentially reduce the toxic effects of zzso oxygen species zzso These zzso and therefore zzso have been implicated in the zzso of diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases and zzso Recent studies on the role of zzso in gene regulation, zzso and zzso have advanced our knowledge on the possible mechanism by which zzso regulate immune function and zzso
