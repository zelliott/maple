The Coulter zzso IV separates zzso in peripheral blood by volume analysis into zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso the so-called zzso differential zzso White blood cell zzso counts, zzso zzso zzso counts, zzso and zzso were compared with zzso differentials on zzso samples, including samples from zzso patients, to determine the zzso value of the Coulter parameters in detecting zzso zzso zzso showed good correlation between the zzso and zzso differential for zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso and poor correlation for zzso cells zzso No zzso region flag indicators were observed in the following zzso 15 of 40 samples with greater than or zzso zzso 105 of 183 with greater than or 1 zzso red blood cell zzso per 100 zzso 65 of 113 with zzso greater than zzso zzso X zzso 425 of zzso with greater than 2,000 zzso zzso X zzso 84 of 112 with zzso greater than zzso zzso X zzso and 88 of 149 with greater than zzso immature zzso All samples with greater than zzso blasts were indicated by region flags and abnormal zzso Oncology patient data were zzso yielding similar zzso The authors established guidelines for using the Coulter zzso data in their zzso care laboratory to select samples that require zzso zzso
