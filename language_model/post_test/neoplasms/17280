Many cancer patients suffer from zzso zzso several years after they have undergone radical zzso Early cancer cell dissemination followed by a protracted period of dormancy potentially explains this prevalent clinical zzso zzso evidence suggests that the zzso cells are cancer stem cells or zzso to this functional state upon zzso a target zzso Their entry into dormancy and subsequent zzso are governed by intrinsic programs and by contextual cues, which resemble those regulating the zzso capability of adult stem zzso In addition, zzso cells undergoing zzso are nursed by specialized zzso zzso zzso which support positive signals, such as zzso and zzso and zzso negative signals, such as zzso In spite of significant remaining zzso these findings provide a framework to understand the logic of zzso dormancy and zzso and open new avenues for therapeutic zzso
