Recent developments in Global zzso theory suggest that human consciousness can suffer zzso zzso of mutual and zzso interaction with embedding environments which will have early onset and often insidious staged zzso zzso possibly according to a cancer model, in which a set of zzso control strategies progressively zzso 

A rate distortion argument implies that, if an external information source carries a damaging zzso then sufficient exposure to it, particularly during critical zzso zzso is sure to write a sufficiently accurate image of it on mind and body in a punctuated manner so as to initiate or promote similarly progressively punctuated zzso disorder, in essence either a staged failure affecting large-scale brain zzso which is the sine zzso non of human consciousness, or else damaging the ability of embedding goal contexts to contain conscious zzso 

The key intervention, at the population level, is clearly to limit exposure to factors triggering zzso disorders, a question of proper environmental zzso in a large sense, primarily a matter of social justice which has long been known to be determined almost entirely by the interactions of cultural zzso group power relations, and economic structure, with public zzso zzso at the individual level appears limited to triggering or extending periods of zzso representing zzso of an extensive, but largely zzso spectrum of evolved control strategies, in contrast with the far zzso case of zzso
