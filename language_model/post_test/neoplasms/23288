To zzso review the literature regarding the zzso safety, and costs associated with the use of zzso in cancer treatment and to assess whether zzso would be a reasonable alternative to the use of zzso zzso 

A zzso search was conducted for English-language human studies published between January 1980 and April 2012 using the terms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso methotrexate, zzso and clinical zzso 

Articles pertinent to clinical trials zzso 1, 2, 3) related to evaluating the zzso zzso and safety of zzso were collected and their contents zzso 

From these zzso and clinical studies, information on the use of zzso as a zzso of zzso as well as when combined with other zzso agents were scrutinized and extracted for comparison with zzso whenever zzso Two zzso Phase 3 clinical studies comparing the efficacy and adverse effect profiles of zzso and zzso demonstrated that zzso is as effective as zzso in terms of response, zzso and zzso Six zzso Phase 3 clinical studies demonstrated the safety and efficacy of zzso as a zzso of zzso in combination zzso other zzso agents in zzso cancer zzso zzso has been studied in other zzso These clinical Phase zzso studies demonstrated efficacy and safety of zzso in combination zzso regimens zzso zzso and other zzso zzso 

The results of the clinical studies suggest that zzso is zzso and can be used safely in combination with zzso and other zzso zzso zzso can be used zzso with zzso for modulating zzso The current shortage of the supply of zzso centered in North America renders zzso a reasonable alternative in terms of efficacy and toxicity profile, but from the perspective of cost, zzso remains the drug of zzso
