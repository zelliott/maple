Among the three zzso proteins discussed, zzso is the only clinically useful tumor marker, and the value of zzso zzso is restricted to patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso In patients with zzso zzso disease, zzso levels may serve as an adjunct for the diagnosis, provide zzso information, and be an objective zzso to evaluate the effects of zzso Little or no additional information is obtained from zzso or zzso zzso In patients with germ cell zzso of the zzso zzso zzso add useful information for clinical staging and monitoring of therapy, although zzso between tumor growth and zzso levels can be found in patients whose tumors contain several different zzso zzso zzso zzso must be made as well in these patients to monitor disease zzso Neither zzso nor zzso zzso are useful in these zzso None of the zzso proteins are useful for zzso as zzso zzso or for evaluating the effects of therapy in groups of patients with zzso zzso In some patients with zzso zzso each of the markers may accurately reflect changes in tumor burden during zzso However, the problems with specificity and sensitivity of the tests and the fact that the majority of patients whose tumors produce the hormone have circulating zzso that are at the limits of detection of the zzso decrease the utility of these zzso and render them zzso for routine patient zzso
