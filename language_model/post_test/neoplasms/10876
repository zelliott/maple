This study explores the financial consequences of decreased acute care zzso and expanded community-based care for patients at the end of life in zzso 

A zzso model based on cost and zzso data was used to estimate the costs of care for cancer and organ failure in the last year of life and to simulate reduced acute care zzso 

We estimated at pounds zzso billion the cost to the taxpayer of care for the zzso patients dying from cancer in zzso The equivalent cost for the 30,000 people dying from organ failure was pounds zzso zzso Resources of pounds 16 to pounds zzso million could be released for zzso 

People generally prefer to die outside zzso Our results suggest that reducing reliance on acute care could release resources and better meet zzso zzso Better data on the zzso of interventions are zzso Similar models would be useful to zzso evaluating changes in service zzso
