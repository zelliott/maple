The zzso relationship has led many to advocate zzso of cancer procedures at high volume hospitals zzso We hypothesized that in response cancer surgery has become increasingly zzso and that this zzso has resulted in increased travel burden for zzso 

Using 1996 to 2006 discharge data from NY, NJ, zzso all patients zzso or zzso 18 years old treated with zzso surgery for zzso zzso or pancreatic cancer were zzso Patients and hospitals were zzso Annual hospital procedure volume for each tumor site was zzso and multiple zzso and zzso zzso were used to compare changes in zzso and distance zzso 

Five thousand two hundred zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso procedures were zzso A shift to zzso occurred to varying degrees for all tumor zzso The odds of surgery at a low volume hospital decreased for zzso zzso and zzso per year odds ratios zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Median travel distance increased for all sites: esophagus zzso zzso zzso colon zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Travel distance was zzso to procedure volume zzso zzso zzso The majority of the increase in distance was attributable to zzso 

There has been extensive zzso of complex cancer surgery over the past zzso While this process should result in zzso improvements in cancer zzso zzso is increasing patient zzso For some zzso of the population, increasing travel requirements may pose a significant barrier to access to quality cancer zzso
