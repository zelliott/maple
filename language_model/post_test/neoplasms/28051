The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical course of patients with zzso zzso and zzso involvement, with special reference to zzso rate, zzso and patient survival and morbidity from serious zzso 

A retrospective analysis was carried out of 108 patients presenting with zzso zzso and active zzso disease in eight hospitals in Norway between 1988 and zzso zzso analysis was used to investigate whether selected variables predicted zzso zzso and patient survival and serious zzso 

Median follow-up was zzso zzso Twenty-two patients zzso were admitted with a need for zzso Complete zzso was obtained in zzso after a median of 4 months, and zzso relapsed after a median of zzso 5 zzso zzso and five-year zzso survival was 86 and zzso respectively, and zzso developed zzso zzso disease zzso zzso and five-year patient survival was 88 and zzso respectively, and the cumulative mortality was zzso times higher than zzso The relative risk of zzso increased with the use of intravenous pulse zzso compared with daily oral zzso zzso zzso function predicted zzso survival, and low serum zzso and high age at treatment start increased the mortality zzso Thirty one per cent of the patients were hospitalized for serious infections during zzso Old age increased the risk of having an zzso 

The current treatment of zzso zzso does not prevent zzso development of zzso and serious zzso infections in a considerable fraction of the zzso Alternative strategies for the management of this disease will be an important objective for further zzso
