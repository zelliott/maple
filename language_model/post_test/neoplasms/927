The objective of this study was to investigate the effects of zzso zzso zzso artifacts caused by dental metal zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A dental arch cast was fixed in a zzso zzso zzso A zzso phantom positioned in the vicinity of the dental arch cast was used to simulate a zzso To simulate the tumor imaging, the ratio of the zzso zzso concentration of the zzso phantom to that of the zzso phantom was set at zzso A dental bridge composed of a zzso zzso on the right zzso side was zzso A zzso phantom was set in the white artifact area on the CT images zzso zzso in a slightly remote area from the white artifact zzso B), and in a black artifact area zzso zzso A zzso scan was performed with and without the metal bridge at each simulated tumor site, and the zzso influence was evaluated on the zzso zzso zzso PET images, in which the simulated tumor produced the strongest zzso zzso were performed using three types of zzso scanners zzso 1 and 2 with zzso zzso zzso and 3 with zzso zzso zzso zzso The influence of the metal bridge was evaluated using the change rate of the zzso with and without the metal zzso 

At site A, an zzso was shown zzso 1: zzso and scanner zzso zzso while scanner 3 showed an zzso of zzso At site B, an zzso was shown zzso 1: zzso and scanner zzso zzso while scanner 3 showed an zzso of zzso However, at site C, an zzso was shown zzso 1: zzso scanner zzso zzso and scanner zzso zzso 

When CT is used for zzso correction in patients with dental metal zzso an zzso of zzso of accumulated zzso is anticipated in the dark streak artifact area on the CT zzso In this study, the dark streak artifacts of the CT caused by metallic dental zzso may cause false negative finding of zzso in detecting small and/or low zzso tumor in the oral zzso
