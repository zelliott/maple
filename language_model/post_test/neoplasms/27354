Central zzso zzso zzso are frequently used for stem cell collection and zzso therapeutic zzso procedures for patients with poor peripheral zzso zzso There is a tendency to prefer a right sided approach for zzso of a zzso via the zzso zzso We designed a sequential zzso study to examine the issue of zzso zzso side and analyzed all the technical data on surgical skill and observed zzso 

Seventy-five patients who are candidates for stem cell collection and high dose chemotherapy underwent placement of zzso zzso via the zzso zzso vein zzso zzso One experienced surgeon inserted zzso double zzso zzso silicon based zzso in the operation room via zzso zzso All of the procedure related zzso morbidity and mortality were analyzed on the basis of the side of zzso zzso 

The total rate of zzso in this series was zzso The zzso vein was the most common zzso site zzso We observed a statistically significant difference in zzso between left versus right sided attempts, at zzso versus zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso The routes of zzso encountered for left sided attempts were the right zzso and the left internal jugular zzso the right internal jugular vein zzso zzso zzso the left zzso vein zzso zzso zzso and one left internal jugular zzso There was no significant difference between the right and left sided attempts for mechanical complications other than zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In this study the rate of zzso was greater in the right sided approach zzso zzso zzso and the other mechanical complication rates did not differ for the two zzso Our results indicate that there is no need for hesitancy in using left sided attempts at zzso zzso
