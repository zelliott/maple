To determine the zzso tolerated dose zzso and zzso of high-dose zzso and document the zzso and side effects of zzso when administered with zzso 

zzso patients with advanced solid tumors were entered into a phase I and zzso zzso zzso was administered at doses of 12, 21, 28, 32, 37, and 48 zzso on day 1; zzso (5 zzso once or twice zzso was administered on days 2 to zzso zzso was repeated every 3 zzso zzso escalation continued in sets of three patients until the dose limiting toxicity zzso was zzso The zzso was based on zzso zzso and cardiac zzso and delay of therapy by more than 1 week due to zzso Plasma samples were zzso for zzso zzso using high performance liquid zzso zzso 

Twelve patients required either zzso dose reductions or zzso zzso of zzso was observed at a zzso dose of 48 zzso zzso we conclude the zzso was 37 zzso zzso appeared to be zzso Two patients were withdrawn from the study due to a drop in left zzso ejection fraction zzso Two of 23 patients experienced a partial zzso The mean area under the curve zzso and peak zzso levels increased zzso with zzso zzso elimination of zzso was zzso No statistically significant correlation was observed between either peak zzso level or zzso and duration of absolute zzso count zzso zzso zzso 

The use of zzso allows administration of zzso at a dose greater than three times that given in standard zzso treatment is well zzso Further studies are needed to determine whether zzso has cumulative cardiac or zzso zzso
