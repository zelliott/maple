With the recent development of integrated zzso zzso zzso resonance imaging zzso zzso new possibilities for quantitative molecular imaging of cancer are zzso However, the practical advantages and potential clinical benefits of the ability to record PET and zzso data simultaneously must be balanced against the substantial costs and other requirements of such zzso In this review, we highlight several of the key areas where integrated zzso zzso obtained zzso are anticipated to have a significant impact on clinical and/or research zzso These areas include the use of zzso motion corrections and/or a zzso anatomical information for improved reconstruction of PET data, improved zzso input function characterization for PET kinetic zzso the use of zzso contrast agents, and patient comfort and practical zzso For widespread zzso a compelling case could be made if the combination of quantitative zzso and specific PET zzso significantly improves our ability to assess tumor status and response to therapy, and some likely candidates are now zzso We consider the relative advantages and disadvantages afforded by zzso and zzso current opinions and evidence as to the likely value of zzso in the management of zzso
