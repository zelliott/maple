To evaluate the extent to which zzso in body cavity zzso express zzso in comparison to currently available markers for zzso 

zzso zzso cell blocks of zzso zzso from 25 cases of benign zzso containing zzso zzso cells and 39 cases of zzso zzso with zzso zzso (11 zzso 11 zzso 9 gastrointestinal and 8 zzso were retrieved from the surgical pathology zzso All cases were stained with zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso Positive zzso was defined as distinct linear membrane zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso or membrane zzso for zzso Strong zzso in at least zzso of the tumor cells was required in order to consider the case positive for the particular zzso 

zzso was expressed in zzso zzso of zzso of cases of zzso zzso zzso (11 of zzso from the zzso zzso (10 of zzso from the zzso zzso (6 of 9) from the gastrointestinal tract and zzso (1 of 8) from the zzso None zzso of 25) of the benign zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso in zzso (29 of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso (24 of zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso in 3 cases and zzso in 2 zzso 

zzso is a useful marker that can be applied to zzso zzso It can be used as a reliable component of an zzso panel to distinguish zzso zzso cells from zzso zzso in particular zzso of body cavity zzso in particular zzso of zzso and pulmonary zzso
