zzso zzso is an oral zzso that is spontaneously converted to zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA at the zzso position of zzso although this zzso may be repaired by the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso was combined with zzso zzso because both agents have zzso activity against melanoma and other tumor zzso Additionally, zzso has been shown to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso have been shown to increase the sensitivity of zzso blasts to zzso This Phase I study sought to determine the zzso recommended dose, and pharmacological profile of the zzso zzso Patients were treated with oral zzso daily for 5 consecutive days together with zzso on day 1 (4 h after zzso every 4 weeks at the following zzso zzso zzso dose zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Plasma samples were obtained on days 1 and 2 to evaluate the zzso parameters of zzso alone and in combination with zzso Fifteen patients received a total of 44 courses of zzso The principal zzso of the regimen consisted of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were intolerable in two of six new patients treated at the zzso zzso dose zzso Of five patients receiving 17 courses at the next lower dose level zzso zzso none experienced zzso zzso zzso activity was observed in patients with zzso cell lung cancer, zzso cell zzso of the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso studies of zzso revealed the following pertinent parameters zzso zzso zzso time to maximum plasma concentration zzso zzso zzso h zzso 1) and zzso h zzso zzso elimination zzso zzso zzso zzso h zzso 1) and zzso h zzso zzso and clearance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso drug exposure, described by the area under the plasma zzso curve zzso and the maximum plasma concentration zzso was similar on days 1 and zzso On the basis of these results, the recommended doses for Phase II clinical trials are zzso 200 zzso for 5 days with 75 zzso zzso on day 1, every 4 zzso The addition of zzso did not affect the tolerable dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso nor did it substantially alter the zzso behavior of zzso
