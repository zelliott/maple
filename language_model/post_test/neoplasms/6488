zzso agents are used in increasingly high zzso to treat patients with zzso zzso An in zzso zzso zzso was used to investigate the effects of zzso on cultures of human zzso Ewing's zzso and zzso cells, as well as on normal bone zzso zzso A zzso incubation with zzso M zzso significantly inhibited tumor colony growth of both fresh zzso and zzso cells zzso less than zzso while Ewing's zzso cells and normal bone zzso appeared resistant to zzso even at a zzso higher zzso zzso with zzso for 8 zzso did not significantly increase the sensitivity of zzso and zzso or the relative resistance of Ewing's zzso zzso however, normal bone zzso which had remained resistant to zzso after 1 zzso of zzso showed significant zzso of colony growth after an zzso incubation with the zzso zzso exposure to zzso increased the degree of zzso of both tumor and normal zzso zzso Fresh zzso cells were significantly more sensitive than long-term cultured zzso cells at all drug doses zzso zzso studies demonstrated that the loss of zzso followed zzso zzso with a zzso of 69 zzso and that in addition to the 2 known breakdown products, zzso and zzso several other zzso were present which were not attributable to the tissue culture medium or the buffer zzso
