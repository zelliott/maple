Cancer is a difficult target for any therapeutic zzso therefore, there is a continuous search for new therapeutic zzso for application either alone or in zzso In this regard, zzso therapy is a new approach that offers hope of improved control of zzso zzso research to apply gene therapy for cancer treatment has led to identification of the most important technical and theoretical barriers that need to be overcome for clinical zzso One of the central unresolved challenges remains the issue of specific and efficient delivery of genes to target cells or zzso emphasizing the importance of the gene zzso Along with different viral and zzso zzso systems, zzso cells have also been considered as vehicles for delivery of zzso zzso The zzso delivery approach was introduced as the first attempt to apply gene therapy to cancer treatment, and in general, has followed most of the ups and downs of gene therapy applications, progressing alongside new knowledge gained in this zzso As a result, significant progress has been made in some aspects of the zzso approach, while the development of other essential issues is only just gaining zzso It appears that the initial phase of development of zzso protocols - the achievement of efficient ex zzso cell loading with zzso - has largely been zzso However, the desired efficacy of zzso strategies in general has not yet been reached, and specificity of tumor zzso needs to be improved zzso There is hope that advances in related scientific fields will promote the zzso of cells as powerful and versatile vehicles for cancer gene zzso
