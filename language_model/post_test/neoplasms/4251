Among the factors triggering programmed cell death zzso are a number of known zzso and several consequences of DNA abnormalities characteristic of cancer have been shown capable of zzso the zzso zzso So although elimination of a potentially zzso cell is likely to be a rare consequence of zzso it could turn out to be important for cancer zzso A brief survey is given of the most well-known triggering factors, the molecular mechanisms of the pathways involved and the emerging experimental and clinical data relating capacity of zzso to cancer initiation and zzso It is suggested that future cancer prevention will have to consider also those factors which may abrogate normal zzso
