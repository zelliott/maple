An animal model of cancer pain induced by injection of Walker 256 zzso cells into the zzso surface of rat hind paw is zzso zzso growth and the occurrence of zzso were investigated by zzso zzso zzso cell growth was also analyzed zzso by the increase in paw zzso For characterization of pain symptoms, zzso zzso and spontaneous pain were evaluated 5 to 8 days after cell zzso The volume of the zzso paw started to increase on day 2 after zzso being zzso higher on day 5 after zzso At this time, there was a marked proliferation of tumor cells, with the presence of zzso and zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso zzso On days 7 and 8 after injection, zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso showed the presence of tumor zzso The zzso injection of Walker 256 cells caused zzso at day 5 after cell zzso zzso mechanical zzso was significant 2 days after cell injection, being increased on day zzso In addition, zzso of tumor cells induced gross behavior, characterized by a significant increase in licking and lifting of the injected paw 5 days after zzso The zzso effect caused by cell zzso was partially inhibited by zzso on day 2 after cell injection, whereas zzso blocked zzso on days 2 and zzso These results indicate that zzso injection of Walker 256 cells cause pain symptoms characteristic of cancer zzso This experimental model can then be used to investigate new zzso or zzso zzso 

This article presents a new animal model for studying cancer pain and zzso This model could help in understanding the mechanisms involved in cancer pain symptoms and may be used for the investigation of new zzso or zzso zzso
