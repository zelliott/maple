Recent work has shown that zzso zzso is a significant source of surgical zzso with wide-ranging zzso and zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine the effects of zzso zzso during zzso on tumor growth in an animal zzso 

Thirty zzso rats were zzso to undergo zzso alone zzso zzso 10), zzso with cold carbon dioxide zzso zzso zzso 10), or zzso with warm CO2 zzso zzso zzso During zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso colon cancer cells in suspension were injected into the zzso zzso The control group was zzso and tumor cells were injected without zzso After 3 weeks, total tumor weight and the extent of tumor spread, as assessed by the modified zzso Cancer Index zzso were compared at zzso 

zzso with cold CO2 resulted in a significant reduction in local and core body temperatures zzso zzso zzso growth in both groups that underwent CO2 zzso was significantly increased compared with the group that did not zzso zzso control vs warm CO2 and cold zzso There was significantly more tumor growth in the rats zzso with zzso CO2 than in the zzso group zzso total tumor zzso g zzso zzso zzso zzso g zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso U zzso zzso spread as shown by the zzso scores was less in the warm gas group than it was in the animals zzso with cold gas zzso vs zzso 

These data demonstrate that the zzso zzso of CO2 enhances tumor growth and that the prevention of zzso zzso during zzso zzso tumor zzso This effect may be partially zzso by the increased zzso trauma that results from zzso with cold zzso
