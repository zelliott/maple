zzso like many transition metal zzso is essential to life at low zzso yet toxic to many systems at higher zzso In addition to the overt symptoms of acute zzso zzso delayed manifestations of zzso exposure become apparent by subsequent increases in the zzso of various human zzso zzso is widely used in numerous industrial zzso and as a result is a contaminant of many environmental zzso zzso in its myriad chemical forms and zzso states, has been well studied in terms of its general chemistry and its interactions with biological zzso However, the precise mechanisms by which zzso is both an essential metal and a zzso are not yet fully zzso The following review does not seek to embellish upon the proposed mechanisms of the toxic and zzso actions of zzso but rather provides a comprehensive review of these zzso The chemical nature of zzso compounds and how these properties impact upon the interactions of zzso with cellular and genetic targets, including animal and human zzso are zzso
