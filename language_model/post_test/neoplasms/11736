zzso zzso have the capacity of selectively injure zzso zzso zzso observations by others suggest that the final zzso of zzso tumor zzso are zzso of activated zzso origin which are zzso directly into susceptible target zzso The purpose of this study was to zzso determine if elevated levels of specific zzso activity are present in tumor cells exposed to activated zzso in zzso zzso zzso were obtained from the zzso cavities of zzso and zzso zzso mice in which the zzso tumor virus is zzso Target cells were zzso and zzso zzso cell lines derived from the same two zzso zzso target cell zzso was zzso using zzso incorporation zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was zzso using newly developed zzso zzso for the zzso zzso acid zzso and for the zzso probe zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the specific zzso activity of tumor target cells zzso directly with the degree of tumor zzso generated by zzso zzso Interestingly, this zzso zzso of tumor zzso activity does not appear to represent the acquisition of zzso zzso rather, it appears to represent an increase in the number or size of intact, zzso tumor zzso due to zzso reduction of tumor cell zzso This finding suggest that clinically proven tumor zzso regimens such as host zzso zzso may be useful zzso to cancer therapies designed to selectively promote and zzso tumor cell zzso
