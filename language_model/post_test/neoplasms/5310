To determine the effect of accelerated zzso radiation therapy on the zzso of chronic hypoxic tumor cells by means of a three-dimensional zzso Carlo zzso 

zzso growth zzso cycle time zzso of 2 or 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso oxygen tension zzso enhancement ratio of zzso zzso network zzso and shrinkage of a small zzso tumor were modeled on a zzso Conventional (2 zzso delivered five times per week), accelerated zzso zzso delivered twice a day for 5 zzso and zzso zzso zzso delivered twice a day for 5 zzso with a break in week 3) radiation therapies were simulated with total doses of zzso zzso 

zzso grew in cords with a central zzso area surrounded by hypoxic cells zzso zzso zzso If undisturbed tumor shrinkage occurred, complete zzso took 2 1/2 weeks for accelerated, 3-5 weeks for zzso or 4-6 weeks for conventional radiation zzso If shrinkage was zzso the hypoxic fraction rose to zzso at 2-3 zzso In the shrinking, zzso tumors with a zzso of 2 days, accelerated radiation therapy increased tumor control by zzso over the control with conventional radiation zzso With zzso therapy, this advantage was lost at doses below 70 zzso zzso tumors with a zzso of 5 days were all controlled with 50 zzso 

Fast-growing tumors that zzso by shrinking are especially sensitive to acceleration and treatment zzso
