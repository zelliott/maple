The zzso properties of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were compared in nude mice bearing human zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso light (20 zzso at zzso zzso was delivered to the zzso zzso zzso and to an zzso area of the hind leg of the animals after zzso administration of zzso zzso body weight zzso and an zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso The extent of zzso necrosis and normal tissue injury was assessed by zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso necrosis in zzso zzso at zzso intervals of zzso zzso The onset of action of zzso zzso seemed slower but significantly exceeds that of zzso by days 3 and 4 with the greatest difference being noted at day zzso zzso zzso also induced significantly larger zzso than zzso in zzso cell zzso but not in zzso at day 4, where zzso showed greatest zzso The degree of necrosis induced by zzso zzso was the same for all three zzso zzso led to necrosis of skin and underlying muscle at a zzso zzso of 1 day but minor zzso changes only at zzso intervals from 2-4 zzso In contrast, zzso zzso did not result in zzso zzso changes in normal zzso under the same treatment conditions at any zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso had advantages as a zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were measured by zzso liquid zzso in zzso animals 4 days after zzso There was no significant difference in zzso zzso between the two zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso were of limited use for predicting zzso in this zzso
