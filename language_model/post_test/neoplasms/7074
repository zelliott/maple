zzso determination of caloric requirements is essential to avoid zzso complications in critically ill zzso 

In critically ill cancer patients we compared the measured and estimated resting energy zzso All patients admitted to the zzso intensive care unit between March 2004 and July 2005 were considered for zzso For those patients enrolled zzso zzso 34) we measured resting energy expenditure via indirect zzso and estimated resting energy expenditure in 2 ways: clinically estimated resting energy zzso and the zzso zzso energy expenditure zzso 

zzso estimated resting energy expenditure was associated with zzso appropriate zzso and zzso in approximately zzso zzso and zzso of the patients, zzso The zzso zzso energy expenditure was associated with zzso appropriate zzso and zzso in approximately zzso zzso and zzso of the patients, zzso The mean measured resting energy expenditure zzso zzso zzso zzso was similar to the mean zzso zzso energy expenditure without the addition of stress or activity factors zzso zzso 382 zzso P zzso zzso and both were significantly lower than the mean clinically estimated resting energy expenditure zzso zzso 330 zzso P zzso or zzso zzso for zzso There was a significant correlation only between mean measured resting energy expenditure and mean zzso zzso energy expenditure zzso zzso zzso but the correlation zzso between those values was low zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were common in our critically ill cancer patients when resting energy expenditure was estimated rather than zzso zzso zzso is the method of choice for determining caloric need in critically ill cancer patients, but if indirect zzso is not available or zzso the zzso equation without added stress and activity factors is more accurate than the clinically estimated resting energy zzso
