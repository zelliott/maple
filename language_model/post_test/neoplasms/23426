A zzso is a molecular target analyzed in a qualitative or quantitative manner to detect and diagnose the presence of a disease, to predict the outcome and the response to a specific treatment allowing personalized tailoring of patient zzso zzso can belong to different types of zzso molecules such as zzso DNA, zzso or zzso zzso protein zzso have been the most extensively studied and used, notably in zzso protein zzso tests or zzso The rise of interest in zzso mechanisms has allowed the identification of a new type of zzso DNA zzso which is of great potential for many zzso This stable and zzso zzso modification mostly affects zzso in the context of a zzso zzso in zzso It can be detected and zzso by a number of technologies including zzso screening methods as well as zzso or zzso high-resolution analysis in different types of samples such as frozen zzso and zzso samples, but also in body zzso such as zzso zzso and serum obtained through zzso zzso In some cases, DNA zzso based zzso have proven to be more specific and sensitive than commonly used protein zzso which could clearly justify their use in zzso However, very few of them are at the moment used in clinics and even less commercial tests are currently zzso The objective of this review is to discuss the advantages of DNA zzso as a zzso the practical considerations for their development, and their use in disease zzso prediction of outcome or treatment response, through multiple examples mainly focusing on cancer, but also to evoke their potential for complex diseases and prenatal zzso
