The zzso of zzso tumor end points in assessing the potential hazards of chemical exposure to humans is a somewhat controversial but very important issue since most chemicals are classified as potentially hazardous to humans on the basis of long-term zzso studies in zzso The ability to distinguish between zzso zzso or zzso promotion effects of chemical treatment would aid in the interpretation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in spontaneously occurring and chemically induced zzso tumors were examined and compared as one approach to determine the mechanism by which chemical treatment caused an increased zzso of zzso zzso Different patterns of activated zzso were found not only in spontaneous versus chemically induced mouse liver tumors but also in a variety of spontaneous rat tumors versus chemically induced rat lung zzso In the absence of zzso effects, it could be argued that the chemicals in question activated zzso by a direct zzso zzso These results provided a basis for the analysis of activated zzso in spontaneous and chemically induced zzso tumors to provide information at a molecular level to aid in the zzso of zzso zzso data to human risk zzso
