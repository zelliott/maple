To date, the presence of zzso gene promoter zzso associated with loss of protein expression has been demonstrated frequently in zzso tract zzso In this study, we tested for the zzso status of zzso promoter in normal tissue specimens using the zzso zzso technique to examine whether zzso zzso already existed in the background of zzso 

zzso promoter zzso of zzso gene was detected in 1 of 40 zzso and 1 of 69 gastric and no zzso zzso zzso and these 2 specimens were derived from the same zzso We also found the same zzso change in both tumor and blood cell zzso 

These results suggested that the zzso gene was zzso by zzso in normal background cells of this patient and that other additional factors may promote tumor development in his zzso and gastric zzso
