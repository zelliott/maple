zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family and is an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Recent studies have suggested zzso to play important roles in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso mechanism consists of the zzso presenting its so-called zzso zzso loop as a zzso to its target zzso resulting in a zzso complex with the zzso zzso Previously, three mechanisms have been proposed for the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso recognition, conversion to an inactive zzso or induction of zzso zzso zzso Until now, no zzso zzso against zzso have been thoroughly zzso Here we report the development of three zzso zzso binding specifically and with high affinity to human zzso The zzso all abolish the zzso zzso activity of zzso In the presence of the zzso zzso does not form a complex with its target zzso but is recovered in a zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we mapped the three overlapping zzso to an area spanning the gap between the loop connecting zzso F with zzso 3A and the loop connecting zzso A with zzso zzso We conclude that zzso binding causes a direct zzso of the final critical step of zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso and premature release of zzso zzso zzso zzso These new zzso will provide a powerful tool to study the in zzso role of zzso zzso zzso zzso
