In addition to their zzso activity, several zzso zzso play important roles in other specific biological activities, such as zzso cell zzso certain zzso zzso blood vessel formation and defense against zzso or microbial zzso Among these diverse actions, zzso activity, which relies in most cases on zzso activity, has attracted a considerable attention because of the potential for using zzso as therapeutic agents for the treatment of different zzso In addition to use naturally existing zzso major efforts have been made in the development of engineered zzso which display more potent zzso activity and greater selectivity for zzso zzso This review focuses on the molecular and cellular aspects of the zzso zzso trafficking and final sorting of zzso zzso zzso about the strategies used by these promising toxins provides us with essential information about the mechanisms that can be used to gain access to different zzso compartments and zzso zzso
