zzso cancer gene therapy requires a zzso that zzso and specifically targets tumor cells throughout the zzso Although several zzso have been developed to express zzso genes via zzso promoters or to selectively replicate in tumor cells, most are taken up and expressed by just a few targeted tumor zzso By contrast, we show here that zzso zzso viral zzso zzso and specifically zzso tumor zzso A single zzso treatment allows the zzso to target most tumor cells, as demonstrated by zzso without infecting normal zzso Further, zzso infection is sufficient to induce complete tumor zzso We demonstrate systemic zzso targeting of tumors growing zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso The zzso can also target zzso and spontaneous tumors in zzso zzso We document the zzso specificity of a zzso that zzso targets and zzso tumor cells throughout the body without adverse zzso
