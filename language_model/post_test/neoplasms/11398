zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of calcium binding zzso which are involved in diverse biological regulatory zzso An association between zzso and tumor progression has been demonstrated in several zzso zzso binds to distinct zzso target proteins and regulates specific functions involved in tumor progression such as cell zzso proliferation and zzso as well as zzso of the zzso zzso Once released from the tumor or zzso zzso cells, it may influence certain functions of target cells towards a more aggressive zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to contribute to zzso and the increased production of zzso zzso by both zzso and tumor zzso Moreover, zzso might be responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso and negative regulation of zzso zzso Increased expression of zzso zzso has recently been found in zzso zzso arthritis zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso arthritis zzso zzso zzso in zzso arthritis consists of inflammatory cells and activated zzso lining cells which contribute to the progressive destruction of the zzso during the zzso Since several phenomena are similar between zzso arthritis and zzso tumors it can be hypothesized that zzso contributes to the invasive and zzso behavior of zzso arthritis zzso
