Thirteen patients received 45 cycles of treatment zzso 2; range, zzso No zzso zzso were noted at all zzso dose levels when administered with full dose zzso and zzso The most common grade 3 zzso zzso during any cycle of therapy included elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso (2 zzso Only one patient experienced grade 3 peripheral zzso in cycle zzso Three objective tumor responses were noted zzso cell of zzso zzso of unknown primary, zzso of zzso 

Weekly zzso can be safely combined with full doses of zzso and zzso As zzso zzso weekly of zzso is the maximum tolerated dose in zzso studies, no further dose escalation was performed in this zzso zzso evidence of zzso activity is zzso The further evaluation of this combination in diseases for which zzso and zzso have efficacy should be zzso
