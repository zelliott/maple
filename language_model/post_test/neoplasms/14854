zzso designated by the zzso zzso as circulating zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso are thought to derive from damaged zzso As zzso has been suggested to be expressed by zzso cells from zzso zzso particularly, it is currently unknown whether this zzso is suitable to determine zzso in zzso zzso Also, more insight is needed whether zzso as detected by this zzso predominantly measures zzso or also zzso zzso cells zzso which originate from the bone zzso and reflect zzso rather than vascular zzso zzso counts were determined in nine patients treated with isolated limb zzso with zzso necrosis factor zzso a and zzso and in 10 healthy zzso Given the severe vascular damage caused by zzso and zzso of the main vessels, we expected a significant increase in zzso counts in case zzso were of vascular rather than of bone zzso zzso Additionally, this finding, as well as the presence of zzso zzso zzso in the blood of healthy controls, would confirm that healthy zzso cells express zzso Numbers of zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso increased significantly after zzso and zzso After administration of zzso a large fraction of zzso possibly zzso zzso zzso This study shows that the zzso zzso detects zzso originating from damaged zzso Furthermore, zzso expression is found on zzso from damaged normal zzso rendering further exploration of the value of zzso determined by this zzso worthwhile not only in zzso diseases but also in non zzso disorders zzso by vascular zzso
