The early to intermediate stages of the majority of zzso zzso are thought to be driven by aberrations in the zzso zzso zzso and Ras zzso zzso A smaller proportion of zzso shows mismatch repair zzso The aim of this study was to zzso the zzso of these genetic zzso in relation to zzso and patient zzso 

In a group of 656 zzso sporadic zzso cancer patients, aberrations in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and expression of zzso were zzso Additionally, zzso were divided in groups based on molecular features and compared with respect to patient's age at diagnosis, sex, family history of zzso cancer, zzso zzso zzso stage and zzso 

zzso at the zzso sites zzso 31, 33, 37, and zzso in the zzso gene were observed in zzso from only zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso 12 and 13 occurred at similar zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso percent of zzso zzso both an zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Nine percent of all zzso zzso lacked zzso zzso Patients zzso a zzso with absent zzso expression were older, more often women, more often had zzso colon zzso that showed poorer differentiation when compared to patients zzso zzso with an zzso and/or zzso zzso 

zzso zzso seem to be of minor importance in sporadic zzso zzso The main differences in zzso and patient characteristics are found between groups of patients based on mismatch repair zzso
