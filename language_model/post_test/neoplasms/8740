A single dynamic PET acquisition using multiple zzso administered closely in time could provide valuable complementary information about a zzso status under zzso zzso This study aimed to investigate the utility of zzso dynamic PET imaging with zzso II zzso and zzso for zzso monitoring of tumor responses to zzso 

We administered zzso to one group of zzso nude mice with zzso tumors and zzso zzso particles to another group of mice with zzso zzso To monitor therapeutic responses, we performed zzso dynamic imaging, in sessions that lasted 90 zzso starting with injection via the tail vein zzso with zzso II, followed 40 zzso later by zzso To achieve signal separation of the 2 zzso we fit a zzso zzso model to the zzso curve of zzso II for the 40 zzso before zzso injection and then zzso to 90 zzso The zzso tumor zzso curve was isolated from the zzso zzso tumor zzso curve by zzso the fitted zzso II tumor zzso zzso With separated tumor zzso curves, the zzso II binding potential zzso zzso zzso and volume of distribution zzso and zzso influx rate zzso zzso zzso + zzso based on the zzso method were calculated to validate the signal recovery in a comparison with zzso zzso imaging and to monitor therapeutic zzso 

The transport and binding rate parameters zzso of zzso II, calculated from the first 40 zzso of the zzso dynamic zzso as well as zzso and zzso correlated well with the parameters from the zzso zzso scan zzso zzso zzso Compared with the results of zzso PET imaging, zzso tumor zzso and influx were recovered well from zzso zzso On zzso treatment, whereas no significant changes in zzso zzso zzso values of zzso II or zzso were observed, both zzso II zzso and zzso influx from kinetic analysis in tumors showed significant zzso For therapy of zzso tumors with zzso zzso zzso a significant decrease was observed only with zzso II zzso value from kinetic analysis but not zzso zzso 

The parameters fitted with zzso modeling from the zzso dynamic imaging are consistent with those from zzso imaging, zzso the feasibility of this zzso Even though no significant differences in tumor size were found until 5 d after zzso treatment started, at day 3 there were already substantial differences in zzso II zzso and zzso influx zzso zzso imaging can measure zzso II zzso value and zzso influx simultaneously to evaluate tumor zzso and zzso Such changes are known to zzso zzso changes, and thus zzso imaging may offer the promise of early prediction of therapy zzso
