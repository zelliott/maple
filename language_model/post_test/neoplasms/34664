We report on a theoretical study of point zzso effects on charge transfer properties in the DNA sequence of the zzso zzso zzso On the basis of effective zzso models which simulate hole propagation along the DNA, a statistical analysis of zzso charge transfer modifications is zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso hot spots tend to result in significantly weaker changes of transmission zzso This suggests that charge transport could play a significant role for zzso zzso yielding zzso
