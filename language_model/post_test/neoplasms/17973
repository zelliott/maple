zzso treatment regimes are established for most cancer zzso In general, these substances have extremely narrow therapeutic windows, which render cancer patients vulnerable to zzso and zzso Individual drug dosing is currently based on the patients' body surface zzso This practice is an zzso from animal zzso Recent advances in molecular medicine raise the question of whether the present dosing strategy should be adjusted to individual functional DNA zzso affecting the zzso transport and efficacy of zzso zzso 

This review is based on selected references retrieved from zzso and the zzso experience in drug treatment of cancer zzso 

Several single zzso zzso and other DNA zzso that contribute to varying clinical response to zzso agents were zzso For some drugs it has been shown that zzso DNA zzso can lead to life-threatening side effects and/or zzso zzso 

There is a compelling need for zzso zzso studies to establish the zzso values of zzso zzso With few exceptions the current knowledge is insufficient to include zzso analyses in routine planning of zzso drug zzso In most clinical situations, individual drug dosing according to body surface area in addition to therapeutic drug monitoring and close clinical surveillance is still the preferred approach to treat cancer zzso
