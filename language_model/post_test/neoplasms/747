zzso of DNA repetitive elements is a common finding in cancer, but very little is known about the DNA zzso changes of different types of DNA repetitive zzso such as zzso repeats zzso and zzso zzso and tandem repeats zzso zzso and zzso We used zzso zzso to zzso measure the DNA zzso of five different DNA repetitive elements in normal tissue and zzso In all we studied 10 different zzso from four individuals undergoing autopsy, 34 paired normal and tumor zzso from patients with zzso cancer, 58 patients with chronic zzso leukemia and 23 patients with acute zzso zzso We found that the DNA zzso of zzso repeats zzso and zzso zzso was very consistent from person to person and tissue to tissue while tandem DNA repeats appeared more variable in normal zzso In zzso cancer we found clear zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we found an increase in the DNA zzso levels of zzso from normal to zzso In contrast leukemia showed no significant changes in the DNA zzso of zzso and zzso zzso but DNA zzso increases in zzso and zzso tandem zzso Our findings show that the changes in DNA zzso levels of individual DNA repetitive elements are unique for each repetitive element, which may reflect distinct zzso factors and may have important implications in the use of DNA zzso of repetitive elements as global DNA zzso zzso
