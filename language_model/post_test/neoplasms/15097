The biological relevance of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso pathways of zzso T zzso zzso for cancer zzso is zzso We investigated the importance of these pathways in a zzso zzso cell zzso expressing influenza viral zzso as a defined surrogate zzso zzso Following zzso injection, all zzso zzso mice zzso zzso zzso died from zzso tumors by day zzso By contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice remained zzso at day zzso zzso zzso in zzso inhibited tumor rejection in these zzso Moreover, established zzso tumors were cleared more efficiently by zzso transferred zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso rather than zzso zzso a range of mouse tumor cells presenting low zzso of zzso zzso were all zzso zzso by the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso of zzso whereas at higher zzso zzso the preference in zzso zzso usage by zzso was zzso Interestingly, a number of human zzso cancer lines were also susceptible to zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso may be particularly important for zzso zzso tumors presenting low levels of zzso class zzso zzso following adoptive zzso zzso
