A typical tumor zzso regimen using external beam X rays consists of doses on weekdays for zzso zzso During the final weeks, the tumor may contain only a few cells capable of zzso the tumor and may be growing zzso between zzso zzso fluctuations of the cell number can influence the optimal time pattern of dose zzso If the total dose is zzso a deterministic model of exponential tumor growth, zzso zzso effects, predicts that the way the radiation dose is spread out in time does not affect the average number of tumor cells at the zzso However, we here show, within the framework of a zzso model, that when zzso are taken into account, the earlier the dose is given zzso with other constraints imposed by quite different zzso the zzso The proof uses a transformation that zzso the characteristic equation of the partial differential equation governing the probability generating function for a zzso process with zzso zzso The zzso that earlier is better holds for any statistical distribution of cell number from patient to patient at the start of the exponential growth phase and for virtually any zzso zzso zzso results indicate the zzso effects, although not dominant, are not zzso
