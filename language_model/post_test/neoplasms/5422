zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the most likely precursor proliferation of peripheral zone, moderately to poorly differentiated zzso zzso The usual cell type of the zzso lining of zzso is a zzso zzso cell with characteristic nuclear zzso Here we report nine cases of unusual types of zzso including three cases of zzso cell zzso one case of small cell neuroendocrine zzso and five cases of zzso with distinctive zzso zzso The three examples of zzso cell zzso were all associated with an invasive primary zzso cell zzso of the zzso The zzso assumed a classical zzso and zzso architectural growth pattern, with the constituent cells exhibiting a zzso appearance identical to that of the invasive zzso zzso The zzso and invasive zzso cells were zzso negative and were zzso for zzso zzso zzso A fourth case displayed a mixed zzso zzso cell zzso zzso where zzso small cells were zzso identical to surrounding invasive small cell zzso zzso The small cell zzso and invasive small cell zzso cells were positive for the neuroendocrine markers zzso zzso and zzso zzso In five cases, zzso zzso of zzso zzso producing a flat pattern of the zzso lining layer, comprised the third unusual pattern of zzso These blue zzso zzso were readily detected by zzso and zzso zzso and were composed of both neutral zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we document the existence of an zzso proliferation of zzso cell zzso cell neuroendocrine and zzso zzso are usually considered as zzso cells in the zzso The presence of these rare zzso cell types in both zzso and invasive zzso provides further support for a close relationship between zzso and invasive zzso of the zzso All three unusual types of zzso cell, small cell zzso and zzso important to zzso recognize because of the strength of association of zzso with invasive zzso
