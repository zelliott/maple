During zzso zzso cancer cells acquire multiple genetic zzso that override the normal mechanisms controlling cellular zzso In brief, cancer is a disease of genetic abnormalities caused by zzso and/or environmental zzso zzso diagnosis for cancer can be divided into four zzso 1) zzso diagnosis, 2) existence diagnosis, 3) property zzso diagnosis and 4) genetic test for gene zzso 1) For zzso cancer families, zzso diagnosis is zzso zzso with multiple zzso can be diagnosed by zzso zzso test using zzso cancer zzso and by zzso of mismatch repair zzso If the zzso zzso is zzso the zzso can obtain early diagnosis and prevention of cancer, and genetic services of their zzso 2) Using zzso technology, zzso tumor cells can be detected from blood and other biological body zzso as targets of zzso transcripts and zzso zzso 3) zzso properties of cancer cells are investigated for grading zzso and therapeutic zzso Using the molecular properties, prognosis of the patient can be zzso 4) Following the genetic test results, the specific and superior gene therapy can be applied zzso zzso monitoring is also available only by genetic zzso After the zzso project, the significance of single zzso zzso related with cancer will be established, then zzso therapy and/or prevention will be zzso to zzso The ultimate goal of genetic diagnosis would be the final priority to the zzso zzso
