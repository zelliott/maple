The purpose in this study was to investigate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso loading zzso zzso as a potent zzso zzso zzso is an analog of the natural plant zzso zzso that has shown high zzso activity and is currently in the end stage of clinical zzso Unfortunately, at zzso zzso these potent agents undergo a rapid and zzso zzso with the loss of zzso zzso Previous researchers have shown that the zzso of this drug in zzso zzso could increase its stability and release zzso In this research we investigated zzso zzso and their effect on in zzso characteristics of this zzso zzso zzso zzso with particle size within the range of zzso zzso 30 zzso were prepared by a zzso zzso The influence of four different independent variables zzso of zzso percent of zzso internal phase volume, and external phase zzso on zzso zzso was zzso zzso scanning zzso and X-ray zzso were also evaluated for physical zzso The results of zzso zzso showed a narrow size distribution, suitable zzso potential zzso and a drug loading of more than zzso The in zzso drug release from zzso zzso showed a sustained release pattern of up to 120 hours and comparing with zzso had a significant decrease in initial burst zzso These experimental results indicate that zzso zzso zzso have a better zzso characterization and can be developed as a drug carrier in order to treat different zzso
