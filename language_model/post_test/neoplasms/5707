The immune system is a tight network of different types of cells and zzso The coordinated action of these elements mounts a precise immune response against tumor zzso However, these cells present several escape mechanisms, leading to tumor zzso This paper shows several cellular and molecular events involved in the regulation of the immune response against tumor zzso The interaction of several molecules such as zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso and zzso are discussed, as well as the most recent knowledge about escape mechanisms and zzso
