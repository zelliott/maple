The zzso a zzso zzso DNA zzso originally discovered in the zzso of the fruit fly zzso was subsequently identified throughout the three zzso of zzso zzso zzso genes zzso zzso proteins that regulate gene expression and control various aspects of zzso and cell zzso In particular, the zzso family of clustered zzso genes plays a fundamental role in the zzso of the zzso zzso providing cells with regional information along the main body zzso The zzso or divergent zzso genes include a large number of genes scattered throughout the zzso that, zzso can be organized in distinct families based on their zzso and functional zzso This review will provide the reader with a brief overview on some recent studies aimed at understanding the functional role of zzso genes in normal zzso development as well as their involvement in zzso zzso and zzso
