The zzso targeting of therapeutic zzso to zzso zzso is an innovative concept that has recently been reduced to practice in clinical trials for the treatment of zzso zzso Previously, we reported that intravenous infusions of zzso a zzso zzso (or zzso bearing a zzso zzso induced tumor regression, reduced tumor burden, and improved survival, while enhancing the overall zzso of patients with otherwise intractable zzso zzso In this report, we describe the major zzso and zzso features that are characteristic of solid tumors under the destructive influences of zzso administered as a single therapeutic zzso To further promote tumor zzso and enhance cancer survival, we explored the potential of an auxiliary gene transfer strategy, specifically intended to induce a localized cancer zzso in addition to assisting in acute tumor zzso This zzso strategy uses zzso in combination with zzso a tumor targeted expression zzso bearing a zzso zzso stimulating factor zzso zzso zzso infusions of zzso were given first to induce zzso and necrosis in the zzso tumor zzso thus exposing tumor zzso followed by zzso zzso intended to recruit immune cells zzso into the same compartments (or zzso The intent of this zzso approach is to bring a complement of cells involved in zzso and zzso immunity in close proximity to the zzso tumor zzso in a concerted effort to assist in tumor zzso and to promote a cancer vaccination in zzso zzso we also describe the distinctive zzso and zzso features of tumors in terminal cancer patients who received zzso infusions in combination with zzso In addition to documenting the first zzso indications of clinical efficacy achieved by this novel personalized approach to cancer zzso we discuss new methods and strategies for advancing its therapeutic zzso Taken together with the clinical data, these zzso studies serve as valuable landmarks for medical zzso and as definitive benchmarks for the emerging field of cancer gene zzso
