In this issue of Cancer zzso zzso and zzso demonstrate that sustained zzso zzso of zzso by expression of zzso activated zzso zzso leads to blood vessels that essentially zzso the complex structural and functional abnormalities of tumor zzso The authors provide evidence that zzso zzso of zzso signaling in zzso cells zzso by either reducing zzso activity or blocking zzso reverses the zzso effects associated with excess zzso signaling in the tumor zzso However, unexpected findings following zzso zzso in zzso highlight the seemingly paradoxical and complex effects of zzso on various cell types within the tumor zzso
