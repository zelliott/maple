zzso zzso the transfer of zzso zzso to zzso acids or small zzso A number of publications report the zzso of zzso the rat kidney zzso being the best zzso zzso treatment zzso an active form with a molecular weight of 68,000 zzso into two zzso zzso with molecular weights of 46,000 and zzso the latter contains the zzso binding zzso zzso is intimately concerned in the synthesis and metabolism of zzso through the zzso zzso There is good evidence that this plays a role in the zzso of zzso acids from the zzso zzso and from the zzso zzso through a zzso zzso Many studies indicate that the zzso content of liver is increased by zzso drugs and that this increase is reflected in elevated activity of the zzso in blood zzso The serum zzso has potential in monitoring drug zzso Increased serum zzso activity encountered in chronic zzso seems to be partly due to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in detecting alcoholism is controversial, but it is a useful index to compliance with zzso zzso increases in activity are found in many zzso animal tumors, and can be recognized in zzso cells long before any zzso changes become zzso It has been used as a test for zzso zzso but its zzso value has shown a wide range in the hands of many zzso A similar controversy applies to its role in monitoring cancer zzso Many synthetic zzso have been used to measure serum zzso zzso Currently, zzso is the most zzso Males have higher values than zzso activity is very high in the zzso and rather low in zzso The most universal application of serum zzso zzso is in diagnosis of liver and zzso tract zzso It is widely believed that higher values occur in zzso obstruction than in zzso zzso However, the percentage zzso of abnormalities and the overlap of values in individual cases in different disease categories are so great that the zzso cannot be recommended for this zzso zzso analyses have been performed in an attempt to improve the diagnostic specificity of the serum zzso zzso zzso patterns have not been zzso and zzso patterns cannot be reproduced with zzso Whereas exciting advances are being made in understanding the molecular structure, zzso and functions of the zzso it has yet to find a genuinely useful diagnostic role substantiated by a convincing body of scientific zzso
