Recent studies have shown inconsistent results on the risk of cancer in zzso patients using calcium channel zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We investigated a large number of patients from the Department of Health zzso Care zzso Project zzso zzso database treated with these drugs for hypertension to see whether the use of zzso for hypertension is associated with an increased risk of cancer mortality and the use of zzso zzso with a zzso 

zzso zzso study and a zzso study of survival from 1 year after zzso 

A total of zzso patients treated for hypertension from 1971 through zzso They were recruited on presentation to one of the hospital hypertension clinics or general practices zzso 

Death with any mention of cancer on the death certificate in patients treated with an Index drug zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso blocking drugs zzso or receiving a zzso The treatment groups were mutually zzso 

A total of 391 cases of cancer were matched with zzso zzso In this zzso study the adjusted relative risk estimate in comparison to zzso treatment for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and for zzso plus a zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso results were also observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso with a zzso and also for the zzso and zzso zzso In the zzso survival study, the adjusted relative risk estimate for zzso was zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso for zzso plus a zzso and for zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

In this population there was no increased cancer mortality with the use of zzso and a relative risk greater than zzso to zzso was excluded with zzso zzso The suggestion that zzso zzso reduce cancer mortality was not supported with best estimates of relative risk of zzso to zzso and exclusion of values less than zzso to zzso
