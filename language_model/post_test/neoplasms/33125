In zzso exposure to radiation is known to increase risks of childhood zzso and childhood exposure is associated with increased risks of zzso zzso However, little is known about whether in zzso exposure to radiation increases risks of zzso zzso 

Solid cancer zzso rates were examined among survivors of the atomic bombings of zzso and zzso who were in zzso zzso zzso zzso or younger than 6 years zzso zzso zzso at the time of the zzso zzso zzso was used to estimate and compare the levels and zzso patterns of the zzso excess risks of first primary solid zzso among these survivors at ages zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

There were 94 eligible zzso in the in zzso group and zzso in the early childhood zzso The excess relative risk zzso increased with dose for both in zzso (age 50, zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso per zzso and early childhood (age 50, zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso declined zzso zzso zzso with increasing attained age in the combined zzso Excess absolute rates zzso increased markedly with attained age among those exposed in early childhood but exhibited little change in the in zzso zzso At age 50, the estimated zzso per 10,000 zzso per zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to 49) for those exposed in zzso and 56 zzso zzso zzso 36 to zzso for those exposed as young zzso 

Both the in zzso and early childhood groups exhibited statistically significant zzso increases in zzso rates of solid zzso The apparent difference in zzso between the two groups suggests that lifetime risks following in zzso exposure may be considerably lower than for early childhood exposure, but further follow-up is zzso
