Response zzso defined as expectations for zzso responses, have been proposed to contribute to the experience of side effects of cancer and its zzso To statistically evaluate this association, a systematic search of the published literature was conducted, resulting in 14 studies appropriate for zzso zzso revealed a significant zzso zzso zzso zzso association between patients' response zzso for cancer zzso side effects and the experience of these side zzso Assessment of response zzso with reference to the time the zzso side effect would occur resulted in larger effect sizes than when such zzso specificity in assessment was not included, zzso zzso Effect sizes were also moderated by patients' prior experience with cancer treatment, zzso zzso such that prior experience led to stronger associations between response zzso and side effects than no prior zzso zzso between response zzso and pain, fatigue, zzso and vomiting were zzso Effect sizes did not differ between side effects, with the exception that the relationship was significantly stronger for pain than for vomiting zzso Overall, these results support the contribution of response zzso to cancer zzso side zzso Additionally, the results support the conduct of research on interventions to alter response zzso with the goal of reducing side effects and improving patient quality of zzso
