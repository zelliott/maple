To assess the effectiveness of zzso zzso in a Clinical zzso Unit within a general hospital, and to propose a therapeutic zzso with EPO based on recommendations by zzso 

A zzso retrospective study was carried out on patients who required support treatment with EPO while in the zzso Unit during the year zzso Data were collected by reviewing patient medical zzso An effective treatment was defined as an increase in baseline zzso zzso equal to or higher than 2 zzso over zzso weeks, with no zzso requirements or decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso values, their distribution per diagnosis, and the involvement of zzso chemotherapy regimens were zzso 

Of the 353 patients in chemotherapy, zzso corresponded to zzso diagnoses while the rest had zzso zzso A total of 54 patients were zzso with zzso of these corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso diagnoses that most required the use of EPO zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lung zzso zzso effectiveness was 57% zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso The zzso value leading to initial prescription zzso zzso was always below 10 zzso for the zzso area, whereas most zzso patients exhibited higher levels at therapy zzso 

zzso Its percentage of zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso patients, together with its high cost, shows that a further search for zzso factors is warranted in order to more precisely select individuals who may benefit from this zzso zzso The percentage of zzso patients with baseline zzso zzso is only zzso zzso zzso values for treatment onset and peak zzso values for therapy zzso should be agreed zzso Treatment initiation when zzso values fall below 10 zzso would be a reasonable option, and a decision to use EPO above 10 zzso should be made in patients with less severe anemia zzso zzso only if clinical circumstances render it zzso zzso Use protocols must include clear concept definitions for treatment, and for primary and secondary zzso which will help in the establishment of therapeutic zzso
