Patients undergoing surgery for cancer are at high risk for zzso zzso zzso Agents that selectively inhibit zzso such as zzso zzso have potential for a zzso zzso ratio in the prevention of this zzso 

Patients scheduled for zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso surgery for cancer zzso were zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the second day before surgery, then 300 zzso once daily), or calcium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso starting 2 hours before zzso Both treatments were continued until zzso day 7 or until adequate zzso was zzso zzso zzso was scheduled at the end of zzso zzso were centrally assessed in blind zzso The study outcomes were zzso zzso proven deep vein zzso zzso or zzso zzso confirmed pulmonary zzso and bleeding zzso 

At 27 zzso zzso patients were zzso and underwent surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed in 521 patients with adequate zzso and/or confirmed pulmonary zzso zzso was observed in a total of 96 zzso symptomatic zzso pulmonary embolism developed in 2 patients (one per group), who also had zzso at zzso zzso zzso occurred in 40 of 267 patients on zzso zzso zzso versus 56 of 254 patients on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Relative risk reduction was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso The rate of bleeding complications in all operated patients was zzso with zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso for the absolute risk difference, zzso to zzso The zzso mortality rate was zzso and zzso zzso 

In zzso surgery, zzso zzso prevents zzso more effectively than zzso without increasing bleeding zzso
