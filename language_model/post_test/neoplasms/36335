The small zzso zzso zzso has been identified as an essential regulator of the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which control the turnover of multiple proteins with fundamental roles in cancer zzso The zzso function of the zzso cascade within the context of zzso makes it an attractive target for the development of novel zzso zzso zzso is a zzso inhibitor of the zzso regulator of the zzso system zzso zzso zzso that has entered zzso trials for cancer therapy and has established that significant therapeutic benefit can be achieved by zzso zzso protein zzso 

This review provides a detailed overview of the zzso system and discusses the mechanisms of action of zzso a novel small zzso zzso zzso Key findings from zzso investigations of zzso in a broad range of cancer models and preliminary findings from ongoing zzso clinical trials with zzso are also zzso 

zzso protein zzso represents an exciting new zzso strategy with zzso therapeutic zzso zzso and future studies focused on zzso the functional zzso of the zzso system in individual tumor types will facilitate the design of novel approaches that yield optimal therapeutic zzso
