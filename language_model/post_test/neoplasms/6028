zzso sequencing technology enables an entirely new perspective for clinical research and will speed up personalized zzso In contrast to zzso approaches, zzso analysis provides a much more comprehensive and unbiased view of gene zzso Although the perspective is clear and the long-term success of this new technology obvious, zzso resources making these data easily available especially to the biomedical research community are still zzso 

We have generated zzso Atlas, a zzso zzso of zzso gene expression profiles and query zzso The zzso offers open and easy access to zzso gene expression profiles and tools to both compare zzso and find genes with specific expression zzso To enlarge the scope of the zzso Atlas, the data were linked to common functional and genetic databases, in particular offering information on the respective zzso signaling zzso analysis and evaluation of biological functions by means of gene zzso Additionally, data were linked to several zzso gene profiles, including zzso normal tissue profiles and zzso cancer cell line expression zzso Our data search interface allows an zzso detailed comparison between our zzso data and the zzso zzso This is the first database providing data mining tools and open access to large scale zzso expression zzso Its applications will be zzso as it will be beneficial in identifying tissue specific genes and expression profiles, comparison of gene expression profiles among diverse zzso but also systems biology approaches linking tissue function to gene expression zzso
