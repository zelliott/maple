To examine whether zzso such as sister zzso exchanges zzso and zzso aberrations zzso can predict cancer development, a zzso zzso study was performed in a zzso endemic area with a known high cancer zzso A cohort of zzso residents was recruited from three villages in the zzso endemic zzso Personal characteristics were collected, and zzso blood was drawn for zzso culture and stored in a zzso The vital status and cancer development were followed using the National Death zzso Cancer zzso and zzso Disease zzso The follow-up period was from August 1991 to July zzso During this zzso period, 31 residents developed various types of zzso Blood culture samples from nine of these subjects were zzso for experiments due to improper zzso Finally, a total of 22 cancer cases had zzso samples that could be zzso Twenty-two control subjects were selected from those who did not develop cancer in the study period, and these subjects were matched to cases by sex, age, smoking habits, and residential zzso The results showed that there was no significant difference in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso between the case and control zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso gaps, zzso breaks, zzso breaks plus exchanges, total zzso zzso and total zzso of zzso in the case group, were significantly higher than those in the control group zzso zzso zzso The odds ratio of cancer risk in subjects with more than zero zzso breaks was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso compared to those with zero zzso zzso The odds ratios for more than zero zzso breaks plus exchanges and a frequency of total zzso aberrations of zzso were zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso with a total CA frequency of zzso had a zzso increase for cancer zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso are good zzso for the prediction of cancer development, whereas zzso and zzso zzso cannot predict cancer zzso
