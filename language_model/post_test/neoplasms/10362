Emerging evidence suggests a role for zzso and its receptors in the biology of zzso This study was designed to systematically analyze the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in various human cancer cell lines, compare expression levels to those in human brain tissue and, using zzso techniques, explore whether cancer cells respond to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was performed by means of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple myeloma zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lung zzso zzso colon zzso zzso 29), T cell leukemia cells zzso zzso breast zzso zzso and colon zzso zzso Analysis revealed that all zzso zzso zzso were zzso expressed in the tumor cell zzso For the majority of tumors, expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were lower compared to human brain zzso zzso imaging revealed that selected zzso zzso zzso proteins were expressed in tumor zzso By means of zzso analysis, it was shown that zzso and zzso cells zzso in response to application of zzso zzso and that this effect was reversed by zzso zzso zzso This study reveals that zzso zzso zzso are zzso expressed in human tumor cell lines at the zzso and the protein level, and that their expression is associated with the formation of functional zzso The potential role of zzso zzso zzso in cancer therapy is a feasible goal to be explored in clinical zzso
