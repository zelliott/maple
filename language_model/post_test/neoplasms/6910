Red blood cell distribution zzso zzso an automated measure of red blood cell size zzso zzso zzso that is largely zzso is a newly recognized risk marker in patients with established cardiovascular disease zzso It is unknown whether zzso is associated with mortality in the general population or whether this association is specific to zzso 

We examined the association of zzso with zzso mortality and with zzso cancer, and chronic lower respiratory tract disease mortality in 15 852 adult participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso a nationally representative sample of the US zzso zzso status was obtained by matching to the National Death Index, with follow-up through December 31, zzso 

zzso mortality rates increased zzso from the lowest to the highest zzso of zzso after accounting for age and zzso after multivariable adjustment zzso zzso zzso for zzso A zzso zzso in zzso zzso was associated with a zzso greater risk of zzso mortality zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso after multivariable zzso The zzso was also associated with risk of death due to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso and chronic lower respiratory tract disease zzso zzso 

Higher zzso is associated with increased mortality risk in this large, community-based sample, an association not specific to zzso Study of zzso may, therefore, yield novel zzso zzso and measurement of zzso may contribute to risk zzso
