Research into the basic biology of zzso continues to reveal details relevant to fundamental aspects of human zzso The goal of this review is to highlight discoveries made within the last year, with emphasis on their relevance to cancer zzso diagnosis, zzso and zzso 

zzso evidence indicates that dysfunctional zzso likely play a zzso role in the process of zzso zzso in at least a fraction of human zzso by initiating zzso zzso zzso form protective capping structures composed of zzso DNA zzso with a multitude of associated zzso the loss of which can have profound effects on zzso zzso Critical zzso zzso can lead to zzso zzso and may occur at the earliest recognizable stages of zzso transformation in zzso zzso The widespread zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso not only zzso unlimited zzso potential but also prevents intolerable levels of zzso zzso Several details regarding zzso structure and zzso regulation have recently been zzso providing new targets for therapeutic zzso Various therapeutic strategies aimed at either zzso or its zzso zzso are showing promise and may zzso with established zzso zzso Further support for zzso approaches comes from recent studies indicating that zzso may possess additional functions, beyond zzso zzso that support the growth and survival of tumor zzso 

zzso progress has been made in understanding the complex relationships that exist between zzso and zzso However, important issues, such as transient zzso of zzso in normal cells and the potential for tumor cell zzso via zzso independent means, remain to be zzso
