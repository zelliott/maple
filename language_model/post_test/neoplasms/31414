A zzso zzso zzso plug for zzso energies was used to measure water transmission values at different locations in a 20 zzso 20 zzso field at 100 zzso zzso distance zzso for 4, 6, and 15 zzso therapy zzso zzso The transmission zzso in water were measured at 25 locations across the 20 zzso 20 field, and each location was separated by 5 zzso at the zzso Each transmission value was made using a zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso zzso hole of 20 zzso length at the central axis zzso The small field measured transmission curve in water was used to derive the zero field size tumor maximum ratio zzso and the primary zzso exposure spectrum as a function of energy at zzso The exposure spectrum was used to find an effective zzso energy and linear zzso zzso at depth and at different locations in the zzso These values were found to vary with location in the zzso
