According to the currently prevailing perception, sporadic cancer arises as a result of zzso zzso in a cell that lead to its uncontrolled zzso It is generally accepted that zzso zzso occur randomly and that they are generally either zzso or due to various external agents (physical or chemical zzso Constitutional genetic conditions, which modify cancer risk, may become instrumental in opening new concepts in zzso For instance, evidence gathered from Down syndrome zzso individuals has challenged the above perceived explanation since zzso zzso in these patients markedly differ from those arisen in the general population, and do not seem to occur at zzso There is no global increase or decrease of zzso zzso in all genes in zzso Instead, specific zzso have been detected on particular zzso depending on the tissue type and the age of the zzso zzso In the context of constitutional zzso 21, where cancer have a very particular and striking distribution, zzso zzso and architectural imbalances in specific zzso may be responsible for a vulnerable state leading to zzso zzso in zzso of zzso patients which seem resistant to cancer, the zzso and maturation state of the cells would lead to a zzso state of zzso zzso zzso we observed that the proliferation of tumor cells in zzso zzso produced by zzso 21 zzso appears to be inhibited when compared to that of those placed on an zzso zzso produced by zzso zzso These observations challenge the current zzso zzso theory of zzso and strongly suggest instead a critical role of cells and zzso in the zzso where zzso zzso
