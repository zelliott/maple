zzso dose calculations in nuclear medicine depend on zzso of activity via zzso and/or zzso imaging zzso However, both methods have inherent limitations, and the accuracy of activity estimates varies with object size, background levels, and other zzso The goal of this study was to evaluate the limitations of quantitative imaging with zzso and single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approaches, with a focus on activity zzso for use in calculating absorbed dose estimates for normal zzso and zzso To do this we studied a series of zzso of varying complexity of zzso with three zzso whose zzso schemes varied from simple to zzso Four zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were placed in spheres of four different sizes in a zzso zzso with three different levels of activity in the surrounding zzso zzso and zzso images of the zzso were obtained on a modern zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso and zzso studies were repeated using a cardiac phantom and a modified torso phantom with liver and zzso regions containing the zzso zzso and with the same varying background zzso zzso zzso was performed using the geometric mean approach, with zzso correction zzso and with and without scatter corrections zzso and zzso zzso images were reconstructed using zzso maps zzso for zzso scatter windows were used to perform SC during image zzso For zzso sources with corrected data, good accuracy was observed zzso within zzso of known zzso for the largest sphere zzso zzso and for both zzso and zzso methods with zzso and zzso but were poorest and deviated from known values for smaller objects, most notably for zzso zzso zzso was affected by the partial volume effect in smaller objects and generally showed larger errors than the zzso results in these cases for all zzso For the cardiac zzso results were the most accurate of all of the experiments for all zzso zzso zzso was an important factor influencing these zzso The contribution of scattered photons was important in zzso with zzso if scatter was not accounted for, activity tended to be overestimated using zzso zzso zzso For the torso phantom experiments, results show a clear zzso of activity when compared to previous experiment with zzso sources for all zzso Despite some variations that were observed as the level of background increased, the zzso results were more consistent across different activity zzso zzso or zzso zzso on state-of-the-art gamma cameras with appropriate quantitative processing can provide zzso of better than zzso for large objects and modest zzso zzso however when smaller objects are used, in the presence of higher background, and for zzso with more complex zzso schemes, zzso zzso methods generally produce better zzso
