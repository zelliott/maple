This brief review details the structure, nature, and distribution of the zzso and discusses its significance for zzso differentiation and tumor zzso The zzso is a cell surface specialization consisting of zzso zzso filaments and zzso zzso filaments associated with zzso plaque zzso The zzso represents an zzso junction between zzso but in particular is a device for providing contact between zzso and zzso that mediates continuity between zzso zzso filaments and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in particular has shown that the zzso filaments contain zzso The zzso filaments contain zzso and collectively form the zzso zzso The plaque probably contains such proteins as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Under appropriate zzso development and fixation conditions, the zzso zzso of the zzso is characterized by and distinguished from zzso by enhanced density, a rigid appearance, failure to adhere closely to the contours of the cell surface (except zzso near the plaque zzso and a zzso zzso zzso Confirmation of the presence of a zzso zzso may be obtained by the finding of intense cell surface zzso with an zzso zzso zzso in identifying the zzso may be encountered, however, due to poor development and zzso in which case the zzso zzso may be zzso The zzso is such a typical feature of and is often so conspicuous in zzso that it can be regarded as perhaps essential for the interpretation of zzso zzso zzso with a similar appearance have been documented in fundamentally zzso zzso these include zzso and zzso spur smooth muscle cells and zzso zzso remain in the protein composition of the zzso the nature of its contact with the zzso and its relationship to similar structures seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a potential means of clarifying some of these zzso
