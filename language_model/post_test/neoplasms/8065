zzso cancer accounts for more than zzso of all cancer deaths but is zzso if detected zzso We reported previously on a zzso screening test in which DNA from stool samples is subjected to zzso zzso sensitivity of the test has been limited in part by inefficiency of retrieving DNA from zzso Our aim was to test the impact of a new zzso method that would increase the yield of human DNA from zzso DNA from 86 cancer and 100 zzso subjects zzso by zzso were zzso from stool with a new method for DNA recovery based on zzso capture with zzso gel immobilized capture zzso as well as with a previously developed magnetic zzso zzso The new zzso method gives an average zzso increase in the quantity of human DNA that can routinely be retrieved from zzso zzso The increased recovery of DNA zzso with an increase in zzso sensitivity from zzso zzso 42 to zzso to zzso zzso 59 to zzso P zzso zzso (by zzso zzso with no change in zzso The newly developed sample preparation method zzso a major problem in detecting rare zzso genetic changes in zzso clinical samples such as zzso
