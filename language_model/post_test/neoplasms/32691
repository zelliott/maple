A hypothesis concerning the mode of formation of the components of DNA and zzso in living cells is zzso This is based on the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso acids in the zzso It is shown that formation of DNA in the cell directs reacting chemicals from the outer membrane of the cell towards the zzso leading to the conclusion that all cells operate in the same zzso Cell products are therefore a function of the nature and concentration of chemicals in the source of zzso The origin of zzso cells is proposed as the formation of distorted zzso Suggestions are advanced as to means of correcting this zzso
