A study was carried out to zzso trends in cancer mortality sex zzso This study compared zzso sex ratio values for mortality from 18 zzso (or groups of zzso and total cancer mortality over the period zzso in 24 European countries, for 4 age groups (all ages, zzso years, zzso years, and 65 years and zzso For lung cancer and other zzso zzso appreciable rises in sex ratio values were observed until the late 1970s, particularly in Southern and Eastern Europe, before zzso off in recent years, particularly among the younger age zzso In the late 1980s, the range of variation in overall zzso sex ratios for lung cancer was between 2 and 3 in the United Kingdom and in zzso countries, and around or over 10 in Southern zzso In young adults, the decline in sex ratio values observed in Denmark and Sweden zzso and in other zzso countries and in the United Kingdom zzso or below 2) reflects a zzso of lung cancer in young males and an increase in young zzso This clearly indicates that young women are a priority target group for smoking control interventions in zzso zzso cohort effects were also observed for stomach zzso rises in sex ratio values were greater in, or restricted to, middle- and older age groups, whereas in the young there was some tendency towards a zzso in sex zzso The overall sex ratio values for stomach cancer were around 2 in most areas of Europe in the late zzso For zzso cancer, sex ratio values showed some tendency to rise, reaching a level of zzso in the late zzso steady rises were also registered in sex ratio values for melanoma zzso zzso reaching zzso in the late 1980s in most zzso These upward trends which were minor or inconsistent at younger ages in several countries became progressively stronger with advancing zzso Sex ratio values were below unity for zzso of the gallbladder and the zzso Sex ratio values tended to rise also for zzso (from zzso to zzso but showed no noticeable trend for zzso or zzso The overall sex ratio values for total cancer mortality in the 1950s were between zzso and zzso in most European zzso zzso they rose appreciably in several countries, reaching zzso in zzso Italy and Poland, and zzso in zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
