Natural killer zzso cell number and activity were measured in 26 patients with zzso disorders and the results were compared with 16 zzso control zzso The percent of zzso cells was zzso zzso zzso in the patients, compared with zzso zzso zzso in the control zzso Ten of 26 patients, however, had zzso activity lower than all of the control values at three different zzso to target cell ratios zzso zzso less than zzso The values of those patients with low zzso zzso activity remained low despite stimulation with zzso zzso or zzso zzso whereas the values of those patients with normal zzso activity responded to zzso and zzso like the control zzso Three of the ten patients with low zzso activity had a history of zzso zzso None of the 16 patients with normal zzso activity had a history of zzso zzso zzso less than zzso We conclude that patients with zzso disorders frequently have low zzso zzso cell activity in zzso The dysfunction of the zzso system appears to be intrinsic because the relative number of zzso cells was similar to control values and the response to stimulation with zzso and zzso was zzso There may be a relationship between low zzso activity and the development of zzso disease in such zzso
