The ability to predict drug sensitivity in cancer is one of the exciting promises of zzso zzso Several groups have demonstrated the ability to predict drug sensitivity by zzso zzso data and associated gene expression zzso from large zzso drug screens such as zzso The general approach is based on comparing gene expression zzso from sensitive and resistant cancer cell lines and zzso drug sensitivity profiles consisting of lists of genes whose expression is zzso of response to a zzso zzso it has been shown that such profiles are generic and can be applied to cancer cell lines that are not part of the zzso zzso However, one limitation is that the profiles can not be generated for untested drugs zzso drugs that are not part of an zzso drug zzso In this work, we propose using an existing drug sensitivity profile for drug A as a substitute for an untested drug B given high structural similarities between drugs A and zzso 

We first show that structural similarity between pairs of compounds in the zzso zzso highly zzso with the similarity between their activities across the cancer cell zzso This result shows that structurally similar drugs can be expected to have a similar effect on cancer cell zzso We next set out to test our hypothesis that we can use existing drug sensitivity profiles as substitute profiles for untested zzso In a zzso experiment, we found that the use of substitute profiles is possible without a significant loss of prediction accuracy if the substitute profile was generated from a compound with high structural similarity to the untested zzso 

zzso drug screens are a valuable resource for generating zzso drug sensitivity zzso We show that it is possible to extend the usefulness of existing screens to untested drugs by zzso substitute sensitivity profiles from structurally similar drugs part of the zzso
