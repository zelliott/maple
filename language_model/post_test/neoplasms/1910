zzso zzso zzso from six zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso cervical zzso two zzso zzso zzso and two zzso corpus zzso cultured in the presence of zzso zzso 2, were zzso for their zzso activities against various fresh tumor cells including zzso zzso A clear correlation between zzso and zzso activity of zzso was zzso Four of six zzso preparations exhibited strong zzso activity against zzso fresh tumor target cells, and were all zzso In contrast, zzso activity was not detected in any of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso activities of the zzso zzso preparations were highly zzso only zzso fresh tumor cells were zzso This result is consistent with the notion that zzso are of a different cell lineage from zzso killer cells which are zzso and zzso Instead, zzso appear to be of zzso T cell lineage that is highly zzso and zzso To explore the potential for clinical use, we have attempted to augment the zzso activities of these zzso zzso by treatment of the target tumor cells with gamma zzso zzso in zzso hoping that elevated expression of zzso class I gene products on the cell surface would enhance their zzso It was observed that brief treatment of freshly prepared tumor cells in zzso with zzso resulted in zzso of the expression of zzso class I gene products, and the treated tumor cells were more susceptible to zzso by zzso than zzso zzso
