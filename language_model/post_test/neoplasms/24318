zzso a widely used herbicide, has been classified as a group C possible human zzso by the zzso Environmental Protection zzso We evaluated the zzso of cancer in relation to reported zzso use among zzso zzso in the Agricultural Health zzso a prospective cohort of licensed zzso zzso in Iowa and North zzso 

Information on zzso use came from two questionnaires zzso and zzso The present analysis includes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with complete information on zzso use and zzso from a take-home zzso We conducted zzso zzso analyses to evaluate the association of zzso exposure with cancer zzso zzso follow-up zzso zzso zzso using two exposure zzso zzso of lifetime days of exposure and zzso of zzso lifetime days of zzso 

zzso cancer zzso did not increase with increasing lifetime zzso use, and there was no clear evidence of an association between zzso use and risks for specific zzso The risk for zzso cancer rose with increasing lifetime zzso exposure when using zzso as the reference zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso for the highest exposed zzso P for trend zzso zzso but the association was attenuated when using the low exposed as the zzso group zzso for trend zzso zzso Similar patterns for zzso cancer were observed when using zzso zzso The number of zzso cancer cases among the zzso was small zzso zzso zzso There was some evidence for an elevated risk for lung cancer, but the excess occurred only in the highest exposure category for lifetime zzso zzso The trends for lung cancer risk were inconsistent for different exposure zzso 

We did not find a clear association of lifetime zzso exposure either with overall cancer zzso or with specific cancer zzso
