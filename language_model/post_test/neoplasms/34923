zzso radiation therapy zzso has been associated with an increased zzso of zzso zzso and zzso changes in the zzso among zzso However, findings regarding a zzso relationship between zzso and zzso zzso and the differential impact of zzso as a function of treatment age have been zzso zzso findings may be attributed to the current research focus on description of zzso to the neglect of a larger theoretical framework and the failure of investigators to integrate findings from the various disciplines involved in assessing zzso zzso Two theories regarding the zzso of zzso effects on zzso functions have been zzso The zzso hypothesis suggests that zzso effects are attributable to direct effects on zzso zzso zzso indicating that the child is in a state of particular vulnerability to zzso due to the rapid growth phase of zzso during the first 48 months of life provide the basis for this zzso The zzso hypothesis predicts a differential effect for zzso as a function of zzso The vascular hypothesis proposes that zzso effects are due to pathological changes in vascular zzso zzso indicating prominent white matter changes among some zzso recipients provide the basis for this zzso The vascular hypothesis predicts no age effect or an inverse age zzso it places more emphasis on the relationship between zzso of cerebral blood flow and zzso test zzso Two basic mechanisms underlying the effects of zzso are outlined to provide a theoretical framework on which future research may be zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
