zzso zzso 

A total of zzso subjects zzso men and zzso zzso aged 40 to 79 years from 1988 to 1990 and were followed until zzso

Both short and long sleep duration were associated with increased mortality from cardiovascular disease, zzso zzso and all causes for both zzso yielding a zzso relationship with total mortality with a zzso at 7 hours of zzso
