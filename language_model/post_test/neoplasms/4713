Because of the importance to identify zzso indicator for zzso zzso we decided to check whether the parameters which describe zzso zzso damage may be used as a marker of the zzso The aim of this work was to investigate whether zzso zzso of patients with cancer zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso DNA damage on the level of the whole zzso and whether the zzso of the damage such as zzso zzso and its modified base zzso zzso in urine and DNA may be used as a predictor of zzso zzso 

All the aforementioned modifications were analyzed using techniques which involve zzso liquid zzso detection zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Of all analyzed parameters only patients with significantly elevated urinary zzso of the zzso with zzso unchanged level of zzso in zzso DNA in the samples collected 24 hours after the first fraction in comparison to the initial level have significantly increased survival time zzso months after the treatment, survival of 50% of the patients who fulfill the above mentioned criteria, in comparison with zzso of the patients who did zzso 

zzso of our work suggest that patients with higher urinary zzso and zzso stable level of zzso in zzso DNA, after 24 hours of the first dose should be regarded as better zzso to zzso as being at lower risk of zzso 

The above mentioned statement could make it possible to use these parameters as markers to predict the clinical zzso
