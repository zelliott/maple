To describe the long-term survival, zzso condition, and morbidity outcomes in patients who received total zzso zzso zzso for the treatment of lupus zzso 

zzso patients with zzso diffuse zzso zzso and significant zzso of zzso zzso received zzso from 1980 to 1987 at Stanford University Medical zzso All patients had previously failed to respond to treatment with high-dose zzso or therapy with zzso plus zzso agents zzso zzso or zzso 

The mean duration of followup since zzso was zzso zzso Fifteen of 21 patients zzso remained alive at the time of this zzso Nine of the 21 patients zzso survived without developing zzso zzso disease zzso The probability of long-term survival without zzso and without need for additional zzso agents after zzso was zzso (4 of zzso zzso predicting zzso failure at the time of zzso included elevated zzso levels, increased zzso zzso on zzso zzso and increased fractional zzso of zzso and zzso Malignancies were found in 4 patients, and opportunistic infections occurred in 7 zzso 

Overall, patients with lupus zzso treated with zzso do not appear to have better 10-year survival with lower zzso of zzso compared with patients in published series treated with conventional zzso zzso However, in this series of patients, treatment with conventional zzso therapies had been unsuccessful and given the limited number of adverse events and the efficacy seen in some patients, zzso appears to be a reasonable therapeutic option for the treatment of severe lupus zzso among patients who fail to respond under standard zzso zzso
