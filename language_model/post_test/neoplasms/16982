zzso zzso is receiving increasing attention as a gene carrier with high zzso zzso However, its high charge density and zzso effects limit its zzso zzso zzso is another zzso gene carrier with good zzso and zzso although its lack of zzso escape ability strongly zzso its zzso zzso In this study, zzso was introduced to zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso followed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized as gene carriers in zzso by measuring their particle size, zzso potential, zzso zzso efficiency, and cell zzso The optimum zzso efficiency of zzso was nearly seven times higher than that of zzso with a molecular weight of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso DNA was used as a gene for zzso treatment in a zzso model using nude zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso exhibited better tumor zzso effects in zzso In addition, terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end zzso zzso and western zzso analysis were used to determine the zzso mechanism of zzso The results showed that tumor cell zzso led to tumor zzso which could be attributed to zzso inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising gene carrier candidate for further application in zzso
