zzso is a sensitive measure of the zzso constitution of soft biological zzso and increasingly used in diagnostic zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso uniquely allows in zzso measurement of the zzso elasticity of brain zzso However, the spatial resolution of zzso is inherently limited as the transformation of zzso wave patterns into elasticity maps requires the solution of inverse zzso zzso an zzso method is introduced that avoids inversion and instead exploits zzso wave scattering at elastic zzso between anatomical regions of different zzso zzso This zzso imaging zzso method can be used to evaluate the mechanical consistency of cerebral zzso or to measure relative zzso differences between anatomical zzso of the zzso It is demonstrated that zzso is sensitive enough to reveal significant elasticity variations within inner brain zzso the zzso nucleus zzso was stiffer than the zzso nucleus and the zzso by factors of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso provides a unique method for characterizing brain tissue by identifying local zzso zzso
