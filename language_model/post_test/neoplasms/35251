In this paper we present a zzso model for tumor dormancy based on an idea of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 49, zzso to zzso The zzso of a secondary zzso tumor can be suppressed by an inhibitor originating from a larger primary zzso zzso We apply this idea at the avascular level to develop a model for the remote suppression of secondary avascular tumors via the zzso of primary avascular tumor zzso The model gives good agreement with the observations of zzso zzso et zzso 2003, zzso Surgery 29, zzso These authors reported on the emergence of a zzso melanoma at a site remote from a primary zzso melanoma after zzso of the zzso The authors observed no recurrence of the melanoma at the primary site, but did observe secondary tumors at secondary sites zzso zzso from the primary site within a period of 1 month after the zzso of the primary zzso We attempt to provide a reasonable zzso biological model for this zzso We show that when the tumors are sufficiently remote, the primary tumor will not influence the secondary tumor while, if they are too close together, the primary tumor can effectively prevent the growth of the secondary zzso even after it is zzso It should be possible to use the model as the basis for a testable zzso
