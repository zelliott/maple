High prevalence of zzso problems has been observed in clinical studies of teenagers who have a parent with zzso In contrast, we used a zzso design to study such problems in teenagers who have a parent with cancer zzso compared with matched teenagers with zzso parents zzso We hypothesized that higher prevalence of zzso problems would be observed in cases compared with controls and that sex differences would be observed between cases and zzso 

We used data from a zzso zzso survey of teenagers zzso zzso Among zzso teenage participants, 120 of their parents had invasive cancer before the zzso study according to the Norwegian Cancer zzso These parents had 143 teenagers zzso participating in the zzso zzso zzso on sex, age, and zzso zzso control teenagers with zzso parents were drawn from the zzso zzso Six zzso problems were zzso 

No significant differences in zzso problems were observed between cases and controls in the total zzso Fewer case daughters reported eating problems compared with control daughters, and more case sons reported eating problems compared with control zzso More case daughters than case sons reported zzso stress symptoms and low self-esteem and displayed more zzso of zzso These three sex differences were also observed among controls, indicating that they were general sex zzso 

In this zzso study, teenagers who had a parent with cancer did not have higher prevalence of zzso problems than zzso Sex differences observed in previous clinically based studies were confirmed but may simply reflect sex differences observed among teenagers in zzso
