zzso zzso zzso events zzso are possible findings in ambulatory cancer zzso Data regarding the zzso and clinical impact of zzso zzso are zzso We therefore conducted a study to evaluate the occurrence of zzso zzso of the lower limbs in ambulatory cancer patients to further evaluate the association of these zzso zzso on survival during a zzso follow-up zzso 

In our prospective zzso we included 150 consecutive ambulatory cancer patients who were free of any clinical symptoms for zzso zzso ultrasound to detect deep vein zzso zzso and superficial zzso zzso zzso of the lower limbs was performed by a vascular specialist in all patients at zzso In case of pathological findings the patients were treated with low molecular weight zzso zzso because of current established zzso The occurrence of death was investigated during a zzso follow-up zzso 

A total of 27 zzso patients with zzso were zzso which included 13 patients zzso with a zzso and 16 patients zzso showing a zzso Two patients had both, a zzso and a zzso as zzso During the zzso follow-up period the occurrence of a zzso at baseline was associated with a zzso increased risk for death zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of the lower limbs in ambulatory cancer patients are frequently occurring zzso features and are associated with poor survival during a zzso follow-up period despite zzso with zzso
