zzso zzso zzso are zzso proteins with a restricted expression pattern in normal zzso and zzso expression in different types of tumors being considered promising candidates for zzso We used the alignment between zzso sequences and the human zzso sequence to identify novel CT zzso By examining the zzso tissue composition of known CT clusters we defined parameters for the selection of zzso zzso clusters corresponding to putative CT zzso The expression pattern of 70 CT gene candidates was evaluated by zzso in 21 normal zzso 17 tumor cell lines and 160 primary zzso We were able to identify 4 CT genes expressed in different types of zzso The presence of zzso against the protein zzso by 1 of these 4 CT genes zzso was exclusively detected in plasma samples from cancer zzso Due to its restricted expression pattern and zzso zzso represents a novel target for cancer zzso
