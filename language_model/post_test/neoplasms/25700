In searching for a tumor zzso gene in the zzso region, we isolated two zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis indicated that these genes share zzso zzso zzso a lesser zzso also have similarity to zzso at zzso which maps less than 20 zzso upstream of zzso A zzso of zzso zzso is located at zzso zzso FISH analysis showed that the distance between zzso and zzso in zzso is about 265 zzso zzso and zzso on the X zzso have the same orientation, whereas on zzso 3 the orientation of zzso and that of zzso are opposite to the orientation of zzso Presumably, part of the zzso region has duplicated to zzso zzso Part of this region on zzso 3 may subsequently have duplicated again within the same zzso zzso zzso at some stage of the evolution of the human zzso would explain the change in orientation of the genes on zzso 3 compared with that of the genes on the X zzso
