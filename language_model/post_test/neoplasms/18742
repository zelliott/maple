The death receptors zzso zzso and zzso induce cell death in many types of tumor zzso zzso of these receptors has received considerable interest due to its potential use in cancer zzso In particular the observation that most primary cells are not or only barely zzso resulted in the development of targeted therapy concepts that base on zzso of the TRAIL death receptors by zzso TRAIL or zzso zzso Indeed, a variety of zzso studies and several phase I and II clinical trials show that zzso of TRAIL death receptors effectively zzso zzso in cancer cells in zzso without zzso toxicity on normal zzso zzso tumor cells are often sparsely sensitive for TRAIL death zzso zzso or acquire resistance during zzso zzso of tumor cells by zzso drugs or radiation can therefore be necessary for zzso therapies, but this involves the danger of triggering side effects related to the breakage of zzso resistance of zzso zzso Thus, there is a foreseeable need to develop zzso combination therapies or to locally restrict TRAIL zzso zzso to fully exploit the zzso potential of TRAIL death receptors in the zzso Although the high sensitivity of zzso for zzso zzso prohibits therapies resulting in systemic zzso of zzso several studies have shown that this limitation can be overcome by ex zzso treatment regimes or by zzso zzso zzso with cell zzso zzso This patent review is focused on the death zzso zzso currently under consideration in clinical trials, but also addresses the hurdles that have to be cleared to broaden and to improve the zzso of the currently used clinical concepts related to death zzso zzso
