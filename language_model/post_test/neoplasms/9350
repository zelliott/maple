Three previous retrospective studies noted a positive association between zzso and childhood zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether the zzso of cancer is increased in children with zzso relative to those without zzso using data from the Collaborative zzso Project zzso a large, prospective zzso 

Our study population comprised zzso US children who were born between 1959 and zzso zzso were documented as zzso or suspected during the first year through history or medical examinations and included zzso zzso strawberry, or zzso pigmented zzso zzso and zzso zzso The association between zzso and childhood cancer was determined using Cox zzso hazards zzso 

In the Collaborative zzso Project, zzso individuals had a documented zzso or suspected zzso including 7 of 47 children who developed zzso zzso were associated with a significant increase in the risk for zzso There was a slight zzso of the risk estimate when cases that were diagnosed in the first year of life were zzso No specific childhood zzso were notably affected by zzso 

Although this study was based on a small number of cases, we found zzso to be in excess in children who received a diagnosis of cancer using prospective zzso These findings provide additional support for the possibility of a shared zzso between zzso and childhood cancer that could offer insight into the zzso of pediatric zzso
