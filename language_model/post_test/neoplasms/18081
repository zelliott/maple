This zzso study was performed with the intention to evaluate the zzso of the predicted zzso cell yield calculated by two zzso programs of the cell zzso zzso upon the number of donor's circulating zzso cells and the blood volume zzso 

Patients and healthy donors zzso zzso zzso received zzso by chemotherapy and/or zzso zzso factor and underwent zzso cell harvest by the zzso programs zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cells were collected by 112 harvests on zzso and by 91 collections on zzso The median collection efficiency of zzso cells was significantly better for the program zzso than for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The collected zzso cell yield was in median more exactly by zzso than by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 59% zzso of the predicted zzso zzso obtained by zzso showed in median significantly higher percentages of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and had lower zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1011 zzso zzso zzso zzso than those harvested by zzso 

The significantly better collection efficiency of zzso cells and the more exact prediction of the harvested zzso cell yield make the zzso program zzso a safe and efficient zzso However, concentrates collected by zzso are of a better cellular quality with a significantly higher percentage of zzso and zzso cells and a lower contamination by zzso and zzso
