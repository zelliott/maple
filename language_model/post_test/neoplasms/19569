zzso zzso CT is useful in many clinical situations, where detailed abdominal and zzso imaging is needed over the course of the respiratory zzso However, it usually delivers a larger radiation dose than the standard three-dimensional zzso CT, since multiple scans at each couch position are required in order to provide the zzso zzso Our purpose in this work is to develop a method to perform zzso CT scans at relatively low zzso hence reducing the radiation exposure of the zzso To deal with the increased statistical noise caused by the low zzso we proposed a novel zzso penalized weighted least square zzso smoothing method, which can incorporate both spatial and phase zzso The zzso images at different zzso were registered to the same phase via a zzso model, zzso a zzso term combining zzso and spatial neighbors can be designed for the zzso objective zzso The proposed method was tested with phantom experiments and a patient study, and superior noise suppression and resolution preservation were zzso A quantitative evaluation of the benefit of the proposed method to zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging are under zzso
