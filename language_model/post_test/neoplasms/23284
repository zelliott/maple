zzso of the innate immune system are involved in discriminating between the innocuous cell death zzso which occurs in zzso during zzso and the cell death associated to tissue damage zzso Recently, a new zzso of zzso termed zzso zzso has been zzso In cancer, this type of cell death has acquired great zzso In zzso and in zzso experimental models support that zzso and some zzso drugs induce the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells express at zzso membrane or release several nuclear or zzso molecules termed zzso zzso or damage associated molecular patterns zzso zzso alert the zzso and play a role inducing an efficient zzso immune zzso In this review, the importance of cell death by zzso zzso the zzso drugs that induce this type of cell death, the zzso role of some zzso and their participation in the zzso of the zzso immune response, in particular in the zzso cell, are zzso The goal of this information should impact in improving the participation of the immune system in the recognition and efficient elimination of the residual tumor cells and to overcome the evasion mechanisms of tumor zzso This knowledge should lead to a better control of the growth of tumors with a zzso reduction in the tumor zzso Also, an increase in the survival of the cancer patients or probably their definitive cure could be reached in the zzso
