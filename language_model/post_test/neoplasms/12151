zzso gene is a member of the inhibitor of DNA binding zzso family proteins that inhibit DNA binding of basic zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso gene on zzso cancer zzso development and its clinical significance was zzso 

In zzso cell lines, zzso zzso status of the promoter region was assessed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso expression level was assessed by quantitative real-time reverse zzso The zzso status of 9 normal zzso 13 zzso 92 primary zzso and 26 liver zzso was assessed by zzso zzso zzso protein expression was assessed by zzso analysis of tissue zzso 

zzso cell lines were shown to be zzso and zzso expression was suppressed and could be restored by zzso zzso In clinical specimens from normal zzso zzso primary zzso and liver zzso the frequency of zzso zzso was 0 of 9 zzso 0 of 13 zzso 49 of 92 zzso and 19 of 26 zzso respectively, with a significant zzso according to zzso pathological zzso zzso status of primary zzso significantly correlated with zzso tumor grade zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed zzso expression of normal colon zzso zzso and zzso primary zzso but not zzso zzso zzso Among 76 American Joint Committee on Cancer stage I to IV patients who had undergone zzso surgical zzso overall survival was significantly poorer in patients with zzso zzso bearing tumors zzso zzso zzso 

zzso gene is a potential tumor zzso gene for which zzso status may play an important role in the zzso zzso
