The clinical potential of zzso peptides such as zzso and zzso has been widely established for tumor zzso zzso based on the tumor binding potential of the peptides and the zzso effects of zzso or zzso zzso is an extension of such zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coupled to the analogue zzso has been used to establish the feasibility of treating tumors with zzso zzso and our experience with this approach is zzso In three different experimental tumor models zzso zzso zzso zzso and small cell lung zzso in nude mice, treatment resulted in significant reduction or elimination of tumor zzso Two routes of administration were zzso zzso injection zzso zzso and zzso injection zzso and zzso zzso negative control peptides bound to tumor cells to a low extent and did not exhibit therapeutic zzso zzso by itself did not result in therapeutic zzso zzso which did not bind zzso did not evidence a therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso was rapidly zzso via the urinary zzso and did not accumulate in either tumors or normal zzso even following direct zzso zzso zzso kits containing 200 zzso of zzso were labeled with zzso zzso zzso of zzso in 30 minutes with no need for subsequent zzso These studies establish the conceptual feasibility of targeted zzso based on the local or regional administration of zzso zzso
