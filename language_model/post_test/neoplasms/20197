In view of the evidence that electrical currents may enhance healing of chronic wounds and zzso zzso growth it is suggested that these currents zzso cell zzso Additional support to this contention is given by two reports: one on healing of pressure sores in man and one on zzso growth zzso in zzso The effect of an zzso environment on the cell cycle is zzso Finally a hypothesis attempting to explain the zzso effect of electrical currents on cell proliferation is zzso It is known that zzso cells, zzso mature zzso have high zzso potential zzso whereas zzso cells, zzso zzso cells, have low zzso When a cell is exposed to an electrical field, one side of the cell becomes zzso while the opposite side is zzso Assuming a zzso relationship between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso it can be shown that in zzso cells their high zzso is zzso whereas in cells with a high division rate, their low zzso is raised due to cell exposure to the external electrical zzso These zzso in zzso potential could contribute to the zzso of abnormal cell zzso
