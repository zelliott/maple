We apply a full zzso model framework to a zzso on stomach cancer mortality in West zzso The data are zzso by age group, year, and zzso Using an zzso model with an additional spatial zzso our goal is to investigate whether there is evidence for zzso interactions in these zzso Furthermore, we will determine whether a zzso or a zzso interaction model is more appropriate to predict future mortality zzso The setup will be fully zzso based on a series of zzso zzso random field zzso for each of the zzso zzso zzso is based on efficient zzso to block update zzso zzso random fields, which have recently been proposed in the zzso
