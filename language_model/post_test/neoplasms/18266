zzso binding proteins zzso are involved in several zzso stages of gene expression and dictate the quality and quantity of the cellular zzso When zzso zzso they can lead to disease states as well as zzso A basic requirement to understand their role in normal tissue development and cancer is the build of comprehensive gene expression zzso In this direction, we generated a list with zzso human zzso based on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso were then used to verify their levels of expression in normal zzso while zzso and zzso zzso were used to perform comparisons between normal and tumor zzso As main outcomes of our studies, we identified clusters of zzso or zzso genes that could act together in the development and maintenance of specific zzso we also obtained a high confidence list of zzso zzso expressed in several tumor zzso This later list contains potential candidates to be explored as diagnostic and zzso markers as well as putative targets for cancer therapy zzso
