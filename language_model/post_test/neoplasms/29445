In order to improve the early detection and diagnosis of cancer, give more accurate zzso zzso individuals by risk, predict response to treatment, and help the transition of basic research into clinical application, zzso are needed that accurately represent or predict clinical zzso To be useful in trials for zzso agent development, zzso must be subject to zzso easy to obtain and zzso and have biological meaning, zzso representing steps in zzso zzso zzso Though difficult to validate fully, wisely chosen zzso in zzso trials can inform the zzso of zzso long-term trials that measure clinical zzso When well-designed, smaller trials using zzso as surrogate zzso should promote faster decisions regarding which targeted preventive agents to zzso promising greater progress in the zzso of zzso zzso could become useful in distinguishing zzso from aggressive forms of zzso zzso in zzso as well as localized invasive breast and prostate cancer, zzso that are often zzso zzso strategies that reduce the progression of early forms of zzso can benefit patients not only by reducing their risk of cancer and death from cancer but also by reducing their need for invasive zzso zzso and zzso methods offer the possibility of revealing new potential zzso especially for diseases whose biology is complex or not well zzso Panels of markers may be used to accommodate the molecular zzso of zzso zzso in phase 2 prevention trials of combinations of zzso drugs have been used to demonstrate synergistic action of multiple agents, allowing use of lower doses, with less zzso a critical feature of interventions intended for cancer zzso
