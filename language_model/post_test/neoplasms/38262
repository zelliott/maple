zzso represent the major part of the zzso cell wall dry weight and build the skeletal carcass defining cell wall stability and cell zzso zzso or constitute zzso zzso and cell surface zzso material zzso and zzso It is known that zzso cell wall zzso reveal zzso properties, which allows for their application in zzso and zzso zzso Recent data also suggest that zzso reveal zzso activity that can result in their protective function as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The paper provides a review of our continuing research involving zzso derivatives of zzso isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and of a zzso isolated from the industrial zzso zzso zzso The results are confronted with the available literature zzso The derivatives of zzso demonstrated potent zzso effect on zzso zzso comparable to that of the known antioxidants and exerted DNA protection from zzso zzso The free radical scavenging activity was confirmed by zzso electron zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity of the zzso zzso was demonstrated using zzso zzso and zzso zzso The derivatives of zzso exerted potent enhancement of tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso released from zzso zzso and revealed synergistic effect with zzso in the treatment of Lewis lung zzso and two types of zzso in zzso zzso The results indicate significant protective zzso zzso and zzso activities of the zzso zzso and imply their potential application in zzso zzso
