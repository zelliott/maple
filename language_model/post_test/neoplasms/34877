A previous paper in this journal zzso I) concluded that there was no pronounced optimum overall time, at least up to 70 zzso of zzso zzso at two zzso in 50 zzso The maximum tolerable zzso doses increased only zzso from the best short schedules of 21 or 23 days to those of 50 zzso Only this range was zzso in part I because it covered the fewest and the most zzso and the longest overall times that will probably be used in zzso Most UK schedules, typically using five zzso a week, yield zzso effective doses about zzso less than the best schedules in other developed zzso The present paper covers a much wider range of fraction numbers from one to zzso and from 1 to 80 zzso Some zzso errors in the zzso in part I are also corrected in the present zzso These made no difference to the main conclusions just zzso 

Standard linear zzso zzso was used, assuming at first zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso days, zzso days for zzso but with zzso days, zzso zzso for acute zzso zzso as zzso A late complications constraint of 70 zzso was accepted, and an acute constraint of 51 zzso (both at 2 zzso zzso Alternative values of more rapid or slower zzso were also explored zzso days or zzso days, zzso 

zzso values were shown at zzso days for one zzso five times a week, and at zzso days for two zzso at 10 zzso zzso caused a rapid fall in zzso dose after 30 days with one zzso but not until after 50 days with two zzso and so was not seen in part I with its zzso end zzso 

Biological zzso can extrapolate calculations outside the borders of published treatment schedules to clarify borderline zzso zzso schedules in zzso can reliably give more zzso control if two zzso are zzso The potential gains are equivalent to about two zzso of 2 zzso as given by this zzso However, the late complications will be less with some nearly zzso equivalent shorter schedules if zzso zzso
