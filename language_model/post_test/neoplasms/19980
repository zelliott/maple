zzso symptom monitoring is important in the setting of patients with advanced zzso Scores over time may naturally zzso although a patient may feel the zzso 

The purpose of this study was to determine the minimal levels of change required to be clinically relevant zzso clinically important difference zzso using the Edmonton zzso Assessment System zzso 

Between 1999 and 2009, patients completed the zzso before zzso zzso and at zzso zzso were calculated using both the zzso and zzso methods for improvement and zzso zzso confidence intervals for the differences in mean change scores between adjacent categories also were zzso 

A total of 276 patients completed the zzso at baseline and during at least one follow-up zzso At the four-week zzso decrease of zzso and zzso units in pain and depression zzso respectively, constituted clinically relevant improvement, whereas increase of at least zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso units, respectively, in pain, zzso depression, anxiety, and appetite loss items were required for zzso At the subsequent zzso these values were zzso Overall, the zzso for improvement tended to be smaller than that for zzso The zzso method estimates tended to be larger than the zzso zzso estimates, but closer to the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso allow health care professionals to determine the success of treatment in improving the patient's quality of zzso zzso may prompt health care professionals to intervene with new zzso Future studies should confirm our findings with a variety of zzso
