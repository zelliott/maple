Both solid zzso and zzso show considerable zzso and functional zzso It is widely accepted that genetic zzso have a major role in determining zzso zzso but evidence is also accumulating that zzso of distinct zzso within an organ may derive from different zzso of zzso These cells acquire the first genetic hit or hits that culminate in the initiation of zzso The identification of these crucial target cell populations may allow earlier detection of zzso and better prediction of zzso zzso and ultimately may lead to preventive therapies for individuals at high risk of developing zzso
