zzso signaling zzso plays an important role in zzso by maintaining the activity of zzso of cancer stem cells, and therefore, it is hypothesized that interference of zzso signaling may inhibit tumor formation and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is zzso in cells lacking intact zzso but it is unable to eradicate zzso stem zzso In this study, we tested a new strategy of tumor gene therapy by combining a zzso with zzso zzso zzso In zzso tumor cells, the combined therapy blocked the zzso zzso and induced zzso in tumors that are zzso In nude mice bearing zzso tumors derived from zzso cells, the combination of zzso therapies inhibited tumor zzso Moreover, zzso increased zzso gene expression at both the zzso and the zzso levels, and promoted zzso replication in tumors, thereby enhancing the zzso activity of zzso These data demonstrate the feasibility to combine zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities as a novel zzso zzso
