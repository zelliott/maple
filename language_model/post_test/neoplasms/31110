DNA damage induced zzso arising during the course of zzso replication are likely to be an important zzso cause in the development of many zzso In budding zzso zzso zzso a good model system with which to investigate this process, zzso is associated with the zzso repair zzso and depends on the functions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins are zzso of a new type of DNA zzso called DNA zzso zzso that appears to carry out zzso zzso but no other repair, zzso or replication zzso Pol zzso replicates past a zzso zzso zzso with a higher efficiency than zzso pol zzso is less prone than this zzso to insert an incorrect zzso and is more efficient at zzso from a mismatched zzso zzso protein is a terminal zzso zzso that zzso zzso opposite template G, A and zzso zzso zzso of zzso induced during zzso replication appear to depend largely on zzso structure, but the frequency and accuracy of bypass also depend on replication zzso zzso of the activity or expression of pol zzso may be clinically useful for patients undergoing cancer therapy or for those with a familial predisposition to zzso
