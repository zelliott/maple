zzso proteins mediate interactions between cells and their zzso zzso This functional protein family includes several structurally unrelated members, such as zzso zzso 1, zzso C, and zzso as well as some zzso of these zzso such as zzso 2 and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso have zzso effects on cultured cells and have been characterized as zzso factors in some cellular zzso Both proteins are produced at high levels in many types of zzso especially by cells associated with tumor zzso and zzso In this Prospect article we zzso evidence for zzso and zzso in the regulation of tumor cell growth, zzso and zzso and we propose that zzso proteins such as these perform critical functions in zzso responses of tumors that culminate in their dissemination and eventual colonization of other zzso
