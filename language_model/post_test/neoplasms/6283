zzso are zzso in cancer cells, and some are either tumor zzso or zzso In addition, a link has been established between decreased expression of zzso and zzso and several proteins of the zzso interference zzso have been shown to be zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso could represent new therapeutic targets, and their identification is therefore zzso However, structural and functional zzso between zzso zzso approaches relying on individual zzso zzso We reasoned that in cancer cells that depend on zzso zzso the zzso zzso could lead to growth zzso rather than increased zzso zzso such cells could allow functional analyses of individual zzso by zzso of the zzso observed upon global zzso zzso zzso we developed zzso zzso coding for small hairpin zzso targeting either zzso or zzso the two components of the zzso the nuclear zzso maturation zzso We identified cancer cell lines in which both zzso induced colony growth zzso We then screened for individual zzso zzso this growth arrest, and identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso as major zzso zzso However, the effect of zzso and zzso was only zzso In addition, embryonic stem zzso zzso with zzso seeds were much less efficient than zzso in sustaining cancer cell growth, a finding that contrasted with results obtained in stem zzso Finally, we showed that the tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10, a shared target of zzso and zzso was functionally involved in the growth arrest induced by zzso zzso We conclude that our approach allowed to identify zzso cancer cells, which could be used to screen for zzso zzso This zzso screen unveiled functional differences between zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso cells will allow precise functional studies of these zzso
