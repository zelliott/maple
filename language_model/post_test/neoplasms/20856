zzso of immune responses by the use of zzso zzso or zzso genes is one of the strategies for cancer zzso Although host immune responses are complex and many kinds of cells are involved, crucial steps for enhancing zzso responses can be induced by a single or a few zzso zzso However, zzso may induce toxic reactions or produce no substantial effects, when the concentration is zzso Administration of zzso zzso has advantages in controlling the blood concentration and the biological activity that can be induced by the zzso Since zzso are relatively unstable in zzso cancer patients have to receive a large amount of the zzso protein to maintain the required blood concentration for biological zzso Administration of the protein is thereby often toxic to the zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso from tumor or vehicle cells by gene transfer is another therapeutic zzso Previous zzso studies have shown that zzso which facilitate type 1 helper T zzso zzso immune reactions but not zzso zzso zzso when produced in tumors, are effective for zzso zzso Several technical problems to express sufficient amounts of zzso in appropriate target cells remain unresolved but the potential of zzso gene therapy is being zzso zzso therapy trials also contributes to our present knowledge of how zzso responses can be effectively produced in cancer patients, shedding the light on the generation of zzso immunity in the zzso
