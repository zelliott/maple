A diagnosis of collagen vascular disease zzso may zzso to zzso zzso zzso The objective of the current study was to identify factors that influence zzso toxicity in the setting of zzso 

A total of 86 zzso courses for 73 patients with zzso were delivered between 1985 and zzso zzso zzso include zzso arthritis zzso 33 zzso systemic lupus zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso (9 zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso (4 zzso zzso zzso zzso (4 zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso and mixed zzso tissue disorders zzso (2 zzso Each patient with zzso was matched to 1 to 3 controls with respect to sex, race, site zzso zzso dose zzso zzso and age zzso zzso 

There was no significant difference between zzso patients zzso and controls zzso experiencing any acute zzso zzso patients had a higher zzso of any late toxicity zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and a trend toward an increased rate of severe late toxicity zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso zzso delivered to the breast had increased risk of severe acute zzso whereas zzso to the pelvis had increased risk of severe acute and late zzso zzso administered in the setting of zzso carried a higher risk of severe late zzso whereas zzso to zzso patients carried a higher risk of severe acute and late zzso 

Although generally well zzso zzso in the setting of zzso appears to carry a higher risk of late zzso zzso to the pelvis or in the setting of zzso or zzso may zzso to an even greater risk of severe zzso These issues should be considered when deciding whether to offer zzso for these zzso
