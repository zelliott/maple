zzso instability is characteristic of tumor cells, and a strong correlation exists between abnormal zzso and zzso Increased expression of the zzso zzso and DNA repair protein zzso has been reported in immortalized and tumor cells, which could alter zzso pathways to contribute to the zzso zzso found in these zzso We used a genetic system to examine the potential for multiple zzso breaks to lead to zzso zzso in the presence of increased zzso zzso Analysis of repair revealed a novel class of products consistent with crossing over, involving gene conversion associated with an exchange of zzso markers leading to zzso zzso Increased zzso also promoted zzso and multiple zzso zzso These data provide a link between elevated zzso protein levels, zzso instability, and tumor zzso
