This paper presents a zzso study of zzso and cell kinetic models for cancer zzso zzso The zzso analysis is based on a modified procedure deduced from zzso scheme of the relationship between the cellular zzso of normal and tumor zzso and the zzso of zzso agents for designing an optimal dose and schedule for cancer zzso In this scheme zzso models and zzso interactions at the tumor site are incorporated into the cell cycle kinetic models to form the cancer zzso model zzso Three cell cycle kinetic models are presented under alternative hypotheses concerning the mechanism of the resting cells, while each tumor mass is comprised of cells in zzso zzso of the four cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resting zzso and non dividing zzso zzso zzso An zzso and a computer program for simulating the tumor populations during scheduled treatments have been zzso By a suitable selection of expressions for zzso zzso the program is able to simulate tumor behavior during scheduled treatments with different classes of zzso agent such as cell cycle zzso cell zzso or cell zzso or cell zzso zzso A preliminary study of the zzso therapeutic system is included to demonstrate the computer simulation zzso
