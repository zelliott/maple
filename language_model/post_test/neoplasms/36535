To evaluate clinical characteristics and functional outcome of zzso zzso spinal zzso zzso associated with a zzso zzso 

Between 1987 and 1990, 136 patients with zzso spinal zzso zzso were treated with zzso Of these, 25 patients zzso had zzso spinal zzso zzso associated with a zzso zzso This report is based on analysis of these 25 zzso Fourteen patients received zzso zzso in 10 zzso Seven received zzso zzso in 16 zzso Four received 2000 zzso in 5 zzso Motor function was evaluated by five zzso 

Lung cancer accounted for the majority of zzso spinal zzso zzso with a zzso mass zzso followed by zzso zzso and kidney tumor zzso This pattern of zzso spinal zzso zzso has a longer duration of pain before developing zzso symptoms and has a high propensity of the upper zzso spine involvement by an zzso lung zzso The functional outcome of radiation treatment reveals a significant difference between moderately zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso and very zzso tumor zzso None of the zzso patients became ambulatory following zzso except for the very zzso zzso Higher doses of radiation treatment zzso zzso in 16 zzso did not improve functional zzso 

Due to the larger tumor burden, radiation treatment for zzso spinal zzso zzso associated with a zzso mass is not as effective as treatment of zzso spinal zzso zzso without a zzso mass except for the very zzso zzso zzso combined treatment zzso might be beneficial for improving functional zzso
