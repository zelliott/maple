The zzso artery zzso is usually zzso to avoid zzso zzso before zzso zzso zzso to treat liver zzso In a minority of patients, there is retrograde flow in the zzso The purpose of this study was to determine if there is any increased risk from maintaining a patent zzso in patients with reversed zzso 

A retrospective review was performed of all patients undergoing zzso zzso at our zzso The zzso of zzso arising from zzso zzso by way of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and death occurring within 2 months of treatment were compared between the reversed and the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso patients underwent preliminary zzso zzso zzso flow was found on zzso in zzso of zzso the zzso was not zzso in these zzso The zzso was coiled in zzso of patients with zzso zzso flow to prevent zzso zzso of zzso zzso There was no increased toxicity related to zzso zzso by way of the zzso or increased early zzso in patients with reversed zzso flow zzso zzso zzso 

In patients with reversed zzso flow, maintenance of a patent zzso before administration of zzso zzso does not increase the risk of toxicity from zzso zzso zzso injection, with careful monitoring to identify early vascular zzso may be safely performed beyond the origin of the patent zzso A patent zzso with reversed flow provides forward drive for infused particles and may allow alternative access to the zzso zzso
