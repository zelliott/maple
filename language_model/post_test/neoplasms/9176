We tested the hypothesis that prescription coverage affects the prescribing of zzso zzso to indigent inner city minority patients with cancer zzso 

We conducted a chart review of 360 patients treated in the Oncology zzso at University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey University Hospital, who were prescribed zzso pain zzso Half the patients were charity care or zzso zzso without the benefit of prescription coverage, and half had Medicaid, with unlimited prescription zzso We evaluated patients discharged from a zzso who had three subsequent zzso follow-up zzso We compared zzso pain intensity, the type and dose of zzso adherence to prescribed pain regimen, unscheduled emergency department visits, and unscheduled zzso 

There was a significantly greater use of zzso zzso in the Medicaid group than in the zzso zzso The Medicaid group had significantly more African American patients and a greater rate of smoking and substance use, and the zzso group disproportionately more Hispanic and Asian patients and less smoking and substance zzso Hispanic and Asian patients were less likely to have zzso zzso prescribed to zzso zzso levels and adherence were equivalent in both groups and were not affected by any of these variables except stage of disease, which was equally distributed in the two zzso 

zzso use of zzso zzso for equivalent levels of cancer pain was influenced only by the availability of prescription zzso The group without prescription coverage and receiving fewer zzso zzso had disproportionately more Hispanic and Asian zzso
