Four drugs that inhibit zzso function have been evaluated for their zzso effects in zzso These are zzso zzso zzso and zzso Aspirin has been shown to reduce the number of transient zzso attacks zzso stroke and death in patients with multiple zzso The reduction in zzso was greatest in males who were zzso and when there was an zzso demonstrated zzso in the carotid artery that accounted for the zzso Aspirin reduced zzso zzso and zzso and fatal pulmonary embolism in patients after surgery for fractured hip and after zzso hip zzso There is evidence that the zzso effect of aspirin may be greater in male zzso Aspirin reduced the frequency of zzso shunt zzso Aspirin abolished symptoms in patients with peripheral zzso associated with zzso and spontaneous zzso zzso There is no conclusive evidence at the present time that aspirin is effective in patients with coronary artery artery zzso zzso in combination with oral zzso is effective in reducing the frequency of systemic embolism in patients with prosthetic heart valve replacement but is ineffective in patients with transient cerebral zzso attacks or for the prevention of zzso zzso zzso was effective in reducing zzso zzso zzso in patients undergoing general zzso surgery but the evidence that it was effective in patients undergoing zzso surgery is zzso zzso may be effective in reducing the frequency of sudden cardiac deaths in patients in the first year after zzso zzso when it is started within 25 to 35 days after the zzso zzso reduced the zzso of zzso shunt zzso in patients undergoing chronic zzso and in combination with zzso it reduced the frequency of zzso zzso zzso There have been no large scale trials of zzso zzso drugs in clinical cancer and successful treatment of zzso disorders cannot be used to predict success in the treatment of zzso zzso
