Recently, it has been reported that some members of the zzso family might have a zzso zzso in other words, zzso have been found to act not only as classical zzso but also as scaffolding zzso Until now, the use of knockout mice has been considered sufficient to model the effects of zzso zzso and to predict the outcome of zzso pharmacological treatments by observing the resulting zzso These studies supported the view that zzso may represent promising pharmacological targets for cancer and zzso However, in selected cases, different experimental strategies of gene targeting of the same locus have resulted in distinct zzso This demonstrates that zzso a gene is not necessarily equivalent to zzso an zzso point zzso zzso et zzso in Cell zzso zzso Specifically, knockout and zzso models have led to the discovery that zzso and zzso may act independently of their zzso activity, likely as zzso zzso
