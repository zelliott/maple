Deaths prior to or shortly after the diagnosis of childhood cancer may reflect zzso in detection and appropriate referral for zzso This study was performed to determine the extent of and factors associated with early death in childhood zzso 

Patients with of primary cancer, aged zzso years at diagnosis, were identified from the zzso data zzso zzso zzso from 1973 to zzso Early deaths were defined as cases identified by 1) death certificate, 2) autopsy report, or 3) death within 1 month of initial diagnoses zzso zzso zzso zzso of death was determined by zzso and -9 zzso Age at diagnosis, year of diagnosis, zzso site of disease, race, and gender were evaluated for association with early zzso 

Age zzso year at diagnosis zzso early zzso being diagnosed earlier in the observation period, and a diagnosis of a brain zzso zzso zzso or liver tumor were associated with increased early zzso Gender and race were not associated with early zzso Among the cases for whom the zzso diagnosis was made at the time of death zzso zzso zzso the cause of death was zzso for zzso For 22 of these cases the zzso was an incidental finding and appeared not to contribute directly to the cause of zzso Among these patients, 11 had zzso 9 being zzso year of zzso 

A decrease in the proportion of early deaths associated with childhood cancer has occurred during the past 2 zzso This decrease may reflect earlier diagnosis or improved imaging capabilities, surgical techniques, medical therapy, and supportive zzso Awareness among zzso general practitioners, and emergency physicians is warranted, with a focus on high-risk groups for early detection among childhood cancer zzso
