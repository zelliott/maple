This study was conducted to determine the toxicity profile, maximum tolerated dose zzso and zzso of the putative zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in combination with zzso 

zzso patients were treated according to three different dosing schemes in which the zzso dose was fixed and the zzso dose was zzso zzso was administered in twice daily divided doses, and zzso was given as a single daily zzso In schedule A, 26 patients were treated with zzso 1650 zzso and zzso for 2 weeks of a zzso zzso In schedule B, six patients received zzso 1650 zzso for two zzso cycles and zzso for 5 of 6 zzso In schedule C, 22 patients were treated with zzso 2000 zzso and zzso for 2 of 3 zzso 

At the zzso the principal zzso toxicity was zzso The zzso of zzso were zzso by zzso and there was no correlation between body surface area and major zzso zzso zzso count zzso was best predicted by the observed zzso concentration zzso of zzso 

The recommended phase II dose is 6 zzso (or 10 zzso of zzso in combination with zzso 2000 zzso for 2 weeks of a zzso zzso
