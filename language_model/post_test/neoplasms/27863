The authors originally demonstrated the zzso expression of the zzso gene in the mouse zzso In the current study, they analyze the activity of this gene in fresh human tumors associated with zzso zzso compared with normal and zzso cells from other zzso 

The authors studied the zzso levels of the zzso gene by Northern zzso in 81 fresh zzso 

A high zzso gene expression was observed in tumor samples derived from the neural tube zzso zzso zzso and adult nervous system zzso In addition, this zzso expression extended to neuroendocrine tumors of the gut, small cell lung zzso and zzso 

These results suggest a specific restriction pattern to human cells derived from the neural tube and neural zzso The zzso zzso protein may be a useful differentiation marker of zzso cells in the characterization of zzso zzso
