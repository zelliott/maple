Biological response zzso zzso are agents or approaches which can modify the biological response of the host to tumors and thereby are expected to augment the resistance to development or progression of zzso Recent advances in the technology of genetic engineering and zzso zzso have led to rapid progress in this zzso There is an increasing number of genetically engineered zzso which appear promising for cancer treatment and are becoming available for clinical zzso These include the zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor, and zzso zzso For development of optimal therapeutic protocols with these and a variety of zzso agents, it appears necessary to develop a detailed understanding of the possible mechanisms of their zzso effects, and to determine the optimal dose and schedule for altering the zzso zzso zzso zzso would also be expected to be quite useful in the prevention of zzso Indeed, in a variety of animal tumor model systems, potent protective effects can be zzso However, the strategies for clinical application of such information have yet to be adequately worked zzso One more immediate application of this approach is for the prevention of zzso spread of tumor zzso zzso which stimulate natural killer cell activity, have been shown to strongly protect against dissemination of tumors, and clinical strategies for this important aspect of cancer treatment are being zzso
