The speed of diagnosis impacts on prognosis and survival in all types of zzso In most cases survival and prognosis are significantly worse in rural and remote Australian populations who have less access to diagnostic and therapeutic services than metropolitan communities in this zzso Research suggests that in general delays in diagnosis were a factor of zzso the zzso effect of existing conditions and delayed or misleading investigation of zzso The aim of this study is to further explore the factors that impact on the speed of diagnosis in rural Western Australia with direct reference to General zzso zzso working in this zzso 

The methodology consisted of a structured discussion of specific zzso zzso based in two rural locations in Western Australia were asked to identify up to eight clinical cases for zzso A diversity of cases was requested encompassing those with timely and delayed diagnosis of zzso Focus groups were held with the practitioners to identify which factors under six zzso delayed or facilitated the diagnosis in each zzso A structured summary of the discussion was relayed to a wider group of zzso to seek additional views or comments on specific factors that impact on the speed of cancer diagnosis in rural and remote locations in zzso 

A number of factors affecting the speed of diagnosis were zzso the demographic shift towards a zzso and older population, presenting with multiple and complex diseases, increases the challenge to identify early cancer zzso seasonal and demanding work patterns leading to procrastination in presenting for medical care; unhelpful scheduling of specialist zzso and the varying impact of informal networks and social zzso 

Within the limitations of this study we have generated a number of hypotheses that require formal zzso zzso zzso working within informal professional and social networks are better informed about their patients' health needs and have an advantage in making early zzso zzso Despite the other differences in the population characteristics zzso services would improve the prospect for timely zzso and zzso zzso coordination of specialist appointments would improve the speed of diagnosis for rural zzso
