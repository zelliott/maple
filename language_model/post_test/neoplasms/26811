Cell migration plays a crucial role in embryonic development, wound healing, zzso zzso and immune response, as well as in dissemination of zzso zzso zzso is the marker of zzso cells, but its role in cell migration is still zzso However, recent studies have revealed novel functions for zzso related to the migration, such as determination of cellular zzso regulation of cell contact formation, and arrangement and transport of signal proteins involved in cell zzso The review sums up the latest data on zzso functions and its involvement in molecular mechanisms underlying cell zzso Early studies demonstrated that zzso expression during embryonic development is associated with cell zzso However, having obtained zzso knockout mice without apparent zzso in development and ability to zzso doubts have appeared zzso is required for cell migration during embryonic zzso In the present review, we also discuss involvement of zzso in migration processes at different stages of development and try to resolve current contradictions concerning the role of zzso in various events of cell zzso
