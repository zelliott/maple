We have earlier identified and characterized a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in the urine of patients with zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso occur in urine and serum of cancer patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cancer 30, zzso To explain the zzso of zzso in cancer, we have zzso the existence of a zzso zzso reacting with zzso Such a zzso tentatively called zzso zzso was found in zzso fluid from zzso zzso zzso The zzso occurs in complex with zzso and its zzso activity can be measured only after zzso of the zzso This is achieved by reversed phase zzso at low pH and zzso with an zzso alcohol zzso zzso T is inhibited by zzso zzso indicating that it is a zzso zzso Its optimum activity at pH zzso and molecular mass of 24 zzso in gel zzso are similar to those of zzso but the zzso specificity is not identical and its zzso point zzso is about zzso which is lower than the corresponding values of both zzso zzso 9) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T could be associated with the zzso of zzso seen in certain tumor zzso
