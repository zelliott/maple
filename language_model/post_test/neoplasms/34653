During the initiation of tumor associated zzso zzso cells zzso adhere to zzso zzso and form zzso zzso zzso factors of zzso cells conduct this zzso We investigated whether cell surface expression of the zzso blood group zzso zzso zzso and its precursor structure zzso zzso on zzso cells is influenced by soluble factors of tumor zzso Using a bone zzso derived zzso cell line we observed an enhanced expression of zzso and zzso of zzso the key zzso for their zzso after treatment with tumor necrosis zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the leukemia cell line zzso zzso are concentrated on zzso extensions responsible for initial contacts between zzso zzso zzso migration induced by zzso could be diminished by zzso to zzso as well as by zzso induced zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed impaired in zzso zzso when cultivated on zzso zzso and in zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso expression was observed zzso in zzso of zzso zzso Together, our observations point to a tumor induced zzso of zzso zzso and consequently an enhanced expression of zzso which is involved in migration and early zzso contacts during tumor associated zzso
