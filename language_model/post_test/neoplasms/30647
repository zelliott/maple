This study describes the zzso and zzso effects resulting from the adoptive transfer of ex zzso zzso zzso cells zzso to patients with advanced cancer in combination with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso cells were obtained by zzso and zzso ex zzso with zzso The zzso cells were zzso at one of three dose levels on the next day (5 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso Cell administration was followed by zzso given by zzso and continuous infusion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 7 days, or continuous infusion alone zzso zzso zzso zzso for 14 zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed with individual values as high as zzso and 50,000 zzso zzso The other major clinical zzso included a marked zzso zzso with zzso levels as low as zzso zzso in some patients, and zzso of the zzso time zzso and partial zzso time zzso due to decreases in zzso factors zzso IX, and zzso zzso III levels were also zzso zzso associated with increased serum nitrate and zzso levels was zzso These zzso were accompanied by increases in zzso zzso and zzso previously described with zzso These events occurred at a time when the number of circulating zzso cells reached their zzso The amount of zzso zzso correlated with increases in zzso count zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso in zzso expansion of activated T zzso was induced by a protocol combining ex zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso zzso followed by adoptive transfer and zzso zzso The zzso expansion of these T cells superimposed on diminished liver and kidney function from zzso can cause profound but zzso zzso zzso
