Combination chemotherapy with zzso zzso and zzso escalating zzso zzso is an effective regimen in pediatric patients with high-risk solid zzso The toxicity of the regimen is predominantly zzso This study addressed the role of zzso human zzso zzso factor zzso following each cycle of chemotherapy in decreasing zzso zzso of zzso zzso and/or increasing chemotherapy zzso 

zzso children with zzso solid tumors were treated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of patients received no zzso zzso zzso or zzso in a dosage of 5 zzso zzso zzso or 10 zzso zzso zzso on days zzso of each chemotherapy zzso Up to four cycles of chemotherapy were zzso with respect to zzso recovery, clinical zzso and dose zzso 

zzso recovery was significantly more rapid in patients treated with zzso Time to achieving an absolute zzso count zzso over zzso zzso zzso in Groups I, II, and III were 21, 18, and 16 days, respectively zzso zzso zzso Time to achieving an absolute zzso count zzso over zzso zzso zzso in Groups I, II, and III were 24, 19, and 17 days, respectively zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the zzso of zzso zzso between the three zzso zzso zzso occurred following 42, 68, and zzso of chemotherapy cycles in Groups I, II, and III, respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso dose intensity was not different between the three zzso zzso was associated with zzso and zzso in one patient, and transient zzso in zzso 

zzso led to significantly more rapid zzso recovery following zzso chemotherapy, but did not lead to any zzso clinical benefit, either in reducing zzso events, or in increasing chemotherapy dose zzso
