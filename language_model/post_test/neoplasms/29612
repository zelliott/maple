Many zzso to evaluate the nature, zzso and quality of zzso T cell responses are currently applied in human zzso In most cases, zzso protocols are developed on an individual laboratory basis, resulting in a large number of different protocols being applied zzso Together with the inherent complexity of cellular zzso this leads to unnecessary limitations in the ability to compare results generated across zzso Over the past few years a number of critical zzso parameters have been identified which influence test performance irrespective of zzso material, and zzso zzso Describing these critical factors as an integral part of any published report will both facilitate the comparison of data generated across institutions and lead to improvements in the zzso zzso To this end, the zzso Information About T Cell zzso zzso project was zzso The objective of zzso is to achieve a broad consensus on which T cell zzso parameters should be reported in scientific publications and to propose a mechanism for reporting these in a systematic zzso To add maximum value for the scientific community, a zzso open, and zzso approach has been taken to achieve technical precision, zzso adequate incorporation of concerns, and high acceptance among zzso Here, we describe the past, present, and future perspectives of the zzso zzso We suggest that the approach taken can be generically applied to projects in which a broad consensus has to be reached among scientists working in fragmented fields, such as zzso An additional objective of this zzso is to engage the broader scientific community to comment on zzso and to become an active participant in the zzso
