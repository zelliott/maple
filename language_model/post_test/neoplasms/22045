zzso cells play a role in zzso regulation of certain diseases, and their frequency and/or function may be related to disease zzso However, it is often difficult to evaluate zzso cell function in patients with zzso due to reduced numbers of zzso cells as well as the dysfunction of the zzso used as zzso We found that zzso cell function could not be evaluated by conventional zzso zzso confirming the impaired function of zzso in chronic zzso leukemia zzso phase zzso To overcome this problem, we have established a sensitive zzso using zzso zzso cells to evaluate the function of small numbers of human zzso cells independent of zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso phase patients showing a complete zzso response had zzso cells capable of producing zzso whereas zzso cells from patients who were only partially responsive to zzso treatment did not produce zzso zzso zzso cells found in zzso zzso zzso response patients may offer the promise of effective zzso with ex zzso zzso zzso zzso This new approach should be available for evaluating the functions of zzso cells and zzso in cancer zzso
