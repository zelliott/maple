We studied peripheral blood zzso zzso from 42 patients with zzso melanoma undergoing treatment with zzso zzso plus melanoma vaccine to determine whether zzso zzso could be related to depletion of zzso that function as zzso of zzso Every 28 days, the patients were given zzso 300 zzso zzso followed 3 days later by the zzso injection of zzso zzso melanoma cells mixed with zzso zzso zzso were separated by density zzso zzso and zzso until needed for zzso They were stained with zzso zzso directly zzso to zzso zzso or zzso and analyzed by zzso flow zzso At no time after the initiation of zzso plus vaccine were there any significant changes in the percentages of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso of zzso cells expressing zzso 15, a marker for zzso zzso Treatment of melanoma patients with zzso plus vaccine resulted in a progressive fall in the proportion of zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso which identifies zzso of zzso The reduction of zzso zzso zzso did not become apparent until day 28 after the first dose of zzso and reached statistical significance only on days 49 (21 days after the second zzso and 105 (21 days after the fourth zzso zzso changes zzso zzso day 49, zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso day 105, zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso zzso test for zzso zzso In contrast, the proportion of zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso which are true helper cells, increased slightly, although not significantly, following the institution of zzso plus vaccine zzso zzso day 49, zzso zzso zzso day 105, zzso zzso zzso Similar results were obtained when absolute numbers of circulating cells, rather than zzso were zzso Thus the number of zzso zzso zzso fell from a mean of zzso on day 0 to zzso on day 49 zzso less than zzso to zzso on day 105 zzso less than zzso The absolute number of zzso zzso cells remained unchanged at the same time zzso These changes were not due to progression of zzso disease, since a comparison of patients with progressive zzso with those who were rendered disease free by surgery showed no significant differences in the reduction of the percentage of zzso zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
