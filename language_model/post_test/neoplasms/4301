zzso zzso factors regulate expression of a panel of cellular genes that control cellular DNA synthesis and zzso either by zzso or zzso their transcription, largely in a cell zzso zzso The ability of zzso proteins to regulate expression of these target genes is, in turn, regulated by other cellular proteins that are important for normal control of cell cycle zzso Together, zzso zzso their target zzso and the proteins that regulate zzso activity comprise a genetic zzso that is probably the most, frequently altered zzso in human zzso This review examines this genetic zzso and focuses on the role of zzso proteins in its zzso Specifically, the target genes regulated by zzso the likely mechanisms by which zzso and repression of target gene zzso is zzso and the regulation of zzso activity by other proteins in the cell, are zzso
