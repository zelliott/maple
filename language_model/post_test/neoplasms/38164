Common zzso fragile sites occur at specific sequences within zzso zzso that exhibit apparent zzso regions in zzso zzso on exposure of cells to replication zzso Recent progress in the characterization of zzso and more precise mapping of common fragile sites in zzso and zzso zzso has led to the exact placement of large common fragile regions zzso the borders of zzso G and R bands, with early and late replicating zzso regions, respectively, and could lead to breakthroughs in understanding the function of these zzso zzso but highly zzso zzso zzso zzso of genes involved in DNA damage checkpoint responses, such as zzso zzso zzso leads to increased frequency of fragile site zzso Some of these fragile sites, particularly zzso zzso genes that are themselves involved in the protection of cells from DNA damage through various zzso Protection of zzso zzso from zzso of DNA damage in zzso cells is critical during development, zzso and during the zzso zzso and occurs through mechanisms involving surveillance of the zzso for damage, signals to the cell cycle machinery to stop cell cycle zzso signals to repair machinery to repair damage, signals to resume cycling or initiate zzso programs, depending on the extent of damage and zzso When genes involved in these processes are altered or deleted, cancer can zzso The tumor zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso and possibly other fragile zzso is a common target of damage and paradoxically encodes a protein with roles in protection from DNA zzso
