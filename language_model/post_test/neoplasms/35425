The annual percent change zzso is often used to measure trends in disease and mortality rates, and a common zzso of this zzso uses a linear model on the log of the zzso zzso Under the assumption of zzso on the log scale, which is equivalent to a constant change zzso zzso can be zzso defined in three ways as transformations of either zzso the slope of the line that runs through the log of each rate, zzso the ratio of the last rate to the first rate in the series, or zzso the geometric mean of the zzso changes in the rates over the zzso When the constant change assumption fails then the first definition cannot be applied as is, while the second and third definitions zzso define the same zzso regardless of whether the assumption zzso We call this zzso the percent change annualized zzso and propose two new zzso of zzso The first, the zzso zzso uses only the first and last rates, assuming nothing about the rates in zzso This zzso requires fewer assumptions and is zzso unbiased as the size of the population gets large, but has more zzso since it uses no information from the middle zzso The second zzso is an zzso one and equals the linear model zzso with a high probability when the rates are not significantly different from linear on the log scale, but includes fewer points if there are significant departures from that zzso For the zzso zzso we can use confidence intervals previously developed for ratios of directly standardized zzso For the zzso zzso we show through simulation that the zzso confidence intervals give appropriate zzso
