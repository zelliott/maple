The zzso of cancer based on gene expression data is one of the most important procedures in zzso In order to obtain highly accurate results, ensemble approaches have been applied when zzso DNA zzso zzso Diversity is very important in these ensemble approaches, but it is difficult to apply conventional diversity measures when there are only a few training samples zzso Key issues that need to be addressed under such circumstances are the development of a new ensemble approach that can enhance the successful zzso of these zzso 

An effective ensemble approach that does use diversity in genetic programming is zzso This diversity is measured by comparing the structure of the zzso rules instead of zzso diversity zzso 

zzso performed on common gene expression zzso (such as zzso cancer zzso lung cancer zzso and zzso cancer zzso demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in relation to the conventional zzso 

Diversity measured by comparing the structure of the zzso rules obtained by genetic programming is useful to improve the performance of the ensemble zzso
