An optimal zzso selection model of cancer chemotherapy is presented which describes the treatment of a tumor over a fixed period of time by the repeated administration of a single zzso The drug is delivered at evenly spaced intervals over the treatment period at doses to be selected by the zzso The model zzso a regimen that both zzso the tumor population at the end of the treatment and zzso constraints on the drug toxicity and intermediate tumor zzso zzso solutions show that an optimal regimen zzso the bulk of the doses until the end of the treatment zzso When a drug used is of either moderate or low effectiveness, an optimal regimen is superior to a schedule that delivers all of the drug at the beginning of the zzso This study questions whether the current method for the administration of chemotherapy is optimal and suggests that alternative regimens should be zzso
