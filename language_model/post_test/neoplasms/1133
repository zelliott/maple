zzso zzso zzso of human zzso have been analyzed by competition zzso for the presence of two of the principle structural components of zzso zzso zzso the major core protein zzso to zzso and the major envelope zzso zzso zzso of zzso was carried out by use of a zzso zzso system of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso 114 virus serum which was found to detect a class of zzso zzso common to zzso zzso and zzso zzso A competitor with the same apparent affinity for zzso binding as that of zzso viral core proteins was found in relatively high concentration in zzso from patients with systemic lupus zzso in some zzso zzso and also in normal human zzso This competitor from a lupus zzso zzso on zzso and showed size zzso during gel zzso similar to known zzso to zzso viral zzso An zzso zzso protein was also demonstrated by zzso and by zzso of zzso human protein with zzso 114 zzso zzso Analysis of these human competitor proteins with zzso zzso systems of viral core proteins and corresponding zzso showed that all, including the normal tissue zzso appear similar to core proteins of known zzso especially the zzso 114 and zzso monkey zzso A hypothesis suggested by these data is that many, if not all, humans harbor at least part of the zzso of one or more zzso zzso the properties of which are similar to those of viruses from other zzso species, particularly zzso
