zzso differentiation zzso primary response and growth arrest DNA damage zzso genes comprise a set of overlapping zzso including known zzso zzso zzso and novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that have been cloned by virtue of being zzso induced upon the onset of terminal zzso differentiation and following exposure of cells to stress zzso In recent years it has become evident that zzso play a role in blood cell development, where they function as positive regulators of terminal zzso zzso blood cell development and control of blood cell zzso including growth zzso and zzso zzso are also involved in inflammatory responses to invading zzso and response to environmental stress and zzso stress, such as zzso which results in zzso tissue zzso An intricate network of interactions among zzso genes and gene products appears to control their diverse zzso zzso growth, increased cell survival, compromised differentiation and deficiencies in DNA repair are hallmarks of zzso and its zzso Thus, the role zzso play in negative growth control, including cell cycle arrest and zzso and in DNA repair, make them attractive molecular targets for tumor zzso The role zzso play in innate immunity and host response to zzso also make these genes and gene products attractive molecular targets to treat immunity and inflammation disorders, such as septic shock and zzso tissue zzso
