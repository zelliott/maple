Drugs such as zzso or zzso which inhibit the zzso growth factor zzso are increasingly being used in treatment of solid zzso This has led to the appearance of new secondary zzso 

We sought to describe the zzso side effects and their management in patients with cancer treated with zzso or zzso 

We clinically examined 30 patients determining type, frequency, treatment, and evolution of side zzso 

Most patients presented with a zzso reaction consisting of a zzso zzso typically appearing in zzso areas within the first 15 days of zzso zzso fissures in palms and soles and zzso were the second most common zzso zzso We also noticed an zzso in hair growth at several months' zzso As these secondary effects responded well to treatment, few patients discontinued the zzso therapy because of zzso zzso 

This was a prospective but uncontrolled zzso 

Although these new targeted therapies have low systemic toxicity because of their high zzso zzso side effects are common and may be zzso
