zzso zzso is a zzso coding small zzso zzso that zzso regulates gene expression by degradation of zzso or suppression of zzso zzso zzso plays important roles in zzso processes such as cellular development, zzso zzso zzso and stem cell zzso Studies show that the deregulation of zzso expression is closely associated with zzso invasion, and zzso The functionality of zzso may act as zzso or tumor zzso during tumor initiation and zzso zzso in almost all types of zzso started to develop the regulatory network of zzso interaction in the view of systems zzso Experimental evidence demonstrates that the zzso of specific zzso zzso in cancer cells using zzso replacement or zzso technologies can restore zzso activities and repair the gene regulatory network and signaling zzso in turn, reverse the zzso of zzso zzso Numerous animal studies for zzso therapy offer the hope of targeting zzso as alternative cancer zzso zzso the small molecules to interfere with zzso could be of great pharmaceutical interest in the zzso Interestingly, specific zzso is capable of zzso the cancer cells into a zzso embryonic stem zzso state zzso which could be induced into zzso mature cell zzso This chapter will present the various strategies of zzso of zzso in zzso and in zzso
