zzso zzso acquires vessels through a number of zzso including zzso zzso vascular zzso zzso and possibly vascular mimicry in certain zzso The end result of the tumor zzso has been zzso by counting the number of zzso identified zzso in areas of zzso zzso so-called hot zzso Other techniques have been developed, such as zzso counting and the use of image analysis systems that are robust and zzso as well as more zzso Many of the molecular pathways that govern tumor zzso have been identified, and many zzso are now available to study these tissue zzso These include zzso growth factors and their zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and markers of zzso proliferating, zzso or zzso vessels, such as zzso It is also possible to differentiate zzso from active zzso Other zzso that can identify proteins involved in zzso influences such as zzso have also been zzso Although the zzso assessment of tumor zzso is used mostly in the research context, it may also have clinical applications if appropriate methodology and trained observers perform the zzso
