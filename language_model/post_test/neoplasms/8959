Cancer cells rely on extensive support from the zzso in order to survive, zzso and zzso The tumor zzso is thus an important potential target for zzso zzso Typical changes in the zzso include a shift from the zzso zzso zzso zzso to a provisional zzso that promotes invasion and zzso These changes in the zzso zzso are induced by changes in the zzso of zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso zzso of plasma proteins from zzso vessels and release of zzso zzso zzso resulting in zzso and zzso of zzso zzso These in turn alter the rigidity of the zzso and the exposure and release of zzso Changes in zzso rigidity and vessel zzso affect drug delivery and mediate resistance to zzso zzso These zzso changes are brought about not only by the cancer cells, but also through the action of many cell types that are recruited by tumors including immune cells, zzso and zzso zzso Within the zzso these normal host cells are activated resulting in loss of zzso and induction of cancer promoting zzso Key to the development of zzso therapies, selective zzso were developed for specific imaging of key aspects of the tumor zzso
