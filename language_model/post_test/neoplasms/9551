zzso molecules specific for the zzso growth factor zzso zzso have been selected by zzso display technology from a zzso protein library based on the zzso protein zzso Z zzso zzso is zzso in various zzso and is frequently associated with poor patient zzso and the information provided by targeting this zzso could facilitate both patient zzso and zzso Three selected zzso zzso were shown to selectively bind to the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the three zzso zzso molecules bound with similar zzso ranging from 130 to 185 zzso zzso zzso of the zzso molecules were compared for their binding to zzso zzso in zzso analysis and in human zzso cancer zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso were found to bind in a range of zzso zzso affinities in zzso analysis, they were found to be low zzso zzso in the cellular zzso Competition zzso using zzso zzso zzso confirmed specific zzso and demonstrated that the three zzso molecules zzso for the same zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the selected zzso zzso were initially binding to zzso at the cell surface of zzso and zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso could thereafter be zzso The potential use of the described zzso molecules as targeting agents for zzso based imaging applications in various zzso is zzso
