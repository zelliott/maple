Interest in zzso zzso zzso aspiration is zzso Educational courses discuss clinical ultrasound and biopsy techniques but not ultrasound physics and zzso 

To review modern ultrasound physics and zzso to help zzso understand the basis of modern zzso 

A review of recent literature and textbooks was zzso 

zzso physics and zzso are the foundations of clinical zzso The key physical principle is the zzso zzso When zzso by an electric zzso certain zzso zzso and produce zzso A hand-held zzso converts electricity into zzso zzso it into zzso and listens for reflected ultrasound to zzso The returning echoes are converted into electrical signals and used to create a zzso zzso zzso zzso at a high frequency improves zzso resolution but has low tissue zzso Electronic focusing moves the zzso focus to depth of the object of interest and improves lateral zzso The zzso focus in zzso zzso is zzso which results in poor zzso resolution away from the focal zzso Using multiple zzso improves lateral resolution but degrades zzso zzso The zzso can adjust the dynamic range to change contrast and bring out subtle zzso zzso resolution is limited by processing speed, monitor resolution, and zzso perception of the human zzso zzso is an evolving zzso New technologies include zzso spatial compound imaging, tissue zzso and zzso zzso Clinical zzso who understand ultrasound physics, zzso and clinical ultrasound are ready for the challenges of zzso zzso zzso aspiration and zzso biopsy in the 21st zzso
