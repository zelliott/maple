The zzso zzso was first cloned as an amplified gene on a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso cell line, a spontaneously transformed zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso has now been shown to be amplified or zzso in many human zzso It also has been suggested that zzso levels are associated with poor prognosis of several human zzso The most exciting finding is the zzso zzso feedback loop that regulates the function of the zzso tumor zzso zzso The zzso gene is a target for direct zzso zzso by zzso and the zzso protein is a negative regulator of zzso The zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso zzso zzso functions as a zzso factor and inducing zzso zzso The zzso tumor zzso has an important role in cancer therapy, with zzso cell growth arrest and/or zzso being major mechanisms of action for many clinically used cancer zzso agents and radiation zzso zzso the zzso interaction may be a target for cancer zzso In addition, the negative regulation of zzso by zzso may limit the magnitude of zzso zzso by DNA damaging agents, thereby limiting their therapeutic zzso If the zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso a significant increase in functional zzso levels will increase zzso therapeutic zzso Several approaches have now been tested using this strategy, including zzso targeted to zzso binding domain and zzso zzso that specifically inhibit zzso zzso In addition to the interaction with zzso the zzso protein has been found to have interactions with other cellular proteins such as zzso and zzso Although the exact function and significance of these interactions are not fully zzso the zzso functions of zzso may have a role in cancer zzso and zzso indicating that the zzso zzso is a potential molecular target for cancer zzso
