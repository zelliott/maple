Although the zzso Assessment of Cancer zzso questionnaire zzso has been validated few studies have explored the factor structure of the zzso in particular using zzso dependent measurement techniques, such as zzso zzso Furthermore, few studies have explored the relationship between item fit to the zzso Model and clinical zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the zzso and measurement properties of the zzso with zzso Models and Factor zzso 

A factor analysis and zzso analysis zzso Credit zzso was carried out on the zzso completed by a zzso sample of cancer patients zzso zzso zzso For the zzso analysis item fit zzso mean squares zzso or zzso zzso zzso and item zzso were zzso The impact of removing zzso items on the clinical utility of the zzso and zzso total scale was also zzso 

The factor analysis demonstrated a four factor structure of the zzso which broadly corresponded to the four zzso of the zzso Internal consistency for these four scales was very good zzso alpha zzso - zzso The zzso analysis demonstrated that each of the zzso and the zzso total scale had zzso items zzso means square zzso or zzso zzso All these scales with the exception of the Social & Family Well-being zzso zzso were zzso When zzso items were removed, the effect sizes and the clinical utility of the instrument were maintained for the zzso and the total zzso zzso 

The results of the traditional factor analysis and zzso analysis of the zzso broadly zzso zzso should be exercised when zzso the Social & Family Well-being scale and further work is required to determine whether this scale is best represented by two zzso Additionally, removing zzso items from scales should be performed alongside an assessment of the impact on clinical zzso
