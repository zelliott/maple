One of the major challenges in cancer research today is developing new therapeutic strategies to control zzso disease, the spread of cancer cells from a primary tumor to seed in a distant zzso Advances in diagnosis and treatment options have increased the survival rate for most patients with local zzso however, less progress has been made in treatment of zzso zzso According to the zzso Cancer Statistics Review, zzso in the case of breast and prostate zzso only one in four patients diagnosed with distant zzso disease will survive more than five zzso Current research efforts largely focus on identifying biological targets, such as specific genes and signaling pathways that drive two key steps of zzso invasion from the primary tumor and growth in the secondary zzso On the other hand, there are zzso traits and dynamics in the zzso process that are not zzso by single genes or signaling pathways but, rather, a larger system of events and zzso zzso Connecting zzso and zzso investigations with quantitative physical zzso characteristics of cells, the physical zzso and the physical zzso interactions of the zzso process provides a stronger complementary understanding of the zzso
