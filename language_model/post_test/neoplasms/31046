The topic of zzso presents significant issues to the risk assessment zzso In Table I, we have summarized many of the issues raised zzso We have a working definition of an zzso that provides a starting point for considering what chemicals are of zzso We also have an understanding of the important biological zzso zzso there are indications that large scale impacts might be occurring in both human and wildlife zzso Should these effects be confirmed and the zzso agents identified, we will face difficult risk management decisions to minimize or mitigate the zzso Our present knowledge base, however, suggests that the traditional approach to assessing both zzso and cancer zzso will be suitable for toxicity zzso through disruption of zzso systems, although there is controversy here as zzso The fact that many zzso share a common zzso should, in fact, assist in developing more zzso defensible risk zzso given that we must often extrapolate across doses and species in the absence of a zzso basis for zzso zzso As more research focuses on the key zzso we should acquire a better vision of the relative risks that zzso pose to humans and zzso
