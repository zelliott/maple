The risks for four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lung cancer and zzso were studied in workers from zzso involved in nuclear powered ship zzso The population represented a sample of all workers based on radiation dose at study zzso The final sample included 28,000 workers with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso workers with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nuclear workers had lower mortality rates for leukemia and zzso than US white males but higher rates of lung cancer and a significant zzso excess of zzso zzso analyses of risks in the high exposure group indicated that for each cancer the risk increased at zzso above zzso zzso An internal comparison of workers with zzso zzso zzso to workers with zzso of zzso zzso indicated relative risks for leukemia of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for lung cancer, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the higher exposure zzso Except for zzso these risks are not zzso However, the increasing risk with increasing exposure for these zzso some of which are known to be related to radiation, suggests that low-level protracted zzso to gamma rays may be associated with these zzso Other agents such as zzso which are common to shipyard work, may play a role especially in the risk of zzso Future follow up of the population would identify bounds on radiation risks for this population for comparison with similar risks estimated from other zzso
