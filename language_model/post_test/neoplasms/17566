zzso zzso of zzso (at zzso ratio of 1: 4) was developed in order to minimize zzso toxicity of zzso zzso study after single oral administration of 300 to 1200 zzso of zzso was carried out in cancer patients measuring zzso zzso and zzso levels in serum, normal tissue and tumor tissue using zzso and zzso In the all doses zzso zzso of serum zzso after administration of zzso were consistently higher than those of zzso and zzso Peak zzso levels were observed at 2-4 hours after administration of zzso zzso zzso levels ranged zzso zzso and were variable in each patient even at the same zzso The serum zzso level was correlated with zzso and zzso levels, especially with the zzso The zzso of serum zzso of zzso were different from those of zzso and the peak time of zzso occurred 2 or 3 hours later than that of zzso and the decrease of zzso level was zzso The zzso of zzso in tumor tissue zzso were observed in most of the cases compared with those in normal tissue zzso zzso ratio of more than zzso was observed in zzso zzso especially in the patients received higher doses of zzso and in the patients with zzso zzso In the phase I study of oral daily consecutive administration of zzso in 23 cancer patients, the zzso side effects such as zzso zzso vomiting and zzso were observed in 5 out of 23 zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
