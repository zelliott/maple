We propose zzso zzso models for zzso learning with two types of data and an assumed dependency of one type of data on the zzso We consider two zzso approaches, based on a correspondence model, where zzso variables are shared across zzso These models indicate the appropriate number of clusters in addition to indicating relevant features in both types of zzso We evaluate the model on artificially created zzso We then apply the method to a breast cancer zzso consisting of gene expression and zzso array data derived from the same zzso We assume partial dependence of gene expression on zzso expression in this zzso The method ranks genes within zzso which have statistically significant abnormal expression and ranks associated zzso expressing zzso We report a genetic signature for the zzso zzso of breast cancer found across a number of previous gene expression array zzso Using the two zzso approaches we find that this signature also arises from zzso on the zzso expression data and appears zzso from this zzso
