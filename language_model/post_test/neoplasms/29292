Several zzso drugs induce severe and zzso peripheral zzso that can significantly affect the quality of life of cancer patients and cause chronic zzso Despite extensive investigation, the fine mechanisms of this zzso remain zzso It has recently been suggested that several classes of drug zzso are involved in the genesis of chemotherapy induced peripheral zzso Furthermore, the differential distribution and activity of these zzso could also explain the higher sensitivity of the peripheral rather than central nervous system zzso to the toxic action of the zzso zzso These observations may have important therapeutic zzso In fact, the characterization of the proteins that mediate significant transport of clinically relevant drugs in the nervous system, and the understanding of their changes in the different pathological conditions are important in order to zzso zzso mechanisms and to identify new potential therapeutic targets so as to limit the severity of zzso peripheral zzso This review will be focused on the most recent research progress on the role of drug zzso in zzso peripheral zzso and we will discuss the possibility of targeting these zzso as a new and interesting potential strategy for the treatment of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
