The zzso zzso Support zzso Model provides a framework outlining essential components of knowledge generation and zzso The purpose of this research was to illustrate how the Model makes explicit the different contextual aspects implicit in the planning and zzso of two cancer navigation programs in zzso 

The zzso Model guided the collection and analysis of interviews with program personnel and narrative zzso A qualitative zzso analysis was conducted wherein we compared and contrasted the planning and zzso of these two navigation zzso 

The planning and zzso of these two programs was zzso differently and adapted to meet local zzso The zzso Model highlighted three factors that influenced program zzso First, the structure of health services was shaped by the interaction of professionals and services operating in the region, and the existing health services influenced the program's approach to zzso Second, while there were similarities in the professional roles and responsibilities of the zzso these roles and responsibilities also reflected local context in their approaches to patient assessment, zzso education, coordination of services, and zzso Third, these two distinct approaches to navigation have responded to the needs of diverse populations being served by improving access to zzso 

Evidence generated using the zzso Model could ensure a more robust and structured approach to the planning and zzso of future navigation zzso The Model zzso users to make explicit the different types of evidence zzso during program planning and zzso The systematic collection of new information on program zzso using the zzso Model in future initiatives will contribute to an improved understanding of the science of knowledge zzso
