We developed a three-dimensional zzso model in which zzso heat transfer in a human zzso is explicitly zzso by taking into account the physical details of the vascular zzso The spatial pattern in the zzso zzso and tissue temperature is zzso during zzso zzso As such a complex vascular model is not generally zzso a comparative study of the results of zzso zzso zzso concepts applied to zzso was carried zzso It turned out that classical zzso approaches may lead to wrong zzso zzso results are to be expected from an approach suggested by zzso and zzso and by a far simpler efficiency function zzso concept, developed by us, that can be used as easily as the simple classical zzso approach while avoiding its zzso The zzso model is used to predict whether the temperature of the entire volume of zzso muscle tissue will be raised to a therapeutic zzso With the help of the vascular model, local zzso zzso near individual blood vessels are zzso zzso in small volumes of tissue near the vessel walls is zzso This might explain zzso regrowth following local zzso treatment in the tissue adjacent to blood zzso
