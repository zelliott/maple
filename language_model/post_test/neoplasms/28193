Local tumor recurrence after radiation therapy is due primarily to the failure to eradicate all of the tumor cells within the treatment zzso zzso all zzso could be controlled locally if a sufficiently high radiation dose could be delivered to a treatment volume that zzso all of the tumor zzso In practice, however, the administration of a radiation dose high enough to sterilize all of the tumor cells would pose an unacceptably high risk of severe damage to normal zzso zzso improvements in the delivery of therapeutic radiation have led to some improvements in the therapeutic ratio zzso the ratio of the dose required to eradicate every tumor cell to the dose that produces unacceptable normal tissue zzso Further significant improvements in the therapeutic ratio will drive from an understanding of the mechanisms governing the sensitivity of zzso and normal cells to zzso Part 1 of this zzso article reviews the clinical and tissue kinetic factors that govern the sensitivity of normal zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Part 2, which will appear in next month's issue, describes recent insights into the cellular and molecular pathways that determine the sensitivity of normal cells and tumor cells to zzso
