The role of complement in the zzso zzso zzso tumor cell destruction in cancer zzso was investigated in relation to a zzso preparation zzso a so-called biological response zzso zzso of zzso with fresh human serum at 37 degrees C for 60 zzso resulted in the generation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injection of the mixture to a patient with cancer zzso revealed an zzso of zzso in the zzso fluid for a longer period with a rapid reduction of the zzso fluid, than an zzso injection of zzso alone examined in the same zzso zzso were found to invade clusters of the tumor cells and then form zzso followed by the destruction of tumor zzso These findings induced by zzso continued over 10 days in the presence of fresh serum, while diminished within zzso days when zzso alone was zzso When fresh human plasma or fresh frozen plasma was used instead of serum and zzso injected with zzso avoiding zzso the same zzso and clinical changes were observed in other zzso These data strongly indicate that zzso activates human complement either in zzso or in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso to accumulate in the zzso zzso Although the mechanism of killing of tumor cells by zzso is obscure, addition of human serum or plasma to zzso use of zzso seems to be valuable for the management of patients with zzso zzso
