The relationship between zzso zzso stimulation of natural killer zzso cell zzso in zzso and changes in zzso cell zzso resulting from systemic zzso administration was examined in 15 cancer patients in two clinical zzso zzso peripheral zzso cells zzso were incubated zzso h with or without zzso on 2 different days prior to therapy initiation to determine in zzso responsiveness to zzso and zzso zzso levels of zzso cell activity, zzso Three different preparations of zzso were tested, including native zzso zzso and two zzso zzso species, zzso alpha A and zzso alpha zzso zzso hours after zzso injection of zzso significant zzso cell activity enhancement occurred zzso zzso zzso The relative extent of zzso zzso in individual patients resulting from injection significantly correlated zzso less than zzso with the degree of zzso cell activity enhancement induced in zzso by treatment of zzso with the same zzso zzso These results suggest that patients exhibited individual differences in acute responsiveness to systemic zzso administration, which could be predicted to a certain extent by in zzso testing prior to zzso
