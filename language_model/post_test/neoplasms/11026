zzso regulates the cell cycle and zzso acid zzso repair pathways as part of its unequivocally important function to maintain zzso zzso zzso recent studies show that zzso can also zzso genes involved in zzso the two major pathways of energy generation to promote zzso zzso but how this serves to maintain zzso stability is less zzso In an attempt to understand the biology, this review presents human zzso data on the inverse relationship between zzso capacity and cancer zzso that appears to be mirrored by the impact of zzso on zzso capacity in mouse zzso The review summarizes mechanisms by which zzso regulates zzso zzso and proposes how this might contribute to maintaining zzso zzso Although disparate in nature, the data taken together suggest that the promotion of zzso metabolism by zzso serves as an important tumor zzso activity and may provide insights for cancer prevention strategies in the zzso
