The purpose of these studies was to compare local and systemic human zzso activated killer zzso and natural killer zzso zzso and to determine its zzso by the systemic administration of zzso zzso zzso After zzso systemic zzso we extracted tumor zzso zzso zzso and peripheral blood zzso zzso from patients with pulmonary tumors and compared zzso and zzso spontaneous zzso activity and their response to in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was increased in patients receiving 15,000 zzso zzso preoperatively zzso zzso units zzso compared to those receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso or no zzso zzso zzso After 3 days incubation with 1,000 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was increased in patients receiving 15,000 zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to those receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso or no treatment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was low overall zzso zzso with the exception of two patients receiving 15,000 zzso who had zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso precursor activity was only slightly increased in patients receiving zzso zzso zzso whereas those receiving 15,000 zzso zzso had an average of zzso zzso zzso zzso also increased spontaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso obtained at time of surgery or 3 days after zzso systemic zzso resulted in significant increases in zzso response to in zzso zzso compared to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on spontaneous zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso tumor environment can be partially reversed with 15,000 zzso systemic zzso Higher doses of systemic zzso also increased spontaneous zzso zzso activity at time of surgery and 3 days after zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso following higher doses of systemic zzso
