The aim of the study was to investigate cancer risk following employment in the asphalt zzso 

Cancer zzso was studied among 22 362 male asphalt workers employed for more than one season in jobs zzso exposure to zzso zzso road zzso in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and zzso These workers are part of a European cohort of asphalt workers, for which results on mortality have been zzso The follow-up was almost complete, and reference rates were obtained from national cancer zzso 

The zzso of cancer was reduced in all four countries zzso standardized zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso Lung cancer zzso was increased in all four countries, yielding an overall zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso but no trend was detected according to time since first zzso No overall increased zzso of zzso cancer was observed, but there was a suggestion of a tendency towards higher risk with longer time since first zzso with a relative risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso for more than 30 years versus zzso years zzso for trend zzso The zzso of lip and stomach cancer was zzso increased, and the excess was present mainly in zzso No increased zzso was detected for other zzso notably zzso melanoma, zzso skin cancer, and kidney zzso 

The results of this study confirm the pattern of cancer risk detected in the mortality analysis of the European zzso in addition, they provide suggestive evidence of an excess risk of zzso cancer among asphalt zzso
