zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso by small molecules or zzso has been pursued as a paradigm to treat human zzso for over two zzso It is now clear that these agents can induce tumor zzso in a variety of human zzso proving the critical role of zzso signals for tumor maintenance in zzso of patients with these zzso zzso meaningful responses, however, are only transient and further refinement of zzso therapies is urgently zzso 

Several studies provide new insights into the molecular basis of zzso zzso inhibitor resistance, including zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso loss of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso and zzso zzso Potential strategies are emerging to overcome acquired zzso zzso inhibitor resistance associated with the zzso M zzso zzso including a new compound identified in a chemical library screen and a combination regimen of an zzso zzso plus a small zzso zzso zzso zzso Lastly, zzso dosing schedules are being pursued to accomplish more complete target zzso 

Current data point toward a strong association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor response, similar to the findings with other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This relationship is less obvious for zzso targeting zzso More complete zzso of zzso in tumor cells and more focused clinical drug development remain important goals toward further success with this class of zzso zzso
