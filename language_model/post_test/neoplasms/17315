zzso technology was used to prepare zzso zzso zzso zzso dual loaded with the zzso drug zzso and magnetic zzso zzso incorporation of the magnetic zzso was confirmed by transmission electron zzso Dynamic light scattering zzso showed a relatively narrow size distribution of the hybrid zzso zzso zzso reduced the cell viability of prostate cancer cells zzso measured after 72 h significantly, while drug-free zzso showed no zzso zzso zzso attachment of a cancer targeting zzso zzso as well as a fluorescent label zzso zzso zzso to the hybrid zzso was performed and specific cell binding and zzso were shown by flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso clearly demonstrated the capacity of magnetic zzso to generate significant zzso zzso contrast and potentially allow for direct monitoring of the zzso of the zzso zzso technology as an easy, fast and efficient way to manufacture hybrid zzso as zzso drug delivery devices is a further step from basic research to personalized zzso
