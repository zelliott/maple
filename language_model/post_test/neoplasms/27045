Most aspects of zzso function display zzso rhythms driven by an zzso zzso The zzso clock is operated by genes and comprises a central clock in the brain that responds to environmental cues and controls subordinate clocks in peripheral zzso via zzso output zzso The central and peripheral clocks zzso generate rhythmic gene expression in a zzso manner in zzso to couple diverse zzso and behavioral processes to periodic changes in the zzso However, with the zzso of the world, activities that disrupt zzso zzso with external zzso cues have zzso This change in lifestyle has been linked to an increased risk of diseases in all aspects of human health, including zzso Studies in humans and animal models have revealed that cancer development in zzso is closely associated with the loss of zzso zzso in energy balance, immune function, and aging, which are supported by cellular functions important for tumor suppression including cell zzso zzso zzso and DNA damage zzso The clock controls these cellular functions both locally in cells of peripheral zzso and at the zzso level via zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso clock provides a unique system to study zzso as a zzso zzso process in zzso The zzso between host and zzso zzso in cell proliferation and metabolism also provides new and exciting options for novel zzso zzso
