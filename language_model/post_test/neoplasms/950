zzso Index zzso is a widely used functional scale developed for zzso zzso It has proved useful as outcome predictor with cancer and geriatric zzso zzso zzso could be used to predict mortality in patients with home zzso nutrition zzso 

To determine baseline zzso and its zzso evolution in zzso patients, and to assess its relation with the mortality zzso 

zzso and prospective study carried out during 2002 and 2003 with tube feeding zzso and cancer patients followed during 10 months since their zzso zzso zzso 

201 patients were included, 131 zzso with neurological diseases and 70 zzso with zzso There were not significant differences between groups in age, days with zzso and mortality rate at the end of the study period zzso in zzso patients and zzso in cancer zzso zzso of cancer patients had resumed full oral nutrition after ten months from the beginning of the study, whereas only zzso of zzso patients did zzso zzso zzso In the three measurement zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso values were higher for cancer patients than for zzso ones zzso zzso zzso In both groups we didn't found statistically significant differences in zzso along the three zzso A significant relation was observed overall between initial zzso values and average survival after 10 months zzso zzso zzso and an inverse relation was found between the former and mortality rate zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a useful tool to predict mortality rate in cancer and zzso patients under zzso
