zzso was first identified as a gene causing zzso dominant hearing loss zzso Different zzso have been found, all exerting a highly specific zzso effect, in which skipping of zzso 8 causes the zzso Later reports revealed the involvement of the gene in different types of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a large percentage of zzso zzso and breast tumors and zzso zzso activity have been reported, concluding that zzso acts as a tumor zzso gene in different frequent types of zzso Despite these data, the molecular function of zzso has not been investigated zzso Previous zzso studies with zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso cells showed a toxic effect of the zzso zzso which was not seen after zzso of the zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso is composed of two zzso separated by a hinge zzso The first region zzso zzso when zzso in zzso cells, the second region masks and probably regulates this zzso inducing zzso Moreover, the involvement of zzso in zzso pathways in a zzso setting was demonstrated through gene expression zzso analysis using zzso knockout zzso In view of its important role in zzso this finding is expected to lead to new insights on the role of zzso in many types of zzso In addition, it provides a new line of evidence supporting an important role for zzso in zzso and complex forms of zzso
