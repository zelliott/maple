To evaluate the zzso of zzso and zzso administered in combination with zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Factor zzso in patients with advanced solid zzso 

Patients were recruited to a phase I trial where escalating doses of zzso zzso to 200 zzso were administered in combination with zzso 100 or 120 zzso and fixed dose of zzso 20 zzso and zzso 30 zzso with the zzso use of zzso zzso zzso zzso was followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sampling for zzso analysis was performed in ten patients from dose levels zzso 

The mean zzso area under the plasma zzso zzso zzso for the zzso dose level zzso was zzso zzso zzso h zzso zzso for the zzso dose level zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 h zzso zzso for the zzso dose level zzso it was zzso zzso zzso h zzso zzso and for the zzso dose level zzso it was zzso zzso zzso h zzso zzso The mean peak plasma concentration zzso values for dose levels zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso h zzso zzso 

In this study, relevant zzso parameters of zzso like zzso zzso and the zzso plasma concentration above the zzso relevant zzso threshold concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso when administered in combination with zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not statistically different from zzso data of historical zzso However, given the trial design, zzso interactions between the agents cannot be zzso
