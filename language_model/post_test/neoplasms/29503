Because tumors develop resistance to zzso agents, the cancer research community continues to search for effective zzso One promising possibility is to use dietary agents that sensitize tumors to the zzso In this review, we discuss that the use of zzso can sensitize tumor cells to zzso zzso The tumors shown to be zzso by zzso include lung zzso acute zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso prostate cancer, oral zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso The zzso agents include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of tumor cells by zzso appears to be zzso through its ability to zzso multiple zzso zzso including drug zzso cell survival zzso cell zzso zzso and members of the zzso and zzso signaling zzso Interestingly, this zzso has also been reported to suppress zzso induced by zzso zzso and zzso in some tumor zzso The potential mechanisms underlying this dual effect are zzso Overall, studies suggest that zzso can be used to sensitize tumors to standard cancer zzso
