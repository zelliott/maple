An in zzso test of cell sensitivity to drugs that indicates in zzso response is an important need in cancer therapy and cancer drug zzso Toward this end, we previously developed a collagen zzso culture system for growth of human zzso This three-dimensional culture system is general and grows tumors at high frequency directly from surgery or biopsy that maintain important in zzso properties in zzso including tissue zzso We report here that with zzso techniques measuring cellular DNA synthesis the drug responses of individual cells within the tissue structure of in zzso tumors can be zzso Twenty tumor classes, including all the major ones, have been measured in zzso at greater than 50% zzso zzso and qualitative results show increasing cell kill with rising zzso drug zzso differential drug sensitivities of multiple cell types within individual cultured tumors, differential sensitivities of a series of tumors of the same zzso zzso to a single drug, differential sensitivities of individual tumors to a series of drugs, and sensitivity patterns of various tumor types similar to the sensitivities found in zzso zzso the results indicate that potentially important therapeutic data can be obtained from tumor specimens growing in zzso for the individual cancer patient as well as for rational and relevant screening for new agents active against human solid zzso
