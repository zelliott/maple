zzso therapy plays a critical role in the local and regional control of zzso zzso Its zzso however, is limited by a number of factors, including zzso tumor zzso and tumor zzso Recent attempts to enhance the efficacy of radiation therapy have focused on zzso agents that zzso zzso reactions within tumor zzso 

We review five promising zzso zzso that are in zzso zzso and zzso are known as zzso cell zzso and are toxic in areas of low oxygen zzso zzso zzso delivery of oxygen to tumor cells, thereby rendering them more sensitive to zzso zzso zzso with a zzso structure, selectively accumulates in tumor cells and thereby enhances zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso target a zzso factor that regulates zzso events and cell zzso 

Our review of each agent included a thorough search of published zzso and clinical data, including that presented in abstracts and posters at international zzso Our objectives were not to identify a superior mechanism or drug, but rather to zzso the available safety and efficacy zzso 

Clearly, there is an zzso need for safer agents that augment the efficacy of radiation zzso This review highlights five promising zzso zzso that are in zzso None has yet been approved by the Food and Drug zzso These drugs were selected for discussion because they exemplify the current investigative landscape of zzso and are indicative of future directions in this zzso These radiation zzso have the potential to succeed where others have failed, by locally increasing the zzso of tumor cells without enhancing that of surrounding normal zzso
