zzso zzso mice are susceptible to tumor induction by zzso zzso while zzso zzso mice are zzso zzso cells from zzso mice respond to the virus with zzso zzso and those from zzso mice with zzso These polarized zzso responses zzso the development of effective zzso immunity in zzso mice and the lack zzso in zzso zzso An ex zzso zzso production zzso using zzso cells from infected zzso zzso zzso zzso mice together with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso trait zzso analysis was used to map the zzso of zzso production to a region of zzso 4 carrying the zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso of infected zzso mice showed zzso of zzso zzso DNA sequences with the zzso zzso zzso responses zzso by zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a known zzso zzso induced the same polarized responses as the virus in these host zzso zzso cells from zzso and zzso zzso mice challenged in zzso with zzso showed an impaired zzso response but were unaffected in zzso zzso zzso of strains zzso and zzso differ by 3 zzso acid zzso 2 in the zzso domain and 1 in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso signaled equally to an zzso reporter in zzso cells in a zzso zzso When introduced into zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso from zzso mice zzso a robust zzso response to zzso and no zzso zzso The zzso zzso from zzso mice failed to zzso a response with either zzso These results establish zzso as a key zzso of the zzso response governing zzso to tumor induction by zzso
