zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso and degradation is critical for appropriate biological zzso The zzso growth factor zzso (also known as zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso and invasion and is zzso in human zzso zzso zzso of the Met zzso leads to sustained zzso cell zzso and zzso hence understanding mechanisms that regulate this process is zzso Here we report that, following Met zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso is recruited to the plasma membrane and becomes both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso requires Met zzso zzso activity and involves two distinct zzso zzso Unlike previous reports for the zzso zzso which requires the zzso zzso interacting zzso recruitment of zzso to Met involves the zzso domain of zzso and the signaling zzso zzso zzso which binds through a zzso motif in the third domain of zzso zzso of the zzso domain is sufficient to zzso the zzso zzso protein complex from Met, resulting in loss of zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso results in delayed Met degradation, which can be rescued by expression of zzso zzso but not an zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain, identifying a role for this domain in zzso Met zzso This study demonstrates a new mechanism of recruitment for zzso downstream of the Met zzso involving the zzso domain of zzso as well as interaction of zzso with zzso This highlights distinct regulation of zzso recruitment and the diversity and zzso of zzso molecules in promoting zzso zzso
