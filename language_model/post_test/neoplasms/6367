The study was designed to evaluate zzso properties of Iraqi zzso collected from Mosul region zzso on zzso and zzso cell lines and on zzso in zzso M induced an zzso effect against the proliferation of zzso and colony potential of zzso zzso The zzso in zzso cells was associated with zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso while in zzso cells, zzso features were zzso size of cells was dramatically increased by swelling of zzso and loss of membrane integrity, cell zzso and release of cellular zzso Analysis of zzso cell cycle in both cell lines showed that M induced cell cycle zzso in both zzso positive and zzso negative zzso The exposure of zzso to M caused zzso in a dose dependent manner and was associated with induction of zzso The experiments in zzso zzso mice showed that oral administration of zzso at doses that caused no zzso toxicity was associated with a decrease in zzso cells and an increase in zzso increased zzso and decreased zzso expression of cells in tumor zzso This study provides the rationale to investigate the potential beneficial effect of zzso in the diet of patients receiving zzso zzso
