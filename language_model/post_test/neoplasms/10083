We have designed and evaluated zzso as a novel fluorescent pH probe for tumor zzso zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso leaving group activated by zzso reduction, directly linked to zzso Although zzso itself is zzso and zzso in zzso solution, zzso reduction triggers the release of zzso which has zzso long wavelength zzso and zzso that is sensitive to zzso The zzso zzso released zzso by zzso reduction of zzso allows measurement of pH by zzso dual zzso zzso zzso showed clear differences in zzso behavior between hypoxic and zzso conditions in liver zzso and inside zzso zzso These data are confirmation that zzso is biologically reduced inside tumor cells and the released zzso should monitor zzso pH of tumor cells selectively with reduced background zzso
