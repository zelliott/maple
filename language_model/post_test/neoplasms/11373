zzso communication between cells, zzso by gap zzso is nowadays considered as an indispensable mechanism in the maintenance of cellular zzso In fact, gap zzso zzso communication is actively involved in virtually all aspects of the cellular life cycle, ranging from cell growth to cell zzso For a long time, it was believed that this was merely a result of the capacity of gap junctions to control the direct zzso exchange of essential cellular zzso However, recent data show that the picture is more complicated than initially thought, as structural precursors of gap zzso zzso and gap junction zzso can affect the cellular zzso balance independently of gap zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we zzso the current knowledge concerning the roles of zzso and their channels in the control of cellular zzso with the emphasis on cell growth and cell zzso We also briefly discuss the role of gap zzso zzso communication in zzso and the potential use of zzso as tools for cancer zzso
