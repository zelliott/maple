zzso zzso can be broadly defined as zzso that are engineered to interact with a particular population of cells with the objective of delivering a payload or increasing their retention within the targeted cell population by means of a chemical interaction with zzso molecules or other zzso zzso 

The authors review recent advances in the field with an emphasis on zzso studies and place them in the context of historical zzso 

The review focuses on zzso zzso zzso as these zzso are presently the most zzso 

The field has advanced in tandem with advances in zzso design and zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso have been used in diagnosis to deliver magnetic resonance contrast agents and zzso for magnetic resonance and nuclear medicine imaging, zzso They have been used in gene therapy to deliver a variety of gene expression zzso including zzso zzso zzso and short interfering zzso zzso zzso provide a delivery advantage over zzso zzso not because of increased zzso to tumor sites but because of increased interaction with the target cell population once localized to the tumor zzso The increased interaction can take on the form of fusion with the cellular membrane or zzso by zzso To the extent that the spatial distribution of targeted zzso within a solid tumor may become more zzso than has been found for zzso zzso this may be a zzso However, systematic comparisons of the spatial distribution in tumors of targeted versus zzso zzso have yet to be zzso The majority of reported studies have been in the area of chemotherapy zzso Their use in zzso and zzso and zzso delivery is just zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso could potentially be the future direction in targeted zzso zzso
