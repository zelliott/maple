zzso zzso have been considered for many years as zzso building blocks of biological zzso with key structural functions and little relevance in cellular zzso However, this view has changed dramatically in recent years with the recognition that certain zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso participate actively in signal zzso zzso regulating many different cell functions such as zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso In particular, zzso has attracted considerable attention in cell biology and zzso due to its key role in the zzso of membrane physical properties, signaling and cell death zzso This latter function is largely exerted by the ability of zzso to activate the major pathways governing cell death such as the zzso zzso and zzso Overall, the evidence so far indicates a key function of zzso in disease zzso and hence their regulation may be of potential therapeutic relevance in different zzso including liver diseases, zzso and cancer biology and zzso
