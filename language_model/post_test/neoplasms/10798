To zzso evaluate the rate of zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso correlate at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients, because better defining these abnormalities could potentially lead to improved patient management zzso that rely on zzso for zzso staging, and treatment monitoring of zzso 

We performed a computer search of all zzso studies performed at our institution from 2006 to 2009, and identified 87 studies with findings of focal zzso zzso without correlate at zzso The rate of zzso of such zzso was determined by reviewing findings at follow-up imaging or by clinical or zzso zzso Rates of zzso were zzso and compared by zzso location and by the type of primary zzso 

The most common locations for focal zzso zzso without CT correlate were: zzso zzso location (without visible zzso zzso zzso bone zzso soft tissue zzso liver zzso and gastrointestinal tract zzso zzso percent zzso of the focal zzso zzso without CT correlate were zzso zzso zzso disease or a second zzso at follow-up zzso zzso 5 months, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso location and in bone without CT correlate had higher rates of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso than zzso in all other locations zzso zzso zzso In 15 of 87 cases, the only significant finding at zzso was an zzso zzso without CT zzso Of those, zzso zzso was positive for zzso There were no significant differences in the rates of zzso for the focal zzso zzso without CT correlate when zzso by the type of primary zzso in this zzso 

zzso zzso avid zzso without CT correlate were zzso in zzso of cases in our series of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso location and in bones had the highest rates of zzso zzso of the patterns and risk of zzso of focal zzso zzso without CT correlate in zzso patients may facilitate the management of zzso patients with such zzso on zzso and could lead to an improved interpretation of zzso scans by imaging zzso
