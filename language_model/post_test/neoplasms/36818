To determine the zzso zzso tolerated doses, and response rates for a combined regimen of the platinum and zzso oral zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as a 14 zzso every zzso zzso 

Of 20 patients enrolled in this investigation, 17 on the following dose escalation scheme were zzso for toxicity and/or response: I zzso 300 zzso zzso 5 zzso (three zzso II zzso 300 zzso zzso 10 zzso (four zzso III zzso 300 zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso 

All 17 zzso patients were zzso for zzso At dose level III zzso zzso and zzso were observed in one patient despite zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not observed at the zzso dose levels examined in this zzso This observation is consistent with results seen with single agent zzso 

For zzso and zzso administered at 20 zzso and 300 zzso over 14 days, zzso and zzso were observed as the principal zzso zzso These doses are considerably below the zzso tolerated doses of single agent zzso and zzso zzso administration schedules should be explored in an attempt to increase the dose intensity and minimize the toxicity of this combination oral zzso
