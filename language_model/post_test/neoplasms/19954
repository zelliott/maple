zzso blind mole rats zzso are zzso tolerant (down to zzso zzso long lived zzso zzso zzso showing no clear signs of aging or aging related zzso In 50 years of zzso research, spontaneous tumors have never been recorded among thousands of zzso Here we addressed the questions of zzso whether zzso is resistant to zzso zzso and zzso whether normal zzso isolated from zzso possess zzso zzso 

Treating animals with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso two potent zzso confirmed zzso high resistance to chemically induced zzso While all mice and rats developed the expected tumors following treatment with both zzso among zzso no tumors were observed after zzso treatment, while zzso induced benign zzso proliferation in 2 zzso individuals out zzso and only a single animal from the advanced age group developed zzso 18 months zzso The remaining animals are still healthy 30 months zzso In zzso experiments showed an extraordinary ability of normal zzso cultured zzso to restrict zzso behavior in a broad spectrum of zzso and in newly isolated zzso zzso cancer cell zzso Growth of cancer cells was inhibited by either direct interaction with zzso zzso or with soluble factors released into culture media and soft zzso This was accompanied by decreased cancer cell zzso reduced colony formation in soft zzso disturbed cell cycle zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from another cancer resistant subterranean zzso the naked mole zzso were also tested for direct effect on cancer cells and, similar to zzso demonstrated zzso zzso No effect on cancer cells was observed using zzso from zzso rat or zzso zzso zzso zzso media had no effect on proliferation of zzso zzso 

This report provides pioneering evidence that zzso is not only resistant to spontaneous cancer but also to zzso induced cancer, and shows the unique ability of zzso normal zzso to inhibit growth and kill cancer cells, but not normal cells, either through direct zzso cell interaction or via soluble zzso Obviously, along with adaptation to zzso zzso has evolved efficient zzso mechanisms yet to be zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms allowing zzso to survive in extreme environments and to escape cancer as well as to kill zzso and zzso cancer cells may hold the key for understanding the molecular nature of host resistance to cancer and identify new zzso strategies for treating zzso
