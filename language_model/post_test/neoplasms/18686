zzso invasive surgery represents one of the main evolutions of surgical techniques aimed at providing a greater benefit to the zzso However, minimally invasive surgery increases the operative difficulty since the depth perception is usually dramatically reduced, the field of view is limited and the sense of touch is transmitted by an zzso However, these drawbacks can currently be reduced by computer technology guiding the surgical zzso Indeed, from a patient's medical image zzso CT or zzso zzso Reality zzso can increase the zzso zzso vision by providing a virtual transparency of the zzso zzso is based on two main zzso the zzso zzso of the anatomical or pathological structures appearing in the medical image, and the registration of this zzso on the real zzso zzso zzso can be performed directly from the medical image without the need for a zzso step thanks to volume zzso But better results are obtained with surface rendering after organ and pathology zzso and zzso zzso Registration can be performed zzso or zzso Several interactive systems have been developed and applied to humans, demonstrating the benefit of zzso in surgical zzso It also shows the current limited zzso due to soft organ movements and interaction between surgeon instruments and zzso If the current automatic zzso systems show the feasibility of such system, it is still relying on specific and expensive equipment which is not available in clinical zzso Moreover, they are not robust enough due to the high complexity of developing a real-time registration taking organ deformation and human movement into zzso However, the latest results of automatic zzso systems are extremely encouraging and show that it will become a standard requirement for future zzso surgical zzso In this article, we will explain the concept of zzso and its zzso Then, we will review the existing interactive and automatic zzso systems in zzso surgical zzso highlighting their benefits and zzso Finally, we will discuss the future evolutions and the issues that still have to be tackled so that this technology can be seamlessly integrated in the operating zzso
