In zzso zzso studies of a disease, people often attempt to identify a few diagnostic or zzso markers amongst the most significant zzso expressed zzso zzso However, the zzso of DE genes identified in different studies for a disease is typically very zzso To tackle the problem, we could evaluate the zzso of DE genes across studies and define robust markers for disease diagnosis using zzso zzso interaction zzso zzso Using zzso for four cancer types, we found that the most significant DE genes in cancer exhibit consistent zzso or zzso in different zzso For each cancer type, the 5 (or 10) most significant DE genes separately extracted from different zzso tend to be significantly zzso and closely connected in the zzso zzso thereby indicating that they are highly zzso at the zzso zzso zzso we were able to build robust zzso zzso for cancer zzso
