We reported recently a novel zzso cholesterol zzso with a zzso head group, zzso zzso for zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso (1997) zzso In the present paper we have studied whether this novel zzso zzso is prominent in nature to suppress cell growth of human cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and they were introduced into human zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso gene induced probably zzso (including necrosis in some zzso in zzso and zzso cells, however, nonsense zzso zzso corresponding to a zzso control hardly induced zzso zzso of zzso was much greater than that by commercially available zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso of zzso zzso zzso were specifically found in the zzso The intensity of the zzso was mostly consistent with the amounts of zzso proteins observed by Western zzso analysis in the target zzso The results showed the possibility that this new zzso cholesterol zzso might be very promising to be used for zzso gene targeting in zzso and in zzso
