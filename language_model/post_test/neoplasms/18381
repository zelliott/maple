zzso zzso zzso are not uncommon in advanced cancer and are associated with a very poor zzso zzso control includes reducing the frequency of vomiting by prescription of zzso zzso The most commonly used agents for this are either zzso zzso or zzso Either zzso 2 zzso or zzso pump zzso are sometimes recommended as zzso to reduce gastric zzso The aim of this study was to examine the effects of zzso 2 zzso and zzso pump zzso and to zzso compare the effects of one agent over zzso 

Previously, electronic databases were searched for trials that compared zzso versus zzso pump zzso in their effect on volume of gastric zzso 

Seven trials were included in a zzso zzso outcomes suggest that both zzso pump zzso and zzso reduce gastric volumes, but the most superior agent is zzso which reduces the volume of gastric zzso by an average of zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso 

Based on zzso studies, objective evidence exists that confirms zzso will decrease the volume of gastric zzso This forms a sound basis from which to develop further research aimed at improving the care of people with zzso zzso zzso
