zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso belongs to a zzso zzso family containing four members, zzso - 4, which play an essential role in a number of cellular functions including cell cycle, survival and zzso Recent advances reveal a crucial role of zzso in zzso and tumor zzso making zzso an attractive therapeutic target for cancer zzso 

Recent findings identifying the role of zzso in human zzso including zzso zzso and solid zzso zzso implications of targeting zzso are also discussed with regard to clinical zzso 

A better understanding of molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso and its contribution to human zzso and also insight into the development of novel targeted cancer zzso 

The significance of zzso in cancer cell survival, zzso invasion and tumor zzso varies amongst human zzso and depends on the signaling properties of the zzso and cellular zzso of the transformed zzso Thus, further exploitation of zzso signaling and its dynamic interaction with other crucial zzso and zzso pathways in different human zzso is needed for more effective therapeutic zzso
