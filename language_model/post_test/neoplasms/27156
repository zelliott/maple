zzso zzso group of Palm and zzso also known as Dark zzso and zzso zzso are two zzso rat strains with differences in several zzso including zzso to zzso disease models and inflammatory zzso While these strains have been extensively zzso little information is available about the zzso and zzso zzso as only the Brown Norway zzso and spontaneously zzso rat strains have been zzso to zzso Here we report the sequencing of the zzso and zzso zzso using next-generation zzso zzso read technology and the first de zzso assembly of a rat zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with an average depth of zzso covered zzso of the zzso reference zzso and included zzso of known rat zzso New sequences could be assigned to 59 million positions with previously unknown data in the zzso reference zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso included 19 million positions in novel zzso zzso million single zzso zzso zzso (including zzso million new zzso zzso short insertions and zzso and zzso structural zzso zzso differences between zzso zzso and zzso including high-impact zzso and short insertions and deletions affecting zzso zzso are likely to account for most of the zzso variation between these zzso The new zzso and zzso zzso sequencing data should facilitate gene discovery efforts in rat models of human zzso
