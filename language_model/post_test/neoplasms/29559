zzso is one of the most abundant protein modifications in zzso having roles in protein stability, zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso are responsible for a number of human diseases and zzso zzso as well as associated with certain types of zzso However, the zzso role of this form of zzso in many of these instances is zzso Here we describe how one zzso responsible for initiating zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso cell zzso by influencing the zzso and zzso of an zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is normally zzso and localized to the zzso zzso where zzso of two opposing cell layers takes zzso In zzso zzso zzso is no longer zzso and fails to be properly zzso to the zzso cell layer zzso resulting in disruption of proper cell zzso zzso effects are dependent on the zzso activity of zzso and cannot be rescued by another zzso family member, indicating a unique role for this zzso These results provide in zzso evidence for the role of zzso in the zzso of specific zzso zzso zzso which thereby influences the composition of the cellular zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso The studies described in this review provide insight into the long-standing association between zzso zzso and zzso as changes in zzso environment and cell zzso are hallmarks of cancer zzso
