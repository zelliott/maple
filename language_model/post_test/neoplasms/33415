zzso is a selective zzso target of zzso zzso inhibitor with promising zzso zzso In order to identify a rationally based dose and schedule for cancer treatment, we have conducted a tumor zzso phase I study in patients with advanced solid zzso 

Fifty-five patients were treated with zzso in zzso of 20, 50, and 70 zzso weekly or 5 and 10 zzso zzso zzso escalation depended on dose limiting toxicity zzso rate during the first zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor and skin zzso were evaluated for total and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 1, zzso initiation factor zzso zzso binding protein 1 zzso zzso initiation factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Plasma trough levels of zzso were determined on a weekly basis before dosing during the first 4 zzso 

We observed a zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with a near complete zzso of zzso and zzso at 10 zzso and zzso 50 zzso In addition, zzso was zzso in 50% of the treated zzso In the daily schedule, there was a correlation between zzso plasma trough zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso There was good zzso of zzso zzso zzso between skin and zzso Clinical benefit was observed in four patients including one patient with advanced zzso cancer achieving a partial zzso zzso occurred in five zzso one patient at 10 zzso zzso 3 zzso and four patients at 70 zzso zzso with grade 3 zzso one with grade 3 zzso and one with grade 3 zzso 

zzso achieved zzso signaling zzso at doses below the zzso A dosage of 10 zzso or 50 zzso is recommended for further zzso
