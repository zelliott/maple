While the cause and nature of certain human zzso are known, definitive preventative guidelines still cannot be offered for many types of zzso This is partly due to the inherent zzso and zzso limitations involved in the identification and interpretation of complex zzso risk factors and potential low-risk zzso Two divergent control strategies have zzso zzso regulatory programs designed to control or eliminate minute quantities of pollutants in the ambient environment, based on fairly rigid quantitative risk zzso zzso a biological research effort to understand the fundamental biological mechanisms with the objective of eventually manipulating or intervening in zzso through zzso or zzso Apart from more intensified effort on certain already recognized zzso factors, current research indicates that the zzso approach will have little impact on the cancer burden and that the zzso approach, although difficult and slow, represents the most logical zzso This will require long-term major investments in fundamental research and zzso This biological approach, however, is largely ignored by the public and legislative bodies concerned with cancer control strategies, partly due to lack of formal input to appropriate national bodies by experts in chemical zzso zzso scientists have an important role in ensuring that the public and legislative bodies are aware of current scientific views on zzso and the need to establish priorities in zzso
