To analyze the zzso variations in patient setup and zzso changes at seven zzso sites observed in zzso zzso 

A total of 152 patients treated at seven zzso sites using a zzso zzso zzso system were zzso Daily zzso zzso zzso zzso images acquired before each treatment were fused to the planning zzso zzso zzso images to determine the daily setup errors and organ motions and zzso The setup errors were corrected before treatment and were used, along with the organ motions, to determine the clinical target zzso target volume zzso The organ motions and zzso for 3 representative patient cases zzso zzso and zzso zzso and for 14 zzso of 7 patients are zzso 

zzso setup errors in the skull, brain, and head and neck are significantly smaller than those in the chest, abdomen, zzso and zzso These zzso relationships are statistically zzso The margins required to account for these setup errors range from 3 to 8 zzso for the seven zzso The margin to account for both setup errors and organ motions for kidney is 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso changes were zzso For example, the zzso moved up to zzso zzso and volumes of the zzso and zzso varied zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso variations in patient setup and in shapes, sizes, and positions of both targets and normal structures are site specific and may be used to determine the zzso zzso The data presented in this work dealing with seven zzso sites may be useful in developing zzso zzso
