In order to accomplish the transition from avascular to vascular growth, solid zzso zzso a zzso substance known as zzso zzso factor zzso into the surrounding zzso zzso cells which form the lining of zzso blood vessels respond to this zzso stimulus in a zzso sequence of events zzso at zzso of a degradation of their basement zzso migration, and zzso A model mechanism is presented which includes the diffusion of the zzso into the surrounding host tissue and the response of the zzso cells to the zzso zzso The model accounts for the main observed events associated with the zzso cells during the process of zzso zzso cell migration and zzso the zzso results compare very well with experimental zzso The situation where the zzso zzso the source of zzso is removed and the vessels recede is also zzso
