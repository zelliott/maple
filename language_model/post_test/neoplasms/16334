One difficulty in studying molecular changes of zzso has been the inability to isolate DNA and zzso from a homogeneous cell zzso The combination of several new technologies should help overcome these zzso zzso is a technique for rapid and easy procurement of a pure cellular zzso away from its complex tissue zzso zzso zzso has recently been identified as a zzso simple and effective method by which zzso of complex tissue specimens can be routinely performed for molecular zzso With the advent of laser zzso zzso libraries can be developed from pure cells obtained directly from stained zzso zzso and zzso of thousands of genes can now be used to examine gene expression in zzso zzso tissue zzso This review will concentrate on the application of different zzso techniques in the area of cancer zzso
