Many zzso are zzso by increased levels of zzso This observation establishes significance for this process in zzso development, but it does little to zzso the nature of this role, nor does it yield information relevant to the early stages of zzso To gain a better understanding of the importance of zzso it has been necessary to create a number of transgenic model systems wherein the zzso response has been zzso Using this strategy, a number of genetic zzso have been identified which affect both the zzso zzso and predisposition to zzso These zzso can operate either directly, by blocking the induction of zzso or zzso by increasing the selective pressure for further genetic zzso The zzso deregulation of growth control and increase in zzso burden represent two key steps in zzso underlining the pivotal role played in zzso suppression by the normal induction of zzso
