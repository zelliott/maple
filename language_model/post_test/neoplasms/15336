zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso in high zzso of zzso is required for generation of therapeutic numbers of cells for adoptive zzso of human zzso Under these conditions zzso promotes both zzso zzso and zzso growth from tumors of several zzso zzso In a series of 16 consecutive tumors, studies of zzso zzso against different tumor targets were characterized by an initial strong zzso zzso With time, zzso bulk cultures became zzso against all targets zzso time zzso 38 zzso zzso zzso bulk populations were capable of zzso strong zzso responses if zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso before addition to zzso zzso populations were not, however, zzso susceptible to zzso zzso zzso zzso was confined to zzso bulk populations zzso as populations with a zzso ratio less than 1), with virtually no zzso observed in zzso populations zzso ratio greater than 2, zzso less than zzso Both zzso and zzso populations expressed zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso These results indicate that, despite poor in zzso zzso zzso in short-term zzso zzso zzso are fully competent zzso zzso cells when subjected to strong zzso signals via the zzso zzso In addition, these results imply that zzso transferred zzso populations of zzso have in zzso zzso functions quite distinct from those of zzso populations and, further, that disparate clinical outcomes could reasonably be expected from the adoptive transfer of either population zzso
