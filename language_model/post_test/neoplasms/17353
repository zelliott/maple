In the treatment of cancer, zzso resistance zzso has been the major obstacle to the success of zzso The underlying mechanism relies on the zzso of zzso zzso that prevent the zzso transport of the zzso In this study, zzso zzso were designed and developed with efficient zzso zzso behavior for reversing drug zzso zzso zzso were zzso from zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Observations from transmission electron zzso zzso and zzso laser scanning zzso zzso outline an obvious hollow structure surrounded by a thin outer layer, indicating the successful formation of the zzso Using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the model drug, a significant acceleration of drug release regulated by zzso zzso was found zzso zzso Upon incubation of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso cervical cancer cell line exposed to zzso an enhanced nuclear zzso of zzso was observed, zzso by the preferred zzso of the zzso structure under reducing zzso zzso by using the zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cell line zzso it was found that cell viability was significantly reduced after treatment with zzso zzso zzso indicating that these zzso can help to reverse the drug zzso
