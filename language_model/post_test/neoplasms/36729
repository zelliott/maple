The zzso of zzso islands is often zzso with zzso zzso and there is overwhelming evidence that this is the case for islands located in gene zzso Such zzso is probably part of a mechanism to permanently silence the activities of zzso including those on the inactive X zzso Not all zzso islands and zzso sites are located in known zzso several zzso and imprinted genes have zzso islands located at considerable distances downstream of zzso initiation sites, and many genes have multiple zzso zzso of zzso islands downstream of zzso initiation does not block zzso in zzso zzso This has given rise to an interesting paradox in which zzso in the transcribed region is often correlated with zzso in contrast to the inverse correlation seen at the site of zzso zzso The zzso paradox might be resolved if it is hypothesized that zzso through a zzso island zzso de zzso zzso
