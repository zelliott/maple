Recent studies suggest that zzso targeting specific zzso zzso zzso may be beneficial in cancer zzso However, most of these zzso are tumor type specific and zzso among patients, thus limiting their zzso Here, we describe the de zzso induction of a zzso zzso zzso for zzso of tumors of various zzso The zzso zzso zzso normally expressed only in a few tumor lines, could be induced de zzso in all zzso cancer lines of eight zzso origins in zzso and in various zzso zzso by systemic administration of zzso The induction of zzso expression correlated strongly with zzso of the zzso island in the promoter region of this zzso The induced zzso was processed and presented properly for recognition by zzso zzso zzso The combination of a zzso agent and adoptive transfer of zzso zzso effectively treated lung zzso in zzso mice challenged with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These data show a novel strategy of combined zzso of cancer targeting a zzso induced de zzso in a broad range of tumor zzso and support further evaluation of zzso agents for human cancer zzso
