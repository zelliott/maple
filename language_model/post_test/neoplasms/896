Gold zzso can enhance the biological effective dose of radiation delivered to tumors, but few data exist to zzso this zzso The purpose of this project was to build a zzso Carlo simulation model to study the degree of dose enhancement achievable with gold zzso A zzso Carlo simulation model was first built using zzso zzso An zzso zzso source in a water phantom was simulated and the calculation model was first validated against previously published zzso We then introduced up to zzso gold zzso per zzso into the water phantom and examined their dose enhancement zzso We compared this enhancement against a zzso mixture model that has been previously used to attempt to zzso zzso dose zzso In our benchmark test, zzso constant, zzso dose function, and two-dimensional zzso function calculated with our model were within zzso of those reported zzso Using our simulation model we found that the radiation dose was enhanced up to zzso with zzso gold zzso per zzso zzso by zzso in a water phantom selectively around the zzso The comparison study indicated that our model more accurately calculated the dose enhancement effect and that previous zzso overestimated the dose enhancement up to zzso zzso Carlo calculations demonstrate that zzso radiation dose enhancement can be achieved with the use of gold zzso Selective tumor labeling with gold zzso may be a strategy for clinically enhancing radiation zzso
