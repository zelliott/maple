The zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso carries out multiple regulatory and transport functions, and disruption of zzso function has been implicated as a mechanism to increase cell zzso Several zzso zzso zzso have been identified in human zzso including the following zzso acid zzso occurring in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To determine what effects these zzso have on zzso function, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso and zzso zzso were characterized for binding of zzso growth factor zzso and a zzso zzso zzso termed zzso (where zzso is zzso zzso and zzso is bovine serum zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso eliminated zzso binding while not affecting zzso zzso zzso zzso Val and zzso zzso zzso each showed zzso decreases in the number of sites available to bind both zzso and zzso In addition, the zzso zzso His zzso underwent a zzso loss of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso that was not observed for wild zzso In all, four of the five zzso zzso analyzed demonstrated altered zzso zzso providing further evidence that loss of zzso function is characteristic of certain zzso
