zzso zzso resulting from inadequate zzso zzso zzso cell zzso is a serious complication of zzso zzso high-dose chemotherapy zzso In this situation, the infusion of zzso zzso that are expanded ex zzso could be clinically zzso In this study we investigated the ability of various growth factor combinations to generate zzso zzso zzso cells derived from bone zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso peripheral blood zzso from 17 patients with breast cancer, lymphoma, or myeloma were cultured zzso for 10 days in a zzso liquid culture system that contained zzso growth zzso Five different growth factors combinations were zzso Stem cell factor zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth and development factor zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso alone zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells yielded significantly higher numbers of zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso cells with any of the growth factor regimens zzso zzso zzso cells zzso at day 0 generated zzso to zzso zzso cells by day 10 when cultured in the presence of growth factor combinations 1, 2, or zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso cells produced zzso zzso cells after 9 days in the presence of combination 1, whereas lower numbers of zzso cells were generated in cultures with combinations 2 and 3 zzso and zzso zzso The addition of zzso to cultures that were grown with combination 1 for 5 days increased the number of zzso cells zzso increase in zzso cultures, zzso increase in zzso zzso Treatment with zzso alone resulted in higher zzso of zzso zzso than those obtained in cultures with combined growth factors zzso in zzso cultures, zzso in zzso zzso but because total cell growth was zzso absolute numbers of zzso zzso were lower zzso in zzso cultures, zzso in zzso zzso analysis of zzso identified zzso cells revealed zzso cells as the zzso cell type in all of the zzso During the 10-day culture period, zzso zzso zzso did not show notable zzso even under the influence of zzso whereas in zzso cultures zzso induced a significant shift to zzso cells and stage I zzso after day zzso zzso analysis of cell surface markers showed that the majority of cultured zzso cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also indicating an immature stage of zzso The ex zzso zzso activity of zzso cells and their potential to develop into the zzso lineage demonstrated considerably high zzso zzso There was no correlation between zzso recovery following zzso with zzso cell support and the magnitude of zzso cell expansion ex zzso suggesting the zzso of zzso expansion ex zzso in patients with prolonged zzso zzso In zzso these data indicate that zzso zzso zzso are more effectively expanded ex zzso into the zzso lineage than are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be an zzso cell population for zzso as prophylaxis or treatment of prolonged zzso The efficacy of this procedure will be tested zzso in a clinical zzso
