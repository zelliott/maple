During cancer zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the tissue in which the tumor grows is extensively zzso both by degradation of zzso zzso molecules and by the zzso of zzso zzso which in many cases are not present in the zzso of normal zzso zzso zzso a class of zzso adhesive zzso plays a prominent role in zzso zzso function, because of its high abundance and its interaction with cellular zzso Furthermore, the generation of zzso zzso zzso allows the development of specific zzso zzso zzso which can be used for the selective delivery of therapeutic agents to the tumor zzso In view of these considerations, it is not surprising that zzso is being used as a target for zzso intervention, both for the development of zzso molecules that block the interaction of zzso with zzso and other receptors on the cell surface, and for the development of zzso targeted imaging and therapeutic zzso In this review, we briefly present the essential properties of zzso and we then focus on the therapeutic strategies that are currently in zzso or clinical development and feature zzso as a target, or that are based on zzso fragments so as to promote zzso zzso
