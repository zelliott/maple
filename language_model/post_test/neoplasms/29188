Unless diagnosed early, many adult zzso remain incurable zzso This is despite an intense global research effort to develop effective zzso therapies, calling into question the use of rational drug design strategies in targeting complex disease states such as zzso A fundamental challenge facing researchers and clinicians is that zzso are inherently robust biological systems, able to survive, adapt and zzso despite the zzso resulting from zzso zzso It is essential that the mechanisms underlying tumor zzso be formally studied and zzso as without a thorough understanding of the principles of tumor zzso strategies to overcome therapy resistance are unlikely to be zzso zzso describes the ability of structurally distinct system components zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso to be zzso interchangeable in their contribution to system traits and it has been broadly implicated in the zzso and zzso of complex biological zzso Here we focus on one of the most important mechanisms underpinning tumor zzso and zzso the cellular zzso that is the hallmark of most solid zzso Based on a combination of zzso experimental and clinical studies we argue that zzso noise is an underlying cause of tumor zzso and particularly zzso Drawing from a number of recent data sets, we propose an zzso model for the evolution of therapy resistance, and discuss recent zzso studies that propose new therapeutic strategies aimed at defeating the adaptable cancer zzso
