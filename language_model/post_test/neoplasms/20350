The zzso capture reaction zzso produces two energetic zzso zzso and zzso that are strongly cell zzso Due to the short range of these nuclear fragments zzso zzso mainly those cells that have bound or zzso a zzso substance are zzso The most critical and difficult step in an efficient zzso zzso capture therapy zzso is the zzso zzso It is today possible to zzso a large number of zzso compounds and zzso them to zzso zzso such as zzso zzso or different zzso The zzso substances presently considered for therapy are zzso zzso hydride zzso and zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Other zzso compounds considered are zzso for zzso zzso cells, zzso for zzso cells with specific zzso and zzso for treatment of zzso zzso The required zzso concentration is given by the relative dose due to zzso capture in zzso and that of the competing capture reactions in nitrogen and zzso zzso in nitrogen produces zzso with a range of about zzso zzso and this gives a radiation dose to all cells in the zzso activated zzso zzso show that the local concentration of zzso near the critical radiation target, DNA, must be higher than 10 zzso (10 zzso Increased emphasis will be put on the development of combinations of treatments that zzso the requirements for attacking the microscopic spread of the zzso
