In the process of identification of zzso zzso that elicit zzso responses in cancer patients, evidence for the existence of zzso zzso with little sequence zzso to normal open reading frames has been zzso The generation of zzso zzso is either zzso controlled (by zzso of zzso cryptic promoter zzso zzso events, or zzso zzso or zzso controlled (by zzso zzso or translation from an alternative open reading zzso The zzso zzso may possess either an zzso zzso zzso of a true zzso or zzso zzso or structural zzso of zzso of a true zzso In zzso studies have revealed the presence of zzso zzso zzso in cancer patients, suggesting that these zzso could represent a natural alternative to zzso In cases in which tumor zzso are zzso in cancer, zzso can overcome tolerance by zzso zzso receptors zzso that originally had low zzso for their respective tumor zzso zzso zzso have been shown to possess the zzso binding motif and cause efficient zzso of zzso Indeed, zzso from an zzso of melanoma zzso zzso can elicit both zzso and zzso zzso immune responses in zzso Furthermore, studies suggest that zzso could be excellent targets for cancer zzso This review summarizes the discovery and functional characteristics of zzso zzso in particular zzso in cancer zzso
