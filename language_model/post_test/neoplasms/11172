Human gastrointestinal tumors with zzso DNA mismatch repair system zzso instability zzso zzso have distinct molecular and zzso profiles, and are associated with favorable zzso There is evidence suggesting that zzso cancer patients with zzso tumors respond differently to zzso chemotherapy as compared with patients with zzso zzso Finally, determination of the zzso status has clinical application for assisting in the diagnosis of suspected zzso zzso It is thus becoming increasingly recognized that testing for zzso should be conducted systematically in all human zzso potentially of this zzso We recently described a zzso zzso chain reaction of five zzso repeats to establish the zzso status of human tumors, and showed that this zzso was zzso sensitive and zzso Moreover, these markers are zzso in zzso DNA of the white population zzso individuals of zzso zzso and could be used for tumor zzso determination without the requirement for matching normal DNA in this zzso 

In this study, we analyzed a comparable panel of five zzso markers in zzso DNA from zzso individuals encompassing 55 different populations zzso zzso With the exception of two zzso zzso and one San individual for whom three markers showed zzso zzso (three cases zzso the remaining zzso individuals showed no zzso of zzso size zzso cases zzso or only one zzso cases zzso or two zzso cases zzso markers with zzso zzso All 60 zzso tumors investigated display instability in at least four of the five zzso 

We demonstrated that tumor zzso status can be determined using the zzso reaction for all human populations without the need for matching normal zzso
