The aim of this study is to investigate zzso polarization induced by zzso zzso zzso that promotes zzso responses in zzso and in zzso Both zzso and functional activities of zzso were assessed by the quantitative analysis of key surface molecules on zzso with flow zzso zzso zzso and the production of zzso with zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain zzso Our results showed that zzso could zzso the expression of zzso and the production of zzso (the markers of alternatively activated zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso meanwhile it could significantly zzso the expression of zzso zzso and the production of induced zzso oxide zzso (the markers of classically activated zzso zzso Furthermore, the studies on bone zzso zzso treated with zzso zzso in zzso had demonstrated that zzso could markedly increase zzso zzso zzso could also enhance the release of zzso zzso species and the production of zzso tumor necrosis zzso while decrease the production of zzso In conclusion, zzso could effectively induce zzso zzso polarizing to zzso zzso zzso to zzso the zzso responses of the host immune zzso Our results suggest that zzso might have great potential as a new therapeutic agent for zzso
