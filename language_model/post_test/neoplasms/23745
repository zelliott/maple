In the present study we tested numerous soluble zzso parameters zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso gamma zzso and alpha zzso zzso zzso in zzso obtained from 18 advanced cancer patients during subcutaneous treatment with zzso zzso zzso The treatment cycles consisted of a dose of 9 zzso zzso zzso twice daily for 2 days followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso twice daily for 5 zzso during 6 zzso Even before therapy, zzso patients had higher levels of soluble zzso 2 zzso than a group of healthy zzso Moreover, zzso soluble zzso zzso levels showed significant differences zzso zzso zzso in patients with different clinical responses zzso and zzso During treatment we observed a fast increase (in the first or second week) of all parameters zzso soluble zzso 2 zzso and soluble zzso zzso were the markers that were best related to the course of zzso In conclusion, monitoring zzso zzso 2 zzso with zzso parameters in serum seems to be of zzso However, more data are necessary to confirm the real value of the single zzso
