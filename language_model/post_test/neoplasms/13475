Human zzso exhibit considerable zzso activity against tumor (but not normal zzso zzso at least partly, with the generation of zzso oxygen zzso zzso The present study examined the role of surface zzso and zzso zzso in the induction of zzso production by human zzso zzso with cancer cells, as measured by zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso indicated the engagement of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and tumor cells, expressing zzso zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso decreased the expression of zzso and induced zzso zzso zzso from the cultures of tumor cells zzso zzso response of zzso an effect that was abolished by treatment of the zzso with zzso zzso or by zzso of zzso with an zzso zzso These results indicate that several surface molecules of zzso including zzso are required to trigger the generation of zzso after their contact with tumor cells, whereas zzso zzso on some cancer cells may allow zzso (via zzso to distinguish between transformed and normal zzso However, blocking of zzso on zzso by free zzso zzso their response to tumor zzso Taken together, these observations suggest that the presence of zzso in the tumor zzso may zzso zzso functions of zzso zzso and their interactions with cancer cells in zzso
