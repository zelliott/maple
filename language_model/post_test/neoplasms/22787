zzso zzso are pivotal regulators involved in various biological functions through the zzso regulation of gene zzso zzso of zzso expression and function contribute to both zzso and pathological processes such as development and zzso While their roles have been attracting more attention in connection with tumor development, the mechanisms regulating zzso zzso have not been well zzso zzso zzso have revealed the dynamic regulation of zzso zzso by several regulatory factors and demonstrated the complexity of zzso gene zzso In addition, several reports showed the interplay between the zzso tumor zzso network and the zzso gene regulatory zzso We recently found that zzso zzso zzso maturation at the processing step of primary zzso zzso unraveling a novel function of zzso Here, we review the recent understanding of functional links between zzso zzso and zzso signaling zzso with particular focus on the zzso between the zzso network and the zzso zzso zzso Further characterization of controlling elements for zzso production and activity would provide important insights for a comprehensive understanding of the zzso function in health and zzso
