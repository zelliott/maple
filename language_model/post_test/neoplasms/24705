zzso tumors frequently release zzso factors, which lead to the zzso of the zzso a process called zzso This zzso provides sufficient zzso of the tumor when it exceeds a certain zzso Recently, a similar mechanism has been zzso for the development of new zzso vessels in tumors, termed zzso Thus, tumors get access to the circulation and zzso drainage like any other growing or zzso zzso Furthermore, it has been hypothesized that zzso and zzso support zzso zzso Elaborating on this model, we zzso present strong arguments for the new theory that tumors initiate their own zzso by the release of zzso factors in zzso to zzso and zzso For this process, we coin the term zzso It is likely that zzso further supports the formation of zzso since the zzso nerve endings can release zzso which enhance the zzso zzso zzso the presence of nerve cell markers in tumor zzso has been shown to be a zzso marker for the course of a cancer disease, and we have recently reported on the zzso function of the neurotransmitter zzso in a mouse zzso
