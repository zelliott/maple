zzso or total loss of zzso class I expression on tumor cells is known as a mechanism of cancer immune zzso zzso of the zzso zzso are frequently due to zzso affecting genes zzso the zzso class I heavy chains located on zzso zzso or the zzso zzso gene zzso the light chain of the zzso complex located on zzso zzso Frequently irreversible total loss of zzso class I molecules is due to the coincidence of two molecular events, the zzso of one zzso gene and the loss of the second zzso The latter is zzso as loss of zzso zzso of zzso markers in the zzso region on zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso might be an important event in the processes of zzso class I zzso and total zzso Here we studied the frequency of zzso in tumor zzso of different zzso By determining the status of zzso of two zzso markers we detected zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso of colon zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso but only in zzso of zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we observed a frequent coincidence of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and melanoma, but not for zzso zzso We believe that the high zzso of zzso in some zzso and especially the coincidence of zzso and zzso might have a strong impact on tumor zzso and on the efficiency of cancer zzso
