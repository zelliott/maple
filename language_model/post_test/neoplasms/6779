The proportion of elderly persons among terminal cancer patients is around zzso in zzso zzso of the last week of survival can be significant in zzso care units for planning patient management, fulfilling patients' wishes at the end of life, and meeting the needs of zzso We aimed to find out the zzso factors for the last week of survival in elderly terminal cancer zzso 

We zzso observed items based on previous research that we anticipated might influence survival among zzso consecutive elderly zzso Within 24 hours of admission, we collected data including clinical symptoms and signs, demographic information, and zzso test zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to identify factors associated with patient mortality within 7 zzso 

zzso analysis indicated that the following factors were zzso of zzso higher score of Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group zzso performance status zzso zzso p zzso zzso primary liver cancer zzso zzso p zzso zzso male gender zzso zzso p zzso zzso lower zzso muscle power zzso zzso p zzso zzso lower zzso blood pressure zzso zzso p zzso zzso higher heart rate zzso zzso p zzso zzso higher zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and higher blood zzso nitrogen zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

We propose that the probability of survival of less than a week can be predicted by our zzso This formula, which includes factors of demographic information zzso zzso and presence of liver zzso clinical signs zzso zzso blood pressure, higher heart rate, and lower mean zzso muscle zzso and zzso tests zzso zzso and higher zzso may help improve survival prediction in terminal elderly cancer zzso
