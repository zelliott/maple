In addition to the plasma where factor zzso zzso A is present as part of the zzso of the zzso zzso factor, zzso of factor zzso A can also be detected in cellular zzso in different human zzso Experimental findings verified that these cells belong to the zzso zzso and the zzso cell zzso Additionally, factor zzso A is present in zzso localized mainly around central veins in the liver and occasionally expressed in certain zzso transformed zzso It is reasonable to suppose that factor zzso A acts not only as a member of the zzso zzso but also as a cellular zzso that can catalyze molecular interactions zzso (during the zzso of the zzso or zzso (in the zzso tissue zzso around the cells containing zzso
