zzso culture techniques were used to study the effect of zzso on several cell types, including normal liver and zzso cells, as well as cell lines that have been established in culture for many zzso Short zzso (less than 30 zzso at 45 degrees C readily kill a large proportion of zzso The response to heat was zzso similar in all cells tested, and no preferential killing of zzso cells could be zzso By contrast, hypoxic cells were found to be dramatically more susceptible to killing by heat than zzso zzso This is the reverse of the situation for zzso zzso The effectiveness of zzso zzso was zzso by treating the zzso cells for 20 zzso at 43 degrees C, which did not kill a zzso number of zzso
