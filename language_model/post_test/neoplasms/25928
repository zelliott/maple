The aim of this study was to evidence the clinical effects of an abrupt substitution of zzso with zzso using a fixed ratio of zzso in patients for whom limiting adverse effects occurred before adequate analgesia was achieved with oral zzso 

A zzso prospective study was carried out on 24 consecutive patients who were switched from oral zzso to oral zzso because they experienced substantial adverse effects that limited further increase in zzso zzso A fixed conversion zzso ratio of zzso was zzso zzso doses were changed according to clinical need, with frequent visits or phone zzso zzso and symptom intensity, zzso doses of zzso initial and subsequent doses of zzso and survival were zzso 

A significant decrease in pain and symptom intensity was found within 24 hours after the substitution took zzso The switching was effective in most patients (19 of 24), although five patients required alternative zzso No significant changes in zzso dose were reported in the 3 days after zzso zzso dose was significantly higher in patients who had lower zzso doses of zzso and vice zzso No relevant complications were zzso 

A rapid substitution of zzso with zzso using an initial fixed ratio of zzso is a safe and effective method for improving the balance between analgesia and adverse effects in cancer patients with poor zzso zzso An appropriate system of patient monitoring is necessary, because further changes in dose may be required according to clinical zzso
