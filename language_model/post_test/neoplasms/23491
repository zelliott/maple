zzso identification has emerged as a priority for symptom zzso Variation in statistical approaches has hampered the identification of common clusters that should be targeted for zzso The purpose of this study was to identify and validate common symptom clusters in a large zzso cohort of ambulatory cancer zzso 

This zzso factor analysis study used zzso methods to derive a stable factor structure to identify symptom clusters in a zzso sample of cancer zzso zzso were identified from a provincial symptom database and linked to other provincial zzso zzso clusters were validated using zzso factor analysis in a randomly selected portion of the sample and model fit examined using common goodness of fit zzso 

The cluster cohort included zzso zzso Three symptom clusters were zzso zzso symptoms zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso emotional distress zzso and zzso and a poor sense of well-being zzso and zzso These clusters were stable across most zzso in the zzso 

The identification of common symptom clusters using robust statistical methods will help to yield targets to improve symptom management and identify populations at risk for worse disease zzso
