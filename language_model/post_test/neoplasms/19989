zzso survivors of pediatric and young adult zzso zzso have a high zzso of subsequent zzso but few risk factors other than cancer treatment have been zzso We aimed to describe the burden of human zzso zzso zzso among survivors of zzso zzso to assess whether zzso infections might be a reasonable area of future zzso research on subsequent zzso in this zzso We used zzso data from 9 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and End zzso program collected between 1973 and 2010 to assemble a cohort of individuals who were diagnosed with any cancer between the ages of 0 and 29 years and survived at least 5 years zzso We estimated zzso standardized zzso ratios zzso with corresponding zzso confidence limits zzso of zzso subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our study population comprised zzso long-term survivors of zzso zzso diagnosed between 1973 and zzso Compared with females in the general US population, female zzso cancer survivors had a zzso relative excess of zzso zzso overall zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with males in the general US population, male zzso cancer survivors had a zzso relative excess of zzso zzso overall zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest an excess of zzso zzso among zzso cancer survivors compared with the general US zzso We zzso that a portion of subsequent zzso among zzso cancer survivors may be directly attributable to zzso zzso This hypothesis warrants exploration in future zzso
