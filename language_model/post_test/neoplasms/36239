We conducted a phase I zzso study to define the maximum tolerated dose zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso a heat shock protein 90 zzso zzso given in combination with zzso 

Patients were treated with zzso followed by intravenous zzso on a weekly zzso zzso client proteins were measured at baseline and serially in peripheral blood zzso zzso during cycle zzso Patients with advanced solid tumors progressing on standard therapy were zzso
