DNA amplification is a pervasive phenomenon in continuous cell lines and in zzso It can occur in many different parts of the zzso with high frequency, and a very large amount of DNA, probably including many zzso is often involved in a single amplification zzso In zzso it is likely that a common mechanism zzso the amplification of genes which zzso drug resistance and genes which give a growth advantage to the zzso DNA amplification may be caused by defects in the regulation of DNA zzso and similar defects may lead to other zzso abnormalities such as zzso zzso and zzso Two recent observations should facilitate identification and study of the underlying zzso agents or treatments which damage DNA can increase the rate of amplification, and zzso cell lines can be selected which amplify their DNA at a greatly increased zzso
