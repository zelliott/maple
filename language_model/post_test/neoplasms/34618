The genetic zzso of most zzso remains largely unclear and it has been zzso that common genetic zzso with modest effects on disease zzso cause the bulk of this unexplained zzso zzso association studies are considered the most effective strategy to identify these zzso zzso While zzso such studies have focused on putative functional single zzso zzso zzso in candidate zzso a more comprehensive approach can now be taken, as a result of a number of recent zzso the mapping of the human zzso including the identification of almost ten million zzso and the development of zzso zzso technologies that enable hundreds of thousands of zzso to be zzso in a single reaction, in multiple subjects and at an affordable zzso All common zzso variation can be captured by zzso zzso in zzso zzso or zzso strategies and these are now being applied to many diseases, including zzso We present an outline of each of these approaches, including recent published examples, and discuss a number of challenges that remain to be zzso
