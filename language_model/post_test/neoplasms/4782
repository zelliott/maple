zzso exhibits several medicinal activities and especially it zzso the growth of cancer zzso However, the use of zzso is limited because of its low zzso zzso and systemic zzso In the present study zzso was loaded into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in order to overcome these zzso It was shown that zzso could be loaded in these zzso up to 2 zzso with zzso zzso efficiency and zzso loading zzso The average particle diameter of the zzso loaded zzso zzso as determined by dynamic light scattering ranged from 84 to 112 zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso in its free form as well as loaded in zzso zzso had a high zzso towards both zzso sensitive and, importantly, resistant cancer zzso On the other hand empty zzso zzso did not show any zzso towards normal cells zzso Interestingly, the zzso effect of zzso towards normal cells was masked when loaded in the zzso The mechanism of cell growth zzso by zzso zzso zzso was zzso through induction of zzso as evidenced from a zzso peak of zzso zzso stained cells using flow zzso zzso From the results of this study it can be concluded that zzso has potent zzso activity not only on sensitive but also on zzso resistant cancer cell zzso zzso zzso are therefore attractive delivery systems of zzso for the treatment of zzso
