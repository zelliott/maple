The generation of zzso zzso zzso with tumor specificity is a promising and effective approach to targeted gene therapy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by various tumor cells, provides a specific tool for zzso targeting by zzso The conventional suicidal gene delivery systems need additional drugs other than their gene zzso The zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso gene product yields zzso oxide zzso which directly zzso zzso and zzso of bystander zzso A novel method is described here that explains how to prepare a novel zzso zzso that displays a zzso envelope protein containing a zzso zzso variable zzso zzso to zzso and carries the zzso gene in the zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed a specific delivery of the zzso gene to human zzso zzso cells, resulting in the direct and efficient killing of zzso zzso cells by induction of zzso This approach may offer a zzso procedure for effective gene therapy of zzso tumors and also be applied to other tumor zzso expressed on cancer zzso
