zzso zzso and clinicians require high levels of information regarding prognosis when conditions are zzso 

1) To validate the zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2) to evaluate zzso capacity of used clinical tools and the diagnosis of delirium, in a population referred to a zzso care consultation service at a Canadian acute care zzso 

This was a prospective zzso cohort study on survival prediction based on the zzso and routinely collected clinical data, including the zzso Performance zzso zzso and the zzso zzso State zzso zzso zzso survival curves, zzso tests for significant differences between survival curves, and the Cox zzso hazards model were used to identify the relationship between the hazard ratio for death and the above zzso 

Nine hundred zzso cases underwent final analysis, of which 181 zzso had a zzso zzso Median and mean survival were 35 and 131 days, zzso The three groups, divided based on different ranges of zzso had significantly different survival curves, with zzso rates of zzso zzso and zzso Age, zzso and zzso remained significantly associated with survival, whereas diagnosis group, zzso and zzso became zzso despite lower hazard of death for cancer zzso zzso and higher hazard for abnormal zzso normal zzso and presence zzso absence of zzso 

The zzso was successfully validated in a population with characteristics that extend beyond those of the population in which it was originally zzso This is the largest sample in which the zzso has been validated to zzso
