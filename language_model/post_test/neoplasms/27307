zzso and zzso are zzso molecules which belong to the tumor necrosis factor family and the B7 family zzso When they are zzso by zzso zzso tumor cells, they provide an efficient protective and long-lasting zzso zzso zzso We first showed that when zzso and zzso were delivered in the tumor environment by zzso zzso but were not expressed by the tumor cells themselves, no zzso response was zzso We next assessed whether the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso contribute to enhance the zzso activity necessary to induce effective T zzso cell interactions and T zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso to express different combinations of deleted zzso and zzso or full-length zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso zzso domain was required to regulate zzso membrane zzso by interacting with the zzso zzso The loss of the zzso zzso domain did not alter its ability to relocate on the surface zzso but failed to zzso T cell zzso In zzso experiments in zzso zzso mice showed that the zzso and the zzso tumors were rejected via zzso T cells, whereas zzso and zzso tumors were zzso The mice that rejected zzso tumors showed decreased protection against injection of parental zzso cells when compared to mice which rejected zzso zzso These results showed that the zzso domain of zzso was critical for the zzso phase of zzso T zzso tumor rejection and that the zzso zzso domain could mediate zzso or surviving signals required for optimal zzso zzso T cell zzso
