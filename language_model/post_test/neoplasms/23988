To report the clinical and zzso features of two patients with progressive retinal zzso and circulating zzso zzso without systemic zzso 

Two patients were followed up for 5 to 7 zzso Comprehensive medical and zzso examinations and visual function testing included manual zzso and standardized zzso Patient zzso were tested for zzso zzso by Western zzso and zzso indirect zzso zzso 

Two patients had family history of zzso zzso Each had severe zzso visual loss with zzso a ring zzso and abnormal zzso despite a zzso zzso zzso One had a flat zzso the other had inner zzso dysfunction, with selective b wave loss and abnormal zzso zzso Both patients' zzso had zzso zzso that specifically labeled the inner zzso layer of donor zzso by indirect zzso zzso Neither had any sign of zzso 

In two patients without systemic zzso the symptoms, zzso findings, and normal zzso appearance resembled cancer associated zzso zzso and zzso findings indicating dysfunction of the inner zzso are distinct from those of zzso zzso These two cases raise the possibility of an zzso mechanism for retinal zzso that is not cancer zzso Further study is necessary to determine the role of zzso zzso in these zzso
