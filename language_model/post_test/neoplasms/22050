Based on their mechanism of action, zzso drugs that target the cell cycle can be generally divided into three categories, zzso blocking DNA zzso causing DNA damage, and zzso zzso zzso In terms of zzso zzso most compounds used in the clinic impair the normal function of zzso zzso by targeting zzso basic building blocks of zzso In zzso these compounds often exhibit significant side effects, thus limiting their zzso zzso processes are under tight control through surveillance mechanisms commonly termed zzso zzso in the regulation of these checkpoints often result in zzso instability, which zzso the cell to zzso zzso As cancer is the consequence of uncontrolled cell division, great efforts have been devoted to discover drugs that target zzso thereby halting cell division and inducing zzso catastrophe with minimal zzso to zzso or normally dividing zzso This review primarily focuses on zzso proteins that have been explored as new targets for zzso drug development during the past zzso
