To compare the accuracy of zzso fine needle aspiration zzso samples prepared by the zzso method to conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso and turn around time zzso were also zzso 

Fifty consecutive fresh zzso submitted for zzso analysis were zzso and each prepared as zzso zzso direct zzso with zzso zzso zzso direct zzso with Pap zzso zzso zzso slide with zzso zzso and zzso zzso slide with Pap zzso The slides were randomly distributed to three zzso for zzso The quality of the preparation, the diagnosis and the time needed for interpretation were zzso 

zzso was measured as the percentage of absolute agreement between the zzso and the zzso diagnoses of the zzso zzso there were 43 zzso and six benign zzso and one zzso zzso The zzso began when the zzso specimens arrived at the lab and ended with the zzso zzso 

In terms of accuracy and zzso zzso zzso slides with Pap stain is the best zzso This advantage however is offset by the longer testing zzso
