Preceded by three decades of intense basic research on zzso zzso we are assisting to the translation of zzso therapies as medical zzso are increasingly using pioneering zzso drugs in combination with standard zzso While basic knowledge in the field of zzso is reaching maturity and our level of understanding of the complex process of vessel development and growth in health and disease has been enriched at the molecular and cellular levels, the translation of this knowledge to the clinic is still in its zzso zzso the most suitable drugs, and the optimal dosage and schedule, as well as monitoring patients' responses to zzso therapy, remain challenging issues that currently limit the benefit of this new therapeutic approach in zzso This review will focus on a comprehensive description of the experimental zzso in which zzso research has been founded and how the different zzso complement and provide relevant information for the task of zzso the zzso properties of diverse zzso giving us a variety of tools to follow up zzso zzso in research zzso Following up zzso zzso in patients and their response to zzso therapy is a more challenging task that will benefit in the near future from the use of zzso imaging methods as well as molecular and cellular zzso of zzso suitable for clinical zzso As both the design of the zzso therapies and monitoring of the response are improved in the coming years to properly tailor them to the zzso profile of every patient, we hope to achieve increasing response and benefit of including zzso drugs as standard in cancer zzso
