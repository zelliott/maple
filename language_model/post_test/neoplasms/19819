Recent prospective studies found an elevated cancer risk shortly after diabetes diagnosis, and this was probably due to increased zzso This study investigated whether zzso cancer risks are also raised following zzso in a disease management zzso for type 2 diabetes zzso zzso 

We linked records from a zzso to population cancer registry zzso The study period was from June 2003 to December zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso were calculated for time intervals following zzso zzso using the cancer zzso rates of the general source zzso Additionally, zzso zzso with natural zzso was used to assess zzso cancer zzso by diabetes zzso 

There were zzso first invasive cancer cases identified over zzso zzso of zzso zzso cancer risk was significantly increased mainly in the first year after zzso zzso zzso the zzso was only seen for patients in whom diabetes had been diagnosed less than 1 year before zzso zzso zzso of zzso cancer was similarly raised in the first year after zzso zzso among individuals newly diagnosed with diabetes but decreased rapidly zzso There was no time dependence in the zzso of zzso of the liver, zzso zzso breast and zzso 

zzso in a zzso did not appear to induce zzso bias for most zzso Cancer risks were initially increased, especially for pancreatic cancer, potentially as a result of reverse zzso zzso bias and zzso zzso of cancer appear to be less of a problem in settings using zzso structures for the study of the association between diabetes zzso zzso medication and cancer zzso
