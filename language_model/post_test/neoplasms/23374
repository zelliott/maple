After zzso cells leave the primary tumor and zzso they may zzso from the zzso and colonize zzso to form zzso zzso zzso play diverse roles in zzso and tumor zzso including zzso In blood cells, zzso of zzso zzso can be regulated by zzso signals leading to zzso from the circulation into zzso However, a role for zzso zzso zzso in tumor cell zzso is zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso promotes tumor zzso and that activated zzso zzso may serve as a zzso of zzso human zzso To determine whether zzso zzso zzso can influence tumor cell zzso the zzso zzso zzso in melanoma and breast cancer cell lines was zzso knocked down with zzso and replaced with zzso or zzso zzso When tumor cells expressing zzso zzso zzso were injected zzso into chick zzso or mice, they demonstrated increased colonization of the liver when compared to cells expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso expression with zzso zzso zzso revealed that tumor cell zzso and zzso colonization required zzso zzso binding to zzso as well as zzso interaction with zzso an zzso zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso knock down of zzso reduced zzso colonization by tumor cells expressing zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso in tumor cells of the tumor zzso zzso inhibited zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso Using an zzso that detects activated zzso zzso we found higher levels of activated zzso zzso in human zzso zzso compared to primary zzso suggesting that activated zzso zzso may serve as a zzso of invasive tumor zzso Altogether, these studies establish that zzso zzso of zzso zzso promotes tumor cell zzso and zzso suggesting diagnostic and therapeutic approaches for targeting of zzso zzso signaling in zzso
