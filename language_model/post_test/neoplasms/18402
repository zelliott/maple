The zzso zzso spike model is applied to liquid water in relation to zzso zzso beams zzso of zzso used for cancer zzso The goal of this project is to calculate the heat transfer in the vicinity of the zzso zzso zzso spike calculations indicate a very large temperature increase in the vicinity of zzso tracks near the Bragg peak during the time zzso from zzso to zzso s after the zzso passage and an increase in pressure, as large as tens of zzso can be induced during that zzso These effects suggest a possibility of zzso pathways to disruption of zzso zzso An extension of the model for hydrogen, zzso zzso zzso zzso and uranium zzso around the Bragg peak is presented as zzso
