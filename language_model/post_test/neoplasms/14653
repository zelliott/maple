It has been hypothesized that zzso vitamin zzso and fiber reduce the risk of specific human zzso Evidence for a role of zzso is based primarily on animal studies, inverse geographic correlations between intake and zzso cancer zzso and an inverse association between serum zzso and subsequent risk of zzso Certain geographic areas with high fiber zzso have lower rates of colon cancer and, in several zzso studies, consumption of fruits and vegetables has been associated with a lower risk of large zzso zzso zzso that vitamin E might reduce the risk of human cancer is largely zzso a protective association has been observed in only 1 small study of breast zzso The evidence that these 3 dietary factors reduce the risk of human cancer remains zzso Future zzso investigations should simultaneously assess a wide variety of dietary factors to address potential zzso and interacting zzso Prospective study designs should be used whenever possible to avoid any influence of cancer on dietary intake or its zzso
