Over the past five years 86 zzso tumors were zzso for cell surface zzso zzso zzso complexes, and/or cell surface zzso zzso Surface zzso was measured by indirect zzso using zzso suspensions and tumor zzso zzso receptors in tissue sections were identified by the closed chamber zzso The results confirm our previous finding that human tumors are coated in zzso with zzso and that there is a population of cells within solid tumors capable of binding zzso zzso In addition, zzso complexes appear to attach to the cell surface membrane by the zzso zone of zzso zzso binding was inhibited by zzso raised against the zzso zzso complement consumption zzso indicated the presence of zzso complexes in tumor zzso It appears that most cell surface zzso is zzso
