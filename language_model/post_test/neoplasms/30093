The zzso death zzso zzso has been studied extensively in cancer cells, but its action in the tumor zzso is not well zzso Here, we uncover a role for zzso signaling in tumor zzso cells zzso We detected zzso expression in zzso within tumors but not normal zzso Treatment of zzso mice with an zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in tumor zzso collapsing blood vessels and reducing tumor zzso zzso disruption and zzso activity required zzso expression on tumor zzso but not zzso zzso These results establish a therapeutic paradigm for zzso zzso zzso as selective tumor vascular disruption agents, providing an alternative, perhaps zzso strategy to their use as zzso of zzso in zzso zzso
