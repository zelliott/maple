In order to determine the zzso effectiveness of zzso drugs in zzso zzso two in zzso test methods were examined for their zzso zzso the short-term incubation of zzso cells with zzso drugs and radioactive zzso precursors of the zzso or zzso and the testing of the cloning ability of zzso cells, zzso with zzso zzso The short-term incubation techniques were directed in two directions: the testing of sensitivity and the testing of zzso Both methods can only be carried out using strong zzso zzso With zzso zzso and biological problems, the sensitivity test results in a relatively minor correlation between the in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso to this the resistance test allows a zzso clinically zzso zzso of primary and secondary forms of the zzso resistance of specific zzso zzso The consecutive measurement of the zzso activity of zzso before and after a systematic chemotherapy also seems to be an able zzso concerning the clinically expected effectiveness of zzso zzso Compared to the other in zzso tests the zzso zzso zzso demonstrates two main zzso zzso all zzso drugs can be zzso by this test method, and zzso little zzso zzso can also zzso Nevertheless, this test method seems to be more suitable for predicting zzso resistance than the sensitivity of zzso zzso
