After 35 years of research, a zzso regulator of zzso production has been identified and the zzso protein is zzso With the discovery of zzso zzso its potential use in a wide variety of clinical zzso and zzso disorders has been expected and clinical trials have been zzso To date, the reported encouraging zzso studies indicate that, as with zzso or zzso minimal toxicity can be zzso A potential limiting zzso of zzso could be the induction of zzso Nevertheless, it is too early to know whether this zzso will be of major therapeutic importance for patients with life-threatening zzso such as patients undergoing bone zzso transplantation or subjected to a high dose of zzso Several experimental and clinical studies are still needed to determine the efficacy of zzso in the prevention or the zzso of zzso which is the ultimate goal for the appropriate use of zzso with zzso zzso Basic and clinical studies on regulators of zzso have rapidly zzso Now, there is no doubt that some of these regulators are effective in correcting zzso disorders of various zzso Studies on negative regulators not only are important to understand the regulation of zzso in normal and pathological states but also have a potential clinical zzso Some of these regulators have been shown to be effective in the treatment of essential zzso and other zzso zzso zzso factor 4 zzso and some other zzso are also capable of protecting zzso cells from the zzso of zzso zzso However, detailed investigations are still required to determine the precise zzso of action of these regulators and to establish the optimal clinical protocols of negative regulators alone or in association with positive regulators for the treatment of various zzso diseases and zzso
