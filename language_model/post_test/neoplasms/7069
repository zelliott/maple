Cancer cells in hypoxic areas of solid tumors are to a large extent protected against the action of radiation as well as many zzso zzso There are, however, two different aspects of the problem caused by tumor zzso when cancer therapy is zzso One is due to the chemical reactions that molecular oxygen enters into zzso targeted zzso This results in a direct chemical protection against therapy by the hypoxic zzso which has little to do with cellular biological regulatory zzso This part of the protective effect of zzso has been known for more than half a century and has been studied zzso However, in recent years there has been more focus on the other aspect of zzso namely the effect of this zzso condition on selecting cells with certain genetic zzso that are negative with respect to patient zzso There are zzso mechanisms, where zzso zzso regulatory zzso in cells resulting in a changed metabolism or changes in zzso zzso These processes may lead to changes in cellular intrinsic sensitivity to treatment irrespective of zzso and, zzso may also have consequences for tissue zzso Thus, the zzso mechanisms induced by zzso itself may have a selective effect on cells, with a fine-tuned protection against damage and stress of many zzso It therefore could be that the zzso mechanisms may take advantage of for new tumor zzso and treatment zzso One of the Achilles' heels of zzso research has always been the exact zzso of tissue zzso as well as the control of zzso in biological tumor zzso Thus, development of technology that can ease this control is vital in order to study mechanisms and perform drug development under relevant zzso An integrated zzso zzso project zzso termed zzso demonstrates several pathways involved in zzso and translation control of the hypoxic cell zzso and evidence of zzso with responses to pH and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso CA IX was selected for further studies due to its expression on the surface of many types of hypoxic zzso The effort has led to marketable culture zzso with sensors and incubation equipment, and the synthesis of new drug candidates against new molecular zzso New zzso methods for cancer diagnosing and imaging of hypoxic cancer tissue are now being tested in zzso models and are also in early clinical testing, while new potential zzso drugs are undergoing tests using zzso tumor zzso The present article describes the above results in individual consortium partner zzso
