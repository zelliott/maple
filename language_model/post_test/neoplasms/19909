Cancer is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals infected with human zzso virus zzso but patterns of cancer zzso after combination zzso therapy zzso initiation remain poorly zzso 

We evaluated the zzso and timing of cancer diagnoses among patients initiating ART between 1996 and 2011 in a collaboration of 8 US clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to estimate zzso zzso Cox zzso was used to identify demographic and clinical characteristics associated with cancer zzso after ART zzso 

At initiation of first combination ART among 11 zzso patients, median year was 2004 zzso range zzso zzso and median zzso count was 202 zzso zzso zzso zzso rates for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were highest in the first 6 months after ART initiation zzso zzso zzso and zzso thereafter, while zzso rates for all other zzso combined increased from 416 to zzso cases per 100 zzso zzso from 1 to 10 years after ART initiation zzso zzso increase per year; zzso confidence zzso zzso Lower zzso count at ART initiation was associated with greater risk of zzso lymphoma, and human zzso zzso zzso year of ART initiation was not associated with cancer zzso 

zzso and zzso rates were highest immediately following ART zzso particularly among patients with low zzso cell counts, whereas other zzso increased with time on zzso likely reflecting increased cancer risk with zzso Our results underscore recommendations for earlier zzso diagnosis followed by prompt ART initiation along with ongoing aggressive cancer screening and prevention efforts throughout the course of zzso zzso
