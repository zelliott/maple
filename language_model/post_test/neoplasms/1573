zzso studies of populations living in areas with good air quality report correlations between levels of ambient particulate matter zzso and mortality zzso These associations occur at low PM zzso that are below current air quality zzso Can such zzso cause zzso given the toxicity of PM chemical zzso We examined zzso zzso data typically used in zzso zzso human health risk zzso These assessments rely on established, zzso thresholds for zzso health zzso We found that chemicals identified as constituents of ambient PM are present at zzso considerably below the regulatory thresholds used in risk assessment zzso below the zzso and zzso that identify levels for which no adverse health effects are zzso From the perspective of risk assessment, exposure to the zzso of chemicals in ambient PM zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cannot be expected to cause zzso zzso the health effects attributed to ambient PM in zzso impact zzso appear to be at odds with what would be predicted from a standard zzso zzso zzso assessment for PM zzso Four possible resolutions of this paradox are that zzso the zzso of chemicals present in ambient PM are vastly more toxic than the sum of individual zzso zzso small portions of the general population are vastly more sensitive to certain ambient PM chemicals than reflected in zzso zzso toxicity factors, zzso the toxicity of ambient PM is unrelated to its chemical constituents, or zzso PM mass concentration is not the zzso factor in the reported zzso The associations may arise because ambient PM zzso zzso are a surrogate for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso factors that cannot be fully controlled zzso weather, zzso or zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso
