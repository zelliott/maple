As pediatric cancer survivors age, long-term cardiovascular complications related to zzso zzso as well as development of premature coronary artery disease zzso from radiation and increased prevalence of zzso risk factors such as zzso are likely to become more zzso Despite advances in our understanding of zzso in the general population, a large amount of the zzso in development of disease is zzso Given the strong zzso of zzso some of this may be attributable to zzso zzso zzso in particular zzso in families, and twin studies have shown that the genetic contribution is greater in premature zzso In this article, we present a brief review of the literature on the zzso of zzso Over 30 zzso disorders feature zzso zzso Recently, however, interest has shifted to understanding the genetic variation contributing to common, complex disease, where disease risk is zzso and characterized by environmental factors, and zzso zzso zzso zzso such a disease, and highlights the inherent difficulties in understanding the underlying genetic architecture of such zzso zzso cardiovascular complications in patients who survive pediatric zzso result in significant morbidity and mortality in this zzso zzso need to be aware of screening and treatment strategies for primary and secondary prevention of cardiovascular complications in this zzso Further research is necessary to define the epidemiology and risk factors of premature zzso in survivors of pediatric zzso and to determine whether candidate genes for cardiovascular disease in the general population are also zzso genes in this vulnerable zzso
