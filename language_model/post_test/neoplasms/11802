Evidence that the various common types of cancer are largely zzso diseases is zzso zzso and other environmental factors are divided into a dozen categories, and for each category the evidence relating those particular factors to cancer onset rates is zzso Where possible, an estimate is made of the percentage of current zzso cancer mortality that might have been caused or avoided by that category of zzso These estimates are based chiefly on evidence from zzso as the available evidence from animal and other laboratory studies cannot provide reliable human risk zzso By far the largest reliably known percentage is the zzso of current zzso cancer deaths that are due to zzso although it is possible that some nutritional zzso may eventually be found to be of comparable zzso The percentage of zzso cancer deaths that are due to tobacco is still zzso and must be expected to continue to increase for some years yet due to the delayed effects of the adoption of cigarettes in earlier zzso Trends in mortality and in onset rates for many separate types of cancer are studied in detail in appendixes to this zzso zzso in the available data on registration of new cases produce apparent trends in cancer zzso which are zzso zzso also produce zzso trends in cancer zzso which are zzso zzso also produce zzso trends in cancer death certification rates, especially among old zzso In (and zzso middle age, where the biases are smaller, there appear to be a few real increases and a few real decreases in mortality from some particular types of cancer, but there is no evidence of any generalized increase other than that due to zzso zzso increases or decreases due to some new zzso or zzso might of course be overlooked in such large-scale zzso But, such analyses do suggest that, apart from cancer of the respiratory zzso the types of cancer that are currently common are not zzso modern diseases and are likely to depend chiefly on some long-established zzso (A prospective study utilizing both questionnaires and stored blood and other biological materials might help zzso these zzso The proportion of current zzso cancer deaths attributed to occupational factors is zzso estimated as zzso zzso cancer being the major contributor to zzso This is far smaller than has recently been suggested by various zzso Government zzso The matter could be resolved directly by a zzso study of lung cancer two or three times larger than the recently completed zzso National zzso Cancer Study but similar to it in methodology and unit zzso there are also other reasons for such a zzso A fuller summary of conclusions and recommendations comprises the final section of this zzso
