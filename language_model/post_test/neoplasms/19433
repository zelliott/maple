To determine whether zzso and its active zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso immune function in patients with advanced cancer who required zzso for pain zzso 

Prospective zzso clinical zzso 

zzso clinic of a university zzso 

Fifteen patients who visited our clinic for control of advanced cancer zzso 

During the initiation or changes of zzso therapy, zzso blood samples were obtained at the enrollment of this study, 1 and 3 weeks after the change of zzso dose or zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity of natural killer cell, zzso zzso zzso zzso and plasma zzso M and G zzso were measured, as well as plasma zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 

At the entry of the study, 6 patients did not receive any type of zzso medication zzso 1), whereas 9 patients were treated with zzso for 1 month zzso zzso Cancer pain, rated as 4 at the entry period, was reduced to 2 of 10 zzso analogue zzso during the study zzso Although the plasma zzso of zzso and zzso in Group 1 were significantly less than those in Group 2, plasma zzso of zzso markers were similar between the zzso In Group 1, zzso linear zzso analysis showed negative correlation between zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso whereas poor correlation was found with all zzso parameters in Group zzso zzso linear zzso analyses showed that the zzso rather than zzso per se, modulated immune function, reflected by zzso zzso proliferation and zzso G concentration in Group zzso 

The present study suggests that some of zzso and cellular immunity are modulated by zzso zzso at the early phase of zzso therapy in patients with advanced zzso
