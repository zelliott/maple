zzso zzso is a notable feature of zzso zzso to the roles of these zzso in cancer growth, immune suppression, tumor zzso and therapeutic zzso zzso are zzso membrane zzso released by many cells types during normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso large quantities of zzso that transport zzso and immune zzso molecules to support tumor growth and zzso The role of zzso in zzso signaling is exemplified by human zzso growth factor zzso type 2 zzso zzso breast cancer, where zzso with the zzso zzso stimulate tumor growth and interfere with the activity of the therapeutic zzso zzso Since numerous observations from experimental model systems point toward an important clinical impact of zzso in cancer, several pharmacological strategies have been proposed for targeting their zzso zzso We also propose a novel device strategy involving zzso zzso of zzso from the entire circulatory system using an affinity zzso platform known as the zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity platform zzso system, which would overcome the risks of toxicity and drug interactions posed by pharmacological zzso This technology allows affinity agents, including zzso zzso and zzso to be immobilized in the zzso space of plasma zzso zzso that integrate into existing kidney dialysis zzso Device therapies that evolve from this platform allow rapid zzso capture and selective retention of target zzso from the entire circulatory zzso This strategy is supported by clinical experience in zzso C zzso patients using an zzso device, the zzso to reduce the systemic load of zzso having similar sizes and zzso surfaces as cancer zzso This review discusses the possible therapeutic approaches for targeting immune zzso zzso in cancer patients, and the anticipated significance of these strategies for reversing immune dysfunction and improving responses to standard of care zzso
