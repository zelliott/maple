Many zzso studies on the role of detoxifying zzso zzso in zzso to cancer have identified significant associations, though few have identified effects with sufficient strength to be useful zzso zzso ratios of 2-3 are the usual zzso zzso combinations of risk zzso are increasingly studied in the hope of identifying zzso with sufficient biological impact zzso ratio zzso zzso to warrant further study in a clinical zzso The study of interactions between different detoxifying zzso zzso should be based on biological sense, for example the classical view of zzso zzso detoxification, overlapping zzso zzso zzso of molecules derived from the same pathological insult zzso zzso of zzso and zzso aromatic zzso in cigarette zzso or simultaneous regulation of zzso The rationale behind these mechanisms is zzso zzso amounts of data have focused on the interaction between zzso and zzso particularly in Japanese patients with lung zzso In this regard there is accumulating evidence suggesting that the combination of zzso zzso rare zzso particularly in combination with smoking, zzso highly significant increased zzso However, there is now some debate on the importance of these data in terms of chemical zzso since certain studies suggest that the zzso zzso that have been investigated do not influence function or expression of the zzso Indeed, the influence of zzso genetic variation is also zzso suggesting that these zzso may be acting more as linkage markers than by influencing chemical zzso zzso What is clear from the many studies on interactions between detoxifying zzso zzso is the comparative lack of supporting data on zzso between these zzso Given the inevitable increase in the complexity of studies, a basic explanation of the statistical approaches to the assessment of interactions is included in this zzso A more detailed zzso assessment is given elsewhere in the zzso Since there is an increasing reluctance of journals to publish zzso studies describing the (usually zzso influence of detoxifying zzso zzso it is important that scientists understand what statistical approach is appropriate and address the issue from a novel and clinically significant zzso This is likely to involve multiple genes and zzso analysis of some zzso
