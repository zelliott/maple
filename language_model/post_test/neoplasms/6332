zzso sedation is a clinical procedure aimed at zzso zzso symptoms in patients with advanced zzso It has been suggested that sedative drugs may shorten life, but few studies exist comparing the survival of zzso and zzso zzso We present a systematic review of literature on the clinical practice of zzso sedation to assess the effect, if any, on zzso 

A systematic review of literature published between January 1980 and December 2010 was performed using zzso and zzso zzso Search terms included zzso zzso terminal zzso zzso symptoms, cancer, zzso zzso care, terminally ill, zzso care, and zzso A manual search of the zzso of zzso identified articles was also zzso 

Eleven published articles were identified describing zzso consecutive patients in 10 retrospective or prospective zzso studies, zzso zzso of whom were zzso One zzso study was excluded from prevalence zzso The most frequent reason for sedation was zzso in the terminal stages of illness zzso zzso range, zzso to zzso zzso were the most common drug category zzso Comparing survival of zzso and zzso patients, the sedation approach was not shown to be associated with worse zzso 

Even if there is no direct evidence from zzso clinical trials, zzso zzso when appropriately indicated and correctly used to relieve unbearable suffering, does not seem to have any zzso effect on survival of patients with terminal zzso In this setting, zzso sedation is a medical intervention that must be considered as part of a zzso of zzso zzso
