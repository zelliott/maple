Most chemical zzso require zzso to zzso zzso forms by Phase 1 zzso zzso zzso in order to exert their toxic and zzso zzso The zzso zzso are susceptible to zzso zzso and other types of zzso by Phase 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The balance between Phase 1 and Phase 2 zzso is an important zzso of whether exposure to zzso will result in toxicity and zzso zzso of the activity of zzso zzso zzso provide an efficient method for studying the potency and mechanism of Phase 2 zzso zzso zzso can be measured easily in zzso zzso cells zzso zzso grown in zzso plate wells, and the zzso response of these cells closely parallels the behavior of zzso zzso in zzso Some zzso (such as large zzso zzso are zzso they induce both Phase 1 and Phase 2 zzso and require binding to the zzso zzso and enhanced zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Other zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso are zzso and are independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induction protects against zzso The induction of Phase 2 zzso by zzso zzso depends on the presence, or acquisition by zzso of zzso centers, and many of these zzso are Michael reaction zzso Our search for zzso zzso zzso for potential use as zzso in man is currently focused on zzso zzso as well as on the identification of other zzso zzso in extracts of zzso
