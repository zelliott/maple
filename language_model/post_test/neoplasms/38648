From September 16, 1981, through April 4, 1986, a total of 21 zzso electromagnetic zzso and zzso ultrasound and zzso zzso zzso zzso and three types of zzso systems underwent extensive phantom and clinical testing at Stanford zzso A total of zzso treatment sessions involving 268 separate treatment fields in 131 patients was zzso zzso profiles were obtained in zzso of these treatment sessions by zzso and/or mapping techniques involving mechanical zzso The ability of these devices to heat superficial, eccentrically located and zzso zzso at the major anatomical locations is evaluated and the temperature zzso acute and zzso zzso and chronic complications zzso Average measured zzso temperatures between 42 degrees C and 43 degrees C were obtained with many of the devices used for superficial zzso average zzso temperatures of zzso degrees C to zzso degrees C were achieved with the three zzso zzso When compared to the goal of obtaining minimum zzso temperatures of zzso degrees C, all devices performed zzso Only 14 per cent zzso of treatments with measured zzso profiles achieved minimum zzso temperatures of 41 degrees zzso zzso per cent of all treatments had associated acute zzso 14 per cent of all treatments necessitated power reduction resulting in maximum zzso temperatures of less than zzso degrees zzso zzso comparisons between two or more devices zzso to treat the same field were made in 67 instances, including 19 treatment fields in which two or more devices were compared at the same treatment zzso The analyses from direct comparisons consistently showed that the zzso spiral and larger area scanning spiral zzso resulted in more zzso temperature zzso Three zzso zzso systems zzso single channel, four channel and eight channel multiple zzso probe zzso the zzso Bowman zzso system and a zzso system were evaluated with respect to zzso stability and zzso The clinical zzso durability, and patient tolerance of the zzso systems were zzso The zzso Bowman and third generation zzso systems were found clinically useful, with the former meeting all of our established zzso
