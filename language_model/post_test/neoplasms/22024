zzso in the zzso regulator zzso gene cause the zzso zzso disease zzso zzso syndrome type 1 zzso which is characterized by a loss of zzso to multiple zzso In zzso with its role in immune zzso zzso is strongly expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells zzso Data on mechanisms controlling zzso zzso and the expression of this gene in other zzso are zzso and zzso We report here zzso zzso expression profiling of a large set of normal human zzso and cells, tumor zzso and zzso deficient cell zzso On this broad data basis we found that zzso zzso expression is confined to zzso in zzso and to zzso zzso tissue and that DNA zzso contributes to zzso control of this zzso
