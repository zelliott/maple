We present a zzso survey of cell line zzso zzso among original stocks of human cell lines, investigated using molecular genetic zzso The survey comprised 252 consecutive human cell lines, almost exclusively zzso submitted by their zzso to the zzso and 5 additional cell zzso zzso using a combination of DNA profiling zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and molecular zzso exploiting an interactive database zzso zzso high levels of zzso zzso were uncovered, affecting 45 cell lines zzso supplied by 27 of 93 zzso zzso Unlike previous reports, most zzso zzso occurred zzso a zzso attributable to improved detection of the more insidious zzso zzso afforded by molecular zzso The most prolific zzso were classic tumor cell lines, the numbers of zzso they caused being as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) and zzso zzso zzso zzso All 5 supposed instances of spontaneous zzso of normal cells were zzso due to zzso including zzso the most cited human zzso cell zzso Although high, our figure for zzso at the source sets a lower limit only as zzso many older tumor cell lines were unavailable for comparison and zzso circulating cell lines are often obtained zzso rather than via zzso or zzso The misidentified cell lines reported here have already been unwittingly used in several hundreds of potentially misleading reports, including use as inappropriate tumor models and zzso zzso as independent zzso We believe these findings indicate a grave and chronic problem demanding radical measures, to include extra controls over cell line zzso provenance and zzso
