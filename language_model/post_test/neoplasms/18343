The zzso and stabilization of tumor zzso zzso are very important in preventing cells from becoming zzso zzso many experimental works have been carried out to investigate zzso dynamics through its interactions with other proteins and its therapeutic applications for the treatment of zzso In this work, by analyzing a theoretical model, we attempt to search for an optimal therapeutic strategy that guarantees the zzso and stabilization of zzso For this purpose, we introduce a new mathematical model including zzso zzso and zzso which are recognized as crucial for tumor suppression but have not yet been considered in most theoretical zzso Through mathematical modeling and zzso simulations, we confirm several important properties of zzso zzso the role of the zzso zzso of zzso as an important factor for the zzso and stabilization of zzso the necessity of time delays in negative feedback zzso to guarantee sustained zzso zzso and the digital behavior of zzso zzso Furthermore, we propose that the binding of zzso to zzso and enhancing the degradation of zzso is an efficient strategy for therapeutic zzso which may assure the zzso and stabilization of zzso
