Inner London health zzso 

Cancer patients were routinely notified from 1987 to zzso zzso patients expected to survive less than one year entered the trial and were randomly allocated to a coordination or a control zzso 

All patients received routinely available zzso zzso group patients received the assistance of two nurse zzso whose role was to ensure that patients received appropriate and well coordinated services, tailored to their individual needs and zzso 

Patients and zzso were interviewed at home on entry to the trial and at intervals until zzso Interviews after zzso were also zzso zzso measures included the presence and severity of physical symptoms, psychiatric zzso use of and satisfaction with services, and zzso zzso zzso from the baseline interview, the interview closest to death, and the interview after zzso were zzso 

Few differences between groups were zzso zzso group patients were less likely to suffer from zzso were more likely to report effective treatment for it, and less likely to be concerned about having an itchy zzso Their zzso were more likely to report that in the last week of life the patient had had a cough and had had effective treatment for zzso and they were less likely to rate the patient's difficulty swallowing as severe or to report effective treatment for zzso zzso group patients were more likely to have seen a zzso and their zzso were more likely to contact a specialist nurse in a night time zzso These zzso were less likely to feel angry about the death of the zzso
