The detection and correct identification of cancer, especially at an early stage, are vitally important for patient survival and quality of zzso Since signaling pathways play critical roles in cancer development and zzso methods that reliably assess the activity of these pathways are critical to understand cancer and the response to zzso zzso zzso zzso identifies signatures of expression that can be linked directly to signaling zzso activity, allowing the changes in zzso levels to be used as downstream indicators of zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate this ability by identifying the downstream expression signal associated with the mating response in zzso zzso and showing that this signal disappears in deletion zzso of genes critical to the zzso signaling cascade used to trigger the zzso We also show the use of BD in the context of supervised learning, by analyzing the zzso zzso zzso data set provided by Project zzso The zzso correctly removes routine zzso zzso allowing zzso signatures of expression to be zzso Gene zzso is used to interpret these zzso Since a number of modern zzso specifically target signaling zzso it is important to be able to identify changes in signaling pathways in order to use zzso data to interpret cancer zzso By removing routine zzso signatures and linking specific signatures to signaling zzso activity, BD makes it possible to link changes in zzso results to signaling zzso
