Although the zzso zzso is widely used for economic zzso it remains unclear whether it can be combined with medical data to predict survival in patients with terminal zzso 

We carried out this prospective study on 142 terminal cancer patients in four zzso care zzso Association was sought between survival time and a range of variables such as cancer site, performance, previous treatment, age, sex, pain, and zzso The zzso was transformed into the corresponding zzso zzso For zzso analysis, we estimated differences in survival with the zzso generalized zzso zzso For those variables that were zzso we performed zzso analysis using the Cox zzso hazard zzso 

zzso analysis showed that sex, age, performance, previous use of chemotherapy, and the zzso utility provided statistically significant zzso survival zzso The median survival time was zzso days for the group with an zzso utility score lower than zzso and zzso days for the group with an zzso utility score above zzso In zzso analysis with the Cox zzso hazard model, an zzso utility score zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso was an independent negative predictor of zzso 

The zzso zzso assessment tool might be useful for predicting survival time for terminal cancer zzso
