zzso motion can have a severe impact on the dose delivered by radiation therapy, and different procedures have been developed to address its zzso Conventional techniques include breath hold methods and zzso A different approach is the compensation for target motion by moving the treatment beams zzso zzso results have been reported for robot based zzso where a linear accelerator mounted on a robotic arm delivers the zzso However, not all zzso move in the same way, which results in a relative motion of the beams with respect to the body and the zzso in the proximity of the zzso This relative motion can severely effect the dose delivered to critical zzso We propose a method to incorporate motion in the treatment planning for robotic zzso to avoid potential zzso of zzso surrounding the zzso The method takes into account the motion of all considered volumes, which is zzso for dose zzso Similarly, the beam motion is taken into account and the zzso dose zzso over all discrete steps is used for zzso We simulated the treatment of a moving target with three different planning zzso First, we zzso beam weights based on a zzso planning situation and simulated treatment with organ motion and the beams moving zzso to the zzso Second, beam weights were zzso by the zzso planning method incorporating the organ and beam motion and treatment was simulated for beams moving zzso to the zzso Third, the beam weights were determined by the zzso planning method with the beams fixed during planning and zzso For comparison we also give results for the zzso treatment plan if there was no organ motion and when the plan is delivered by fixed beams in the presence of organ zzso The results indicate that the new zzso method is preferable and can further improve the overall zzso of motion compensated robotic zzso
