Over the past decade, synthetic biology has emerged as an engineering discipline for biological zzso Compared with other zzso biology poses a unique set of engineering challenges resulting from an incomplete understanding of natural biological systems and tools for manipulating zzso To address these challenges, synthetic biology is advancing from developing zzso designs to focusing on core platforms for rational and zzso biological zzso These platforms span the entire biological design cycle, including DNA construction, parts libraries, zzso design tools, and zzso for manipulating and probing synthetic zzso The development of these enabling technologies requires an engineering mindset to be applied to biology, with an emphasis on zzso techniques in addition to zzso zzso This review aims to discuss the progress and challenges in synthetic biology and to illustrate areas where synthetic biology may impact biomedical engineering and human zzso
