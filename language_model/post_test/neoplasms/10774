zzso cell transfer of zzso zzso T cells could potentially be used as a universal treatment for zzso We present a novel approach for adoptive zzso using fully zzso zzso T cells redirected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso Mice bearing systemic zzso disease were zzso by zzso and treated with zzso zzso T zzso zzso created a zzso zzso which allowed the zzso to attack the tumor before their zzso A single split dose administration of zzso zzso extended the survival of zzso mice similarly to zzso zzso and to a significantly greater extent than zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso using the zzso zzso zzso extended the persistence of zzso T cells such that zzso zzso provided superior therapeutic benefit relative to zzso ones, and dramatically extended the median survival time of the treated mice for more than a zzso zzso we suggest that zzso generated zzso zzso can be used universally for zzso cancer zzso and that their zzso zzso can be safely harnessed to zzso adoptive cell zzso
