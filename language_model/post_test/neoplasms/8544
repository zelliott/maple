We have studied the distribution of the zzso and zzso of zzso in developing and adult human kidney as well as in selected other zzso and cultured zzso In cultured cells some of the zzso zzso zzso 1, alpha 1, alpha 2 and alpha 5) zzso with zzso at focal zzso when zzso on an appropriate zzso Similarly, in zzso the polarization of beta zzso in zzso with zzso appears to indicate adhesive complexes, as demonstrated in adult zzso In human zzso the alpha zzso of zzso were seen to be zzso expressed already in fetal zzso In zzso the zzso alpha 1 zzso characterized zzso cells while the alpha 2 and alpha 3 zzso showed zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso In zzso zzso the alpha 6 zzso zzso with the beta 1 zzso showed a typical polarized distribution zzso with the zzso basement membrane while the alpha 3 and alpha 2 zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso These results suggested that in kidney the alpha 2 beta 1, alpha 3 beta 1, and alpha 6 beta 1 zzso can function as basement membrane zzso The alpha 5 zzso was nearly lacking in the kidney and it appears to be mainly expressed in some smooth muscle zzso In other zzso distinct patterns in the expression of zzso were zzso Thus, in many zzso zzso cells the alpha 3 beta 1 zzso appeared to function as a basement membrane zzso while in various zzso zzso and in the breast such a polarized zzso could be found for the alpha 6 beta 4 zzso Finally, although presenting a clearly polarized distribution for beta 1 zzso none of the alpha zzso could be found in cardiac or skeletal muscle cells and none of the zzso could be revealed in zzso cells of human developing and adult zzso or zzso although zzso in peripheral zzso contained abundantly the alpha 6 beta 1 zzso zzso In human tumors, the tumor cells, including also zzso tumors, generally presented the same zzso as their zzso of zzso In some poorly differentiated tumors both a population zzso and even a lack of expression or a disorganization of basement membrane zzso zzso was zzso
