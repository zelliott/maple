The objectives of this study were to assess the toxicity and zzso response induced by the zzso zzso administration of tumor zzso zzso cells zzso 

Patients with stage IV solid zzso were treated in zzso that received zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso every 2 weeks for three zzso Each vaccine was composed of a mixture of half zzso zzso with zzso tumor zzso and the other half with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso cells zzso harvested 1 month after the last zzso was compared with zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso hypersensitivity zzso to tumor zzso and zzso was also zzso 

Fourteen patients received all three vaccines and were zzso for toxicity and/or zzso zzso There were no grade 3 or 4 zzso associated with the vaccines or major evidence of zzso Local zzso of zzso and zzso T cells were found at the vaccination zzso There was a significant zzso response of zzso to zzso induced by the zzso In 5 of 6 patients, the vaccine resulted in increased zzso production by zzso to zzso in an zzso zzso Using the same zzso 3 of 7 patients' zzso displayed increased zzso production in response to zzso tumor zzso One patient with melanoma also was observed to have an increased frequency of zzso and zzso zzso T cells after zzso By zzso hypersensitivity testing, 8 of 9 and 4 of 10 patients demonstrated zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso Two patients with melanoma experienced a partial and a minor response, zzso 

The administration of tumor zzso zzso is nontoxic and capable of inducing zzso response to tumor zzso Additional studies are necessary to improve tumor rejection zzso
