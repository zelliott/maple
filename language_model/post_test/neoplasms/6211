zzso in urban zzso can directly pose significant human health risks through oral zzso particle zzso and zzso zzso especially for children in public zzso Both zzso and zzso risks of heavy metals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were characterized in 40 surface zzso zzso zzso from 14 urban parks in Xiamen, zzso zzso based on total metal zzso may overestimate the actual risks in comparison with oral zzso assessment that were estimated by a simplified zzso based extraction test zzso After considering the zzso zzso zzso the zzso hazard of zzso to children via oral zzso should be a consideration though its zzso Index zzso was below zzso The overall cancer risks to adults still exceeded the target value zzso mainly contributed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso via zzso contact zzso and oral zzso zzso To produce a more realistic zzso for human health risks of metal contamination in urban soils, a framework combining land use type and zzso is recommended and thereby should be applied for the derivation of zzso zzso soil zzso
