This dedicated zzso phase I study, conducted in zzso cancer patients, assessed the effect of a single zzso dose zzso zzso of zzso on the zzso zzso 

A randomized, partially blind, zzso zzso crossover study was zzso Patients zzso zzso 25) received single doses of 800 zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso monitoring was done before each treatment and for 24 h zzso Blood samples for zzso concentration were collected through 24 h zzso following zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso and blood sampling times were designed to capture the expected zzso of zzso 

zzso of the 25 patients enrolled in the study were included in the zzso zzso The upper bound of the zzso zzso confidence zzso for the zzso zzso for the zzso mean change from baseline of zzso was zzso zzso at every time zzso No patient had a zzso change from baseline value zzso zzso One patient had zzso values zzso zzso zzso after both zzso and zzso zzso and none had values zzso zzso Mean zzso and zzso values attained were on the order of approximately zzso and approximately zzso higher, respectively, compared with the 400 zzso clinical zzso Based on assessment of clinical and laboratory adverse experiences, single doses of 800 zzso zzso were generally well zzso 

Administration of a single zzso dose of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso is not associated with zzso of the zzso zzso A dedicated zzso study in advanced cancer patients is a robust means for assessing risk for zzso zzso zzso
