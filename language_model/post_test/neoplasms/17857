The role of zzso as a key zzso of outcome for human zzso has encouraged efforts to zzso detect and zzso regions of poor zzso in zzso In this review, we will zzso existing and developing techniques for imaging zzso zzso A brief review of the biology of tumor zzso and its effect on tumor cells will be provided zzso We will then describe existing methods for measurement of tissue zzso zzso An overview of emerging molecular imaging techniques based on zzso hypoxic markers such as zzso or zzso genes and proteins will then be given, and the usefulness of these approaches toward targeting zzso directly will be zzso Finally, we will evaluate the clinical potential of zzso and zzso techniques for imaging zzso and discuss how these methods will individually and collectively advance zzso
