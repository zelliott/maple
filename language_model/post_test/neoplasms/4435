The linear zzso equation for zzso zzso has already been adapted to include a time factor for zzso zzso zzso cell kill zzso is given as a function of dose per fraction zzso number of zzso zzso overall treatment time zzso and the zzso doubling time zzso By incorporating a normal tissue zzso and replacing the relationship between T and zzso by a function zzso the equation for E can be zzso as a more complex function of zzso In this form, E and d are continuous variables so that the dose per fraction zzso required to produce maximum values of E for zzso late normal tissue effects can be found by differential zzso The derived equation takes the form zzso zzso zzso + zzso + zzso zzso 0 and when solved for d provides a direct zzso of the optimum dose per zzso Where normal tissue sparing is possible and the zzso dose zzso is related to the normal tissue dose zzso the optimum dose per fraction zzso can be found by solving the equation zzso zzso zzso + zzso + zzso zzso 0 The results show that a critical minimum dose per fraction is required to counteract rapid zzso zzso zzso in both conventional and accelerated zzso The calculus method is reasonably accurate for larger fraction numbers, when zzso doubling times are zzso days or longer and for conventional zzso given 5 days per zzso The model is even more accurate for accelerated zzso zzso providing that there is complete repair between successive zzso Where greater normal tissue sparing is possible, as with focal zzso methods and zzso higher zzso doses per fraction can be used to increase further the zzso cell kill without exceeding normal tissue zzso These predicted doses per fraction are consistent with clinical experience when the given constraints in terms of frequency of treatment are zzso The model described can be used for zzso in which zzso occurs at a constant rate throughout zzso For zzso in which accelerated zzso occurs, the optimum dose per fraction can be separately calculated for the initial phase of slow zzso (for which very small doses per fraction are zzso and also for the second phase of rapid zzso (for which either accelerated zzso treatments or zzso focal methods of treatment would be zzso The limitations of the model are fully discussed including the need for accurate zzso zzso zzso In the future such zzso of zzso doubling times and zzso cell zzso could be used to determine reasonable ranges for the optimum dose per fraction in experimental zzso and subsequently in clinical zzso This approach could produce major improvements in the therapeutic potential of zzso
