zzso response, determined by means of the indirect bacterial zzso tests, was studied in 58 consecutive patients with various zzso whose blood culture yielded growth of zzso or zzso and from whom serum specimens were zzso Of these patients 59% had a significant zzso zzso The invading zzso were zzso coli in 33 and zzso in 19 subjects, an zzso response being documented with essentially equal frequency zzso and 57% of the subjects, zzso Two patients had positive blood cultures for both zzso coli and zzso one of whom had a significant response to one isolate zzso A specific zzso zzso was documented in zzso of the subjects from whom blood for zzso zzso was obtained at least 5 days after the blood culture, but from only zzso of patients whose serum was procured during the first 5 days after the blood zzso Similarly, such an zzso response was identified in zzso of subjects with two consecutive serum zzso but in only zzso of the patients with a single serum zzso for zzso zzso Documentation of the immune response may be of diagnostic aid in zzso between infection and contamination even in patients with underlying zzso and under potentially zzso zzso
