Despite a relatively large body of published research, the potential zzso of zzso fumes is still a zzso zzso Various uncertainties and gaps in scientific knowledge need to be zzso These include uncertainties in chemistry, animal studies, and human zzso The chemistry of zzso fumes is complex and varies according to the source of the crude oil and the application zzso The zzso studies, while showing weak evidence of lung cancer, are inconsistent and many zzso factors have not been zzso Studies of animal exposure are also inconsistent regarding laboratory and zzso zzso There is a need for further human studies that address potential zzso factors such as smoking, diet, coal zzso and diesel zzso Animal inhalation studies need to be conducted with zzso fumes that are chemically representative of roofing and paving zzso zzso all of this is the need for continued characterization of fumes so their use in animal and field studies can be properly zzso Nonetheless, uncertainties such as these should not zzso appropriate public health actions to protect workers in the even that asphalt fumes are found to be a zzso zzso
