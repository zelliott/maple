To test the feasibility of using the zzso promoter to induce specific expression of zzso zzso zzso in cancer cell lines and tumors for targeted use of zzso therapy, a zzso zzso zzso that expressed the zzso gene under control of the zzso promoter was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was performed in zzso zzso zzso and zzso therapy studies were performed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cancer cells all exhibited zzso zzso zzso after infection with zzso approximately 50 times higher than that of negative control zzso zzso No significant zzso zzso was observed in normal human dental pulp zzso zzso cells after infection with zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso cancer cells were selectively killed by exposure to zzso zzso tumors show significant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ID per g at 2 h zzso and the effective zzso was zzso zzso Moreover, infection with zzso in combination with zzso suppressed tumor zzso These results indicate that expression of zzso under control of the zzso promoter can likely be used to achieve zzso expression of zzso in many types of zzso In combination with zzso therapy, this strategy is a possible method of cancer gene zzso
