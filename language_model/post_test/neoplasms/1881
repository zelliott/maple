In the presence of a characterized zzso zzso recognizing a soluble zzso additional zzso zzso zzso with unknown zzso zzso on the zzso can be easily selected by reversed indirect zzso zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso 101, was selected by reversed indirect zzso zzso zzso against soluble zzso which exist in zzso and in zzso zzso derived from lung zzso patients and which bear zzso recognized by the previously characterized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognized by the zzso 101 zzso appear to be zzso zzso in nature and different from those recognized by previously reported zzso zzso against zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggested by competitive zzso zzso and zzso of zzso A circulating zzso zzso zzso was detected by a zzso zzso zzso using immobilized zzso 101 zzso and zzso zzso zzso It was found that serum zzso zzso levels were elevated in zzso zzso of 40) of patients with lung zzso and in zzso (11 of zzso of patients with pancreatic zzso but only in zzso (2 of 31) of patients with benign lung diseases and in zzso (1 of zzso of patients with zzso The present observations indicate that the zzso zzso zzso may serve as a new tumor marker for zzso of the lung and the zzso Additionally, the reversed indirect zzso zzso zzso may be a widely zzso method for selecting new zzso zzso against as yet unknown zzso zzso on soluble zzso
