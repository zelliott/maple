In zzso with diverse cell zzso it is not uncommon for one type of cell to respond while others are zzso Even in an organ with common cell types, such as zzso within the liver, the population of cells may respond with different sensitivities for injury or for zzso responses to zzso In the liver, many tumor promoters induce zzso zzso zzso and other proteins in zzso cells at much lower doses than required to cause induction in zzso zzso In addition, these induction responses appear to occur at the level of individual zzso 50% response of the liver for induction does not represent 50% induction in all zzso Instead, half of the cells are fully induced and half are zzso zzso zzso from one zzso state to zzso Over the past 10 years, several attempts have been made to model these cellular switches and to understand their relevance for zzso tumor promotion and risk zzso The data used for analyzing these switches include responses of the entire liver zzso zzso responses of individual cells in the liver zzso zzso and cellular responses such as proliferation and zzso This brief overview describes the development of biologically based, zzso zzso models for protein induction and tumor promotion in liver by zzso zzso with emphasis on the role of specific types of zzso and molecular data in providing insights about mechanisms for cellular switches and their implications for tumor zzso As the biological basis of these switches become unraveled and incorporated into the models, these zzso models should eventually serve to improve risk assessments with a variety of liver tumor promoters with zzso modes of zzso
