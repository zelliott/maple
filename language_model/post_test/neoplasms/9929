The mechanisms of action of, and resistance to, important zzso agents are briefly zzso Their selective toxicity is considerably high, and is chiefly due to the distribution and metabolism in the zzso The selective toxicity of some zzso drugs may be attributed to the structural difference of DNA, zzso and/or zzso between zzso and normal zzso Some studies of reducing side effects are zzso In our laboratory, we are studying zzso and zzso of tumor zzso Since the mechanism of natural resistance of gastric cancer, pulmonary cancer, and other zzso zzso may be related to acquired resistance of zzso studies on new agents against drug-resistant tumor cells are zzso In our laboratory, we have selected cell zzso of zzso zzso zzso for resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and have observed that the resistance is attributed to decreased influx and increased zzso of the antibiotic, resulting in lowered retention of the drug in the zzso Each resistant zzso shows a characteristic zzso pattern, suggesting that membrane zzso involved differs each zzso We have also found that zzso activity and alkaline zzso activity of plasma membrane are higher in the three resistant zzso than in the parental cell zzso We obtained a number of zzso producing zzso to plasma membrane of an zzso zzso of zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso one was found by zzso tests to react with the zzso cell line, but not significantly with the parental and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells demonstrates two protein bands of 230 K and 20 K zzso which are zzso by the zzso zzso The former seems to be specific to the zzso zzso Based on the results so far zzso the 230 K protein may be related to the drug resistance and may be zzso zzso transplantation zzso The results suggest that isolation of drug-resistant zzso cells is a novel method of finding zzso
