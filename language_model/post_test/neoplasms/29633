While symptomatic zzso zzso adversely impacts survival among cancer patients, the outcome of cancer patients with zzso pulmonary embolism zzso found on routine cancer staging zzso detector zzso zzso zzso scans is zzso 

To determine whether zzso detected on routine staging zzso scans impacts overall survival among cancer zzso 

We performed a matched cohort study of cancer patients diagnosed with zzso on routine staging scans between May 2003 and August zzso Two controls zzso zzso zzso were individually matched by age zzso 5 zzso cancer type and stage for each zzso patient zzso zzso zzso We used Cox's zzso hazard models to compare the mortality between zzso patients and their matched zzso 

The hazard ratio zzso for death among zzso patients was zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Compared with their matched controls, patients with zzso more zzso than the zzso zzso branches had a zzso for death at 6 months of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and an overall zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Survival among zzso patients with isolated zzso zzso zzso was not significantly different than that of matched controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso identified more zzso than the zzso zzso branches has a significant negative impact on survival among cancer zzso
