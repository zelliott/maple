zzso has been shown to promote zzso zzso zzso in zzso making it an important target in cancer zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso is zzso in various zzso and is one of the most potent growth factors for inducing zzso and promoting zzso zzso zzso zzso Likewise, zzso zzso plays major roles in zzso tumor growth and zzso via multiple mechanisms including zzso of host zzso immunity and promotion of tumor cell migration, tumor cell zzso and zzso zzso and zzso We previously demonstrated an association between zzso and zzso in an in zzso model of lung zzso However, little is known about the regulation of zzso by zzso in cervical zzso In this study, we measured the zzso and zzso expressions by zzso in 23 zzso and 20 zzso cervical cancer zzso We then examined the correlations among the expressions and the zzso zzso density zzso and zzso changes to the zzso vessel walls by zzso zzso zzso and electron zzso In addition, we used the zzso cervical cancer cell line to explore the in zzso regulation of zzso by zzso and its zzso zzso using zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso specimens exhibited significantly higher zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso than the zzso zzso Furthermore, there were strong correlations between the levels of zzso expression and the levels of zzso expression and zzso and a significant positive association between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression inhibited zzso zzso expression while zzso and zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso protein level and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso attenuated zzso zzso zzso our data provide evidence for a clinical association between zzso and zzso expressions in cervical zzso zzso and zzso receptors may be involved in the zzso regulation of zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso may be a downstream zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso may diminish zzso by suppressing zzso zzso
