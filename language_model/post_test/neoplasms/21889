Cancer cells that have a large number of zzso zzso zzso islands zzso are known to have zzso island zzso zzso zzso and decreased zzso in replicating zzso zzso has been analyzed as an underlying zzso First we developed a method to analyze the number of errors in replicating zzso zzso patterns in a defined zzso A single cell was expanded into 106 cells, and the number of errors during the culture was measured by counting the zzso from the original zzso zzso It was shown that zzso status of a zzso site was more zzso inherited than zzso status, suggesting that the zzso is constantly exposed to de zzso zzso zzso zzso showed higher zzso than zzso outside promoter zzso We then analyzed error rates in two gastric cancer cell lines without zzso and two with zzso for five promoter zzso Two zzso cell lines showed error rates smaller than zzso errors per site per generation zzso zzso for all the five zzso In contrast, zzso cells showed significantly elevated error rates, mainly due to increased de zzso zzso in three zzso zzso to zzso and zzso cells showed a significantly elevated error rate in one CGI zzso zzso of densely zzso DNA molecules was observed only in zzso and zzso These data demonstrated that some cancer cells have decreased zzso in replicating zzso zzso patterns that zzso zzso
