zzso disease is a major cause of death in patients with chronic zzso pulmonary disease zzso and predicts zzso for acute zzso zzso death and zzso zzso Although beta zzso improve cardiovascular zzso patients with COPD often do not receive them zzso to concerns about possible adverse pulmonary zzso There are no published data about beta blocker use among zzso with COPD zzso A study was undertaken to identify factors associated with beta blocker use in this setting and to determine whether their use is associated with decreased zzso zzso 

zzso data from the University of Alabama Hospital were reviewed and patients admitted between October 1999 and September 2006 with an acute zzso of COPD as a primary diagnosis or as a secondary diagnosis with a primary diagnosis of acute respiratory failure were zzso zzso data, zzso and medication use were recorded and subjects receiving beta zzso were compared with those who did zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed to determine zzso of zzso death after controlling for known zzso and the propensity to receive beta zzso 

825 patients met the inclusion zzso zzso mortality was zzso Those receiving beta zzso zzso zzso zzso were older and more frequently had cardiovascular disease than those who did zzso In zzso analysis adjusting for potential zzso including the propensity score, beta blocker use was associated with reduced mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Age, length of stay, number of prior zzso the presence of respiratory failure, zzso heart failure, cerebrovascular disease or liver disease also predicted zzso mortality zzso 

The use of beta zzso by zzso with zzso of COPD is well tolerated and may be associated with reduced zzso The potential protective effect of beta zzso in this population warrants further zzso
