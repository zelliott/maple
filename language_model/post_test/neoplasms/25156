T cells can reject established zzso when zzso transferred into patients, thereby demonstrating the power of the immune system for cancer zzso However, it has proven difficult to maintain zzso transferred T cells in the long zzso zzso have the potential to induce zzso zzso and memory T zzso However, clinical efficacy of current vaccines is zzso possibly because zzso skew the immune system by means of zzso zzso cells, inflammatory type 2 T cells and regulatory T cells zzso all of which prevent the generation of zzso zzso To improve the clinical efficacy of cancer vaccines in patients with zzso disease, we need to design novel and improved strategies that can boost zzso immunity to cancer, help overcome zzso and allow the breakdown of the zzso zzso zzso This can be achieved by exploiting the fast increasing knowledge about the zzso cell zzso system, including the existence of distinct DC zzso that respond zzso to distinct zzso signals, zzso zzso both contributing to the generation of unique zzso immune zzso We zzso that these novel cancer vaccines will be used as zzso in patients with zzso disease and in combination with drugs targeting zzso pathways in patients with zzso zzso
