Platinum drugs are widely used in zzso therapy and are a cornerstone of the treatment of different solid zzso The pharmacological interest of zzso has led to the design of many zzso to broaden the spectrum of activity, reduce side effects, and overcome zzso Although the zzso zzso was initially identified as the only active one, zzso complexes have shown significant zzso activity in zzso zzso In addition to zzso platinum compounds, zzso platinum complexes have been generated that are zzso by a different mode of interaction with zzso Since a major limitation to the clinical efficacy of platinum compounds is drug resistance, the most important feature of zzso platinum drugs should be the capability of overcoming cellular zzso However, due to the zzso nature of clinical resistance, which also involves pharmacological factors, the zzso of current zzso therapy also includes the development of drug delivery zzso The present review focuses on recent studies on the molecular zzso of zzso cells that are associated with resistance to platinum drugs, the development of novel platinum drugs, and approaches that may contribute to improve the efficacy of zzso zzso
