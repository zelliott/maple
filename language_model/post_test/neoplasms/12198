zzso with zzso zzso zzso cells zzso represents an attractive approach for therapy for cancer and diseases caused by zzso zzso It has been suggested that sufficient stable zzso complexes on the surface of zzso might play an important role in the generation of zzso and zzso immunity in zzso In this study, we observed that zzso peptides that were artificially fused with an zzso zzso zzso retrieval zzso a zzso zzso zzso could be efficiently presented by zzso zzso class I molecules in a zzso and zzso but zzso zzso zzso The zzso retained the capacity to display surface zzso complexes for a prolonged zzso In addition, our results show that vaccination with DC bearing our fusion peptides induced greatly enhanced specific zzso response, and resulted in significant zzso of tumor zzso Thus, the zzso retrieval signal modification can be regarded as a novel method for targeting zzso peptides into the zzso zzso class I presentation pathway, and may improve the clinical utility of vaccines based on synthetic zzso zzso zzso
