Strategies to circumvent different forms of zzso resistance zzso in tumor cells will be zzso The form of zzso associated with zzso of zzso zzso is zzso and its features are briefly zzso Many clinically useful zzso organic bases have been shown to interfere with drug zzso zzso by zzso consequently zzso or overcoming this form of zzso Based on these zzso zzso screening and molecular modeling efforts are being employed to develop new zzso of zzso However, because zzso of normal tissue zzso can cause unacceptable zzso new strategies to circumvent zzso in tumors must be zzso zzso range from zzso modeling to the development of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells expressing altered DNA zzso II express a more restricted form of zzso termed zzso that will be discussed briefly and compared with zzso zzso of zzso are without effect in cells expressing only zzso However, some zzso of zzso appear to act via a zzso zzso zzso and can circumvent this form of zzso Also, zzso in zzso II may have consequences for other cellular functions, as zzso cells appear to have defects in DNA repair zzso suggesting other areas for therapeutic zzso
