zzso zzso libraries of single chain molecules zzso from the variable zzso of zzso light and heavy chains zzso have great promise for new approaches to zzso zzso However, creating and evaluating zzso from diverse sources is time consuming and differences in molecular format can influence in zzso and in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso do not have optimal characteristics for targeting therapy to tumor because of their small size and zzso zzso zzso molecules at least twice the size of zzso are better for zzso because zzso and zzso molecules can be zzso A zzso chain reaction zzso based primer system was created to easily convert zzso genes into a zzso gene format, once they have been placed into zzso zzso a readily available zzso The primer system for this zzso gene platform was developed and tested by constructing an zzso zzso zzso zzso Two mouse zzso libraries were screened for zzso clones using zzso zzso display zzso zzso mouse zzso and zzso zzso genes were combined, zzso into the zzso zzso zzso that zzso these zzso zzso in zzso coli as two mismatched zzso pairs zzso zzso The zzso protein that was zzso from zzso had the expected molecular characteristics when analyzed by sequencing, zzso zzso and Western zzso This modular gene design platform provides methodology for easy and rapid creation of zzso molecules from diverse zzso zzso zzso from various zzso can easily be produced, thereby zzso comparative zzso studies en route to development of new tumor targeting zzso
