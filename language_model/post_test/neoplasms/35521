There is a large body of evidence which suggests that zzso acids increase the risk of colon cancer and act as tumor zzso however, the zzso of zzso acids zzso zzso is not zzso Previously we showed that zzso acid zzso a zzso zzso acid, and zzso acid zzso a putative zzso agent, exhibited distinct biological effects, yet appeared to act on some of the same signaling zzso The present study was carried out to determine whether there is overlap in signaling pathways activated by zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso 

To determine whether there was an overlap in zzso of signaling pathways by zzso and zzso we zzso zzso cells and then isolated cell lines resistant to zzso induced growth zzso These lines were then tested for their response to zzso induced zzso 

We found that a majority of the cell lines resistant to zzso growth arrest were also resistant to zzso zzso zzso an overlap in zzso and zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the cell lines which were the most resistant to zzso zzso also exhibited a greater capacity for zzso independent zzso 

We conclude that zzso and zzso have overlapping signaling activities and that zzso of these pathways can lead to a more advanced zzso zzso
