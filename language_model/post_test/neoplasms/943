Various zzso zzso zzso peptides have been previously investigated for tumor zzso zzso zzso To further develop zzso zzso with enhanced zzso efficacy and improved in zzso zzso we designed a new zzso zzso zzso with two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between the two zzso zzso motifs and one zzso zzso on the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso as a promising agent for zzso imaging of zzso expression in mouse zzso 

zzso was labeled with zzso via zzso zzso zzso prosthetic zzso In zzso and in zzso characteristics of the new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were investigated and compared with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso without two zzso zzso between the two zzso zzso The ability of zzso to image tumor vascular zzso expression was evaluated in a zzso zzso breast tumor zzso 

With the zzso of two zzso zzso between the two zzso zzso zzso showed enhanced zzso zzso zzso increased tumor zzso and zzso background ratios compared with zzso in zzso zzso zzso imaging with zzso revealed high tumor contrast and low background in zzso nude zzso zzso studies confirmed the in zzso zzso zzso specificity of zzso zzso can specifically image zzso zzso on the activated zzso cells of tumor zzso 

zzso can provide important information on zzso expression on the tumor zzso The high zzso binding affinity and zzso excellent zzso properties and zzso stability make the new zzso zzso zzso zzso a promising agent for PET imaging of tumor zzso and for monitoring the efficacy of zzso zzso
