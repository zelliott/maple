zzso and zzso zzso zzso complexes bearing a fluorescent zzso zzso were examined for zzso in normal and tumor zzso The zzso complex exhibits greater zzso in tumor cells compared with normal zzso zzso in cell zzso this complex determines a more pronounced zzso of zzso zzso zzso but it is ineffective towards zzso zzso zzso Both gold and silver complexes lead to zzso of the zzso system, the zzso zzso being particularly zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso 3 zzso was also observed, demonstrating the ability of these compounds to reach the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the zzso distribution of the complexes shows a larger diffusion of these molecules in tumor cells with respect to normal zzso
