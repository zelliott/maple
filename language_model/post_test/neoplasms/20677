The assumption of molecular epidemiology that zzso leave fingerprints has suggested that analysis of the frequency, type, and site of zzso in genes frequently altered in zzso may provide clues to the identification of the factors contributing to zzso In this zzso we revise the development, and validation of the zzso zzso functional zzso as a new tool for molecular zzso We show that this zzso has some very interesting virtues but also has some zzso The zzso functional zzso can be used to determine highly specific zzso fingerprints in the human zzso zzso zzso Discrimination is possible when comparing zzso zzso induced by sufficiently different zzso However, we also reported that the same zzso may induce distinguishable zzso zzso due to known influencing zzso
