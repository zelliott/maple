zzso are involved in the initiation of breast, zzso and other kinds of human zzso In this process, the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso If the zzso are further oxidized to zzso they may react with DNA to form zzso zzso at zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso and generate zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso synthetic zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso is zzso to its zzso which zzso with DNA to form analogous zzso zzso This could be the primary critical event leading to zzso zzso and then initiation of zzso Evidence supporting this hypothesis has been obtained from the human breast and animal models susceptible to zzso tumors, including the Syrian golden zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso and Noble rat zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso and then to zzso is not only a mechanism of tumor initiation for natural and synthetic zzso but also for the zzso zzso In fact, zzso one of the zzso of zzso when oxidized to its zzso zzso with DNA to form zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, a unifying zzso namely formation of zzso zzso and reaction with DNA, could initiate not only cancer by zzso of specific zzso zzso zzso but also leukemia by zzso of zzso
