zzso of the zzso necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso death receptors has been associated with cancer specific zzso execution in a number of model zzso This has generated tremendous interest in the use of TRAIL as a potential therapeutic zzso However, recent evidence indicates that resistance to TRAIL might present with a therapeutic zzso In this short report, we review the basic biology of TRAIL zzso in cancer cells, highlight the mechanisms underlying resistance to TRAIL and the ability of small zzso compounds to zzso cells to zzso zzso In particular, we provide evidence that zzso zzso oxygen species could be critical in regulating the response of cancer cells to zzso
