zzso neurological and zzso response rates after zzso zzso zzso zzso have been observed in patients with zzso zzso zzso from solid zzso However, the potential use of those responses as early zzso of zzso zzso and overall survival zzso is zzso 27 consecutive patients with zzso treated with 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso under compassionate drug use were zzso zzso All patients received zzso treatment every 2 weeks during induction and every 4 weeks during maintenance zzso Neurological and zzso responses were assessed before every zzso zzso zzso Most of the patients were female zzso diagnosed with breast cancer zzso A complete neurological response was seen among 11 % of the zzso partial response in 22 % of the zzso stable disease in 30 % of the patients and progressive disease in 37 % of zzso zzso assessment was available in zzso patients showing a 26 % complete response zzso The median time to neurological and zzso response was 15 days and 14 days, zzso Patients showing a combined neurological and zzso response showed a significantly longer median zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso p zzso zzso compared to those showing both neurological and zzso zzso No grade 4 zzso were zzso According to these preliminary results, early neurological and zzso responses may be further studied as early zzso of zzso and zzso in patients receiving zzso zzso zzso for zzso
