Loss of zzso protein expression has frequently been related to DNA zzso in association with gene zzso Although the zzso status of zzso for zzso involvement in various zzso has been extensively zzso it has been pointed out that some inconsistencies existed in its relationship to gene zzso of zzso In this study, we focused on the expression and zzso status in the regions of zzso zzso to zzso containing a putative zzso box zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso to 26, both in a recently cloned zzso upstream region of rat zzso We showed that rat lung zzso zzso did not express the zzso zzso whereas rat zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso both expressed it at levels similar to normal zzso even though the region of zzso zzso to 26 was zzso in zzso rather than zzso In contrast, the zzso islands near the putative zzso box region were consistently zzso in zzso but not in zzso and zzso as well as in normal zzso Treatment with zzso zzso induced expression of zzso gene in zzso after 48 zzso but no changes were observed in zzso and zzso The results indicated that zzso of zzso islands near a zzso box region played a critical role for gene zzso of the rat zzso zzso rather than that of other zzso
