This article addresses the evidence that zzso zzso or its zzso might mediate tumor formation via a zzso mode of zzso We review and draw conclusions from the published zzso and zzso information for zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The new zzso Environmental Protection Agency proposed Cancer zzso Assessment zzso provide for an assessment of the key events involved in the development of specific zzso zzso with this thinking, we provide a new and general strategy for interpreting zzso data that goes beyond a simple determination that the chemical is or is not zzso For zzso we conclude that the weight of the evidence argues that chemically induced zzso is unlikely to be a key event in the induction of human tumors that might be caused by zzso itself (as the parent zzso and its zzso zzso zzso and zzso This conclusion derives primarily from the fact that these chemicals require very high doses to be zzso There is not enough information to draw any conclusions for zzso and the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso There is some evidence that zzso is a more potent zzso than zzso zzso or zzso Unfortunately, definitive conclusions as to whether zzso will induce tumors in humans via a zzso mode of action cannot be drawn from the available zzso More research, including the development and use of new techniques, is required before it is possible to make a definitive assessment as to whether chemically induced zzso is a key event in any human tumors resulting from exposure to zzso
