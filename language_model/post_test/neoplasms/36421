zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso often presenting as zzso zzso has become the most serious long-term complication of cancer therapy and offers a unique opportunity to study chemical zzso Seven zzso of patients treated for six different types of primary tumor have been followed closely for zzso zzso and 115 consecutive patients with zzso or zzso including 45 cases from the zzso have been investigated zzso at our institutions during the past 16 zzso In patients primarily treated with zzso agents, the risk of zzso and zzso increased by approximately zzso per year from 2 to at least 8 years after start of zzso In most cases, the disease presented as zzso with loss of a whole zzso 5 or 7, or various parts of their long arms, and the zzso were of zzso zzso zzso or zzso In patients treated with drugs targeting at zzso II, such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso combined with drugs reacting directly with DNA, such as zzso or zzso agents, the risk of leukemia increased much more steeply from only one year after start of zzso These early onset cases often presented as overt leukemia of zzso zzso or zzso with balanced zzso to zzso bands zzso and zzso whereas later onset cases often shared characteristics with cases observed after therapy with zzso agents zzso Both zzso of DNA and poisoning of zzso II may result in development of zzso with different clinical and zzso zzso There may be a synergistic zzso effect between the two types of drug, and in patients with germ cell tumors treated with zzso zzso and zzso reassessment suggested the risk of leukemia to increase zzso with increasing doses of zzso and zzso
