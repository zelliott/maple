Recent technological advances allow analysis of zzso changes in cancer in unprecedented zzso The next challenge is to prioritize the multitude of genetic aberrations found and identify therapeutic zzso We recently completed a study that illustrates the use of unbiased genetic screens and zzso cancer models to find therapeutic targets among complex zzso zzso We genetically dissected the common deletion of zzso zzso and identified the zzso zzso A7 zzso as a tumor zzso in zzso zzso zzso encodes a soluble zzso zzso that acts as an zzso tumor zzso zzso we developed an zzso strategy to specifically deliver zzso back to tumors that have lost this zzso Recent sequencing studies have implicated zzso in lung cancer and other tumors, suggesting a broader therapeutic potential for zzso delivery of this tumor zzso for cancer zzso Together, our comprehensive approach provides new insights into cancer biology and may directly lead to the development of new cancer zzso
