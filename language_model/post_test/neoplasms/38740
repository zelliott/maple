zzso zzso zzso are commonly observed in tumor patients, and zzso was recently found to competitively inhibit the membrane transport of zzso We therefore investigated the possibility that elevated plasma zzso levels may damage the immune zzso The experiments in this report demonstrate a link between the individual plasma zzso level and the individual zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso This correlation has been analyzed in 39 zzso zzso patients, 40 zzso cell zzso patients, 24 large cell lung zzso patients, and 31 apparently healthy persons zzso zzso Blood cells from all three groups of tumor patients in comparison with cells from healthy persons produced markedly reduced zzso responses against zzso and all three groups of tumor patients had on average significantly elevated plasma zzso acid zzso Our analysis revealed a linear zzso of the zzso of the individual plasma zzso levels zzso therapeutic zzso on the zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso against zzso for the entire population of zzso persons tested zzso zzso zzso level of significance P less than zzso A statistically significant linear correlation with a similar zzso equation was also observed in the group of the healthy blood donors zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso P less than zzso indicating that this correlation is universal and not dependent on the presence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cultures revealed an inverse correlation between zzso concentration and cell proliferation in response to the zzso zzso and zzso
