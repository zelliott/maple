The zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CA I, II, IX zzso domain zzso zzso and zzso domain plus zzso zzso zzso zzso and XIV were investigated as a function of pH for the CO2 zzso to zzso and a zzso The zzso zzso CA I and II as well as the zzso domain of CA IX, together with the zzso zzso CA zzso and XIV showed zzso pH zzso of zzso with a zzso of zzso showing thus optimal zzso efficiency around pH zzso The full length CA IX had a similar shape of the pH dependency curve but with a zzso of zzso having thus zzso zzso activity at pH values around zzso typical of hypoxic solid tumors in which CA IX is zzso The zzso domain of CA IX zzso only in this zzso zzso may thus act as an intrinsic buffer promoting efficient CO2 zzso at zzso pH values found in hypoxic zzso
