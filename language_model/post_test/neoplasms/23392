Diet energy density zzso is associated with energy intake zzso in cancer zzso There is limited information on the influence of patient characteristics on this association, potentially zzso individual tailoring of dietary treatment in clinical zzso 

We studied the relation between zzso zzso and zzso zzso body weight per zzso using a mixed linear model zzso both overall and individual intercept and slopes with patient characteristics as zzso Age, sex, body mass index zzso tumor type, zzso of survival, weight loss, zzso low muscle mass, low serum zzso zzso zzso strength, and fatigue were entered in the model, and significant effects were retained zzso zzso zzso zzso intake was obtained from 251 food records zzso zzso in a group of zzso zzso care cancer zzso zzso and zzso were calculated for each day including all food and zzso 

Mean zzso was zzso zzso Age, zzso fatigue, and survival were zzso associated and zzso was positively associated with zzso Effect estimates (1 zzso were: zzso zzso for age, zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for fatigue, and zzso zzso for zzso For zzso of survival, the effect was zzso zzso for 1st and zzso zzso for 2nd, as compared to 3rd zzso After adjustment, zzso was still positively associated with zzso with an overall effect of zzso zzso per 1 zzso 

Age, zzso fatigue, survival, and zzso are associated with zzso but do not substantially influence the association between zzso and zzso in zzso care cancer zzso
