The impact of a gene zzso on the population burden of cancer can be measured by the population attributable fraction zzso which depends on the risk zzso by the zzso zzso relative risk zzso the frequency of the zzso in the population and the mode of zzso zzso defines the proportion of the disease in the study population due to a gene zzso hence the zzso term, zzso zzso After a review of the literature, 27 confirmed cancer zzso zzso groups of genes and zzso were selected for analysis on the basis of their prevalence and availability of validated zzso zzso The covered zzso represent the most common established cancer zzso zzso those not included have marginal zzso on common zzso The zzso due to known genes at the covered sites was highest for brain zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso For zzso cancer, the zzso estimates amounted to zzso Including genes and identified zzso from whole zzso scans, zzso for both breast and prostate zzso summed up to zzso The derived estimates should rectify common zzso on the contribution of individual high zzso genes on common zzso at the population zzso More dramatically, the estimates show the large zzso zzso by the recently discovered breast, prostate and zzso cancer zzso most of which are not known to alter coding sequences or expression patterns and they thus act through yet unexplained zzso Although of low risk, these common zzso appear to explain large proportions of breast and prostate zzso in the zzso
