The tumor zzso is a milieu of zzso architectural features that affect tumor growth and zzso zzso zzso size, density, zzso and fiber architecture change dramatically from location to location throughout the tumor zzso While many studies have addressed the effects of two-dimensional zzso zzso structure and composition on cell migration, less is known about how cancer cells navigate complex, zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso Mechanical structures such as zzso and zzso part of the zzso zzso and zzso part of the zzso zzso play a key role in migration and are altered during cancer zzso Recent evidence suggests that these changes in zzso and zzso structures may enable cancer cells to efficiently respond to features such as pore size and zzso to invade and zzso Here we discuss the role of cell mechanics and the zzso in the ability of cells to navigate and respond to zzso zzso features and zzso
