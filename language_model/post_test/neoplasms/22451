After DNA or zzso damage, zzso tumor cells undergo a complex cycle of zzso zzso How this process occurs and more importantly, why, has recently become the focus of several research groups, prompting this review in which we discuss two related phenomena that accompany the zzso zzso of tumor zzso the induction of zzso genes such as zzso and the decrease in zzso instability observed during the zzso from zzso to zzso The zzso zzso likely provides the means through which the balance between increased zzso instability zzso driving genetic variation and decreased zzso necessary for perpetuating these zzso zzso is zzso These concepts are integrated with recent findings that many zzso and zzso genes become activated during zzso zzso and lead us to the hypothesis that tumor cell zzso may be achieved through zzso zzso
