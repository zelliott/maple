This article describes the construction, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso To construct a fusion zzso the gene for each zzso the zzso and the binding zzso is modified separately to contain complementary DNA zzso a 13 zzso acid zzso that separates the zzso from the binding zzso zzso restriction zzso sites for cloning into the zzso are also zzso The modified DNA is combined and fused using the zzso technique of zzso by overlap extension zzso The resulting DNA construct is expressed in inclusion bodies in zzso bacteria that are specifically engineered for the expression of toxic proteins zzso After isolation and zzso of the inclusion bodies, the fusion protein is zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso fusion protein mixture is zzso to zzso by two zzso zzso The first column, a zzso zzso or a zzso zzso column, eliminates the majority of zzso proteins while the second column, an affinity column zzso zzso results in the final zzso of the zzso fusion zzso
