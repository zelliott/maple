To study outcome and its zzso factors in cancer patients admitted to the zzso with septic zzso and the implications of zzso as a risk factor in this advanced stage of systemic inflammatory zzso 

A prospective consecutive zzso cohort study was conducted in 73 adults with cancer and septic shock admitted to the zzso at the Cancer Medical Center associated with the University of zzso zzso 

The mortality rate from septic shock was zzso zzso zzso to zzso The mean Acute zzso and zzso Health zzso zzso II score on admission, the mean number of organ zzso on admission or during the zzso stay, liver dysfunction, respiratory dysfunction, and the need for mechanical ventilation were zzso of mortality in a zzso zzso zzso was not associated with a worse prognosis in terms of mortality zzso or mean days of zzso stay zzso zzso in comparison with zzso patients zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso model only the need for mechanical ventilation and liver dysfunction remained independent zzso of zzso 

zzso shock among cancer patients admitted to the zzso has a mortality rate similar to that reported for mixed zzso and it is particularly increased when zzso or respiratory dysfunction zzso zzso on admission does not seem to modify zzso
