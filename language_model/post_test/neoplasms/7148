zzso zzso cells zzso promote tumor zzso The mechanisms of zzso development during tumor growth remain zzso zzso zzso zzso have been implicated to play a role in immune regulation, however the role of zzso in the induction of zzso is zzso Our previous work demonstrated that zzso isolated from tumor cells are taken up by bone zzso zzso zzso Here, we extend those findings showing that zzso isolated from zzso switch the differentiation zzso of these zzso cells to the zzso zzso zzso The resulting cells exhibit zzso zzso and functional characteristics including promotion of tumor zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that in zzso zzso zzso promotion of tumor progression is dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso can induce the zzso of zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso against zzso zzso and zzso block the activity of these zzso on zzso induction and therefore zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are enriched in zzso when compared with zzso isolated from the zzso of cultured tumor cells zzso The tumor zzso has an effect on the potency of zzso zzso induction of zzso by regulating the sorting and the amount of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Together, these findings lend themselves to developing specific zzso therapeutic strategies to reduce or eliminate zzso zzso and hence enhance host zzso zzso zzso
