By interfering with signal zzso events that control cell proliferation and fate, zzso zzso zzso hold promise as zzso zzso Nevertheless, the functional role of a zzso depends on the cellular context and hence zzso zzso in zzso cells could lead to side zzso For instance, this context dependence renders many zzso potentially cardiotoxic since zzso of primary cancer targets such as zzso zzso or zzso recruits zzso pathways in zzso zzso by these zzso we propose a mode of zzso zzso where one drug (the editor) suppresses the side effect promoted by the primary drug as it impacts zzso zzso Editor and primary drug have overlapping therapeutic impact, and the editor suppresses the downstream propagation of zzso zzso
