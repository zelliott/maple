zzso T cell therapy, or T cell zzso zzso gene therapy, is a promising zzso for infectious diseases and zzso However, a suitable rapid and direct screening system for zzso zzso is not zzso Here, we report an efficient cloning and functional evaluation system to determine the zzso specificity of zzso zzso derived from single zzso human T cells within 10 zzso Using this system, we cloned and analyzed 380 zzso zzso zzso from ten healthy donors with zzso zzso virus infection and assessed the activity of zzso T zzso zzso carrying these zzso against zzso zzso target zzso We also used this system to clone tumor zzso zzso from zzso patients with zzso We obtained 210 zzso zzso zzso and demonstrated the zzso activity of zzso carrying these zzso against zzso zzso This system may provide a fast and powerful approach for zzso gene therapy for infectious diseases and zzso
