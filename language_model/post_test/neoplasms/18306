Aging is a complex process that has been shown to be linked to zzso of DNA zzso zzso zzso represents a zzso mechanism leading to DNA damage zzso and zzso of DNA damage checkpoints in aging zzso zzso of DNA damage checkpoints in response to zzso dysfunction results in induction of cellular zzso permanent cell cycle zzso zzso represents a tumor zzso mechanism protecting cells from evolution of zzso instability and zzso As a zzso zzso zzso may also limit tissue renewal and zzso capacity of zzso in response to aging and chronic zzso In aged zzso zzso zzso may also increase the cancer risk by initiation of zzso instability, loss of zzso competition of aging stem cells, and selection of zzso growing zzso zzso aged individuals are more susceptible and vulnerable to various diseases and show an increased cancer zzso Recently, proteins were discovered, which are induced by zzso dysfunction and DNA zzso It was shown that these proteins represent new zzso of human aging and zzso Here, we review the scientific background and experimental data on these newly discovered zzso
