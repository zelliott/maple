Resistance to cancer zzso treatment is a common phenomenon, especially in progressive zzso The generation of cellular models of drug resistance has been pivotal in zzso the main zzso of resistance to traditional chemotherapy at the molecular level zzso zzso drug zzso detoxifying systems, defects in DNA repair, zzso zzso membrane zzso and cell zzso The development of targeted therapies has also been followed by resistance, reminiscent of an evolutionary arms race, as exemplified by zzso and other zzso zzso for the treatment of chronic zzso zzso Although traditionally associated with the last stages of the disease, recent findings with minimally transformed zzso primary human cells indicate that the ability to generate drug resistance arises early during the zzso process, before the full zzso Novel technologies, such as zzso zzso have in certain cases predicted the outcome of chemotherapy and undoubtedly have tremendous potential for the zzso In addition, the novel cancer stem cell paradigm raises the prospect of zzso therapies instead of treatment directed against the whole zzso
