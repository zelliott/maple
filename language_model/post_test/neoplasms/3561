zzso zzso deletion is frequent in human tumors, suggesting the presence of at least one tumor zzso gene within this zzso While zzso analyses of local genes revealed only rare zzso we have previously described a zzso gain of zzso that leads to loss of expression of genes located on the maternal zzso zzso in human zzso Loss of expression was often associated with loss of zzso zzso at the zzso zzso Here, we show that loss of the maternal zzso zzso is common, ranging from 30 to zzso to a variety of adult zzso including liver, breast, cervical and gastric zzso We found that other zzso zzso were zzso zzso indicating that loss of zzso zzso occurred in the context of a common mechanism affecting the zzso of a large zzso zzso zzso These zzso abnormalities were not detected in any normal zzso zzso zzso it seems possible that, contrary to the repression of promoter activity caused by zzso loss of gene expression at zzso may result from the zzso by zzso of one or more negative regulatory zzso
