Cell death is as important as cell division in both zzso and pathological zzso Three major types of cell death have been zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a form of programmed cell death, zzso by zzso zzso is an zzso zzso process involving zzso implicated in both cell survival and zzso zzso is believed to be an zzso process, followed by release of zzso zzso The zzso intermediate filament zzso 18 zzso has different fates depending on the type of cell zzso During zzso zzso is zzso at two sites into three fragments, one of which is specifically recognized by the zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso is reported to stay zzso zzso cells are considered to release zzso Thus, serum levels of different forms of zzso would reflect the type of cell death occurring in the zzso Two zzso zzso zzso have been developed: one for the zzso fragments of zzso and the other for total zzso zzso of serum levels of zzso and total zzso showed that the ratios between zzso and total zzso were highly variable among patients with zzso zzso Monitoring serum levels of zzso and total zzso during chemotherapy showed an association between increases in total zzso levels and clinical zzso Monitoring serum levels of zzso may be a promising approach for early detection of therapeutic effects and the levels of different forms of zzso might indicate the mode of cell death occurring in the zzso
