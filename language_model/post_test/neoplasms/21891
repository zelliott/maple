It is not surprising that cancer, a kind of zzso of development, hijacks DNA zzso which is necessary for normal zzso zzso Both decreases and increases in DNA zzso are a frequent characteristic of a wide variety of zzso There is often more zzso than zzso of DNA during zzso leading to a net decrease in the zzso zzso zzso Although the exact zzso changes between different zzso of the same type are not the same, there are cancer zzso differences in the frequency of zzso or zzso of certain zzso zzso These opposite types of DNA zzso changes appear to be mostly independent of one another, although they may arise because of a similar zzso leading to long-lasting zzso instability in zzso Both tandem and zzso DNA repeats often exhibit zzso zzso However, one of these repeated sequences zzso displayed zzso increases in zzso in some zzso zzso and zzso tumors and decreases in zzso Furthermore, decreases and increases in zzso zzso can be zzso within a small zzso of the zzso repeat unit of these tandem zzso While the zzso role of DNA zzso at promoters of many zzso genes is clear, the biological effects of zzso zzso of zzso DNA are less well zzso Evidence suggests that DNA zzso functions in direct or indirect control of zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Recent studies of zzso DNA zzso indicate that changes to DNA zzso during zzso and tumor progression have a previously underestimated plasticity and dynamic zzso
