zzso engine exhaust includes zzso particles with a large surface area and containing absorbed zzso aromatic zzso transition metals and other zzso zzso particles and soluble chemicals can be transported from the airways to other zzso such as the liver, zzso and zzso Our aim was to investigate whether air pollution from traffic is associated with risk for other zzso than lung zzso 

We followed up zzso participants in the Danish Diet Cancer and Health cohort for 20 selected zzso in the Danish Cancer zzso from zzso in zzso until 2006, and traced their residential addresses from 1971 zzso in the Central zzso zzso We used modeled concentration of nitrogen zzso zzso and amount of traffic at the residence as indicators of zzso air pollution and used Cox models to estimate zzso rate ratios zzso after adjustment for potential zzso 

zzso at the residence was significantly associated with risks for cervical cancer zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso per 100 zzso zzso and brain cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per 100 zzso zzso 

This zzso study indicates that zzso air pollution might increase the risks for cervical and brain cancer, which should be tested in future zzso
