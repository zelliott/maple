The gene coding for the human zzso zzso surface zzso maps to the zzso region, which is in the vicinity of a region commonly affected by multiple zzso zzso in human zzso The zzso region of the human zzso gene includes an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of potential utility as a marker for zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to investigate the value of the zzso zzso as a marker for instability in different tumor types, particularly in zzso leukemia and zzso 

The zzso zzso and a panel of 10 zzso markers were analyzed by using a zzso chain reaction zzso method and zzso sequencing zzso This was done in several zzso and zzso cell lines, as well as in 28 cases of zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso 19 mantle cell zzso zzso and 45 head and neck zzso zzso 

The frequency of zzso zzso abnormalities found among zzso was similar to that reported for other well known zzso markers at zzso near known and suspected cancer zzso However, instability at the zzso zzso was the most frequent zzso zzso among zzso and zzso 

The inclusion of zzso markers at zzso zzso may be especially zzso for zzso instability analyses of certain zzso zzso and zzso
