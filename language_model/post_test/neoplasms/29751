The distribution of zzso receptors zzso has been studied in a range of normal and zzso zzso using four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In normal zzso zzso was found in a limited number of sites, notably zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso This restricted pattern of distribution may be relevant to the characteristic pattern of iron deposition in primary zzso In contrast to this limited pattern of expression in normal zzso the zzso was widely distributed in zzso zzso and in samples from cases of Hodgkin's zzso This zzso expression of the zzso may play a role in the zzso of advanced zzso by competing with the bone zzso for serum zzso
