zzso five-year relative survival rates were calculated for patients diagnosed during zzso to examine long-term survival patterns for some of the more frequently occurring zzso The data on the patients studied were collected as part of the national cancer institute's End zzso zzso Breast cancer patients with localized disease were found to have only slightly increasing conditional rates for 20 years subsequent to diagnosis beginning at zzso at diagnosis and exceeding zzso at 20 years subsequent to zzso zzso five-year rates for patients with distant involvement approached the conditional rates for patients with regional involvement 15 years after zzso zzso rates by stage for patients with cancer of the zzso or cancer of the corpus increased initially and then became somewhat constant at a level related to stage of disease at zzso For cancer of the zzso the conditional rates for female patients in each stage of disease category approached the same value zzso years subsequent to zzso These observations may provide additional insight into the biological behavior of these zzso
