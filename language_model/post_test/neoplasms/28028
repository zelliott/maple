The mouse zzso beta gene encodes an integral membrane zzso that is expressed in a zzso manner in embryonic and adult zzso cells, and in zzso zzso The zzso beta zzso in the zzso kidney and zzso cells is zzso whereas the zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso is zzso The work zzso was initiated to explore the molecular mechanism responsible for the different zzso Overlapping fragments containing the zzso gene were obtained from a zzso artificial zzso clone using zzso chain zzso The gene spans approximately zzso and consists of 18 zzso and 17 zzso The first three zzso are unique to the zzso end of zzso zzso the next two zzso zzso to the zzso end of beta zzso The rest of the zzso (13 total) zzso the regions common to both beta and zzso zzso In conjunction with the zzso zzso the gene structure establishes that alternative zzso of zzso zzso is responsible for the generation of the zzso zzso The DNA regions between zzso and zzso zzso and upstream of the first zzso zzso have been completely zzso to identify potential regulatory elements for beta and zzso zzso There is significant zzso between the two regions, indicating that a zzso event occurred during evolution of the zzso zzso Potential promoter elements and zzso zzso sites were identified from comparisons to sequences in the zzso This is the first gene structure that has been completed for zzso zzso from all zzso The work zzso molecular mechanisms that regulate differential expression of the zzso zzso
