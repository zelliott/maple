A zzso zzso which is composed of zzso zzso as a contrast agent for the liver tumor imaging was examined using the near infrared zzso zzso optical imaging zzso zzso labeled with zzso green zzso showed a high escape ability from the zzso system zzso zzso was found to be stable in a blood zzso and gradually accumulated specifically at a model liver tumor site, which was obtained by graft of zzso cells at a mouse zzso The high zzso imaging ratio is due to the enhanced zzso and retention zzso effect of zzso The zzso intensity at the tumor site was correlated with the degree of zzso zzso imaging using zzso as a zzso is therefore a potential candidate for a facile and general tumor imaging zzso
