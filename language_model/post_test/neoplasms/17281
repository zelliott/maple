In the past century, there have been many attempts to treat cancer with low levels of electric and magnetic zzso We have developed zzso zzso examination devices and techniques and discovered that patients with the same tumor type exhibit zzso responses to the same, precise zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso zzso electromagnetic fields zzso which are zzso at zzso zzso results in long-term objective responses in patients with cancer and is not associated with any significant adverse zzso zzso administration allows for therapeutic delivery of very low and safe levels of zzso throughout the body as exemplified by responses observed in the zzso liver, adrenal zzso and zzso In zzso studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso identified in patients with various forms of cancer are capable of blocking the growth of tumor cells in a zzso and zzso zzso Current experimental evidence suggests that zzso zzso zzso regulate the expression of genes involved in migration and invasion and disrupt the zzso zzso This novel targeted treatment approach is emerging as an appealing therapeutic option for patients with advanced cancer given its excellent zzso zzso of the molecular mechanisms accounting for the zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso is likely to lead to the discovery of novel pathways in zzso
