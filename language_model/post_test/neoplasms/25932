zzso mice generated by gene targeting exhibited several of the zzso characteristic of zzso mice, including zzso instability, increased radiation zzso and a low frequency of zzso zzso instability was exemplified by zzso zzso zzso gene amplification and zzso amplification, and was accompanied by abnormalities in zzso zzso and growth zzso zzso segregation of zzso due to multiple zzso poles during zzso occurred in several zzso zzso cell lineages and may contribute to the zzso Our results indicate that zzso is one component of the zzso zzso that contributes to the maintenance of zzso zzso
