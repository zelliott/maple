Attempts to prepare zzso zzso as novel zzso revealed that some zzso were unstable under zzso reaction zzso zzso zzso reactions were used to prepare zzso compounds as potential zzso zzso zzso zzso prepared from zzso were reacted with zzso to provide the target compounds with zzso side chains in good zzso The approach supplies a useful general route to structurally diverse zzso compounds possessing a variety of side zzso zzso zzso reactions were used also to prepare a zzso zzso These novel compounds were evaluated in binding zzso and a high affinity zzso zzso was zzso Crystal structures obtained for two key precursors aided the interpretation of binding zzso
