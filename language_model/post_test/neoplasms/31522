zzso fat is an important zzso for the growth and development of all zzso In addition to its role as an energy source and its effects on membrane zzso zzso dietary fat has profound effects on gene zzso leading to changes in zzso growth, and cell zzso The effects of dietary fat on gene expression reflect an zzso response to changes in the quantity and type of fat zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso factors have been identified in bacteria, zzso and zzso In zzso these factors include zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B, and zzso These factors are regulated by zzso direct binding of fatty zzso fatty zzso A, or oxidized fatty zzso zzso oxidized fatty acid zzso regulation of zzso cell surface receptors and zzso of signaling zzso targeting the zzso or zzso oxidized fatty acid regulation of zzso calcium levels, which affect cell signaling zzso targeting the zzso At the cellular level, the zzso response to fatty acids will depend on zzso the zzso chemistry, and duration of the fat zzso zzso zzso fatty acid metabolism zzso zzso zzso and competing zzso zzso cellular abundance of specific nuclear and membrane zzso and zzso involvement of specific zzso factors in gene zzso These mechanisms are involved in the control of zzso and zzso zzso cell differentiation and growth, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The effects of fatty acids on the zzso provide new insight into how dietary fat might play a role in health and zzso
