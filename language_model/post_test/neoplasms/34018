The human zzso contains a unique class of zzso referred to as AT islands, which consist typically of zzso zzso long tracts of up to zzso zzso zzso The significance of AT islands as potential targets for zzso intervention stems from two main zzso First, AT islands are inherently unstable zzso zzso that are found in various known zzso of zzso instability, such as zzso fragile zzso Second, AT islands are involved in the organization of the zzso DNA on the nuclear zzso by acting as zzso attachment regions, zzso DNA duplexes of AT islands are unusually flexible and prone to base zzso which are crucial zzso zzso Various AT islands show high binding affinity for isolated nuclear zzso and associate with the nuclear zzso in the zzso The cellular zzso function of AT islands may differ in cancer and normal zzso The zzso expanded AT islands in the zzso fragile site in zzso zzso cells act as strong, permanent zzso while their zzso counterparts in normal cells are loop zzso Given their instability and involvement in the zzso of the nuclear architecture, AT islands may be a factor in zzso zzso AT islands are zzso targeted by the extremely potent zzso zzso drugs, zzso and zzso High zzso of zzso in AT islands is consistent with the critical role of zzso zzso in DNA zzso The abnormal zzso of AT islands, such as their expansion and acquired strong zzso properties, may sensitize cancer cells to AT island targeting zzso
