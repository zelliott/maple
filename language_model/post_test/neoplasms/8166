The completion of zzso sequencing of various model organisms and the recent explosion of new technologies in the field of zzso zzso and zzso is poised to revolutionize the way scientists identify and characterize gene zzso One of the most significant advances in recent years has been the application of zzso interference zzso as a means of zzso gene zzso In the zzso era, advances in the field of cancer biology will rely upon the rapid identification and characterization of genes that regulate cell growth, zzso and zzso zzso efforts are being directed towards cancer therapy and devising efficient means of selectively delivering drugs to zzso zzso In this review, we discuss the promise of zzso zzso zzso screens with zzso approaches and zzso chemical genetic screens, towards improving our ability to understand and treat zzso
