zzso is an zzso widely prescribed to cancer patients for pain zzso However, the zzso of zzso has not been sufficiently zzso Therefore the aim of this work was to study population zzso of zzso in patients with cancer zzso The authors analyzed 108 serum zzso samples of 33 individuals with zzso zzso model zzso zzso zzso was calculated using the zzso model of zzso volume of distribution, zzso zzso constant rate, and lag zzso An exponential error model was used to determine zzso zzso and a relative error model was applied to assess residual zzso zzso zzso of zzso at the end point were as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + (2 - zzso zzso zzso A zzso 0, B zzso 1, C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso F zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and residual zzso was zzso As the total clearance in patients with liver dysfunction zzso class zzso was reduced to zzso serum concentration of zzso increased by zzso zzso it became clear that dose adjustments are essential when treating patients with liver zzso These findings suggest that population parameters are useful for evaluating zzso of zzso in patients with cancer zzso
