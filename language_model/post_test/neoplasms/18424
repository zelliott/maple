The tumor zzso gene zzso is known to be a key regulator in cancer, and more than half of human zzso exhibit zzso in this zzso Recent evidence shows that point zzso in zzso not only disrupt its function but also possess zzso and zzso effects on zzso copies, thus making the zzso gene an zzso zzso this brings about the possibility that zzso zzso may be under selection for increasing the overall translation efficiency zzso of defected zzso in zzso zzso Here, we perform the first large-scale analysis of TE in human cancer zzso zzso zzso identifying a significant increase in TE that is correlated with the frequency of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso with a known zzso effect significantly increase their TE compared with the other zzso zzso Further analysis shows that TE may have influence both on selecting the location of the zzso and on its zzso zzso with lower TE show stronger selection toward zzso zzso and, for each zzso frequent zzso show stronger increase in TE compared with less frequent zzso Additionally, we find that zzso zzso have significantly higher TE increase in progressive versus primary zzso Finally, an analysis of zzso zzso cell lines points to a zzso between the zzso and the zzso pool, increasing the overall zzso zzso Taken together, these results show that TE plays an important role in the selection of zzso zzso zzso
