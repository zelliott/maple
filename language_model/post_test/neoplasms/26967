The majority of chronic diseases, most notably those accompanying aging, result from progressive deterioration of central zzso control, often referred to as zzso zzso This is as true of cancer as it is of the development of zzso zzso and neurodegenerative disease, in all of these zzso surveillance break downs, leading to an unraveling of the zzso process that zzso proliferation of zzso and zzso cells already existing in the zzso The onset of cancer is anticipated by changes in the zzso coordination resulting in chronic quantitative zzso in the synthesis and release of hormones and the loss of the natural zzso of that release, which occurs according to zzso rhythms in the healthy zzso principally under the control of the zzso zzso zzso zzso hormonal release is the source of immune system regulation, thus altering hormone rhythms zzso the immune system's ability to maintain control over emerging tumor cells, not necessarily to eliminate them, but to inhibit zzso zzso then, is the result of suppression of or interference with the regular release of hormones that maintain strict regulation of the zzso immune system's maturation and zzso This understanding means that we can act to prevent cancer by means of efficiently monitoring and maintenance of zzso hormonal zzso For the zzso synthesis of zzso that are zzso a means of zzso bone zzso transplantation is proposed as an alternative therapeutic zzso
