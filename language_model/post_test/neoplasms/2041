Recent progress in biotechnology has uncovered the presence of trace substances which participate in the zzso response between cancer and host; They are zzso zzso zzso and zzso agents produced by zzso cells which are called zzso zzso cells and zzso of cancer zzso Recent genetic engineering enables mass production of these zzso and their clinical application in treating human zzso is expected to take place in the near zzso In this paper, the recent trend of cancer treatment, using various zzso are briefly introduced, namely zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor and colony stimulating zzso Although zzso is effective for the zzso of zzso intravenous injection of zzso is not so effective for treatment of zzso On the other hand, zzso killer cells zzso zzso are potent zzso of adoptive zzso in advanced cancer zzso The clinical study was conducted in 25 patients with advanced zzso zzso efficacy was obtained in patients for whom local transfer was undertaken rather than systemic zzso zzso necrosis factor, a zzso derived from zzso shows much promise for application in cancer therapy because of its marked zzso effects and its high specificity to zzso Clinical study was performed on leukemia patients who showed marked decreases of percentage of zzso cells in peripheral zzso Moreover, local injection of zzso was very effective for the decrease of tumor size in patients with zzso and subcutaneous zzso In addition, to clinical results using zzso and zzso are zzso
