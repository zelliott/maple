The objective of this study was to determine the optimal scan delay time after zzso zzso enhancement using a zzso zzso row zzso CT zzso zzso Two hundred zzso consecutive patients underwent zzso CT scans using a zzso zzso In group A zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso phase scans zzso and zzso were obtained at 40 and 60 seconds, after zzso threshold time zzso in the abdominal zzso In group B zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso scans were obtained 50 and 70 seconds after zzso Both groups were divided into zzso that were given different contrast zzso Groups A1 and B1 received a contrast medium of 300 zzso groups zzso and B2 received a contrast medium of 370 zzso Each patient was injected with contrast medium at a dose of 2 zzso at a rate adjusted to the patient's body weight with a constant injection duration of 47 zzso The zzso values zzso for the liver, portal zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The average zzso was compared between the zzso zzso enhancement in the images obtained at 50 and 60 seconds after zzso was greater zzso zzso zzso than in images obtained at 40 and 70 zzso These results were obtained with both contrast zzso A few patients showed greater enhancement at a 40 seconds or 70 zzso zzso enhancement was significantly greater in all scans using a contrast medium dose of 370 zzso compared with the zzso dose zzso zzso zzso Independent of the concentration of contrast zzso scan delays of 50 to 60 seconds after zzso may provide optimal zzso zzso
