zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso account for many, but not all, zzso breast and zzso cancer zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso may function as a zzso zzso gene because it is sometimes zzso zzso in breast, zzso gastric and pancreatic zzso and is located on a region of zzso 22 that frequently zzso loss of zzso in many cancer zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso in zzso may account for some breast cancer families that include cases of zzso pancreatic and/or zzso zzso 

We screened the entire coding region of zzso for zzso in the youngest affected members of 23 zzso breast cancer families with at least one confirmed case of zzso pancreatic and/or zzso zzso These families were zzso in Australia through the Kathleen zzso Foundation zzso for Research into zzso Breast zzso 

zzso zzso analysis identified a zzso zzso at zzso zzso specifically a zzso to zzso zzso to zzso zzso in two zzso This conservative zzso acid change was not within any known functional zzso of zzso The frequency of the zzso zzso did not differ significantly between a series of 352 breast cancer patients zzso and 254 control individuals zzso P zzso zzso 

The present study does not support a major role for zzso zzso in breast and zzso cancer families with a history of zzso pancreatic and/or zzso zzso
