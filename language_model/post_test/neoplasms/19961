zzso exhibit numerous zzso zzso such as copy number variations, structural variations and sequence zzso It is difficult to determine whether a specific constellation of zzso observed across a cohort of multiple tumors provides statistically significant evidence that the zzso target a set of genes that may be located across different zzso but yet are all involved in a single specific biological process or zzso 

We introduce the zzso random zzso zzso statistical model and analysis method that evaluates the statistical significance of the abundance of zzso zzso that overlap a specific locus or a zzso set of biologically related zzso The zzso model retains certain biologically important properties of zzso zzso that are ignored by other zzso In a simulation study and two example analyses of leukemia zzso zzso data, zzso more effectively identified important zzso as significant than did three methods based on a zzso zzso zzso also identified biologically relevant pathways with a significant abundance of zzso in both zzso 

An R package will be freely available at zzso and zzso
