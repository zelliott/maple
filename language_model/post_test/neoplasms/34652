To examine associations between area and individual zzso characteristics and premature cancer mortality using zzso zzso 

We modeled cancer mortality among zzso men and women zzso zzso zzso between 1998 and 2000 in zzso zzso characteristics of zzso Local Areas zzso zzso zzso were measured using an Index of Relative zzso zzso zzso and individual zzso position was measured by occupation zzso white and blue zzso 

After adjustment for zzso variation in age and occupation, the probability of premature cancer mortality was highest in the most disadvantaged areas for zzso mortality for men zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and women zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for lung cancer mortality for men zzso zzso zzso zzso and women zzso zzso zzso zzso Men in blue zzso zzso had a higher rate of cancer mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and lung cancer mortality zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso whereas men in white zzso zzso had a lower zzso mortality rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Compared with professionals, women in white zzso zzso had an zzso mortality rate that was lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When deaths from breast cancer were zzso women in blue zzso zzso had a significantly higher zzso mortality rate than professionals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Area disadvantage and individual zzso position were independently associated with premature cancer zzso suggesting that interventions to reduce zzso should focus on places and zzso
