The immune system, which is able to distinguish between self and zzso is programmed to protect the zzso from a huge spectrum of potential foreign zzso Each T and B zzso bears an zzso zzso of a single zzso which is determined during development by a unique genetic mechanism that generates millions of different zzso of the genes zzso the zzso zzso When a particular zzso such as a virus, is encountered, only those zzso bearing the relevant receptors become activated and undergo massive zzso zzso The expanded zzso B cells produce zzso which neutralize free virus in the zzso whereas the T cells, particularly the so-called zzso T cells, actually kill cells that are infected with the zzso Once the infection is zzso most of the expanded T cells undergo zzso leaving a small number of memory cells to await future possible encounters with the same zzso During zzso both zzso and acute viral infections lead to increased morbidity and zzso based, in large part, on the diminished ability of T cells to control the zzso To investigate the underlying mechanism of the T cell zzso we have analyzed the process of zzso zzso in human T zzso Our research has shown that following repeated stimulation with zzso in cell culture, the responding T cells eventually reach an irreversible state of cell cycle arrest, at which time they show loss of gene expression of a key T zzso signaling zzso required for zzso as well as reduced stress protein production, zzso resistance, shortened zzso and inability to zzso zzso Increased proportions of T cells with identical zzso are present in elderly individuals, suggesting that zzso stimulation of some T cells may lead to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of this process may yield novel strategies to augment immune function in the zzso
