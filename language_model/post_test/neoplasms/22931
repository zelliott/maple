zzso and zzso odds ratios for various zzso based on zzso data from zzso and mortality data from zzso for western Washington State, were calculated in relation to three measures of exposure to zzso in community water zzso Six odds ratios were calculated for each zzso that occurred in sufficient numbers in each zzso About half of the 332 odds ratios calculated were above unity and half were below unity, and no more of them differed significantly from unity at the zzso level than would be expected by zzso zzso ratios for tumors of the small zzso were consistently elevated in both zzso as were those for zzso of the zzso eye, zzso and prostate in zzso however, odds ratios for brain tumors and leukemia were consistently less than one in both zzso Chance is the most likely explanation for these zzso zzso of this study and prior studies of cancer in relation to zzso zzso are inconsistent, and provide little evidence that zzso in community water supplies has altered the risk of any zzso However, all investigations conducted to date are zzso studies which have an inherently higher probability of failing to detect actual increased risks associated with zzso zzso and additional studies of individual zzso are zzso zzso of the zzso and small zzso should be included in such zzso
