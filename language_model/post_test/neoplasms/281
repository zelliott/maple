Computer technology has acquired an important role in structuring a variety of biological zzso The availability of modern powerful computers has zzso the development of good and accurate models of biological zzso Biological systems, such as the immune response against cancer, are complex and it is difficult to zzso control all the interacting elements zzso the immune response of a host to zzso Complex zzso do not always behave or act as expected during experimental zzso In these cases computer models can be helpful in understanding the behavior of such complex zzso The purpose of this review is to consider the use of mathematical models to study the immune response against zzso The logic and design of some zzso models relevant for tumor zzso will be zzso Special attention is given to the zzso of a model based upon a new hypothesis of tumor rejection presented by De zzso et zzso zzso Technical details concerning the mathematical aspects, differential zzso details on hardware and software package zzso are not included in this zzso These details are contained to in the original zzso
