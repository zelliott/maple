zzso of higher organisms can commit suicide in response to zzso zzso a process called programmed cell zzso Although it is commonly thought that the loss of programmed cell death is required for zzso we argue that the situation is more complex and that the loss of programmed cell death can have the converse effect, preventing cancer zzso If the death rate of cancer cells is low, fewer cell divisions are required for the tumor to reach a certain size, resulting in the presence of fewer zzso zzso zzso the chances of overcoming potential selective barriers are reduced, rendering the failure of zzso progression zzso However, if there is a higher cell death rate, more cell divisions need to occur for the tumor to reach a certain size, resulting in the presence of more zzso cells and in an increased probability of overcoming selective barriers and cancer zzso
