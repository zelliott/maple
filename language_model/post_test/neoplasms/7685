The development of zzso zzso against zzso associated zzso with human tumors has zzso interest in the use of zzso as zzso targeting agents for cancer zzso There are now many reports of the construction of zzso of drugs and toxins with zzso which have in zzso toxic properties directed by the zzso zzso Only recently, however, have limitations to the in zzso therapeutic application of these zzso become zzso These include limited levels of zzso accumulating in tumor deposits in patients, sometimes marked differences in the zzso of zzso zzso from those seen with free zzso limited penetration of zzso and zzso zzso into tumor tissue together with zzso of zzso expression within zzso and limitation to the zzso of zzso caused by the low drug to zzso zzso ratios possible without zzso It is now becoming appreciated that effective development of this approach will require more than chemical zzso of existing or even novel drugs or toxins to zzso so that they are zzso in zzso Additional strategies will probably have to be zzso including the use of intermediate carriers to increase drug to zzso ratios in zzso the production of zzso without extreme overall charge or zzso changes, techniques to increase zzso zzso into tumors by, for example, regional zzso blood flow enhancement, or increase in zzso zzso or the use of zzso containing zzso of zzso or fragments directed against different zzso zzso
