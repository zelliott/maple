Although extensive data indicate that the tumor zzso zzso zzso the radiation responses of human and zzso cells, the exact relationship between zzso and radiation responsiveness remains zzso To zzso the relevance of zzso zzso zzso status to zzso in a zzso manner, different cells of 10 human tumor cell lines with different zzso of origin were examined for zzso zzso The zzso status was compared with zzso cell survival parameters zzso zzso zzso and with the mode of cell zzso Different modes of cell death were examined by measuring zzso zzso zzso and abnormal zzso zzso of the zzso gene were detected in eight cell zzso No zzso zzso was zzso Five cell lines showed zzso 68 zzso zzso 72 zzso were found in four cell zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in only two of 10 cell zzso Although the cells differed widely in survival parameters zzso zzso zzso and modes of cell death zzso zzso after zzso significant zzso correlations were obtained between the multiple cell death zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, cells with a zzso zzso gene were more resistant to X rays than cells with a zzso zzso gene or cells that were zzso The zzso within zzso zzso of the zzso correlated with a enhanced zzso For the first time, we demonstrated a correlation between zzso genetic zzso within zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cell survival and cell zzso This indicates a new molecular relevance of zzso status to intrinsic cellular zzso
