The zzso family of nuclear zzso contains three zzso members, zzso zzso and zzso These genes zzso related but distinct nuclear proteins that can contribute to zzso conversion both in zzso and in zzso However, each gene displays a unique zzso pattern in spontaneously arising tumors, a pattern that partially reflects the unique expression pattern of each gene during normal zzso Although the specific function of zzso family genes has not been determined, changes in zzso gene expression accompany in zzso exposure to growth and differentiation zzso suggesting an important role in these cellular zzso In addition, the zzso shared among zzso genes and two groups of DNA zzso zzso regulatory proteins suggests a role in regulating gene zzso This review describes the similar and unique properties of individual members of the zzso gene family with respect to their expression and potential role during normal development and in the zzso conversion zzso
