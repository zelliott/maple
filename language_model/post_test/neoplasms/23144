Strategies for delivering radiation to a moving zzso each require a margin to compensate for uncertainties in zzso These motion margins have been determined here by separating the total uncertainty into zzso zzso density functions for the individual sources of uncertainty were calculated for ten motion traces obtained from the zzso Motion margins required to compensate for the center of mass motion of the clinical treatment volume were found by zzso the individual sources of zzso For zzso of position at a frequency of 33 zzso system zzso was the dominant source of zzso zzso zzso over the ten motion zzso the motion margin for tracking with a zzso of 200 zzso was zzso zzso zzso with a duty cycle of zzso required a mean motion margin of zzso zzso and tracking with a zzso of 100 zzso required a motion margin of zzso zzso zzso reductions in the effects of the sources of uncertainty, for example by using a simple prediction zzso to anticipate the zzso position at the end of the zzso period, resulted in a mean motion margin of zzso zzso for tracking with a zzso of 100 zzso zzso zzso for tracking with a zzso of 200 zzso and zzso zzso for the gating strategies with duty cycles of zzso A crossover tracking zzso of 150 zzso was found, below which tracking strategies could take advantage of zzso motion margins than gating zzso The methods described here provide a means to guide selection of a motion management strategy for a given zzso
