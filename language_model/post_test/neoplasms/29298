zzso zzso using zzso injected into zzso fluid zzso was a safe zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso model described previously zzso zzso zzso showed good fitting to the zzso zzso data obtained from zzso We now describe a zzso model to account for the zzso zzso of zzso and to identify limiting factors that may impact therapeutic zzso 

Each zzso was examined for its effects on zzso the area under the zzso concentration curve of the bound zzso zzso zzso that of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso their therapeutic ratio zzso 

Data fitting showed that zzso zzso data fitted well using the zzso model zzso zzso were substantially better when compared to the zzso model zzso versus zzso zzso In addition, we made the following new zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso to zzso increased both zzso and therapeutic ratio zzso by zzso fold, zzso When zzso to the clinical setting, the model predicted that if zzso could be split into 4 doses of zzso zzso each and given at zzso hours apart, an zzso affinity of zzso of zzso at 50% zzso were adequate in order to deliver zzso zzso to tumor cells while keeping normal zzso exposure to zzso zzso 

This model predicted that zzso affinity and optimal scheduling of zzso injections were crucial in improving therapeutic zzso
