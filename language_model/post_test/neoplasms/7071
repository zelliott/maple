zzso a new oral zzso inhibitor with zzso properties, has demonstrated zzso and clinical activity against several tumor zzso The aims of this study were to validate a method for the measurement of zzso in plasma from cancer patients, then to test this method in clinical zzso Following zzso zzso the compounds were separated with zzso zzso (on a zzso zzso zzso column using a mobile phase of zzso zzso ammonium zzso then detected at 255 zzso The zzso was linear in the range zzso zzso zzso and zzso precision was lower than 7 and zzso respectively, at zzso 3 and 20 zzso Plasma zzso zzso were measured in 22 cancer patients (99 zzso The mean trough zzso concentration zzso and concentration at peak were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso in eight patients who experienced grade 3 drug-related adverse events was approximately zzso greater than that observed in the remaining patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, the method was successfully used in routine practice to monitor plasma zzso of zzso in cancer zzso Finally, large zzso zzso and higher exposure in patients experiencing severe toxicity support the need for therapeutic drug monitoring to ensure an optimal exposure to zzso
