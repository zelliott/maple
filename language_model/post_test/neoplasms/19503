One of the major challenges in cancer diagnosis from zzso data is to develop robust zzso models which are independent of the analysis techniques used and can combine data from different zzso We propose a zzso scheme which uses a robust zzso gene selection procedure and zzso the results of several machine learning tools trained on raw and pattern zzso We validate our method by applying it to distinguish diffuse large zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso on two independent zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso laboratory, Columbia zzso Our zzso technique achieves higher zzso zzso than each of the individual zzso trained on the same zzso and is robust against various data zzso We also find that combinations of zzso responsive genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso of the zzso
