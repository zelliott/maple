zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in embryonic vascular zzso cells zzso and activates the expression of target genes whose products zzso vascular function and zzso In this report, we describe a genetic model designed to test the zzso consequences of deleting zzso in zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, mice with zzso zzso developed normally but displayed a variety of zzso including increased vessel zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and pulmonary zzso Moreover, these animals exhibited defective tumor zzso associated with increased hypoxic stress and tumor cell zzso zzso zzso zzso displayed decreased zzso to zzso zzso proteins and expressed reduced levels of transcripts zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso 2, and zzso zzso 4 zzso Together, these data identify unique zzso functions for zzso in vascular zzso zzso
