The clinical efficacy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is still limited by the inefficient infection of the tumor zzso Since tumor growth is essentially the result of a continuous zzso between zzso and zzso zzso cells, targeting both cell compartments may profoundly influence viral zzso zzso we developed zzso zzso zzso since the zzso gene is expressed both in zzso cells and in zzso zzso zzso These zzso expressing or not the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso exerted a zzso effect on a panel of human melanoma cells expressing zzso but they were completely attenuated in normal cells of different origins, including fresh zzso regardless of whether cells expressed or not zzso Interestingly, both zzso displayed zzso activity on zzso zzso human zzso zzso cells and zzso fetal zzso Both zzso were zzso effective on zzso zzso melanoma tumors growing in nude mice but exhibited restricted efficacy in the presence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells enhanced the zzso efficacy of zzso on zzso zzso zzso pancreatic cancer cells in zzso Moreover, zzso media produced by zzso cells zzso with the zzso enhanced the in zzso viral zzso activity on pancreatic cancer cells, but not on melanoma zzso The whole data indicate that zzso cells might play an important role on the outcome of the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso zzso
