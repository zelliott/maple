zzso and zzso zzso modifications of proteins are a common theme in zzso zzso zzso was originally described to target proteins to zzso degradation by zzso zzso involving zzso zzso 48 zzso zzso linked zzso of zzso have been found that modify proteins without targeting to zzso zzso Instead this zzso creates zzso sites for signaling scaffolds that are key to control the nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso zzso that form zzso zzso zzso Therefore signaling via zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso use this type of zzso zzso zzso zzso exist zzso that zzso this system, degrading zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, mice deficient in these zzso develop zzso and zzso In zzso the zzso zzso zzso is possibly critical for zzso tumor zzso The zzso is also critically involved in zzso of tumor zzso as well as in the biology of zzso cells zzso The elements of this new signaling paradigm offer the opportunity for therapeutic exploitation and drug zzso
