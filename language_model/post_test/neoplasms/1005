zzso zzso zzso cells recognize zzso zzso presented by zzso and respond rapidly by killing tumor cells and release zzso that activate and regulate zzso immune zzso They are essential for tumor rejection in various mouse models, but clinical trials in humans involving zzso cells have been less successful, partly due to their rarity in humans compared with zzso Here we describe an zzso of functional zzso cells in human zzso a migratory organ with healing zzso Analysis of 39 zzso samples revealed that T cells are the zzso zzso cell type and of these, zzso expressed the zzso zzso zzso chain, found on zzso cells, higher than in any other human organ tested to zzso About zzso of zzso zzso cells expressed zzso compared with zzso in blood zzso Enriched zzso zzso cells killed zzso targets and released zzso and zzso upon zzso zzso zzso zzso were lower in patients with severe obesity zzso and with zzso zzso zzso compared with lean healthy zzso These data suggest a novel role for the zzso in immune regulation and tumor immunity and identify it as a potential source of zzso cells for therapeutic zzso
