We previously reported an image analysis program that uses four zzso parameters including two zzso zzso zzso threshold zzso and hue threshold zzso to determine the number of cells zzso and the zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso or zzso zzso labeling zzso zzso in human solid zzso The present study investigated if the accuracy and zzso of image analysis results can be improved by using zzso zzso and zzso Three investigators evaluated 142 images on 3 days, using visual analysis and four image analysis zzso which used different combinations of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The data show that image analysis using zzso zzso and zzso yielded zzso zzso of zzso and zzso that were indistinguishable from visual analysis, zzso equal zzso zzso or better zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso relative to visual analysis results, and zzso results that were equally zzso or more accurate zzso of zzso and zzso with higher zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso than image analysis obtained using zzso zzso We conclude that the use of zzso zzso and zzso improved the accuracy and zzso of image analysis zzso
