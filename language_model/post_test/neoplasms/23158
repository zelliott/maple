zzso is a key zzso zzso that has been associated with chronic inflammation and zzso cancer initiation and zzso There are zzso differences in zzso expression which may be due to single zzso zzso zzso in the regulatory regions of the zzso We have previously shown that a zzso located in the promoter of the zzso gene (the zzso zzso zzso was associated with lung cancer zzso Interestingly, the presence of the C zzso was also associated with reduced zzso expression in normal lung tissue of lung cancer zzso In the present study, we found that differential binding patterns of nuclear proteins to zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso compared to those with the T zzso were due to specific binding of the zzso factor zzso Yang 1 zzso We further found evidence that specific recruitment of zzso to the zzso region of the zzso promoter regulated zzso gene expression using zzso directed towards zzso The results indicate that the presence of a C zzso at the zzso position may lead to decreased expression of the zzso gene due to a specific binding of zzso in lung zzso zzso Our study provides functional significance of zzso variation at a single locus in the zzso promoter and contributes to understanding the regulation of zzso in zzso zzso
