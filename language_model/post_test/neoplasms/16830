To determine the relationship between changes in plasma zzso concentration and zzso effects, plasma zzso profiles and zzso zzso and zzso were measured during and after the continuous infusion of zzso for 180 to zzso minutes in 15 patients with pain caused by zzso An increase in plasma zzso concentration resulted in a rapid increase in pain relief or zzso The estimates of values of 50% of maximum effect zzso for pain relief and sedation obtained with a zzso model varied tenfold to zzso among zzso the mean zzso value for pain relief zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was virtually the same as the mean zzso value for sedation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the mean gamma zzso zzso for pain relief zzso zzso zzso zzso and sedation zzso zzso zzso zzso did not zzso zzso of zzso plots of data obtained during the infusion and for 4 to 5 hours after zzso of the infusion revealed a very rapid zzso between plasma zzso values and the sites zzso pain zzso There was no indication of the development of tolerance to the zzso effects of zzso during the zzso This report describes a method for zzso the zzso relationships of the desirable and zzso effects of zzso zzso
