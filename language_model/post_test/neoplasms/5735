There is a renewed interest in zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso since the development of large field of view cameras and the capability of regional distribution of zzso This method may help solve three types of problems in clinical zzso tumor diagnosis and extension assessment, prediction of treatment response and follow-up zzso of zzso and zzso The aim of this paper is to review the literature in this zzso This technique is mostly used for brain, zzso zzso and breast tumors as well as for zzso It is possible to diagnose an zzso transformation of a low grade zzso since zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso plays another important role in the evaluation of the brain tumor response to treatment and of the secondary effects or zzso of this zzso This technique is also useful in breast zzso diagnosis in the case of a dense breast, detection of zzso zzso or other zzso which could modify the zzso One of the most established roles of zzso PET is the diagnosis of zzso tumor zzso Furthermore, future results will probably confirm its usefulness in lung zzso for the diagnosis and for treatment zzso Lastly, it plays an important role in soft tissue zzso at all stages of diagnosis and zzso The results of the literature still have to be zzso However, if the capability of predicting tumor response to treatment is confirmed, this method will play an important role in patient management and will modify treatment zzso
