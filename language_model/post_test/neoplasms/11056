The mechanisms by which cells spontaneously immortalized in tissue culture develop the capacity to form tumors in zzso likely embody fundamental processes in zzso zzso The evolution of zzso canine kidney zzso cells from zzso normal kidney cells to immortalized cells that become zzso represents an example of zzso development in zzso Studies of the mechanisms by which spontaneously immortalized cells develop the capacity to form tumors would benefit from quantitative in zzso zzso Most zzso correlations are evaluated by using zzso zzso experiments, which indicate only whether cells are or are not zzso Here we used quantitative zzso zzso to measure zzso zzso tumor development in nude mice of 3 lots of unmodified zzso zzso The results revealed zzso variations in the zzso of zzso cells, which were reflected by their zzso efficiency zzso cell dose represented by mean zzso zzso zzso 50% zzso of zzso for vial 1 and zzso for vial 2, and a zzso dose of zzso for vial 3) and mean tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso vial zzso zzso and vial zzso zzso These studies provide a reference for further characterization of the zzso cell zzso zzso and may be useful in zzso aspects of zzso development in zzso that determine zzso zzso Such data also are useful when considering zzso cells as a zzso for vaccine zzso
