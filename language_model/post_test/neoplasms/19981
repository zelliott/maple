Previous research suggests that patients receiving zzso care may simultaneously experience poorly managed pain and post-traumatic stress disorder zzso symptoms as a result of their deteriorating zzso 

zzso 1) examine zzso of zzso symptoms in patients requiring zzso care; 2) assess whether anxiety, depression, pain zzso and pain anxiety mediate the relationship between pain interference and zzso zzso and 3) evaluate the impact of these variables on pain interference and zzso zzso 

One hundred patients receiving zzso care at one of two zzso care sites in London, zzso Canada, completed the zzso zzso version zzso the Hospital zzso and Depression zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso Form zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso were used to examine zzso zzso zzso and zzso scores as zzso of zzso zzso and mediation analyses were used to test the effect of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the relationship between zzso interference and zzso zzso that significantly affected this relationship in the individual zzso models were entered into a multiple zzso zzso 

Only pain anxiety and pain zzso emerged as significant zzso of the relationship between pain interference and zzso zzso After being entered in a multiple zzso model, pain anxiety emerged as the strongest zzso 

The findings of the present study reveal that pain and zzso symptoms are important concerns in zzso care, and that pain must be addressed to best meet the needs of this zzso
