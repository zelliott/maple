Although a significant negative zzso factor, tumor zzso can be exploited for gene zzso To maximize targeting within the tumor mass, we have developed synthetic gene promoters containing zzso elements zzso from the zzso zzso gene as well as zzso zzso elements from the early growth response zzso 1 zzso Furthermore, to achieve high and sustained expression of the suicide gene zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso our gene therapy zzso contain an expression amplification system, or zzso zzso based on zzso zzso In human zzso and breast zzso cells exposed to zzso and/or radiation, the zzso promoter rapidly activated zzso zzso expression leading to selective and sustained zzso zzso zzso of zzso tumor cells was measured after incubation with the zzso zzso zzso converted by zzso into a zzso In zzso higher and more selective zzso toxicity was achieved with the switch zzso when compared with the same zzso promoters driving zzso expression zzso In tumor zzso implanted in nude mice, the zzso induced significant growth delay and tumor zzso In conclusion, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso represent a promising strategy for both targeted and effective gene therapy of solid zzso
