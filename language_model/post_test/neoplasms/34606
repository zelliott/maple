zzso CT scans for patients with multiple trauma represent an increasingly accepted first diagnostic zzso The zzso approach in particular provides appropriate diagnostic zzso for detecting nearly all relevant traumatic findings in a short time with a high grade of sensitivity and zzso zzso additional findings are commonly depicted based on these CT zzso The aim of this study is to evaluate the number and quality of these additional findings in consecutive patients with multiple zzso 

Between 3 zzso 04 and 8 zzso 06 we scanned 304 patients according to our dedicated multiple trauma zzso The examination protocol includes a head scan without intravenous contrast followed by a zzso scan including the neck, zzso and abdomen acquired by a zzso CT Scanner zzso zzso zzso The CT scans were zzso analyzed by two zzso with respect to zzso zzso zzso were assessed according to their clinical relevance zzso relevant, moderately relevant, not zzso For patients with highly relevant findings, additional follow-up research was zzso 

The average age was 43 years zzso 3 - zzso 236 of the patients were male zzso zzso 68 female zzso zzso 153 patients zzso zzso had additional zzso zzso In 20 cases zzso zzso zzso with high clinical relevance were detected zzso zzso zzso of the kidney or the zzso In 71 patients zzso zzso findings with moderate relevance were zzso In 63 patients zzso zzso additional findings without major relevance were zzso 

zzso CT scans of patients zzso by a trauma show a considerable number of zzso additional zzso In about 30 % of cases, these findings are clinically relevant because further diagnostic zzso or treatment in the short or zzso is zzso The results of these analyses emphasize the diagnostic value of CT examinations with high demands on the examining zzso
