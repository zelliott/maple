Two mathematical models were presented to approximate the various survival zzso for zzso zzso The models individualized several segments in the survival zzso Also, the hazard function of the curve and the confidence intervals of the curve could be zzso First, we studied the zzso curve for zzso therapy of zzso zzso The curve for zzso had three segments and the curve for zzso two zzso The zzso showed its effect in the early period of zzso Second, the zzso survival zzso for zzso therapies of breast cancer were zzso zzso zzso a combination of zzso was superior to a combination of zzso in all the periods of the zzso zzso zzso Poly zzso U was more effective than the control in the middle and late zzso zzso zzso zzso was superior to the control in the early zzso Third, the survival zzso for zzso therapy of stomach zzso zzso versus zzso were zzso zzso of the confidence intervals of each curve clarified that no significant difference could be found between zzso Thus, these analyses showed the effectiveness of the compared zzso zzso
