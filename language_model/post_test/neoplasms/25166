Many zzso zzso including human zzso virus zzso zzso express zzso also known as zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Whether zzso is expressed by the zzso cancer cells, and if so, whether zzso is zzso or behaves zzso remains zzso Here we show that zzso zzso cells express high levels of zzso zzso zzso with cellular distribution, zzso zzso zzso induction and zzso binding similar to that reported for primary zzso zzso of zzso zzso failed to affect zzso cell migration or zzso zzso zzso of zzso also had no effect on growth, and we were unable to confirm a role for zzso in binding or regulating expression of the zzso zzso zzso cells thus emerge as a useful tool for studying zzso with the zzso function of zzso expression by tumor cells remaining zzso Using zzso cells as a source of zzso zzso we confirmed that zzso efficiently binds the zzso zzso member zzso
