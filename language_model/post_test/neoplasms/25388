zzso cells express a great variety of zzso including tumor specific transplantation zzso zzso zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso zzso sites and receptors for natural killer cells and natural zzso These zzso are distributed zzso on tumor zzso and each zzso may induce different immune responses to the same zzso zzso zzso zzso arises early in cancer, possibly during zzso and exists throughout the course of zzso zzso zzso are not generally less zzso than zzso within primary zzso Different zzso of zzso zzso are displayed by zzso but zzso in cell surface expression of a single zzso is also a fundamental type of zzso zzso zzso specificity patterns commonly reveal one-way zzso between tumor zzso zzso zzso might occur due to quantitative differences, zzso variations, zzso zzso zzso expression and restriction phenomena, or zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which occur when zzso co-exist may alter immune responses so that the response to the mixture is not the sum of the responses to the individual zzso It is suggested that the exploitation of the mechanisms involved in zzso zzso may lead to new therapeutic approaches and that the great diversity of zzso expressed by tumor cells could lead to development of zzso panel of zzso zzso which, acting zzso could zzso lyse tumor zzso
