To evaluate the proportion of zzso zzso 

A descriptive study of incident cases of cancer during 3 years in a French zzso All people with cancer having a current or past working history were included in the studied population which was recruited from local zzso A working history was obtained from each subject by zzso The different organ zzso were linked using zzso criteria, to specific occupational zzso zzso The results obtained were compared to international data on zzso cancer zzso 

A total of 2009 cases were included and zzso zzso met the criteria for zzso cancer as zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the main occupational zzso zzso Construction and zzso metal products sectors were linked to almost two-thirds of zzso zzso The percentage of the studied population with attributable risk for occupational cancer was relatively close to international data zzso zzso and organ cancer distribution percentages did not vary significantly from international published validated zzso 

zzso zzso tend to be concentrated in relatively small groups of people among whom the risk of developing the disease may be quite zzso The detection of occupational hazards should therefore have a higher priority in any zzso of cancer zzso zzso criteria to identify specifically zzso with an occupational origin should be specified by the scientific international zzso
