To estimate the risk of secondary leukemia as a function of the dose of zzso and zzso 

We conducted a zzso study of the risk of secondary leukemia or zzso after a solid tumor in childhood within the zzso zzso zzso zzso including 61 patients with leukemia matched with 196 zzso The characteristics of the first cancer, the patient's family history of cancer, and the treatment zzso cumulative dose of chemotherapy, schedule of zzso administration, and radiation dose delivered to active bone zzso were compared in the two zzso 

Only two factors were found to increase the risk of leukemia in zzso analysis, zzso the type of the first zzso with an excess risk in patients with Hodgkin's disease zzso risk zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to 24) or zzso zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and exposure to zzso and zzso The risk of leukemia increased regularly with the cumulative dose of zzso In zzso patients who received between zzso and 6 zzso of zzso or more than 170 zzso of zzso had a zzso higher risk zzso zzso zzso to zzso compared with patients who received lower doses or none of these zzso The risk of leukemia in patients who received more than 6 zzso of zzso was multiplied by 197 zzso zzso 19 to zzso The risk of leukemia was not increased by exposure to zzso agents or zzso 

Both zzso and zzso increase the risk of secondary zzso The current challenge is to minimize the zzso effects of these drugs by diminishing cumulative doses without losing the therapeutic zzso
