To determine whether the immune system limits or improves the therapeutic efficacy of an zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in a subcutaneous tumor zzso 

zzso immune reactions against tumors may be zzso zzso However, recent studies with zzso zzso show that immune responses limit the efficacy and persistence of gene zzso The effect of the immune response on cancer gene therapy with zzso gene delivery by an zzso zzso followed by treatment with zzso is zzso 

After zzso zzso of a Fischer rat zzso zzso cell line with the zzso gene in zzso subcutaneous flank tumors were zzso The ability of the zzso system to inhibit tumor growth was compared among normal Fischer rats, zzso nude rats, and Fischer rats zzso with zzso 

zzso therapy was more effective in nude rats and zzso Fischer rats than in zzso Fischer zzso 

These results indicate that the immune response against zzso zzso cells limits the efficacy of the zzso system and that zzso appears to be a useful zzso These findings have important implications for clinical trials using currently available zzso zzso as well as for future zzso zzso
