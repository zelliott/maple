To determine the relative rates of incident zzso among children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis zzso with respect to treatment as compared to children without zzso 

Using national Medicaid data from 2000 through 2005, we identified zzso of children with zzso and without zzso according to the diagnosis codes used by their physicians and the medication prescriptions that were zzso Study followup began after a zzso lag period to exclude prevalent and zzso zzso Treatment with zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso was zzso as ever exposed or never zzso zzso outcomes were identified using an adapted version of a previously validated zzso zzso zzso were zzso as possible, zzso or highly probable based on a comprehensive review of all zzso zzso rates were standardized to the age, sex, and race distribution of the overall zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso were calculated using children with attention deficit zzso disorder zzso zzso zzso (one of two zzso groups included) as the zzso zzso 

The zzso cohort included zzso children with a total followup time of zzso zzso zzso of these children contributed zzso zzso of zzso inhibitor zzso For all children with zzso versus children without zzso the zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso for probable and highly probable zzso For those taking zzso without zzso inhibitor use, the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Following any use of zzso zzso no probable or highly probable zzso were identified zzso 0 zzso zzso zzso 

Children with zzso appeared to have an increased rate of incident zzso compared to children without zzso The treatment for zzso including zzso zzso did not appear to be significantly associated with the development of zzso
