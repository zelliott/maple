This paper presents evidence that damage to nuclear DNA zzso is a direct cause of aging in addition to the effects of zzso damage on cancer, zzso and cellular zzso Many studies show significant zzso damage with age, associated with declining zzso repair, and this evidence for the decline of zzso repair with age is also zzso zzso zzso correlate with the effectiveness of zzso zzso The most severe forms of accelerated aging disease in humans are due to zzso repair zzso and many of these diseases do not exhibit increased cancer zzso High rates of cellular zzso and zzso due to high rates of zzso damage are apparently the main cause of the elderly zzso in these zzso zzso mice with high rates of cellular zzso and zzso exhibit an elderly zzso whereas some strains with low rates of cellular zzso and zzso show extended zzso zzso increases of zzso damage in the brain may be problematic for zzso because zzso may be difficult to replace and artificial zzso repair could be zzso
