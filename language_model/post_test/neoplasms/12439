zzso described zzso were designed to evaluate the performance characteristics of a flow zzso system that scores the zzso of peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso These procedures represent the continued refinement of a previously reported zzso method zzso et zzso zzso zzso Res zzso with the following zzso incorporation of a third fluorescent label to exclude zzso from the zzso region, and use of a zzso zzso zzso technique to increase data acquisition zzso zzso zzso and human blood samples were analyzed using both the previously described zzso procedure zzso and zzso zzso and a newly developed zzso technique (which adds an zzso zzso The zzso specimens were also evaluated by standard zzso procedures zzso orange zzso Mouse blood was collected via heart puncture of zzso and zzso zzso zzso blood samples from zzso zzso rats were collected from the tail vein and via heart zzso zzso blood samples were analyzed by both the two- and zzso zzso Human blood zzso obtained via arm zzso from cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy, were analyzed for zzso using the zzso zzso zzso blood samples from a single chemotherapy patient were analyzed by both the two- and zzso zzso Finally, the chemotherapy patient blood samples and blood samples from 15 healthy volunteers were evaluated at very high zzso in conjunction with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these investigations showed that data from mouse blood analyzed by the two- and zzso procedures correlated well with zzso data zzso values zzso zzso and zzso for the two- and zzso methods, zzso all three methods confirmed the zzso of zzso Data from rat tail vein samples showed improved zzso with the zzso technique, but no significant difference between the two techniques was seen with the heart puncture zzso Human blood analyzed according to the zzso procedure produced unreliable results, as zzso and zzso zzso impacted the rare zzso scoring zzso The zzso technique effectively overcame this problem and produced zzso zzso that fell within expected zzso For human blood zzso the high cell zzso technique provided significant improvements over the zzso technique, as it allowed data acquisition to occur approximately six times faster with no loss of zzso
