Aging is the major risk factor for the development of zzso An understanding of the molecular mechanisms that induce cancer formation during aging could help to develop cancer prevention strategies and improve cancer screening in the zzso On the cellular level, it is of utmost importance to decipher molecular zzso leading to dysfunction and transformation of adult stem cells, since there is growing evidence that stem cells acquire the initial zzso that ultimately lead to cancer zzso On the molecular level, the zzso of DNA damage and zzso instability represents a hallmark feature of cancer development in aged zzso Different mechanisms can contribute to an zzso of DNA damage and zzso instability during aging, including zzso zzso zzso zzso a reduction in DNA repair capacity, and zzso the declining function of checkpoints zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso in the cell environment can increase the selection of zzso clones in aging zzso involving zzso the loss of zzso competition of zzso organ cells, zzso the zzso production of zzso and growth factors, zzso an impaired immune zzso In this review, we zzso experimental data on the functional role of these different mechanisms increasing the cancer risk during tissue zzso
