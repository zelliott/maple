Cancer is a complex genetic disease characterized by the zzso of multiple molecular zzso Current diagnostic and zzso zzso based on clinical and zzso factors, are insufficient to reflect the whole clinical zzso of zzso Most current zzso agents do not differentiate between zzso and normal cells, leading sometimes to disastrous adverse zzso Recent advances in human zzso research and zzso molecular technologies make it possible finally to tackle the molecular complexity of zzso zzso With DNA array technology, zzso expression levels of thousands of genes can be measured simultaneously in a single zzso Oncology is benefiting on multiple zzso Gene expression profiles are revealing new biologically and clinically relevant tumor zzso previously indistinguishable and are identifying new diagnostic and zzso zzso as well as new potential therapeutic zzso Here, we review the technology and present clinical applications for which promising results have been zzso Finally, we discuss issues that must be resolved in the near future to allow DNA zzso to translate into benefits for cancer zzso
