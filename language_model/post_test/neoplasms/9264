zzso approaches and linear zzso have expanded our knowledge in biology over the past century and represent till today the basis for the zzso diagnosis and treatment of all diseases in clinical zzso However, major diseases still remain zzso All currently available drugs target a single gene or protein ignoring dynamics of highly complex zzso networks driving collectively gene expression and cell's zzso No surprise that most of these agents don't cure common zzso disorders while available zzso and zzso are unable to predict zzso cellular reactions to genetic and zzso zzso as well as drug effects in individual patients and zzso In this review we discuss latest advances in zzso zzso of zzso association studies zzso whole zzso zzso data analysis, zzso interactions networks databases, and more recent Encyclopedia of DNA zzso zzso data on regulatory networks including zzso zzso sites and zzso zzso In addition challenges for a comprehensive analysis of zzso signaling pathways network is zzso Such analysis, despite zzso scarce data and lack of sophisticated methods to predict dynamics of a global hierarchy or zzso biological networks, appears essential for the discovery of new therapeutic network targets, which could dramatically increase treatment zzso while minimizing at the same time major adverse zzso In this review we describe potential and challenges of modern approaches for applying next-generation sequencing and patient's personal whole zzso analysis for personalized treatment using available zzso Additionally, we report why the discovery of next-generation drugs should be shifted from our linear world to zzso zzso disease zzso zzso science and dynamics of network biology zzso
