We conducted a zzso zzso study to evaluate the relationship between cancer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and exposure to zzso zzso from public drinking zzso zzso were exposed to zzso when it zzso from the vinyl lining of zzso distribution zzso Relative delivered dose of zzso was estimated using a model that took into account residential location, years of residence, water flow, and pipe zzso zzso odds ratios zzso for lung cancer were moderately elevated among subjects whose exposure level was above the 90th zzso whether or not a zzso period was assumed zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 0, 5, 7, and 9 years of zzso zzso The adjusted zzso for zzso cancer were modestly elevated among zzso subjects as more years of zzso were assumed zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 11 and 13 years of zzso zzso These elevated zzso stemmed mainly from associations with zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso cancer among zzso subjects were more elevated zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 11 and 13 years of zzso zzso than were corresponding estimates for colon cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 11 and 13 years of zzso zzso These results provide evidence for an association between zzso public drinking water and cancer of the lung and, zzso cancer of the zzso
