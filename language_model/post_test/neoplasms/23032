Patients with advanced cancer exhibited lower natural zzso against zzso target cells in a standard short-term zzso release zzso than did patients with localized zzso or normal zzso Although natural killer zzso activity of advanced cancer patients could be zzso by nylon column depletion of adherent cells and enriched further by zzso of zzso zzso zzso the zzso level attained remained below that obtained from zzso of normal donors treated by the same zzso The pattern of zzso activity obtained on the zzso zzso was the same for all individuals zzso The proportion of large zzso zzso zzso paralleled zzso activity and was highest in the peak zzso fraction in all individuals zzso Advanced cancer patients with low zzso activity showed no decrease in number of zzso from that of other cancer patients or zzso Similarly, there was no decrease in target binding cell zzso Using a zzso zzso in zzso we found that the number of active zzso cells was the same for all patients, whether with localized or advanced zzso and normal zzso In a zzso time period, there were no differences in the rate of killing in zzso The maximum killing potential zzso of the zzso advanced cancer patients in a zzso zzso was significantly lower than that of zzso or other cancer zzso The observed zzso in natural zzso of these patients thus appeared to be due to a reduced recycling zzso
