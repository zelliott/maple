Natural killer zzso activity was zzso in fresh peripheral blood zzso cells zzso from cancer patients receiving zzso zzso zzso Patients received a single intravenous injection of zzso zzso (90 zzso zzso zzso zzso on alternate days for 2 weeks, followed by a higher dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the same zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso target cells was significantly increased in zzso sampled 24 h after the initial injection zzso zzso zzso At the end of the first 2 weeks of the zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso had fallen below the original baseline zzso the higher zzso dose subsequently given was without zzso However, significant increases in the proportion of zzso cells were seen following each zzso A positive correlation was also seen between the increased zzso activity of zzso zzso cells and the proportion of zzso zzso cells, but not the proportion of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso of these in zzso zzso resulted in a further increase in zzso zzso zzso in zzso to zzso zzso seems to prime the zzso to respond to in zzso stimulation by zzso which otherwise had no zzso zzso analysis of zzso after in zzso exposure to zzso zzso showed that the levels of zzso zzso and zzso cells did not zzso All the zzso activity responding to zzso zzso was found in the zzso enriched population of zzso suggesting that it is unlikely that in zzso zzso of zzso zzso representative of zzso cells has occurred in the peripheral zzso
