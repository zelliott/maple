The zzso regulatory system has been shown to mediate zzso effects during normal growth and tumor zzso The zzso of both zzso and zzso is regulated by at least six specific zzso binding proteins zzso Whereas zzso is the main zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso during fetal zzso In addition, zzso is expressed in a range of tumor cell zzso In order to investigate the zzso regulatory zzso in zzso we analyzed by zzso serum samples of 49 children with zzso zzso zzso zzso or solid tumors at the time of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso were significantly zzso but zzso zzso to zzso zzso was zzso Both absolute as well as zzso values of zzso zzso and the sum of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso were zzso correlated with zzso zzso levels of the growth factors zzso and zzso were significantly decreased in different types of zzso to zzso usually seen only in patients with growth hormone zzso or during zzso However, the elevated levels of zzso in zzso of our patients exceeded by far those in growth hormone zzso Furthermore, in this study we could demonstrate that serum levels of zzso and zzso were zzso correlated to zzso independent on the type of zzso indicating a common regulatory mechanism of the zzso signaling zzso in these zzso
