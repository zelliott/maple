zzso T cells play a crucial role in protective immunity to viruses and zzso zzso zzso T cells are initially activated by professional zzso presenting cells zzso that are directly infected by viruses zzso or following zzso of zzso zzso transferred from zzso or zzso cells zzso In order to efficiently target each of these zzso pathways during vaccine design, it is necessary to delineate the properties of the natural zzso for either of these zzso zzso In this study, we zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso transgenic mouse to examine the requirement for both zzso synthesis and synthesis of other cellular factors during direct or zzso We found that direct presentation required ongoing synthesis of zzso but that zzso zzso zzso zzso and did not require ongoing zzso zzso Even after prolonged blockade of protein synthesis in the donor cell, zzso was zzso In contrast, zzso was almost zzso in the absence of zzso zzso and required ongoing protein zzso This suggests that the zzso and zzso pathways may zzso differing pools of zzso an observation that has far-reaching implications for the rational design of vaccines aimed at the generation of protective zzso T zzso
