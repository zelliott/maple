The zzso hypothesis suggests that zzso develop through a single defined series of genetic zzso This hypothesis was first suggested over 50 years ago based upon zzso zzso zzso However, recent molecular studies of tumors indicate that multiple routes exist to the formation of cancer, not a single zzso This parallel route hypothesis has not been tested with zzso zzso zzso 

To test the parallel route hypothesis, I formulated it in terms of a mathematical equation and then tested whether this equation was consistent with zzso zzso data compiled by the Surveillance zzso and End zzso zzso cancer zzso since zzso I used the zzso goodness of fit test to measure zzso The zzso zzso data from most human zzso including those of the zzso zzso zzso and breast were consistent with the parallel route zzso However, this hypothesis is only consistent if an immune zzso exists, one that will never develop zzso Furthermore, breast zzso has two distinct forms of the disease, and one of these occurs at significantly different rates in different racial zzso 

I conclude that the parallel route hypothesis is consistent with the zzso zzso data only if zzso occurs in a distinct zzso population, while the zzso hypothesis is inconsistent with this zzso
