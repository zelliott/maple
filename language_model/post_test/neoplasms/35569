zzso have emerged recently as effective targets for novel zzso drugs referred to as zzso We propose that the molecular mechanism of induction of zzso by zzso as exemplified by the drug zzso zzso involves generation of zzso oxygen species zzso zzso then mediate the formation of zzso bridges between zzso zzso zzso resulting in the formation of zzso outer membrane zzso zzso also cause zzso of zzso triggering the release of zzso c and its zzso via the activated zzso zzso This model may provide a general mechanism for the action of zzso of zzso and zzso drugs, zzso targeting zzso via zzso zzso
