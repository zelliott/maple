A zzso scan was conducted to seek evidence for zzso genes that influence cause of death in mice produced by a cross between zzso females and zzso zzso zzso on zzso 1 and 4 were found to zzso risk of zzso A locus on zzso 4 influenced risk of zzso zzso among zzso female mice, but had no significant effect in virgin zzso A zzso 4 locus was found to zzso risk of death from either zzso or zzso A suggestive linkage was noted (at p zzso between a marker on zzso 11 and zzso zzso Lastly, a locus on zzso 6 was noted to influence the likelihood that pulmonary zzso would be present at zzso The collection of normal and zzso zzso from zzso terminal zzso together with genetic information, provides a valuable resource for further studies of the genetic influences on late-life diseases in zzso
