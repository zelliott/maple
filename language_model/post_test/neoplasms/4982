Modern zzso benefits from precise and targeted diagnostic and zzso zzso 

Standard imaging zzso such as zzso zzso zzso offer high zzso detail but only limited functional information on zzso 

Novel functional and molecular imaging zzso provide biological information about tumors in addition to detailed zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso CT or zzso zzso imaging as well as hybrid zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso CT or zzso have the potential to identify and precisely delineate viable and/or zzso tumor areas, enabling zzso of targeted zzso zzso information on tissue zzso and/or zzso metabolism allow a more precise definition and treatment of tumors while reducing the radiation dose and sparing the surrounding healthy zzso 

In the development of new imaging methods for planning individualized zzso zzso imaging and research plays a pivotal role, as the value of zzso imaging can only be zzso tested and adequately developed in a zzso setting, zzso in animal tumor zzso 

New functional imaging zzso will play an increasing role for the surveillance of early treatment response during radiation therapy and in the assessment of the potential value of new combination therapies zzso combining zzso drugs with zzso
