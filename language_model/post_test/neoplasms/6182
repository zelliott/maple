The magnetic zzso as a potential platform for dual targeted zzso and zzso drug delivery were developed to enhance the efficiency and veracity of drug delivering to tumor zzso The magnetic zzso were zzso based on zzso iron oxide zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso chemically zzso with zzso zzso acid zzso via a facile chemical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected as a model zzso drug to investigate the in zzso drug release and zzso effect of tumor cells in zzso and in zzso in the presence or absence of an external magnetic filed zzso with strength of zzso The zzso blue zzso exhibited that these magnetic zzso possessed remarkable zzso targeting in zzso zzso this smart system enabling folate zzso zzso into tumor cells, showed strong responsiveness to zzso The primary in zzso tumor model study, which was carried out in zzso zzso male New Zealand white zzso demonstrated that the zzso could be guided into tumor site more efficiently by application of zzso and further represented significant therapeutic efficiency to solid zzso
