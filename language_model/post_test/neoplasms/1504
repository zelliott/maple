In environmental health research there is a recognized need to develop improved zzso and statistical methods for rapid assessment of relationships between environment and zzso Exposure assessment is identified as a major challenge needing zzso In this study an exposure simulation model was used to zzso almost exactly in space and time an urban population exposed to airborne zzso A geographic information system zzso was used as the electronic environment in which to link the exposure model with the zzso migration, and cancer data of the exposed zzso This information is available in Denmark on an individual zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso for both men and women in 10-year age bands were calculated for three different exposure zzso zzso patterns were zzso zzso showed no excess of cancer zzso during the time span chosen (13 years; zzso in the whole exposed area or in the medium or higher zzso zzso The exposure model appeared very useful in selection of the appropriate exposure zzso The integration of the model in a zzso together with individual data on addresses, sex, age, migration, and information from routine health statistics zzso Cancer zzso proved its usefulness in zzso the exposed population and identifying the zzso related to that zzso Less than one-third of the study population lived at the same address after 13 years of zzso and only half were still residing in the area, indicating migration of people as a major zzso
