Plants produce many low molecular mass natural compounds endowed with biological zzso Among them, zzso zzso has been demonstrated to be able to affect a plethora of pivotal cellular molecular zzso including zzso pathways and gene zzso These activities result, in turn, in several different cell zzso zzso frequent effects of zzso treatment appear to be the reduction of growth and the zzso of programmed cell zzso zzso a number of trials are currently under development to evaluate the possibility of using zzso in cancer therapy, both as single agent or in association with other zzso zzso However, some reports suggest that, at low zzso not only zzso does not inhibit the proliferation and/or the survival of cells but, conversely, it zzso proliferation and/or protects cells against toxic zzso On the basis of these zzso effects, it has been proposed that zzso belongs to the so-called zzso zzso zzso is an expression employed by zzso to describe a zzso (or zzso dose response characterized by a beneficial effect at low doses and a toxic (or zzso activity at high zzso In this review, we will zzso data that might suggest or disprove that zzso is endowed with clear zzso zzso
