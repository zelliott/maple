In cancer patients undergoing radiation therapy, the beneficial effects of radiation can extend beyond direct zzso to tumor zzso zzso of localized radiation to tumors often leads to systemic responses at distant sites, a phenomenon known as the zzso effect which has been attributed to the induction and enhancement of the zzso zzso innate and zzso immune zzso The mechanisms surrounding the zzso effect are diverse and include trafficking of zzso into the tumor zzso enhanced tumor recognition and killing via zzso of tumor zzso and zzso presenting machinery and, induction of positive zzso zzso Here, we discuss potential mechanisms of zzso enhancement of the zzso response through its effect on the host immune system and explore potential zzso zzso strategies such as adoptive cellular therapy using ex zzso expanded zzso and T cells as a means of delivering a potent zzso population in the context of zzso zzso immune zzso
