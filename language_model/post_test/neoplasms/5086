The zzso number of human tumors varies widely, from zzso to more than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors constitute a small minority zzso of zzso investigated zzso but occur in many different disease zzso In these zzso most zzso are present in one zzso one or a few zzso are zzso Published reports on 141 strictly zzso tumors, supplemented with nine previously unpublished cases, were used for evaluating the pattern of zzso zzso Only one tumor type, acute zzso leukemia zzso was sufficiently common zzso zzso 75) to allow proper zzso other zzso were lumped together in as reasonably logical groups as possible, including 10 zzso zzso zzso nine plasma cell zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso 11 soft tissue tumors zzso nine zzso or zzso cell zzso zzso and eight tumors of the nervous system zzso the remaining 15 tumors could not be zzso It was evident that the pattern of zzso is zzso Moreover, unique signatures for each tumor group were zzso Among zzso most zzso were independent of age and zzso except for zzso 10, which was overrepresented in zzso zzso 21 was invariably zzso whereas zzso 17 was always zzso The most frequent zzso were two zzso in zzso zzso 7, 9, 11, 3, 18, and 19 in zzso 7, 5, 20, 19, and 21 in zzso 20 in zzso 7 in zzso and 1, 7, and 9 in zzso zzso 1 was often partially zzso due to unbalanced structural zzso with segment zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso clone was found in at least one-third of the cases, apart from in zzso where only one of 10 cases showed zzso zzso The present findings indicate that retention of zzso for some zzso is zzso important and that the zzso maintained in two copies is related to cell type or zzso zzso
