zzso membrane association and zzso of zzso B have been shown to occur in many types of tumors and to correlate positively with their invasive and zzso zzso To further understand changes in zzso B activity and zzso we have been examining its regulation at many levels including zzso and zzso Our studies indicate that there may be three promoter regions in the zzso B zzso Of these, continued examination of the promoter upstream of zzso 1 has indicated possible control by several regulatory factors including zzso and zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso B at this level may account for some of the zzso of zzso B found in zzso We have also gathered evidence that zzso and zzso of zzso B may be regulated by zzso and zzso proteins in addition to previously described trafficking zzso There is also evidence that several populations of zzso may exist and that trafficking to different populations may determine whether zzso B is zzso from the tumor cell or remains zzso Our results indicate that membrane association and zzso of zzso B is not a random process in the tumor cell, but rather part of a tightly controlled zzso
