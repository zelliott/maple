To evaluate the mortality experience of zzso men employed in seven uranium zzso in the Colorado zzso for at least one year on or after 1 January zzso 

Vital status was updated through 1998, and life table analyses were zzso 

zzso from all causes and all zzso was less than expected based on US mortality zzso A statistically significant increase in zzso respiratory disease mortality and zzso increases in mortality from zzso and zzso zzso other than zzso lung cancer, and chronic zzso disease were zzso The excess in zzso and zzso cancer mortality was due to an increase in mortality from zzso and zzso and Hodgkin's zzso Within the category of zzso respiratory disease, mortality from zzso and zzso and other respiratory disease was zzso zzso from lung cancer and zzso was higher among workers hired prior to 1955 when zzso to uranium, zzso and zzso were presumably zzso zzso from these causes of death did not increase with employment zzso 

Although the observed excesses were consistent with our a zzso zzso positive trends with employment duration were not zzso zzso included the small cohort size and limited power to detect a moderately increased risk for some outcomes of interest, the inability to estimate individual zzso and the lack of smoking zzso Because of these limitations, firm conclusions about the relation of the observed excesses in mortality and mill zzso are not zzso
