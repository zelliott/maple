zzso of independent, baseline risk factors for zzso zzso zzso may help select adult cancer patients who are at high risk to receive zzso 

We conducted a zzso of individual zzso data to identify these baseline risk zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the Grey literature databases were searched in all languages from 1995 to zzso Prospective studies and zzso controlled trials zzso were zzso Studies were included if original zzso data were provided by the investigators and if zzso was zzso confirmed with valid zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of 17 zzso baseline characteristics was zzso zzso odds ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso were zzso 

A total sample of zzso subjects from five zzso and seven prospective studies was included in the zzso Among these subjects, 425 zzso events were zzso In zzso zzso regression, the use of implanted ports as compared with peripherally implanted central zzso zzso zzso decreased zzso risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas past history of deep vein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso technique zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and improper zzso tip location zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso 

zzso risk is increased with use of zzso previous history of zzso zzso zzso zzso technique and improper positioning of the zzso zzso These factors may be useful for risk zzso patients to select those for zzso Prospective studies are needed to validate these zzso
