zzso is a mixture of highly zzso zzso that zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso and the binding of zzso growth factors to zzso zzso This agent showed potent zzso of zzso blood vessel zzso as well as growth zzso in multiple zzso models, thus forming the basis for this zzso 

This study evaluated the toxicity and zzso of zzso zzso zzso when administered zzso daily for 4 consecutive days zzso zzso 1) or weekly zzso zzso 

zzso patients zzso age, 53 years zzso zzso zzso median performance status, zzso with a range of advanced solid tumors received a total of 232 zzso The maximum tolerated dose was 250 zzso zzso toxicity consisted of zzso and pulmonary zzso Other toxicity was generally mild and included zzso of the activated partial zzso time and injection site zzso The zzso were linear with zzso zzso zzso was low and zzso zzso was zzso Both zzso and zzso correlated with the percent increase in activated partial zzso time, showing that this zzso end point can be used as a surrogate for drug zzso No association between zzso administration and vascular zzso growth factor or basic zzso growth factor levels was zzso One patient with melanoma had a partial response, which was maintained for zzso months, and 9 patients had stable disease for zzso zzso 

The recommended dose of zzso administered for 4 consecutive days zzso or weekly is 250 zzso zzso was generally well zzso Evidence of efficacy in melanoma supports further evaluation of zzso in phase II zzso
