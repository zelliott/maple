zzso zzso were determined in 33 patients with solid zzso who received intravenous doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bound zzso zzso in a phase I zzso Since zzso constraints limited the data at lower doses, conventional analysis was not feasible and a zzso zzso was zzso Bound zzso were best described by a zzso model and further analyses revealed a small influence of dose or weight on zzso but no identifiable effects of age, body surface area, zzso or zzso zzso The final model was: clearance zzso zzso I zzso central compartment volume zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dose zzso zzso peripheral compartment volume zzso zzso zzso zzso clearance zzso I zzso Distribution and elimination zzso had median estimates of zzso h and 49 h zzso Free zzso was present at most sampling times with zzso around 1000 times lower than bound zzso zzso Data were best described using a zzso model and the following parameters were zzso apparent clearance 180 I zzso apparent zzso zzso 1450 zzso zzso zzso dose zzso apparent V2 zzso 21 300 zzso zzso zzso dose zzso zzso zzso zzso height zzso and apparent Q zzso I zzso Distribution and elimination zzso were zzso h and 85 h zzso
