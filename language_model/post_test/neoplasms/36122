Families were recruited zzso weeks after a child's new diagnosis or zzso of zzso Parents zzso zzso 42 zzso completed questionnaires regarding their sources of medical information, age, and zzso The child's zzso reported on the content of their communication with parents regarding zzso Parents and zzso estimated the child's chance of zzso survival using a zzso zzso 

Mothers and fathers reported a more favorable prognosis for their child, which was on average about zzso higher than zzso Time since diagnosis was correlated with less zzso between physician and mother prognosis ratings, with a similar trend noted for zzso zzso between zzso and parents was better for younger fathers, but it was unrelated to physician communication, sources of medical information, or other demographic zzso 

zzso age may be important to their understanding of their child's cancer zzso but we did not find support for other factors related to prognosis zzso Given the zzso of our sample, future research should assess differences in parents' prognosis knowledge across cancer diagnosis, race, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status zzso which may aid in developing interventions to improve parent zzso
