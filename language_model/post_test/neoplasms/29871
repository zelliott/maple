In two independent studies the authors have observed a significantly higher zzso of spontaneous tumors in zzso zzso mice over the long term than in zzso zzso control zzso In the first study, zzso were performed on the animals at 30 months of age (27 months after zzso and 15 of 24 zzso versus 2 of 14 zzso mice zzso less than or equal to zzso had zzso tumors in various zzso In a second study, zzso were performed on the animals at a younger age (18 months, 15 months after zzso and liver tumors zzso 82 of zzso zzso versus 33 of 97 controls zzso versus zzso P less than or equal to zzso had at least one zzso zzso and a significantly higher percentage of zzso animals had large zzso than or equal to 31 zzso zzso zzso tumor burdens zzso versus zzso P less than or equal to zzso and multiple zzso tumors zzso versus zzso P less than or equal to zzso In combined data from both studies, the zzso group had a higher zzso of zzso at least one tumor zzso less than or equal to zzso zzso multiple tumors zzso less than or equal to zzso and zzso more than one type of tumor zzso less than or equal to zzso Furthermore, in both studies tumor number and size were significantly associated with zzso immunity detected by zzso or zzso zzso It is speculated that zzso degradation products and/or the zzso response to zzso that commonly accompanies zzso may affect tumor induction or growth directly or indirectly by interfering with zzso zzso
