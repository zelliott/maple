zzso zzso can be assessed by zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso like zzso zzso The purpose of this work was to independently investigate the influence of chronic and acute zzso on the retention of zzso on the zzso This was approached by zzso and simulating tissue zzso and zzso dynamics on the zzso based on zzso zzso zzso of oxygen and zzso molecules in zzso and zzso zzso binding were included in the zzso Moreover, a model of fluctuating vascular oxygen tension was incorporated to theoretically predict the effects of acute zzso zzso tissue oxygen tensions zzso are strongly influenced by the zzso zzso fluctuations zzso 40 zzso total zzso 10 zzso and mean 35 zzso zzso led to variations in mean zzso of up to zzso and in the hypoxic fraction zzso zzso 5 zzso from zzso up to zzso zzso zzso retention is caused by chronic zzso as well as acute zzso zzso By simulating zzso injection during different zzso of the vascular zzso fluctuation cycle, it was found that acute zzso of an zzso valid magnitude does not influence the zzso of PET zzso Thus, it may be impossible to separate acute and chronic zzso from serial PET zzso
