Twenty-five years after the publication of the first report on gene transfer in zzso in cultured cells by the means of electric pulse delivery, zzso cell zzso for gene transfer and gene therapy zzso zzso is at a zzso in its zzso Present knowledge on the effects of cell exposure to appropriate electric field zzso particularly at the level of the cell zzso is reported here as an introduction to the large range of applications described in this zzso The importance of the models of electric field distribution in zzso and of the correct choice of zzso and applied zzso is zzso The mechanisms involved in DNA zzso which include cell zzso and DNA zzso are also zzso The feasibility of electric pulse for gene transfer in humans is discussed taking into account that electric pulse delivery is already regularly used for localized drug delivery in the treatment of zzso and subcutaneous solid tumors by zzso Because recent technological developments have made DNA zzso more efficient and safer, this zzso gene therapy approach is now ready to reach the clinical zzso A good understanding of DNA zzso principles and a respect for safe procedures will be key elements for the successful future transition of DNA zzso to the zzso
