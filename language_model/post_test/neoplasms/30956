zzso zzso was examined in zzso using various zzso cell lines as target zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso exerted a zzso effect on some zzso cell lines including zzso zzso zzso and zzso but other zzso cell lines including zzso zzso zzso and zzso were completely insensitive to this zzso zzso microscopic examinations showed that zzso zzso zzso to target zzso cells but zzso zzso did zzso zzso changes of zzso cells induced by zzso and zzso zzso were zzso When zzso and zzso cells were zzso in the same vessel but were prevented from coming into direct zzso contact by means of a membrane barrier, zzso of zzso zzso was completely blocked but that of zzso zzso was still zzso However, no zzso activity to zzso cells was detected in the zzso obtained after stimulation of zzso with either target cells or zzso for 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso was not required for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had no effect on the formation of zzso cell zzso but inhibited the zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso had no effect on the zzso activity of zzso zzso These results suggest that direct contact between zzso and target cells is essential for zzso zzso but not for zzso zzso to exert zzso and that some zzso play a role in the zzso process of zzso zzso They also provide evidence that some zzso zzso are soluble and easily zzso factors liberated by activated zzso Our findings indicate that zzso may be one of the zzso zzso cells against certain zzso
