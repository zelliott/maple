To explore job strain in Norwegian zzso cancer survivors compared to matched controls from the general zzso The study has a zzso matched zzso zzso A sample of zzso employed cancer survivors zzso females with breast cancer and 209 males with zzso or prostate zzso who had been diagnosed zzso years prior to the study and were zzso rated themselves on the zzso zzso zzso Their ratings were compared to those of zzso employed controls from the general population, matched with the survivors on time of investigation, zzso age and zzso of zzso No differences in job strain were observed between cancer survivors and controls, or between zzso of survivors, except that female survivors experienced more strain than zzso In certain zzso statistically significant differences on the zzso were zzso older survivors showed higher scores on demands than their controls, female survivors reported lower control and higher strain than male survivors, and older male survivors felt higher demands than younger zzso However, the effect sizes of these differences were so small zzso zzso that they hardly were relevant for the work zzso In zzso analyses zzso versus control status was not significantly associated with any of the zzso zzso The job strain of these cancer survivors did not differ in any work relevant way from their controls, and zzso status was not significantly associated with job zzso A longer follow-up of survivors is necessary in order to draw conclusion about the stability of these findings over zzso
