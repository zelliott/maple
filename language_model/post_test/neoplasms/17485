Advanced or aggressive, but zzso zzso can often be reduced to more zzso proportions by the use of zzso zzso that is, using chemotherapy as the first mode of treatment, prior to definitive zzso and/or surgical zzso In using zzso agents, drug combinations, timing and methods of administration are employed which exploit differences between cancer cells and normal zzso and zzso One zzso difference which is often overlooked is the fact that zzso zzso is often supplied with blood by one zzso this can be zzso so that the agents used can be delivered selectively in high concentration to the region containing the zzso The advantage in delivering drugs regionally by zzso infusion depends upon the size of the artery zzso the rate of zzso or zzso of the agents used, the amount of the agent infused entering the zzso - especially from the first zzso and especially the amount of agent entering the zzso which is biologically active against zzso zzso Taking all these factors into account, mathematical calculations indicated that under the worst possible circumstances infusion of zzso agents zzso should be at least zzso times more effective regionally than intravenous zzso In most situations and with most agents used the advantage would be significantly greater than zzso These calculations are supported by evidence in the literature and by observations of a greater regional effect, albeit toxic, of zzso administration of the zzso These effects include more pronounced loss of hair in the region of distribution of the artery zzso and increased skin and zzso zzso in the distribution of the artery zzso The disadvantage of using zzso infusion delivery is the need for zzso zzso properly controlled, zzso clinical trials should be conducted to compare clinical results of zzso and intravenous chemotherapy zzso
