zzso zzso zzso recognizing the distinct zzso of human zzso had previously been established and they were used to construct several sandwich zzso zzso zzso for the structural analysis of zzso found in the urine of cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso only with zzso and zzso zzso against zzso zzso and was less zzso with other zzso using zzso directed to terminal zzso indicating that zzso was almost completely fragmented and consisted mainly of zzso zzso The zzso using zzso against zzso zzso had sufficient zzso with the zzso fragmented by artificial zzso but these fragments could hardly be detected by other zzso zzso levels were significantly elevated in various cancer patients and extremely elevated in some patients with distant zzso It is presumed that zzso fragments which increase in cancer patients are generated by zzso zzso zzso Thus zzso levels and the ratio of the fragmented zzso level to the zzso zzso level appear to be zzso clinical indicators of tumor zzso or zzso ability in cancer zzso
