zzso control analysis zzso provides a quantitative description of zzso flux in response to changes in system parameters of complex zzso zzso Medical applications of the approach include the zzso understanding the threshold effect in the manifestation of zzso diseases; investigating the gene dose effect of zzso in inducing zzso transformation in zzso zzso the contributions of individual genes and zzso characteristics in zzso disease zzso zzso identifying candidate zzso in pathways suitable as targets for cancer zzso and zzso the function of zzso genes by identifying zzso features shared with genes of known zzso zzso zzso current studies of zzso and zzso providing a link between zzso and functional zzso that relates the expression of genes and gene products to cellular zzso and zzso zzso Thus, it is an important tool for the study of zzso zzso It allows genes to be ranked according to their importance in controlling and regulating cellular zzso zzso We can expect that zzso will have an increasing impact on the choice of targets for intervention in drug zzso
