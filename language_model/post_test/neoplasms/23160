To investigate whether a zzso zzso central line maintenance care bundle reduces central zzso blood stream infection zzso rates in hospitalized pediatric zzso patients and to further delineate the epidemiology of zzso in this zzso 

We performed a zzso interrupted time series study of a zzso bundle addressing all areas of central line zzso reduction of entries, zzso entries, and zzso procedures when changing zzso Based on a continuous quality improvement model, targeted interventions were instituted to improve compliance with each of the bundle zzso zzso rates and zzso data were collected for 10 months before and 24 months after zzso of the bundle and compared in a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso rates decreased from zzso zzso per 1000 central line days at baseline to zzso zzso per 1000 central line days during the intervention period zzso rate ratio zzso zzso P zzso zzso Secondary analyses indicated zzso rates were reduced to zzso zzso per 1000 central line days in the second 12 months of the intervention zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso percent of infections resulted from zzso zzso 37% of patients with a zzso required central line zzso and patients with zzso zzso were more likely to have a zzso than patients with zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

A zzso central line maintenance care bundle can be implemented in hospitalized pediatric zzso patients, although long zzso times may be necessary to reap zzso zzso Further research is needed to determine if this zzso rate reduction can be sustained and zzso
