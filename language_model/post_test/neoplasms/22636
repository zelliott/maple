As a key gene in the zzso of cell zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso is an important negative regulator of T cell zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso A zzso is one of the most commonly studied zzso in this gene due to its association with cancer risks, but previous results have been zzso 

We zzso a zzso using 22 eligible zzso studies (including 32 zzso with a total of zzso patients and zzso controls to zzso the existing data on the association between the zzso zzso zzso A zzso and cancer zzso 

Compared with the common zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso the carriers of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a zzso elevated risk of cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso under the dominant genetic model, as estimated using a fixed effect zzso The effect of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso was further evaluated using zzso zzso In four breast cancer studies, patients with the zzso zzso had a significantly increased risk of breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso A similar result was found in three skin cancer studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In 26 solid tumor studies, subjects with the zzso zzso had a significantly higher risk of developing solid tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso compared with the 6 zzso tumor studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso had significantly increased risk of zzso tumors and zzso tumors, with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso It was also demonstrated that the increased risk of cancer associated with zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso was more pronounced in Caucasians zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Asians zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Our zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso + zzso might be associated with an increased risk of cancer, especially in Caucasians and zzso
