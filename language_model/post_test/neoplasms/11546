zzso pathogens can cause serious infections in zzso patients with cancer, and zzso therapy is often initiated zzso zzso may offer an option for these zzso 

To compare the safety and efficacy of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso patients with cancer, we conducted a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with proven or suspected infection due to a zzso pathogen were zzso to receive zzso or zzso 

Clinical success rates 7 days after completion of therapy zzso end zzso were equivalent between groups in the zzso zzso analysis zzso 219 zzso of 251 zzso zzso 202 zzso of 237 zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso modified zzso analysis, clinically zzso analysis, and zzso zzso analysis, as well as between zzso analyzed by zzso and infection zzso Mean time to zzso was shorter for zzso than zzso in the modified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso although post hoc analyses revealed delayed recovery of absolute zzso counts for zzso in these zzso zzso There were no zzso differences in zzso success rates in the modified zzso subset (41 zzso of 71 patients zzso 29 zzso of 58 zzso zzso and zzso zzso subsets, as well as in mortality rates in the zzso subset (17 zzso of 304 patients zzso 23 zzso of 301 zzso zzso and all zzso Distribution of adverse events, including reported zzso events, was similar between groups, except that zzso was associated with fewer drug-related adverse events zzso zzso of zzso patients zzso 72 zzso of 300 zzso zzso and fewer cases of drug-related zzso failure (1 zzso of zzso patients zzso 7 zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso demonstrated efficacy and similar safety outcomes equivalent to those for zzso in zzso zzso patients with zzso
