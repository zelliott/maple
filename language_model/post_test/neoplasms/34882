The aim of this study is to implement zzso reality in real-time zzso zzso zzso to allow an intuitive real-time zzso zzso 

The developed system consists of a common video zzso two high-resolution charge coupled device cameras, and an zzso zzso The projector was used as a scanning device by projecting zzso patterns to register the patient and zzso the operating field with planning data and additional information in arbitrary zzso zzso movements of the zzso patient were detected by means of zzso tracking passive markers attached to the zzso 

In a first clinical study, we evaluated the whole process chain from image acquisition to data projection and determined overall accuracy with 10 patients undergoing zzso The described method enabled the surgeon to zzso planning data on top of any preoperatively segmented and zzso surface zzso with direct line of sight during the zzso Furthermore, the tracking system allowed dynamic adjustment of the data to the patient's current position and therefore eliminated the need for rigid zzso Because of zzso zzso we obtained an average zzso of zzso zzso by moving the patient, whereas changing the zzso position resulted in an average zzso of zzso zzso Mean zzso of all needles of an implant was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The developed low-cost zzso system proved to be accurate and feasible in zzso zzso The system meets clinical demands and enables intuitive real-time zzso orientation and monitoring of needle zzso
