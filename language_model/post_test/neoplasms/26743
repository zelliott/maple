zzso zzso zzso in mice is considered a powerful forward genetic strategy to identify disease genes involved in zzso Our zzso screens led to frequent identification of the genes zzso the zzso engaged in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can positively or zzso impact on gene transcription, and then fulfill important roles in zzso control and zzso zzso A tremendous amount of progress has accelerated the characterization of zzso zzso and the zzso that regulate zzso zzso of these zzso zzso zzso has been increasingly recognized as a hallmark of cancer in the last few zzso However, in most cases, we have only limited understanding for the molecular mechanisms by which these zzso contribute to cancer development and zzso In this review, we zzso the current knowledge regarding some of the zzso examples of zzso zzso zzso and zzso associated with zzso and discuss their potential mechanisms of zzso
