The goal of this work is to build the foundation for zzso real-time magnetic resonance image guided patient treatment for heating systems with a large number of physical sources zzso zzso Achieving this goal requires knowledge of how the temperature distribution will be affected by changing each source individually, which requires time expenditure on the order of the square of the number of zzso To reduce zzso time, we propose a model reduction approach that combines a smaller number of zzso source zzso zzso than the number of actual zzso that are most likely to heat zzso The source zzso consist of magnitude and phase source zzso values for each actual source and may be zzso from a CT scan based plan or a simplified generic model of the corresponding patient zzso Each zzso source zzso is considered a zzso zzso We assume that the actual best source settings can be represented effectively as weighted combinations of the virtual zzso In the context of zzso each source zzso is treated zzso to one physical zzso This model reduction approach is tested on a patient zzso tumor model (with and without zzso zzso heated using a 140 zzso zzso zzso zzso phased zzso zzso simulations demonstrate that using only a few zzso source zzso can achieve temperature zzso that are comparable to those from full zzso using all physical zzso The method yields close to optimal temperature zzso when using source zzso determined from a simplified model of the zzso even when tumor position is erroneously assumed to be approximately zzso zzso away from the actual position as often happens in practical clinical application of zzso zzso The method also appears to be robust under conditions of changing, zzso zzso zzso The proposed approach of using virtual sources reduces the number of variables that must be zzso to achieve a zzso temperature distribution, thereby reducing the calculation time required in real-time control applications to about 1/3 to 1/4 of that required for full zzso
