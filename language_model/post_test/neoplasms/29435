zzso zzso are members of the zzso coding zzso zzso zzso which can regulate genes on zzso level through either degrading the target zzso zzso zzso or suppressing the protein zzso also take part in a number of biological functions that involve development, zzso proliferation and zzso The zzso and zzso in the expression levels of zzso genes or zzso in their zzso mechanisms may play their roles in the formation of zzso zzso evidence shows that zzso zzso expression profiles are present in a variety of zzso zzso it has been suggested that these profiles could be useful for diagnosis and zzso of different tumor types and that these small zzso might provide significant opportunities for the development of future zzso zzso In this review, we aimed to look into the realm of zzso which is a recent area of research, appraise their biological activities on molecular level and their probable benefits on clinical zzso
