A zzso zzso model for zzso was used to analyze the zzso of cancer of the zzso stomach and colon in the cohort of atomic bomb zzso We fitted the model assuming that acute exposure to radiation results in the creation of initiated cells that are added to the pool of spontaneously initiated zzso In the zzso zzso with the exception of lung cancer in zzso we found no evidence that zzso initiation was dependent upon age at zzso In contrast, we found that spontaneous initiation was dependent upon age at exposure in the zzso analyzed except stomach cancer among zzso Because exposure to radiation in this cohort occurred at the same time for all members of the zzso age at exposure is exactly correlated with birth zzso and the dependence of spontaneous initiation on age at exposure is a reflection of the cohort effects seen in these zzso in zzso Even without a dependence of zzso initiation on age at exposure, the zzso model can explain the zzso behavior of the excess relative risk with age at exposure and time since zzso In particular, the model predicts that excess relative risk is highest among those exposed as zzso Moreover, since zzso initiation is not higher among those exposed as children, the excess relative risk in this group is not due to an inherently higher sensitivity to zzso Our biologically based approach provides another perspective on the zzso behavior of risk after acute exposure to zzso zzso
