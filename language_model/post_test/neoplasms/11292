In this study, selective cancer cell targeting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been investigated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell targeting was zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso against zzso zzso serving on each cell as zzso matched irrelevant zzso Two different targeting approaches have been zzso a direct method using zzso zzso zzso and a zzso method using the zzso zzso For the direct zzso fluorescent zzso were prepared including zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso groups were zzso bound to the zzso and the resulting zzso zzso were coupled with the two zzso using a zzso zzso The effective targeting of cells by zzso was shown by flow zzso zzso Clearly zzso specifically bound to the zzso cells and not to the zzso cells, while zzso bound to zzso cells but not to zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to tumor cells produced a mean zzso or higher signal increase compared to irrelevant zzso For the zzso zzso plain zzso were also zzso and zzso zzso zzso coupled to the zzso zzso with zzso The zzso method was evaluated in zzso by zzso zzso cells first with zzso zzso followed by zzso The relative zzso associated to the specific binding of zzso produced a zzso increase in flow zzso signal compared to zzso zzso In conclusion, these experiments have shown that zzso zzso coupled with zzso or zzso can specifically and efficiently bind to cancer cells in both a zzso and a direct approach, suggesting that zzso zzso may be a useful drug carrier for tumor zzso
