zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso has been found in multiple zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in prostate and breast cancer zzso and promotes the invasion of human prostate cancer cells not only through the zzso of zzso and type IV collagen but also by the zzso of zzso a powerful zzso This study was to present a comprehensive protein expression profile of zzso in multiple human cancer zzso 

The protein expression pattern of zzso was examined using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in coronary artery smooth muscle cells was detected by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso 

The expression of zzso in breast, zzso zzso brain, head and neck, prostate cancer, and melanoma zzso was significantly elevated when compared with parallel normal zzso zzso while not significantly elevated in kidney cancer, zzso cancer, and zzso zzso zzso zzso was also detected to express in zzso zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso protein was expressed in smooth muscle cells of the prostate and associated blood zzso zzso zzso was also detected to express in human coronary artery smooth muscle zzso 

zzso expression may be associated with multiple human zzso and it may serve as a molecular marker for the early diagnosis of these zzso zzso may also contribute to smooth muscle function in the human prostate and cardiovascular zzso
