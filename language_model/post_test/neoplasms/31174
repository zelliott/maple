This review presents an overview and discussion of the potential synergistic strategies of radiation therapy and gene transfer for treating zzso zzso Topics discussed include zzso promoters coupled to genes which produce proteins that are zzso or enhance zzso employment of molecular chemotherapy approaches in conjunction with radiation therapy, and genetic induction of zzso through modification of DNA repair, signal zzso and cell cycle control zzso Additional topics discussed relate to gene transfer zzso of zzso of zzso Specifically, gene transfer methods to genetically induce tumor cells to express enhanced levels of cell surface zzso and receptors to increase zzso zzso and zzso targeting and thus increase their therapeutic effect, selection of zzso for therapeutic zzso zzso and computer simulation of genetic zzso delivery of zzso zzso are zzso
