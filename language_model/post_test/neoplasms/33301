DNA copy number aberrations zzso and gene expression zzso changes provide valuable information for studying zzso instability and its consequences in zzso While it is clear that the structural aberrations and the transcript levels are zzso their relationship is more complex and subtle than initially zzso Most studies so far have focused on how a zzso affects the expression levels of those genes contained within that zzso 

To better understand the impact of zzso on zzso we investigated the correlation of each zzso to all other genes in the zzso The correlations are zzso over multiple patients that have both expression and copy number zzso in brain, zzso and breast cancer data zzso We find that a zzso has a direct impact on the gene amplified or deleted, but it also has a zzso indirect impact zzso To identify a set of zzso that is zzso associated with the expression changes of a set of zzso we used a zzso zzso on the correlation zzso For each of the three cancer types zzso the aberrations in several zzso are associated with zzso specific biological pathways that have been described in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were significantly correlated with zzso growth factor zzso signaling zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso in zzso cancer, and zzso zzso with zzso zzso in breast zzso In all three data sets, gene sets related to cell zzso such as M phase, DNA replication and cell division were also associated with zzso Our results suggest that zzso are both directly and indirectly correlated with changes in expression and that it is beneficial to examine the indirect effects of zzso
