There are situations in which patient zzso zzso quality of life must be zzso by proxy zzso zzso and Knight recently delineated 2 proxy perspectives that may influence the nature of proxy zzso the zzso (the zzso assessment from the patient's zzso and the zzso perspective (the zzso own assessment of the zzso They argued that the zzso perspective would be zzso zzso consistent with the patient's zzso The purpose of this study was to evaluate these to proxy perspectives in terms of zzso bias and zzso 

The European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life zzso was administered to 224 cancer patients and their proxies zzso significant zzso who were randomly assigned to 1 of the 2 proxy zzso zzso in zzso bias and agreement were evaluated using zzso tests, percentage agreement, and zzso and zzso correlation zzso 

Small yet significant amounts of zzso bias were found in both conditions, with patients reporting higher levels of functioning and lower symptoms levels than zzso However, no significant differences in bias were observed between the zzso zzso better agreement on the role and cognitive functioning scales was found in the zzso condition, and for the zzso scale in the zzso zzso 

There is some indication that several of the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer functional scales may perform better when using the zzso zzso However, no compelling evidence was found for clear superiority of either proxy zzso These results deserve further study, as they are not entirely consistent with the pattern of agreement implied by zzso and zzso
