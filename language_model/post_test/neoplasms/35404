zzso is the major structural protein in zzso small zzso zzso within the plasma zzso zzso are involved in signal zzso wherein zzso acts as a scaffold to zzso multiple molecular complexes regulating a variety of cellular zzso zzso has both zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, recent evidence suggests a role for zzso in promoting cancer cell migration and zzso with both loss and zzso of zzso being described as a marker for progression in a variety of zzso zzso Further studies are beginning to determine the molecular mechanisms by which zzso acts in promoting a zzso zzso zzso zzso expression may present a novel means of preventing zzso The purpose of this review is twofold: zzso to survey the current knowledge of the contribution of zzso in promoting a zzso and zzso to explore the viability of targeting zzso with novel zzso
