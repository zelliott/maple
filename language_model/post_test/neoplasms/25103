zzso cancer pain zzso is a frequent event in cancer patients, with a prevalence from zzso to zzso The reasons for such zzso are explained by several factors, including different definitions across zzso In the framework of a wider initiative, we have analyzed the epidemiology of zzso and identified factors associated with the pattern of zzso 

This study reports the results from a zzso zzso zzso zzso study carried out in Italy between 2006 and 2007 on patients with cancer and zzso zzso zzso of pain were assessed with 3 different questions, and 1 composite variable to zzso define zzso was then used as main zzso After zzso analysis, a zzso model was also fitted to identify zzso and zzso zzso 

One hundred and ten centers recruited 1801 cases of which zzso had zzso at zzso Most patients did not receive rescue therapy at the time of study zzso zzso analysis identified several associations with clinical zzso A strong association has been also found with the type of recruiting centers, with zzso zzso reporting a somewhat lower proportion of patients with zzso zzso when compared with zzso zzso Patients with zzso had a high probability of dying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to change of the zzso with another for zzso failure or for side effects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These findings confirm the high prevalence of zzso and substantial zzso and identify a few factors associated with prevalence and zzso
