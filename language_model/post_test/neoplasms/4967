This paper proposes a novel mathematical approach to the beam selection problem in intensity modulated radiation therapy zzso zzso The approach allows more beams to be used over the course of therapy while limiting the number of beams required in any one zzso In the proposed field rotation method, several sets of beams are zzso throughout the treatment to allow a wider selection of beam angles than would be possible with fixed beam zzso The choice of zzso zzso and the number of identical zzso for each set are determined by a mixed zzso linear program that controls jointly for the distribution per fraction and the cumulative dose distribution delivered to targets and critical zzso Trials showed the method allowed substantial increases in the dose objective and/or sparing of normal zzso while maintaining cumulative and fraction size zzso Trials for a head and neck site showed gains of zzso in the objective zzso tumor zzso and for a zzso site gains were zzso depending on how strict the fraction size limits were zzso The objective did not rise for a prostate site significantly, but the tolerance limits on normal zzso could be strengthened with the use of multiple beam zzso
