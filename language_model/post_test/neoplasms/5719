A follow-up study was conducted to clarify the relationship between zzso level and risk of death from all causes and from cancer and cardiovascular zzso The zzso persons who were examined at seven zzso centers throughout Japan between 1982 and 1987 were followed zzso By January 1992, zzso persons zzso had been contacted by zzso They included zzso men zzso of all subjects zzso zzso age zzso years at zzso zzso zzso zzso years, range zzso zzso and zzso women zzso zzso age zzso years at zzso zzso zzso zzso years, range zzso zzso The follow-up period for each person averaged zzso years, for a total of zzso zzso During this period, 155 deaths were zzso At zzso five zzso tests zzso strength, side step, vertical zzso standing trunk zzso and zzso were zzso Five clinical laboratory tests zzso of zzso blood sugar, total serum cholesterol, percent vital lung capacity, and blood zzso were also zzso The zzso were questioned about smoking status zzso smoker, zzso and zzso Men with thicker zzso zzso risk zzso zzso zzso and higher levels of blood sugar zzso zzso zzso had an excess risk of death from all zzso Men with higher serum cholesterol zzso zzso zzso thicker zzso zzso zzso zzso and elevated blood pressure zzso zzso zzso had an excess risk of death from cardiovascular zzso In women, no relationship was seen between clinical laboratory tests and an excess risk of zzso Men exhibiting lower values for side step zzso zzso zzso vertical jump zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and grip strength zzso zzso zzso also had an excess risk of death from all zzso Furthermore, men with lower heights for vertical jump zzso zzso zzso had an excess risk of death from cardiovascular zzso After adjustment for zzso zzso blood sugar, total serum cholesterol, blood pressure, percent vital lung capacity and smoking status, men with a lower level of side step, vertical zzso and grip strength had an excess risk of death from all zzso No such relationship was seen between zzso level and an excess risk of death in zzso It is concluded that a low level of physical strength might be significantly correlated with subsequent health outcomes in zzso
