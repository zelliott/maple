Multiple lines of evidence indicate that the process of zzso is often associated with altered metabolism of two major zzso zzso and zzso These two nutrients are engaged in multiple zzso pathways that can be required for cell zzso The roles of zzso and zzso in the survival of transformed cells both in zzso and in zzso have been separately evaluated in various cell systems, and zzso as the major cellular energy source has received most of the zzso At the same time, data suggests that the inclusion of zzso and zzso into specific zzso pathways and cellular sensitivity to the availability of either of these nutrients depends on the cell origin and the combination and nature of transforming zzso zzso cell metabolism to develop selective cancer zzso requires consideration of these factors and evaluation of the requirement of zzso and zzso metabolism for survival of different transformed zzso Here we discuss possible molecular mechanisms underlying zzso sensitivity to deprivation of these zzso
