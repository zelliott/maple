There is increasing evidence in favor of the hypothesis that human tissue mast cells zzso are progeny of zzso stem cells and are closely related to cells of the zzso zzso zzso To test this hypothesis we investigated the zzso of zzso zzso in 12 zzso zzso and tumor specimens and zzso zzso in 27 tissue samples from patients with various types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 13; zzso zzso zzso zzso 4; systemic zzso zzso zzso 6; and zzso zzso zzso zzso 4) with a panel of eight zzso that stain zzso or immune accessory cells and are zzso on routinely processed zzso zzso zzso The zzso were stained by three of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but were not stained by three other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso detecting immune accessory cells zzso and zzso zzso While zzso stained zzso and zzso zzso in all the specimens investigated, zzso stained zzso zzso in nearly all the cases of zzso but did not stain zzso zzso zzso also failed to stain zzso zzso and stained zzso in only approximately half of the specimens from cases of zzso Among these were most of the cases of systemic and zzso zzso but only a minority of the cases of zzso zzso and a very few cases of zzso zzso To zzso zzso zzso display zzso zzso properties resembling those of cells of the zzso zzso system but not those of zzso derivatives belonging to the immune accessory cell zzso and zzso zzso and zzso are unique among the zzso zzso investigated in that they do not stain zzso zzso but exhibit preferential zzso with the more zzso zzso in cases of systemic and zzso zzso
