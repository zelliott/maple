In order to determine the relationship between zzso tissue zzso and serum levels of zzso in occupational zzso we used zzso zzso gel zzso and DNA sequencing of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso analysis for tissue identification of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for serum levels of zzso zzso protein to examine for such zzso in a cohort of individuals with workplace exposure to zzso or zzso and zzso lung zzso or zzso DNA analysis detected zzso in 5 of 18 zzso tumors, and tissue zzso of protein were detected in 7 of 20 zzso zzso the agreement between zzso and zzso analyses was significant zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein were detected in 4 of 11 zzso cases with available serum zzso the agreement between tissue zzso and serum zzso was also significant zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In addition, based on the analysis of banked samples, serum results tended to be consistent over time prior to the diagnosis of disease zzso zzso value zzso zzso negative zzso value zzso zzso These results suggest that serum levels of zzso are reasonably accurate in reflecting tissue zzso in zzso at the gene zzso or protein level and may be early zzso of disease zzso
