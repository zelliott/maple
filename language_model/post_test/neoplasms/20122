Growth promotion by zzso is observed with cultured human and mouse zzso as well as zzso zzso It is expected to play a role in zzso fibrosis, and zzso Indeed, zzso trigger zzso reactions that resemble those induced by growth and differentiation zzso For example, active oxygen activates protein zzso causes DNA zzso and zzso the growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso The cellular zzso defenses affect the consequences of zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso cells that zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso to the toxic effects of an zzso burst of zzso plus zzso whereas zzso of zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso corrected their zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso was diminished in zzso and zzso zzso albeit probably for different zzso It is concluded that a fine balance of the multiple components of the zzso defense determines the growth response of cells to zzso zzso In studies of the mechanism of the zzso induction of zzso by zzso we identified the joint zzso elements zzso symmetry element, zzso as major zzso motifs in the zzso regulatory sequences of zzso zzso also increased the de zzso synthesis of protein factors that bind to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso induction of zzso as well as the increase in factor binding to zzso We conclude that protein zzso and protein zzso are required for the zzso induction of zzso and the synthesis of protein factors that bind to zzso It is likely that the zzso and zzso proteins are among these factors and that they participate in the regulation of zzso expression by zzso
