zzso are zzso active zzso formed by invasive zzso cells when grown on an zzso zzso zzso zzso A current challenge is to understand how zzso activity is so precisely zzso at discrete sites of the plasma membrane to produce zzso zzso degradation at zzso Indeed, a number of components including zzso need to be directed to zzso to ensure proper segregation of zzso zzso We recently found zzso to feature the properties of zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso and that zzso degradation depends on the tight control of cholesterol zzso Since zzso directed zzso sorting and transport in zzso cells relies on segregation of proteins into zzso zzso at the zzso complex, we zzso that zzso zzso degradation might also rely on zzso zzso zzso transport zzso To investigate this issue we undertook a three-pronged zzso First, we found that zzso zzso which is known to disrupt zzso transport in zzso cells, strongly inhibited zzso formation, while not affecting overall protein zzso In the second approach we found that zzso green fluorescent protein (an zzso model zzso but not zzso zzso virus zzso or influenza virus zzso (both model zzso model zzso was transported to sites of zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso of proteins known to specifically regulate zzso zzso or zzso transport in zzso cells, such as zzso 1 and zzso zzso or zzso respectively, demonstrated that the selective zzso of the zzso but not the zzso transport route zzso zzso formation and zzso zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso are zzso membrane zzso where signal zzso and local membrane zzso events might be temporally and zzso confined via selective zzso zzso transport zzso
