A computer model of the spatial structure of zzso protein zzso a marker of certain tumor zzso has been constructed using the known spatial structure of zzso found in normal human zzso The structure of the two proteins at all levels of their organization has also been zzso On the basis of the revealed differences in structures of these zzso we assume it is unlikely that zzso can be a zzso zzso protein capable of catalyzing the zzso zzso
