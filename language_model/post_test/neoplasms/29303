It has previously been demonstrated that parents of children with cancer often exhibit symptoms of post-traumatic stress zzso even though the child's treatment is successfully zzso For the development of interventions we need to identify zzso of zzso which are possible to zzso Based on contemporary learning theory, it was hypothesized that early avoidance of zzso and zzso distress would predict the development of parental post-traumatic stress after completion of the child's cancer zzso 

zzso cognitive and zzso avoidance of zzso and zzso zzso stimuli during and immediately after a child's cancer treatment and zzso one year after the end of treatment was zzso Data was collected with the zzso zzso Civilian zzso zzso from 111 mothers and 109 zzso 

As hypothesized, avoidance during zzso and immediately after zzso the child's treatment predicted zzso among parents one year after zzso completion of the child's zzso Moreover, avoidance early on during the child's treatment seemed to be a greater risk factor for zzso and post-traumatic stress disorder zzso for bereaved than zzso zzso 

Avoiding reminders of stressful experiences related to a child's cancer disease during and immediately after the child's treatment seems to increase the risk for parents, mothers and fathers alike, of experiencing symptoms of post-traumatic stress zzso zzso based on cognitive zzso therapy with elimination of avoidance as a central component may be of use in this zzso
