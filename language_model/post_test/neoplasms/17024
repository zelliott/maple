Distant zzso harbor unique zzso characteristics not zzso in the corresponding primary tumor of the same patient and zzso located at different sites show a considerable zzso zzso Thus, the mere analysis of the zzso primary tumor alone zzso standard practice in zzso or, if possible, even zzso of tumor characteristics based on the biopsy of the most accessible zzso may not reveal sufficient information for treatment zzso Here, we propose that this dilemma can be solved by a new diagnostic zzso liquid zzso that is, analysis of therapeutic targets and drug zzso gene zzso on circulating tumor cells zzso and zzso circulating tumor DNA zzso released into the peripheral blood from zzso zzso We discuss the current challenges and future perspectives of zzso and zzso as zzso in clinical zzso Both zzso and zzso are interesting complementary technologies that can be used in parallel in future trials assessing new drugs or drug zzso We zzso that the liquid biopsy concept will contribute to a better understanding and clinical management of drug resistance in patients with zzso
