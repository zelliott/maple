zzso immunity requires the participation of zzso zzso cells that display powerful processes to destroy zzso zzso Natural killer zzso cells and zzso once zzso use the same zzso processes for zzso target cell zzso However, they are triggered through distinctly separate zzso zzso zzso cells are currently known to express at least three families of receptors unrelated to the T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to mediate zzso This review provides a view to a zzso bringing together a unifying concept for a common signal zzso that dictates zzso zzso What emerges is a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signal cascade triggered by target cell recognition, which is responsible for zzso the zzso zzso containing zzso and zzso B toward the contacted target zzso
