The tumor zzso zzso zzso tumor growth primarily through its ability to induce zzso zzso in zzso occur in at least 50% of human zzso We hypothesized that zzso of zzso zzso in such tumors should trigger massive zzso and eliminate the tumor zzso To test this, we screened a library of zzso compounds in order to identify compounds that can restore zzso function to zzso zzso We found one compound capable of inducing zzso in human tumor cells through restoration of the zzso zzso function to zzso zzso This zzso named zzso restored zzso DNA binding and the active zzso to zzso zzso proteins in zzso and in living zzso zzso rescued both DNA contact and structural zzso zzso In zzso studies in mice revealed an zzso effect with no apparent zzso This zzso may serve as a lead compound for the development of zzso drugs targeting zzso zzso
