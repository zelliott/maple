It is an emerging view that in many cases cell zzso relies on slow zzso zzso of the backbone of key proteins as exemplified by the zzso zzso zzso and that zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso proteins and the zzso zzso serve to integrate temporally and zzso protein zzso with zzso zzso The zzso relationship between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transformation and zzso progression is not yet fully understood because of the zzso zzso effects characterizing these zzso However, recent studies on the role of zzso and zzso indicate that zzso zzso zzso zzso on client proteins under zzso and zzso zzso This knowledge could offer new cancer intervention strategies based on the development of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
