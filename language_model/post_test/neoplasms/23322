To prepare zzso in zzso cells and investigate its effect on the recognition and proliferation of different tumor zzso 

The zzso was zzso from culture zzso without fetal calf serum zzso by zzso affinity zzso and then bound to zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells detected by flow zzso Different zzso of zzso were added in the training system of different tumor cells, and we analyzed the influence on the proliferation of these cells by zzso zzso With zzso cells which expressed zzso highly and were treated by zzso zzso as the zzso and human zzso as the effect cells, we analyzed the influence of the zzso on the proliferation of zzso by blocking the zzso zzso 

The concentration of zzso zzso from zzso was about zzso zzso and the binding rate of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso suppressed the proliferation of zzso and zzso cells which expressed zzso zzso and the zzso rate of zzso and zzso cells cultured with zzso (the final concentration was 25 zzso was zzso and zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso suppressed the proliferation of zzso by blocking the zzso signal zzso by zzso 

zzso can recognize zzso zzso and suppress the proliferation of tumor cells which express zzso zzso
