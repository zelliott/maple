Clinical trials of drugs that influence zzso and zzso pathways have been undertaken in patients with zzso because these pathways are capable of influencing zzso zzso The zzso of this concept was originally confirmed in experimental animal models of zzso Earlier pilot studies in human disease have been succeeded by definitive prospective zzso clinical trials that have revealed zzso of responsiveness to zzso and zzso agents that may be attributable to differences in mechanisms of interaction of the tumor cells of various types of zzso with these pathways in zzso In certain tumor types studied thus far, increased tumor response rates and zzso of survival have been observed that suggest the possibility that substantial benefit may be realized from this treatment approach in patients with zzso In addition, the availability of newer and potentially more effective therapeutic agents holds promise for even greater gains in previously tested tumor zzso The ability to design treatment regimens that zzso to defined mechanisms that pertain to specific tumor types should permit future studies to be designed zzso Current data suggest that zzso and zzso agents might reasonably be tested in tumor types characterized by the existence of a tumor zzso zzso zzso with zzso generation and conversion of zzso to zzso (such as small cell zzso of the zzso By contrast, zzso zzso might reasonably be tested in tumor types characterized by expression of tumor cell zzso zzso Expansion of current views on the possible role of zzso drugs in cancer therapy is zzso For example, zzso drugs classified as zzso zzso agents may inhibit zzso while zzso drugs with zzso properties, such as zzso and zzso may inhibit growth factor interactions with zzso zzso new opportunities clearly exist for interactions between clinical and basic investigators that may provide both novel zzso insights and improved patient zzso
