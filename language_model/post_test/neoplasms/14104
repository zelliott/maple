zzso Jones proteins zzso free light chains of zzso are the earliest known biological markers of zzso cell zzso zzso Jones zzso is also present in many types of B zzso zzso Sometimes, it may also occur in Hodgkin's zzso In some cases, benign zzso zzso was found to be associated zzso diseases as zzso The type of zzso light chain, the degree of zzso and the zzso point of the zzso may affect the course of the zzso zzso samples from zzso patients with true or suspected zzso diseases were investigated over a zzso period by different zzso zzso zzso Jones zzso was identified in 71 cases by zzso focusing combined with zzso while the pathological protein was detected only in 63 cases by conventional zzso zzso Jones proteins can be detected by this new method at a level below the sensitivity of conventional zzso zzso Jones proteins in the urine may signal a zzso tumor or zzso transformation of an earlier zzso The early detection of zzso zzso light chains in the urine may be important in clinical diagnosis, therapy, and zzso
