Examine the clinical and zzso features including serum intact zzso zzso and plasma zzso zzso zzso levels in patients with zzso zzso zzso 

Forty-eight patients with zzso or zzso proven zzso and zzso who were admitted to zzso Hospital were zzso 

The zzso that caused zzso were zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cell solid tumors zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Most patients zzso had advanced stage zzso zzso serum total calcium zzso levels were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and severe zzso was observed in 17 cases zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Most patients had suppressed serum zzso levels of zzso 10 zzso Plasma zzso levels were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were 27 cases zzso that had zzso zzso of zzso zzso with plasma zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and 22 cases had zzso cell zzso There was no difference in serum zzso zzso alkaline zzso and zzso levels between patients with zzso and zzso In 48 zzso patients, serum zzso correlated to plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and to serum zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In 25 patients with zzso a stronger correlation between serum zzso and serum zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso but not between serum zzso and plasma zzso levels zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso was zzso zzso multiple zzso analyses showed that serum zzso but not plasma zzso levels independently correlated to serum zzso levels zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The clinical manifestations of zzso observed in the present study were similar to those previously zzso zzso calcium correlated to serum zzso more strongly than to plasma zzso zzso The low but zzso serum zzso level might play a role in the development of severe zzso particularly in zzso
