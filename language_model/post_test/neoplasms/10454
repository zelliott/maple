To analyze the risk factors for central port failure in cancer patients administered chemotherapy, using zzso and zzso zzso 

A total of zzso totally zzso zzso access devices zzso were implanted into zzso cancer patients in this cohort zzso A Cox zzso hazard model was applied to analyze risk factors for failure of zzso zzso test was used to compare zzso survival zzso zzso zzso and surgical complication rates zzso test or zzso exact zzso were compared in relation to the risk zzso 

zzso age, male gender and open-ended zzso use were significant risk factors reducing survival of zzso as determined by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased the survival time of zzso this reduction was not statistically significant by zzso analysis zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, it became a significant risk factor by zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso when correlated with variables of age, sex and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a lower zzso rate than open-ended zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso had higher infection rates than solid zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso age, male zzso open-ended zzso and zzso zzso were risk factors for zzso zzso zzso zzso had lower zzso rates and zzso zzso had higher infection zzso
