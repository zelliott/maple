zzso data suggest that zzso zzso zzso has substantial activity in zzso tumor models and may be less zzso than zzso Based on these data we initiated a phase I clinical trial in patients with zzso zzso zzso This report characterizes the zzso profile of both the total plasma zzso of zzso platinum and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso following a 30 zzso intravenous infusion of zzso Platinum zzso were determined by zzso and zzso parameters for both the total plasma concentration and the zzso concentration of zzso platinum were determined using both zzso and zzso zzso zzso patients zzso males and 14 zzso median age, zzso received zzso There was a linear relationship between zzso and dose zzso zzso zzso and zzso and dose zzso zzso zzso zzso is more accurately described by a zzso model than by a zzso zzso The distribution zzso zzso zzso was zzso h and the terminal zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso The volume of the central compartment zzso was zzso L and the volume of distribution at steady state zzso was 183 zzso Like total plasma zzso zzso platinum is also best characterized by a zzso zzso The elimination of free platinum is also zzso with a distribution zzso zzso zzso of zzso h and a terminal zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The mean volume of the central compartment zzso was zzso zzso and the mean volume of distribution at steady state zzso was zzso zzso Clinical development of zzso has been terminated due to increased frequency of neurological complications noted over other platinum zzso however, the zzso are, in general, similar to those of other clinically used platinum zzso
