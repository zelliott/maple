Biological bulk specimens can be prepared by the zzso zzso method, which is suitable for quantitative X-ray zzso of zzso zzso Although the spatial resolution of this zzso technique does not allow us to analyze smaller cellular compartments than the nucleus and zzso it may deliver useful results for answering questions of experimental zzso Bulk specimens are also suitable for determination of zzso water and dry mass contents under certain zzso zzso of the bulk zzso X-ray zzso for experimental zzso revealed an age dependent increase of the zzso zzso content of the zzso cells, a diminution of zzso water content during aging and delivered indirect proof for the decrease of the passive zzso zzso of the cell membrane in old zzso and giant zzso The bulk zzso method of X-ray zzso has been applied also in cancer zzso it proved to be helpful in the determination of zzso zzso and zzso ratios in various human and experimental animal tumors as well as in other models of cell zzso These data gain a certain weight in light of the recent developments on the regulation of zzso
