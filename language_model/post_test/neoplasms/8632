The zzso zzso zzso B has been implicated in the progression of tumors from a zzso to a zzso zzso zzso of zzso B has been shown to be elevated in parallel with zzso or zzso potential of human and zzso zzso These increases in zzso B activity zzso in part to increases in zzso for zzso B and in part to reduced regulation by zzso low Mr zzso zzso zzso Most properties of tumor zzso B appear to be similar to those of zzso B from normal zzso However, the zzso distribution of zzso B is altered in tumors, resulting in association of zzso B with plasma membrane zzso or in release of high Mr forms of zzso B into the zzso zzso Since zzso B can degrade zzso zzso and type IV zzso we speculate that the presence of zzso B at the surface of tumor cells may contribute to the local dissolution of basement membrane observed during tumor cell zzso zzso evidence that zzso B plays a role in cancer progression awaits studies in which zzso or zzso of the expression of zzso B and its zzso zzso is found to alter zzso zzso potential, zzso
