The discovery of new zzso therapeutic targets is mainly based on the identification of genes involved in pathways selectively exploited in cancer cells, including those leading to unlimited zzso potential, evasion of zzso zzso tissue invasion and zzso zzso zzso a zzso a gene zzso recognized as a cancer target whether its zzso in experimental models can specifically modify or zzso the cancer zzso As soon as zzso interference zzso natural gene zzso zzso demonstrated in zzso cells, it rapidly became an essential means for gene zzso in zzso models, making it possible to define the role of several human genes and to identify those specifically involved in the onset and progression of zzso zzso to its powerful zzso properties, zzso has been proposed as a useful tool to validate new therapeutic targets and to develop innovative zzso zzso This chapter summarizes the findings from recent studies relying on the use of zzso approaches to functionally validate therapeutic targets related to two tumor zzso the unlimited zzso potential zzso zzso of zzso maintenance zzso and evasion of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
