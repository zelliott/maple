In a phase III zzso cancer clinical trial or a large public health study, sample size is predetermined to achieve desired power, and study participants are enrolled from tens or hundreds of participating zzso As the zzso is closing to the target size, the zzso data center needs to project the zzso closure date on the basis of the observed zzso pattern and notify the participating sites several weeks in zzso In the past, projections were simply based on some crude assessment, and conservative measures were incorporated in order to achieve the target zzso zzso This approach often resulted in excessive zzso size and subsequently unnecessary financial burden on the study zzso Here we proposed a zzso zzso zzso method to estimate the zzso rate at time of projection and subsequently the trial closure zzso To ensure that target size would be reached with high confidence, we also proposed a conservative method for the closure date zzso The proposed method was illustrated through the analysis of the zzso data of the National zzso zzso Breast and zzso Project trial zzso The results showed that application of the proposed method could help to save considerable amount of expenditure in patient management without compromising the zzso goal in zzso clinical zzso
