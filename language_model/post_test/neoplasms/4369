zzso stimulates systemic release of zzso zzso zzso in zzso To determine whether hyperprolactinemia causes zzso release in humans, we studied the relationship between zzso and zzso in zzso women and patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso women and 16 patients with zzso zzso were paired with healthy zzso and zzso zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso intact zzso and zzso were zzso Mean calcium and zzso levels were higher in zzso women than in control subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso was lower zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and mean zzso was higher than control values zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso correlated zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and positively with zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso and zzso levels were not different between patients with zzso zzso and control zzso The mean zzso level was higher in patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and fell significantly with therapy to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso levels are increased in hyperprolactinemia caused by zzso and zzso zzso In zzso women, the increased zzso was associated with higher mean calcium and zzso and lower zzso zzso The zzso consequences of these abnormalities in hyperprolactinemia require further zzso
