Most models of zzso assume that tumors are zzso in zzso This conclusion is based largely on studies using X zzso markers in zzso One important factor, often ignored in such studies, is the distribution of zzso cells in zzso Because zzso occurs early in development, many of the progeny of a single embryonic stem cell are grouped together in the adult, forming zzso As zzso can be demonstrated only at the borders of zzso patches, the patch size is crucial in determining the chance of demonstrating zzso and hence the number of tumors that need to be examined to exclude zzso Previously studies using zzso genes such as zzso zzso have been handicapped by the need to destroy the zzso to study the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso (1976) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or to determine the restriction zzso length zzso of X zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Hamilton, zzso zzso & Feinberg, zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso Here we zzso zzso patches in human females zzso zzso show that the patch size is relatively large in both the human colon and breast, zzso assessment of tumor zzso with traditional zzso zzso
