The zzso potential of human solid zzso in zzso was investigated using zzso zzso incorporation and flow zzso zzso Patients with solid zzso from a variety of sites were injected with 500 zzso zzso zzso several hours prior to biopsy or surgical zzso The zzso index zzso duration of zzso zzso and thus the potential doubling time zzso could be measured within 24 h of zzso The results show that both the zzso and zzso vary greatly between zzso zzso ranges from zzso to zzso zzso However, within this study of 26 zzso patients, zzso of the same tissue origin tended to have similar zzso zzso zzso had the shortest zzso zzso zzso nine patients with head and neck cancer had zzso values ranging from zzso to zzso h zzso zzso zzso The longest zzso values (24 zzso were found in lung and zzso The estimates of zzso ranged from only zzso days in an zzso cell zzso to zzso days in a zzso The striking feature of the study was that 38% of the zzso had a potential doubling time of 5 days or zzso We found no relationship between proliferation and zzso differentiation or DNA zzso It should now be possible to assess the zzso significance of zzso cell kinetic zzso which may, in the future, aid in the selection of treatment schedules for the individual zzso
