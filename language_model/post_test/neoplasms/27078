The discovery of zzso zzso activity led to a great interest in the potential application of coordination compounds as zzso zzso It is essential to identify new compounds that selectively inhibit tumor zzso evading secondary effects and resistance associated with zzso 

The in zzso zzso potential of an zzso compound was evaluated using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines, and human zzso zzso cell death was evaluated by zzso zzso and flow zzso for the zzso compound and also for a zzso compound bearing zzso as zzso Comparative zzso analysis for both compounds was assessed in the zzso cancer cell zzso 

The zzso compound presented a high zzso effect in zzso and zzso zzso cell lines zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively), and a lower zzso in human zzso Both compounds induced cell zzso and promoted the zzso of zzso stress-related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso compound induced a decreased expression of zzso proteins zzso tumor protein and zzso and the zzso compound decreased expression of proteins involved in zzso stabilization, zzso and zzso 

Our data reveals a high in zzso zzso potential against cancer cell lines and a moderate selectivity promoted by the zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso and zzso compounds in the zzso cancer cell line allowed an insight to their mechanisms of action, particularly by affecting the expression of proteins typically zzso in cancer, and also suggesting a promising therapeutic potential for both zzso
