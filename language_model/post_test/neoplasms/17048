New fluorinated and zzso zzso and zzso were prepared zzso the zzso of the zzso using copper zzso or palladium zzso zzso zzso respectively, of the zzso also prepared, with zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso The compounds obtained were evaluated for their growth zzso activity on the human tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The most active compounds, a zzso with a zzso group in the zzso position relative to the zzso function and two zzso with a zzso group either in the zzso or in the zzso position relative to the NH, were further tested at their zzso zzso on zzso cells causing pronounced zzso in the cell cycle profile and a strong and significant increase in the programmed death of these zzso The fluorinated and the other zzso compounds did not show important activity, presenting high zzso values in all the cell lines zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the compounds was assessed using zzso liver primary cells zzso established by some of zzso zzso showed that one of the most active compounds was not toxic to the zzso cells at their zzso zzso showing to be the most promising as zzso
