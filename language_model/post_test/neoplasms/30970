This review focuses on the zzso instability underlying the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso was discovered by the application of DNA zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso to the analysis of zzso genetic zzso in colon zzso The unbiased nature of zzso permitted to zzso from the mobility shifts observed in some fingerprint bands, the zzso by a subset of colon tumors of hundreds of thousands of zzso zzso in simple repeated sequences or zzso We deduced that this enormous zzso of zzso zzso was due to the previous occurrence of zzso zzso in DNA replication or repair factors leading to a decreased zzso of zzso These zzso zzso appeared to be the remote cause for the development of these zzso tumors, whose existence unmistakably validated the hypothesis of zzso as a zzso zzso Since these original zzso rapid progress has occurred in the zzso The zzso zzso were identified as those occurring in members of the DNA mismatch repair gene family, which are also associated with zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso In this review I discuss the experimental approach that allowed the discovery of zzso and the features of the zzso instability of these zzso I also review recent developments that affect the understanding of the role of the mismatch repair zzso zzso in the unfolding of zzso during zzso
