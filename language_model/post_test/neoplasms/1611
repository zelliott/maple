The DNA zzso has revolutionized cancer zzso Now, scientists can obtain a zzso perspective of cancer gene zzso One potential application of this technology is the discovery of novel cancer zzso for more accurate diagnosis and zzso and potentially for the earlier detection of disease or the monitoring of treatment zzso Because zzso experiments generate a tremendous amount of data and because the number of laboratories generating zzso data is rapidly growing, new zzso strategies that promote the maximum zzso of such data are zzso Here, we describe a method to validate multiple zzso data sets, a Web-based cancer zzso database for zzso discovery, and methods for zzso gene zzso zzso with zzso data to improve candidate zzso zzso
