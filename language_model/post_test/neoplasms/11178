The recent discoveries of the zzso interference system in cells could explain all of the known features of human zzso A key, novel idea, proposed here, is that the cell has the ability to zzso a zzso protein and/or zzso zzso the cell can generate its own short interfering zzso zzso using an zzso zzso to destroy zzso zzso even when only a single base pair in the gene has zzso The zzso strand of the short zzso zzso (called zzso targets the zzso zzso of an zzso or a zzso zzso The resulting double stranded zzso using the zzso zzso complex in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso In zzso zzso during cell zzso the zzso complex can move into the nucleus to target the zzso zzso The zzso possibly edited by zzso zzso zzso converting zzso to zzso can be retained in the nucleus, with enhanced destructive zzso The zzso triggers the assembly of protein complexes leading to zzso modification of the promoter site of the zzso zzso specifically zzso of zzso In some instances, instead of zzso the zzso DNA is zzso leading to loss of zzso The factors controlling these two actions are unknown but the result is gene zzso or physical destruction of the zzso zzso The cell survives dependent on the functioning of the single, zzso zzso An error in zzso zzso occurs when the zzso enters the nucleus and targets the sense strand of the wrong zzso The zzso because of the similarity of its short sequence and relaxed zzso can target other zzso which are being zzso This can result in the zzso of the wrong promoter site of a gene or zzso of that zzso In the vast majority of these cases, the zzso zzso will have no effect on cell function or zzso eliminates zzso zzso On a rare occasion, a zzso cell is initiated when zzso zzso switches zzso a gene involved in zzso as well as a gene involved in cell proliferation and DNA damage zzso zzso instability results when the zzso competes for a repeat sequence in the zzso or zzso leading to gross zzso zzso A zzso develops when the zzso zzso targets a zzso zzso or activates a zzso factor, resulting in the translation of a large number of new zzso alien to that zzso This leads to zzso of the zzso a zzso of the zzso code, zzso zzso along a number of specific zzso the gain of zzso and the dissemination of a zzso zzso
