It is shown that CBS results depend zzso on the kind of zzso zzso In fact, the differences between the decisions as a result of applying monetary criteria in USA and zzso can be explained by differences between zzso zzso 

It is concluded that, for prices estimated in zzso the zzso cleaning project in the industrial plant is not feasible under any zzso However, although zzso seems to be a good zzso method, the final decision zzso to the managers, who must weigh up not only the monetary criteria, but factors such as social zzso
