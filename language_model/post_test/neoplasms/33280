An extraordinary variety of potential therapeutic vaccine strategies directed against a wide variety of tumor zzso has been explored in clinical zzso To date, none of these cancer zzso have been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in zzso A significant problem is that the vast majority of such clinical trials are carried out in patients with advanced or zzso zzso The immune systems of these patients are considerably compromised as a result of zzso and zzso zzso Even in cases where patients are zzso in the zzso setting, where there is minimal residual disease, vaccines directed against zzso zzso have failed to mediate zzso of tumors in the overwhelming majority of zzso Recently, we and others have experimented with administering therapeutic cancer vaccines in the preventive zzso This is achieved by zzso at the earliest possible stage of zzso These studies have demonstrated that early vaccination is extremely effective in zzso an zzso immune response that leads to unprecedented improvements in the survival of mice that spontaneously develop zzso Certain human zzso notably prostate zzso and cervical cancer, can currently be detected at very early stages of zzso zzso vaccines are available for these diseases, opening up the possibility of administering zzso early to patients diagnosed with zzso zzso to halt disease zzso In addition, new technologies have become available in the past decade that will soon yield very sensitive and specific diagnostic tests for a plethora of other zzso Earlier detection of these zzso combined with existing vaccines directed against them, will soon make them targets for therapeutic vaccination in the preventive zzso The ability to zzso patients at the very earliest stages of zzso when they have fully competent immune systems, has the potential to cause a paradigm shift in how therapeutic cancer vaccines are tested and used zzso
