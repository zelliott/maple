The application of zzso zzso in the treatment of cancer has known limitations in patients with loss or zzso of human zzso zzso zzso class I expression on tumor zzso These zzso diminish the ability of cancer cells to present tumor peptides to T cells and therefore lead to failure of zzso cancer zzso zzso expression of zzso class I molecules in zzso cells is a frequent event that ranges from total loss of class I molecules to partial loss of zzso zzso or zzso Different mechanisms zzso these zzso and might require different therapeutic zzso A complete characterization of molecular defects may suggest strategies for the selection and follow-up of patients undergoing zzso based zzso Moreover, a precise identification of the mechanism leading to zzso class I defects in patients with cancer will help develop new, personalized zzso treatment zzso Here, we describe several examples showing the necessity and feasibility of making detailed individual analysis of zzso zzso mechanisms based on previously described molecular patterns in different types of zzso We recommend using this approach, at least in some patients, to enhance the therapeutic benefit of cancer zzso
