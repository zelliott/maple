This study emphasizes the importance of zzso zzso in zzso zzso as zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso in cultured tumor zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso B and zzso zzso resulted in cell death suggesting the role of zzso zzso in the survival of zzso zzso Relative zzso death observed in cells zzso with dominant negative zzso of zzso zzso and zzso imply zzso A as playing the major role in cell zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso A zzso zzso a direct downstream zzso of zzso A, by zzso or dominant negative of zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso zzso is involved zzso in the regulation of zzso cell death zzso Moreover, in zzso studies of zzso treatment in animals implanted with zzso zzso cell tumors also resulted in smaller tumor size and induced zzso in the tumor zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells with expression zzso of zzso zzso dominant negative of zzso and zzso resulted in significant smaller tumor mass, further establishing the importance of zzso zzso specifically zzso and its downstream zzso zzso in cell survival and tumor zzso
