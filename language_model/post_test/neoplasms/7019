zzso medicine is the provision of focused zzso zzso zzso and therapeutic efforts according to an zzso genetic zzso The zzso of personalized medicine will require combining a patient's conventional clinical data with zzso zzso zzso This synergistic approach offers tangible benefits, such as heightened specificity in the molecular zzso of cancer zzso improved zzso zzso targeted development of new therapies, novel applications for old therapies, and tailored selection and delivery of zzso 

Our ability to personalize cancer management is rapidly expanding through zzso advances in the zzso zzso The platforms of zzso zzso zzso zzso profiling and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing, and zzso constitute the mechanisms for the molecular assessment of a patient's zzso The complementary data derived during these assessments is processed through zzso analysis to offer unique insights for linking expression profiles to disease zzso tumor response to chemotherapy, and patient zzso Together, these approaches permit improved physician capacity to assess risk, target therapies, and tailor a zzso treatment zzso 

zzso medicine is poised for rapid growth as the insights provided by new zzso models are integrated with current procedures for assessing and treating cancer zzso zzso of these biological platforms will require refinement of zzso and analysis techniques, particularly in clinical pathology, to overcome obstacles in customizing our ability to treat zzso
