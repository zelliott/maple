zzso has been used in biological laboratories for many years to zzso zzso cell zzso and permit zzso or protein zzso It has been shown that the application of zzso electric fields zzso of defined strength will kill off larger cells and select for viable small cells, in samples containing zzso zzso This permits the selective killing of several blood and bone zzso tumor zzso zzso technology is being applied to tumor zzso of zzso zzso in support of high-dose chemotherapy, for the treatment of zzso such as zzso and multiple zzso zzso stem-cell zzso in the setting of zzso zzso such as lymphoma, improves zzso survival if the graft has undergone tumor zzso zzso cells are preserved or zzso To overcome issues of electrical resistance, zzso zzso and large sample volume, a flowing chamber zzso apparatus was designed and constructed for large-scale zzso of clinical quantities of zzso zzso The specifics of this technique are described zzso Treatment of greater than zzso cells is achieved in 30 zzso under zzso flow conditions designed to overcome surface area or resistance issues and to zzso exposure of cells to electric zzso zzso large volume tumor zzso of greater than 3 logs, for zzso of tumor cells and zzso cells, is routinely achieved under defined zzso
