There is limited data on the prevalence and mortality of zzso zzso zzso following zzso zzso 

To evaluate the trends, factors, and mortality of zzso following major cancer zzso 

Patients undergoing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lung zzso zzso or zzso were identified zzso using the zzso zzso Sample between January 1, 1999, and December 30, 2009, resulting in a weighted estimate of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso following major cancer surgery was assessed according to date, patient, and hospital zzso The zzso of zzso zzso were evaluated using zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso showed an estimated annual percentage increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso which contrasts with a zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso annual decrease in mortality in zzso after major cancer zzso In zzso zzso zzso analysis, older age zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso female sex zzso zzso zzso black race zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso index score of 3 or more zzso zzso zzso and Medicaid zzso private zzso zzso zzso zzso Medicare zzso zzso zzso and uninsured zzso zzso zzso status were associated with an increased risk of zzso zzso other zzso and zzso race zzso zzso zzso was associated with a lower risk of zzso Among hospital zzso urban location zzso zzso zzso and teaching status zzso zzso zzso were associated with greater odds of zzso Patients with vs without zzso experienced zzso greater odds of zzso 

During our study period, zzso events following major cancer surgery increased in zzso however, associated zzso mortality zzso zzso zzso detection guidelines and better management of this condition may explain our zzso
