We previously showed that zzso zzso zzso cells acquire zzso class I zzso I) and zzso molecules from zzso zzso cells zzso and act as zzso in stimulation of zzso zzso zzso In this study, we further demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso T zzso cells also acquire zzso I and zzso zzso and zzso molecules by zzso zzso and act as zzso These zzso can play both negative and positive zzso in zzso immune responses by eliminating zzso and neighboring zzso and stimulating zzso zzso central memory T responses and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso effect of zzso is zzso via its zzso zzso and acquired zzso zzso and is specifically targeted to zzso zzso T cells in zzso via its acquired zzso I zzso These principles could be applied to not only zzso zzso but also other immune disorders zzso zzso
