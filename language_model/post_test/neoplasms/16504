zzso zzso zzso bind to zzso zzso receptors zzso by zzso genes zzso to zzso signals to the zzso pathway, the zzso pathway, or the zzso zzso zzso gene is a zzso target gene of zzso in zzso cells, and encodes a zzso zzso with the potential to activate the zzso zzso Here, we isolated human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from gastric cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which showed a zzso substitution zzso zzso without zzso substitution compared with zzso zzso isolated by another zzso zzso zzso consisting of at least 3 zzso was mapped to human zzso zzso by using zzso zzso zzso was more highly expressed in corpus zzso zzso cerebral cortex, and also in several parts within adult brain than in other normal zzso including stomach, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso in 40 human cancer cell lines were lower than that in normal stomach, zzso or zzso zzso zzso was significantly zzso in 4 cases of primary kidney tumors, 1 case each of primary zzso zzso breast, zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso was significantly zzso in 6 cases of colon tumors, 2 cases of primary kidney cancer and breast zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso by zzso in zzso zzso This is the first report on comprehensive expression analyses on zzso zzso
