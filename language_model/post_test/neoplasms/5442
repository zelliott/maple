zzso the distribution of zzso zzso on zzso and normal zzso is essential for selection of targets for cancer zzso Seven zzso zzso potential targets for zzso were studied using a panel of zzso zzso by zzso on zzso tissue sections of 13 types of zzso and 18 normal zzso zzso and zzso were present on most zzso of zzso origin and zzso was also present on B cell zzso zzso was detected only on melanoma while zzso zzso was detected only on small cell lung zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso was strongly expressed on all tested tumors, including zzso of zzso origin and zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid was primarily expressed on zzso and zzso zzso H was present on most zzso of zzso zzso These zzso were also identified in normal zzso zzso zzso was not expressed significantly on any of the normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid were detected in normal brain to varying zzso zzso and zzso H were expressed on the zzso surface of zzso of a variety of zzso The unexpected expression of zzso on a broad range of zzso and normal zzso zzso was confirmed by loss after methanol fixation and by immune thin layer zzso
