zzso zzso zzso zzso a relatively new ambient zzso technique used in mass zzso zzso allows for the direct analysis of samples such as thin tissue zzso to be conducted outside of vacuum in the ambient environment and often without sample zzso zzso has been used in order to systematically characterize zzso which are abundant species in biological tissue zzso zzso play important biological roles and differences in zzso compositions have been seen in diseases such as cancer and Alzheimer's zzso Imaging of thin tissue sections exploits the ability of zzso to study these lipids directly in the biological zzso In imaging zzso zzso a mass spectrum is recorded at each zzso while moving the surface containing the sample so that the entire sample area is zzso The information in these mass zzso can be combined to create a zzso chemical image of the sample, combining information on spatial distribution with information on chemical identity from the characteristic zzso in the mass zzso zzso has been used to image a variety of tissue samples including human liver zzso rat brain, human breast tissue and canine abdominal tumor zzso Comparisons between diseased and normal tissue are made in these zzso
