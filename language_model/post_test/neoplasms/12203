The molecular mechanisms underlying the increase of natural killer zzso cell zzso activity zzso by zzso zzso have not been zzso The aim of this study was to identify potential molecular zzso of zzso zzso effects by exploring the zzso cell gene display induced by this zzso Gene profile was determined by zzso zzso zzso and quantitative real-time zzso In zzso zzso cells resting or zzso with zzso were tested for zzso migration and zzso zzso enhanced zzso levels of cell zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso not zzso by zzso In line with these findings, zzso increased zzso cell in zzso zzso against zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso did not show any significant effect on zzso cell in zzso proliferation and zzso However, gene profile analysis showed that zzso increased the expression of cell zzso genes zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A4 zzso which might support a zzso effect not evident with the in zzso functional zzso Overall, gene profiling allowed us to formulate new hypotheses regarding the molecular pathways underlying the zzso effects of zzso on zzso cells, supporting further investigation aimed at defining its role in cancer immune zzso
