zzso testing for gene zzso associated with specific zzso provides an opportunity for early zzso zzso and intervention zzso zzso & zzso zzso Lifetime risk estimates provided by genetic testing refer to the risk of developing a specific disease within one's zzso and evidence suggests that this is important for the medical choices people make, as well as their future family and financial zzso The present studies tested whether adult men understand the lifetime risks of prostate cancer informed by genetic zzso 

In 2 experiments, adult men were asked to interpret the lifetime risk information provided in statements about risks of prostate zzso zzso format was manipulated such that the most appropriate interpretation of risk statements referred to an absolute risk of cancer in experiment 1 and a relative risk in experiment zzso 

zzso 1 revealed that few men correctly interpreted the lifetime risks of cancer when these refer to an absolute risk of cancer, and zzso levels positively predicted correct zzso The proportion of correct responses was greatly improved in experiment 2 when the most appropriate interpretation of risk statements referred instead to a relative rather than an absolute risk, and zzso levels were less zzso 

zzso of lifetime risk information is often poor because individuals incorrectly believe that these refer to relative rather than absolute risks of zzso
