The treatment of zzso zzso zzso by zzso appears to be safe and reliable with very mild side zzso We have tested zzso as sole treatment in 14 patients with cancer and symptomatic zzso zzso was given zzso in a dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso until two subsequent normal plasma calcium zzso levels were obtained zzso determined zzso The mean duration of treatment was zzso zzso zzso (4 to 11 zzso As expected, there was a significant correlation between initial zzso and duration of therapy zzso less than zzso Mean zzso fell from zzso zzso zzso zzso before zzso to zzso zzso zzso after 4 days of treatment and remained normal four weeks after the start of zzso Four patients relapsed 11 to 31 days after the end of treatment during a one-month zzso This recurrence did not depend on initial zzso length of treatment and duration of zzso Two of these patients were treated successfully with a second course of zzso while in the other two no further treatment was zzso Both mean zzso and zzso decreased significantly when measured seven days after the beginning of the zzso Plasma zzso values remained in the normal range, while zzso rose significantly after a week of treatment from low to normal zzso Plasma zzso decreased significantly zzso less than zzso during the treatment while zzso % increased, suggesting a positive zzso zzso We conclude that short treatments with zzso of zzso zzso are effective and sufficiently zzso even if they are interrupted as soon as normal zzso is zzso
