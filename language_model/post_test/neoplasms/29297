The success of cancer therapy can be difficult to zzso as its efficacy is often predicated upon characteristics of the cancer, treatment, and individual that are not fully understood or are difficult to zzso Monitoring the response of disease to treatment is therefore essential and has traditionally been characterized by changes in tumor zzso However, in many instances, this singular measure is insufficient for predicting treatment effects on patient zzso zzso imaging allows repeated in zzso measurement of many critical molecular features of zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which can be employed for monitoring therapeutic zzso In this review, we examine the current methods for evaluating response to treatment and provide an overview of emerging PET molecular imaging methods that will help guide future cancer zzso
