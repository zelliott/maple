zzso zzso constitute a large family of regulatory zzso involved in the zzso of virtually every cellular zzso zzso of protein zzso has been frequently implicated in zzso zzso Within the family, zzso zzso zzso have received comparatively lesser attention, zzso zzso zzso in terms of their involvement in human zzso Here, we report a large-scale screening of 125 zzso selected to represent all major zzso within the zzso on nine different types of tumors ( approximately 200 zzso by using in zzso zzso on tissue zzso zzso zzso displayed altered levels of transcripts in tumors, frequently with a clear tumor zzso zzso We identified three patterns of zzso in zzso zzso zzso in the absence of expression in the normal zzso (10 zzso zzso zzso in the presence of expression by normal zzso (8 zzso and zzso zzso (3 zzso zzso members of the three classes were subjected to in-depth analysis on larger case collections and showed significant correlations between their altered expression and biological and/or clinical zzso Our findings suggest that zzso in the expression of zzso is a relatively frequent occurrence in human zzso Among the zzso zzso 10 were zzso in normal controls and are therefore ideal candidates for further validation as potential targets of molecular cancer zzso
