zzso zzso is a protein zzso zzso zzso inhibitor that has shown synergistic activity with zzso in zzso models and early stage clinical zzso zzso findings suggested zzso zzso and zzso expression levels may be important zzso of drug sensitivity that would help identify patient populations more likely to benefit from this zzso This pilot study evaluated the biological effects of zzso and zzso zzso combination therapy in zzso solid tumors by comparing zzso and zzso tumor zzso 

Patients with zzso confirmed locally advanced or zzso solid zzso zzso to standard therapies or with no effective therapies available were zzso Patients were zzso to 1 of 4 dosing zzso 1) 30 zzso 100 zzso 2) 36 zzso 100 zzso 3) 30 zzso 150 zzso or 4) 36 zzso 150 zzso of zzso zzso weekly, zzso orally twice daily, zzso 

Of the 38 patients zzso 36 were treated, and 29 were zzso for toxicity and response zzso The combination of zzso and zzso was tolerated in all zzso with the exception of a zzso zzso of grade 3/4 zzso which was manageable with aggressive zzso zzso Seven patients derived clinically meaningful benefit from this combination zzso these patients had significantly lower zzso zzso zzso expression levels than the mean study population level zzso zzso zzso zzso of clinical benefit with zzso zzso content as well as zzso zzso content were zzso However, no significant correlation was zzso 

Despite the small number of patients, these findings support our zzso zzso studies and warrant further clinical investigations using zzso zzso expression as a potential zzso zzso to select for an enriched patient population to study the effects of zzso and zzso inhibitor combination zzso
