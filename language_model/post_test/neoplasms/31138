Standard identification systems usually ensure that biopsy material is correctly associated with a given zzso Sometimes, as when a tumor is unexpectedly found, the provenance zzso of zzso of a tissue sample may be zzso the tissue may have been zzso or contaminated with tissue from another zzso zzso used to confirm tissue provenance include comparing either tissue markers of gender or zzso blood zzso however, these methods have weak zzso zzso Recently, the use of zzso zzso chain reaction zzso techniques has been zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso tissue sections were selected from 17 patients, 8 of whom had zzso either by dividing a biopsy section, using sequential zzso or sequential biopsy and autopsy zzso The resulting 36 samples were coded before zzso In two additional cases, zzso fragments of tumor from one patient were included in the tissue block of benign tissue from another patient, the tumor fragments were identified on zzso zzso separately scraped off the glass slide, and zzso zzso from two clinical cases, one of suspected zzso and one with a suspected zzso of zzso tissue were also zzso Short tandem repeat sequences zzso or zzso are zzso base pair repeats that vary in their repeat number between zzso This variation zzso can be assessed using a zzso A panel of markers of 3 zzso zzso zzso 2, and zzso 19 (on zzso 3, 11, and 15, zzso were zzso DNA was isolated from the samples after zzso zzso and zzso zzso and was then amplified in a radioactive zzso using zzso selected to give a product size ranging from zzso zzso zzso products were zzso on zzso zzso gels, dried, and zzso DNA segments were successfully extracted from all samples but one, which was fixed in zzso zzso By comparing zzso sizes from the panel, all tissue pairs zzso than the zzso zzso were successfully zzso the zzso tumor fragments were correctly zzso and the two clinical problems were zzso zzso are highly zzso and robust zzso well suited to zzso of small portions of tissue zzso and are an effective method to confirm the provenance of benign and zzso biopsy and autopsy zzso
