zzso in zzso zzso potential zzso is an important characteristic of zzso The observation that the enhanced negative zzso potential is prevalent in tumor cell zzso provides a conceptual basis for development of zzso therapeutic drugs and molecular imaging zzso Since plasma and zzso zzso are negative, many zzso organic zzso such as zzso and zzso are zzso driven through these zzso and able to zzso in the energized zzso of tumor zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso have been clinically used for diagnosis of cancer by single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso monitoring of the zzso resistance zzso transport function in tumors of different zzso However, their diagnostic and zzso values are often limited due to their insufficient tumor zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso and high zzso zzso in the chest and abdominal regions zzso tumor zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso represent a new class of PET zzso zzso zzso zzso with good tumor zzso and high tumor zzso This review article will focus on our recent experiences in evaluation of zzso zzso zzso as potential PET zzso The main objective is to illustrate the impact of zzso zzso on physical, chemical, and biological properties of zzso zzso It will also discuss some important issues related to their tumor selectivity and possible tumor zzso zzso
