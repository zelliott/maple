The mortality of zzso male workers employed at least 30 days in zzso in a zzso plant was zzso Ambient zzso taken in the plant between 1974 and 1979 documented a potential for exposure to levels of zzso as high as greater than zzso zzso Vital status was zzso for zzso of the cohort members, and their mortality was compared with expected deaths drawn from the national and local population zzso A statistically significant increase in lung cancer was observed, based on 18 deaths, which was not fully accounted for by possible zzso factors linked to personal habits or zzso zzso This elevated risk, however, could not be attributed specifically to exposure to zzso zzso from zzso cancer zzso deaths observed) and zzso zzso (5 deaths observed) was not substantially higher than zzso The study was limited by information bias due to incomplete work zzso by the small number of deaths from some relevant causes, and by the possibly insufficient length of the observation zzso Therefore these results do not provide sufficient grounds either to link zzso exposure in the plant to the increased cancer risk noted or to exclude that zzso might pose such a risk to humans under certain exposure zzso
