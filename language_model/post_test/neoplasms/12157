This study determined the effect of zzso dietary zzso zzso and tamoxifen zzso alone and in zzso on the growth of zzso human breast cancer zzso in zzso mice with or without zzso zzso zzso 

zzso mice received injection with zzso cells, were implanted with an zzso zzso zzso zzso and fed the zzso diet zzso When tumor reached approximately 40 zzso the zzso implant was removed, and mice were zzso to the following groups and maintained at either low zzso zzso zzso or high zzso level (new zzso zzso zzso for 6 weeks: zzso positive control with new zzso zzso fed zzso zzso negative control with no zzso zzso fed zzso zzso zzso group with zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso fed zzso zzso zzso group fed zzso zzso zzso zzso group with zzso zzso fed zzso zzso zzso growth was monitored zzso 

At low zzso level, zzso zzso the zzso tumor size by zzso zzso zzso tumor initially but later induced an increase so that the tumor size was finally similar to the zzso zzso A tumor zzso zzso was induced by zzso than by zzso zzso At high zzso level, zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the tumor growth by 22, 41, and zzso respectively, compared with the positive zzso zzso tumor size was attributable to reduced tumor cell proliferation and increased zzso 

zzso inhibited the growth of human zzso breast cancer and strengthened the zzso effect of zzso at both low and high zzso zzso
