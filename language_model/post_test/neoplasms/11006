zzso zzso cell damage during radiation therapy may contribute significantly to tumor zzso and treatment zzso Gold zzso zzso delivered zzso to the walls of tumor blood vessels produce zzso short-range zzso during external beam zzso boosting dose to the tumor zzso In this study zzso at the zzso level is used to estimate the anticipated zzso dose enhancement to tumor zzso cells during zzso X-ray zzso 

zzso cells are modeled as thin zzso with zzso zzso attached within the blood zzso The number of zzso zzso per zzso per gray of zzso is zzso at multiple points along the external beam central axis by use of a zzso zzso energy zzso zzso The energy deposited from zzso emissions to the zzso is calculated based on an zzso method incorporating the zzso formula of zzso The zzso dose enhancement factor zzso is the ratio of the overall zzso plus internally zzso dose to zzso cells in the presence of zzso to the dose without zzso (from the external beam zzso 

At zzso depth, the zzso is zzso zzso dose zzso for an zzso zzso concentration of 30 zzso Most of this dose enhancement arises from the low-energy zzso 100 zzso portion of the linear accelerator X-ray zzso Furthermore, for zzso zzso ranging from 7 to 140 zzso zzso values of zzso to zzso zzso dose zzso are zzso 

In contrast to calculations assuming that zzso distributed zzso throughout the target volume zzso our cellular zzso calculations predict a major dose enhancement to tumor zzso from conventional linear accelerator zzso This effect may enable the delivery of zzso therapeutic doses to these sensitive zzso while maintaining established dose constraints for the zzso at zzso
