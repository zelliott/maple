zzso zzso a zzso zzso has been subjected to limited clinical trials since zzso Use of the drug in adults has been curtailed due to sparse reports of effectiveness as well as its zzso zzso zzso severe zzso vomiting and zzso In earlier studies, children given zzso orally in combination with zzso had significant zzso of zzso of acute zzso during maintenance zzso As zzso is zzso and relatively unstable in solution, oral administration does not appear to be ideal for zzso In the trial described in this report, zzso zzso therapy was zzso using zzso zzso to control zzso in 20 children, 17 of whom were zzso following treatment at zzso dose levels ranging from 150 zzso to 520 zzso zzso and zzso the zzso toxicity for adults, was controlled with zzso zzso which has also been observed in adults, did not occur in the children given zzso zzso A maximum tolerated dose was not zzso however, the projected maximum tolerated dose appears to be in excess of 450 zzso zzso was measured in plasma using a zzso zzso zzso The total body zzso plasma zzso and area under the plasma concentration curve zzso were calculated using a zzso zzso The drug is rapidly cleared from plasma zzso 1/2 zzso 3 zzso and its volume of distribution is approximately twice that of total body water in zzso These zzso data, differ from that of adults reported by zzso Specifically, the plasma zzso 1/2 for children is zzso total body clearance zzso and volume of distribution at steady state zzso are zzso In addition, no dose dependency of zzso 1/2, zzso or zzso was observed in this study, and the zzso zzso were linear and zzso Five of nine children with acute leukemia showed improvement, though insufficient for zzso as partial response, and five of eight children with solid tumors also showed zzso Further trials using zzso in combination with zzso or other agents appear zzso
