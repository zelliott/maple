zzso zzso agents zzso are an emerging class of zzso targeting the existing vascular network of solid zzso However, their clinical progression has been hampered because of limited zzso zzso primarily caused by the persistence of surviving cells at the well zzso zzso zzso of tumors, which allows rapid tumor regrowth to zzso In addition, zzso adverse events, including cardiovascular zzso underscore a need for compounds with improved safety zzso Here, we characterize the mechanism of action, zzso zzso and cardiovascular safety profile of zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso displayed increased potency relative to other zzso agents and was highly zzso to tumor zzso zzso induced significant tumor zzso in prostate and breast zzso models in zzso and, in an aggressive zzso model, demonstrated superior tumor growth zzso and a positive therapeutic index relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso It is noteworthy that zzso analysis revealed that zzso disrupted zzso at both the center and periphery of zzso Compared with zzso zzso induced a zzso increase in central zzso area, zzso decrease in zzso and zzso increase in tumor cell zzso in the remaining viable rim 24 h zzso zzso imaging confirmed that zzso rapidly and efficiently blocked blood flow in highly zzso tumor zzso Moreover, cardiovascular effects were evaluated in the zzso zzso and zzso dogs, and cardiovascular toxicity was not predicted to be zzso This zzso profile zzso zzso from the zzso class and identifies the compound as a promising new therapeutic zzso zzso
