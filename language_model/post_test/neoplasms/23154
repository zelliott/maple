A balance between cell proliferation and cell loss is essential for tumor zzso Although up to zzso of cells are lost in late-stage zzso the progression and characteristics of remnant living cells in tumor mass are zzso Here we used molecular imaging to track the progression of living cells in a zzso tumor model, and ex zzso investigated the properties of this population at late-stage zzso The zzso zzso system was used to zzso introduce the dual reporter zzso including zzso red fluorescent protein zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso genes for zzso and zzso imaging of tumor growth in small animals, zzso zzso zzso was used as a zzso for zzso gene expression in zzso The zzso and zzso imaging using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the number of living cells reached the maximum at 1 week after zzso of zzso tumors, and gradually decreased and clustered near the side of the body until 4 weeks accompanied by enlargement of tumor zzso The remnant living cells at late-stage tumor were isolated and investigated ex zzso The results showed that these living cells could form zzso and express cancer stem cell zzso zzso including zzso zzso factor 4, zzso zzso region zzso 2, and zzso genes compared with those cultured in zzso Furthermore, this zzso zzso population was sensitive to zzso applied for the suicide zzso Taken together, the current data suggested that cells escaping from cell loss in late-stage tumors exhibit zzso zzso and zzso may be considered a zzso agent for targeting this population in zzso
