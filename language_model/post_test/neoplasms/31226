To report our experience with inferior zzso zzso zzso filters in pediatric zzso 

Over a zzso period, eight low-profile zzso zzso zzso filters were placed in four male and four female patients aged zzso years zzso 11 zzso zzso were zzso to zzso in six patients, zzso failure in one, and idiopathic zzso zzso zzso in zzso Six of the eight devices placed were titanium Greenfield zzso One zzso and one zzso Nest filter were also zzso Two of the filters were introduced via the right internal jugular vein by zzso and the remainder were placed zzso via the right internal jugular vein or the right common zzso zzso Patients received follow-up abdominal zzso from 2 to 13 months after zzso filter zzso 

All filters were inserted successfully without zzso Three of the patients died during the follow-up zzso two due to underlying brain tumors at 2 and 12 months and a third at 6 weeks due to progressive idiopathic zzso vein and zzso zzso The remaining five patients were all alive and well at follow-up without evidence of zzso zzso pulmonary zzso or filter zzso 

zzso filter placement using available devices for zzso delivery is technically zzso safe, and effective in zzso
