The zzso zzso family protein and tumor zzso zzso is frequently zzso in tumors with zzso instability zzso The zzso often results in a zzso zzso zzso and therefore is generally thought to be beneficial to the development of the zzso Here, we report the identification of a novel zzso zzso zzso which is unique to zzso unstable zzso zzso is generated by a unique combination of a zzso deletion in zzso zzso 3 and alternative zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is only detected in zzso cell lines and primary zzso zzso is a potent cell death zzso but does not directly target zzso In addition, zzso zzso certain zzso tumor cells to a subset of zzso agents, such as zzso Thus, our data provide evidence that zzso and alternative zzso of tumor zzso such as zzso are not always beneficial to tumor development but can be zzso zzso
