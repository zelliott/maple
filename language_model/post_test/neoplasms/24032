There are several major groups of zzso resistance zzso 1) The zzso resistant zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3) zzso I and zzso 4) DNA zzso 5) Drug zzso by zzso zzso zzso In this article the zzso functions of zzso and zzso are described to show how individual zzso contribute to resistance to zzso and zzso zzso Cancer cell lines indicated resistant to zzso drugs, such as zzso C, zzso zzso zzso and their zzso by a high activity of zzso and a low activity of zzso in zzso However, the mechanism of change of these zzso activities is complicated and different in each zzso We show the study on the mechanism of zzso resistance using cancer cell zzso
