In this zzso data are zzso which provide evidence for the biological and clinical significance of zzso zzso and of its relationship to the zzso state of cancer zzso 

zzso transformation is associated with an zzso of numerous zzso genes in the vast majority of human zzso At the same time, zzso activity and zzso zzso milieu are often variable between individual zzso which zzso large variations in treatment response and zzso Currently, there is no genetic or zzso marker for the prediction of the therapeutic response for individual zzso but the zzso value of zzso zzso zzso for the emergence of zzso for patient survival and for zzso has been documented in a number of zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso appears to generate a chemically reduced milieu associated with an zzso of zzso zzso oxygen zzso zzso fixation of DNA damage and induction of zzso Furthermore, highly zzso cells enhance the zzso defense via zzso and zzso can be zzso zzso upon reducing hydrogen zzso The summary of data given here zzso the importance of further research efforts on the link between zzso metabolism and zzso state of cancer zzso
