Italy, like most western zzso is sharply aging and changing its age structure with a striking increase in the oldest segment of the zzso Since age is related to an exponential growth of cancer zzso rates and to a worsening of zzso the progressive aging of the population will zzso in the future, an issue increasingly more important for public zzso The present study is the first effort to present and analyze survival rates in zzso elderly cancer patients in order to provide a starting point for the development of better clinical strategies addressed to the zzso 

The presented data come from a large data set consisting of survival data relating to zzso men and zzso women, aged zzso years at diagnosis, collected by Italian cancer zzso participating in the zzso zzso Relative survival rates of patients have been calculated by sex, zzso age classes and the considered entire age class for overall zzso zzso and the 10 most frequent cancer sites in the zzso 

When all Italian data for all zzso in the zzso year age group were zzso survival rates at 5 years from the diagnosis was zzso and zzso in men and women, zzso As regards specific sites, survival rates below 50% were observed for zzso stomach and zzso cancer at 1 year from zzso At 5 years from diagnosis, the rates were less than 50% for zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso and melanoma zzso in zzso The best survival at 5 years from diagnosis (above zzso was in women for melanoma and corpus zzso and breast zzso For all zzso the prognosis for women was better in each considered age group even though a dramatic decrease in survival with age was observed in both zzso In general, a similar decline in survival with increasing age characterized all considered specific zzso However, at closer zzso the patterns of a decrease revealed some zzso The ratio between the survival rates of zzso vs zzso year age class indicated that the sites with the greatest advantage of survival for younger patients zzso zzso zzso were zzso lung and melanoma zzso in zzso whereas the least advantage was observed for zzso corpus zzso breast and zzso By calendar zzso excluding zzso zzso for women, an increase in survival was observed for all considered sites, improving an encouraging successful trend in diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
