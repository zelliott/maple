Previous studies have provided conflicting conclusions concerning the efficacy of improving protein balance in patients by standard intravenous nutrition zzso zzso zzso zzso which is either explained by zzso nutritional regimens or insensitive clinical zzso The aim of the present study was therefore to evaluate the effects on the initiation of translation of skeletal muscle proteins by standard overnight zzso A total of 12 patients who underwent standard surgery were zzso zzso was provided as an zzso treatment by constant infusion zzso zzso of body zzso (30 zzso of body zzso zzso patients served as zzso zzso zzso muscle zzso were taken at the time of the zzso The zzso state of the proteins for initiation of translation was zzso Plasma zzso and serum insulin, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fatty zzso zzso fatty zzso were not significantly altered during zzso infusion, whereas total plasma zzso acids increased, as shown by increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso Overnight zzso increased the formation of active zzso (where zzso is zzso zzso complexes zzso whereas the zzso complex zzso zzso zzso was moderately decreased zzso zzso increased the amount of the most zzso form of zzso zzso and increased the amount zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso In conclusion, an overnight zzso constant infusion of standard zzso altered initiation factor complexes, indicating zzso of the initiation of protein translation in zzso zzso muscle in the presence of increased plasma zzso acid levels, but without a zzso increase in energy zzso and zzso In contrast with our results from previous studies, the methodology used in the present study appears to be more sensitive in reflecting directional changes in human muscle protein synthesis compared with traditional methods, particularly based on zzso of zzso acid zzso
