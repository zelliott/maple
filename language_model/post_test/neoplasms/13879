Several zzso in the United States are potential candidates to deliver beams of intermediate energy zzso for zzso At this time, zzso as compared to zzso appear to be the more effective means of tailoring the flux of these zzso The objective is to sufficiently reduce the flux of fast zzso while producing enough intermediate energy zzso for zzso At the University of Missouri Research zzso zzso the code zzso has recently been used to calculate doses in a zzso First, zzso beams of 1, 35, and 1000 zzso zzso were analyzed to determine doses and advantage depths in the zzso Second, a high quality beam that had been designed to fit in the zzso column of the zzso was zzso zzso calculations of the dose in phantom in this beam confirmed previous calculations and showed that this beam would be a nearly ideal one with zzso of the desired energy and also a high zzso zzso However, installation of this beam will require a significant modification of the zzso column of the zzso zzso a second beam that is less difficult to build and zzso but of lower zzso zzso has been designed to fit in zzso port zzso This beam is designed using inexpensive zzso zzso and zzso The doses calculated in the phantom placed in this beam show that it will be satisfactory for sample tests, animal tests, and possible initial patient zzso Producing this beam will require only modest modifications of the existing zzso
