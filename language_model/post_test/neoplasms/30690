The authors assessed the zzso zzso of two zzso instruments recently applied to the measurement of the utilities of health states after different treatment zzso for zzso The first instrument measures the strengths of preferences concerning a choice between a zzso policy, and treatment with zzso after an initial surgical zzso procedure for early breast zzso The second measures the strengths of preferences concerning a choice between two hypothetical surgical treatment outcomes in cancer of the zzso with different probabilities of expected five-year zzso Both measure the strength of a zzso treatment preference given probabilities of zzso costs and zzso The subjects were zzso technicians zzso zzso zzso and cancer patients zzso zzso zzso who were interviewed in weeks 2 and 4 of zzso The zzso zzso of both instruments were inconsistent and moderately high, with zzso rank correlations ranging from zzso to zzso and weighted zzso ranging from zzso to zzso To investigate whether the start of treatment with zzso influenced the utilities that patients assigned to health states, the same procedure was applied in another, comparable, group of patients with cancer zzso zzso zzso For this group, the first assessment was made prior to the start of treatment and the second during the second week of radiation zzso The scores of this group of patients indeed appeared to be less stable than the scores of the patients assessed in weeks 2 and 4 of zzso However, the instability of the scores could have been the result of test zzso
