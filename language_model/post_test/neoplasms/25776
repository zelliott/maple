The standard technique for the detection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a large proportion of the zzso The more intensive the search for zzso the larger the number of zzso zzso Most of these newly detected zzso are of microscopic size zzso As a result of a more accurate zzso zzso staging, more patients have a higher stage of disease zzso zzso In addition to direct methods for revealing zzso zzso indirect molecular methods such as the zzso chain reaction have become zzso These methods are extremely sensitive but possibly have an unacceptable low zzso zzso is needed when introducing techniques for molecular zzso The clinical significance of newly detected zzso is yet ill zzso zzso to the recent introduction of the zzso zzso procedure zzso zzso are much more zzso zzso This may lead to stage migration for a substantial number of women and it is yet unclear whether this is to their zzso The results of zzso research to determine the clinical significance of zzso zzso should not lag behind the ever increasing sensitivity of detection zzso
