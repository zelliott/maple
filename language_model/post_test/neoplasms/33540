We have developed a highly sensitive, zzso zzso zzso zzso for human zzso zzso that is specific for the intact, zzso biologically active zzso zzso This zzso has several technical zzso it does not detect even high zzso of inactive zzso fragments, results are available within 24 zzso and the detection limit for intact hormone is low (1 zzso The zzso readily measures zzso of zzso in all healthy subjects and zzso these values from low or zzso zzso values observed in clinical situations in which zzso zzso is expected to be zzso We found complete separation of results from 37 patients with surgically proven zzso and those from 23 patients with zzso associated with zzso the latter having zzso values at or below the lower limits of normal for this zzso The sensitivity, zzso and rapid turnaround time of this zzso zzso should advance the laboratory evaluation of patients with disorders of calcium zzso
