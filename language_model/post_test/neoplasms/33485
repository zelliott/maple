zzso anemia is an inherited zzso instability syndrome associated with progressive bone zzso failure leading to death or the requirement for zzso stem cell zzso acute zzso zzso and solid zzso Prior zzso studies have zzso the risks of bone zzso failure, acute zzso leukemia and solid tumors, but these estimates have not been zzso 

We assembled a cohort of 181 patients with zzso anemia mostly from zzso We calculated the ratio of observed to expected zzso and the risks of bone zzso failure, acute zzso zzso and solid tumors by zzso 

The first adverse event was bone zzso failure in 66 patients, acute zzso leukemia in 14 patients and solid tumors in 10 zzso The ratio of observed to expected zzso was 44 for all zzso 26 for all solid tumors, and zzso for acute zzso zzso these increased risks were statistically zzso zzso elevated ratios of observed to expected zzso were observed for zzso zzso zzso zzso head and neck zzso breast zzso and brain (23) zzso Absent or abnormal zzso and a zzso zzso zzso score, were significant risk factors for bone zzso zzso The cumulative zzso of bone zzso failure by the age of 10 years varied from zzso in the lowest bone zzso failure risk group to zzso in the zzso The relative hazard of bone zzso failure was significantly higher in zzso group G versus A zzso zzso and in C versus A zzso zzso 

zzso from the German zzso zzso zzso cohort validate prior risk estimates, and strongly support the concept that zzso anemia is a highly zzso cancer zzso syndrome with early onset of acute zzso leukemia and slightly later onset of specific solid zzso
