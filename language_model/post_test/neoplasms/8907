To evaluate the in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso through comparison to zzso and zzso zzso 

The reactions of zzso with corresponding zzso zzso gave rise to complexes zzso The crystal structures of complexes 1-3 were determined by zzso X-ray zzso zzso The in zzso zzso of zzso and complexes 1-3 against five human cancer cell lines were evaluated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso 1-3 have similar zzso zzso The 50% zzso concentration zzso of complex 1 against zzso cells was zzso zzso that of complex 2 against zzso cells was zzso zzso those of complex 3 on zzso and zzso cells were zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

The three zzso complexes exhibited significantly enhanced zzso zzso zzso and corresponding zzso zzso
