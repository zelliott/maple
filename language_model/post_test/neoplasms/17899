In zzso the zzso checkpoint zzso is a ubiquitous safety device that ensures the zzso of zzso segregation in zzso The zzso prevents zzso zzso and zzso and its dysfunction is implicated in zzso Recent molecular analyses have begun to shed light on the complex interaction of the checkpoint proteins with zzso that mediate the binding of zzso zzso to zzso in zzso These studies are finally starting to reveal the mechanisms of checkpoint zzso and zzso during zzso zzso
