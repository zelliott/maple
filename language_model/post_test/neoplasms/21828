The zzso binding protein zzso zzso is a key zzso factor involved in late differentiation events of several cell zzso Besides acting as a classical zzso factor, zzso is also a zzso inhibitor of zzso growth in most cell lines zzso In line with its zzso properties, zzso has been shown to interact with, and alter the activities of, several cell cycle related proteins and a number of models as to the zzso of zzso growth repression have been zzso More recently, several reports have indicated that zzso acts as a zzso zzso in the zzso system and that zzso within zzso is sufficient to induce zzso Here, we will review these data and probe the possibility that zzso also act as a zzso zzso in other zzso zzso
