To determine the maximum tolerated dose, zzso and potential zzso activity of zzso zzso an zzso agent with enhanced in zzso zzso activity as compared with zzso zzso when given in combination with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to patients with advanced zzso 

zzso patients with advanced zzso were treated with escalating doses of zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso following three different subsequently developed zzso Schedule 1 was patterned after the zzso regimen, a combination chemotherapy program with activity against different zzso zzso and consisted of zzso 40 zzso days zzso zzso 3 zzso days zzso A, 30 zzso day, day 2; C, 70 zzso day 2; repeated every 28 zzso zzso 2 and 3 were designed to avoid observed zzso toxicity on schedule 1 consisting of transient zzso of serum zzso levels and delayed zzso Schedule 2 consisted of zzso 40 or 60 zzso zzso days 1 and 15; zzso 3 zzso days 2 and 15; A, 30 zzso day 2; C, 30 zzso days 1 and 2; zzso every 28 zzso Schedule 3 consisted of zzso 60 to 120 zzso day 1; zzso 3 zzso day 2; A, 30 zzso day 2; C, 30 zzso days 1 and 2; zzso every 21 zzso zzso 5 zzso was given to all patients zzso until the absolute zzso count was greater than zzso zzso Three patients were treated on schedule 1, 10 on schedule 2 (four at an E dose of 40 zzso and six at an E dose of 60 zzso and 24 on schedule 3 (six at each of the following E zzso 60, 80, 100, and 120 zzso 

zzso zzso of grade 3 to 4 zzso and transient zzso of serum zzso values were observed in two of three patients treated on schedule zzso A zzso toxicity of grade 3 to 4 zzso was noted in two of six patients treated on schedule 2 at an zzso dose of 60 zzso Two of six patients treated on schedule 3 at an zzso dose of 120 zzso had a zzso toxicity of grade 3 zzso (one zzso and grade 3 zzso (one zzso zzso of 37 patients with zzso or measurable disease had a response to treatment zzso rate zzso zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso Nine of 15 patients with zzso zzso cell lung cancer responded, including one complete zzso zzso rate zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso A median survival of 517 days zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso survival rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was seen in patients with advanced zzso cell lung zzso 

The maximum tolerated dose and the recommended phase II dose of zzso is 100 zzso when administered as part of the zzso program following schedule zzso Promising zzso activity against zzso cell lung zzso was observed, and a phase II study is zzso
