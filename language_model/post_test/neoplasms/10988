zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging play an important role in the zzso of functioning parts of zzso or zzso but an accurate and zzso zzso is still a challenging zzso In this work, an innovative zzso zzso method for zzso zzso has been proposed and implemented for a zzso zzso This method, which is based on experimental zzso zzso zzso also the recovery zzso zzso of the imaging system, so it has been called recovering zzso zzso method zzso The possibility to employ zzso Carlo zzso simulations for system zzso was also zzso 

The zzso is an zzso zzso coded using zzso after an initial rough estimate of the volume of interest, the following calculations are zzso zzso the corresponding zzso ratio zzso is measured and corrected by means of the zzso zzso zzso the threshold corresponding to the amended zzso value and the volume estimate is then found using zzso zzso zzso new volume estimate is obtained by image zzso The process goes on until zzso The zzso was implemented for an zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso system, using a zzso phantom and several test zzso Two zzso codes were tested to simulate the zzso zzso zzso and zzso For zzso test images consisting of hot spheres and some anatomical structures of the zzso head phantom were simulated with zzso zzso Additional test objects zzso and zzso were also zzso zzso Finally, the zzso was applied to evaluate three cases of brain zzso and two cases of high grade zzso 

Comparing experimental thresholds and those obtained by zzso simulations, a maximum difference of about zzso was found, within the errors zzso zzso and zzso zzso for volumes zzso or zzso 5 zzso or zzso 5 zzso zzso Also for the zzso data, the comparison showed differences (up to zzso within the assigned error zzso zzso zzso test demonstrated that the zzso results (in terms of thresholds or zzso at various zzso obtained by zzso simulations were indistinguishable from those obtained zzso The accuracy in volume determination for the simulated hot spheres was between zzso and zzso in the range zzso zzso whereas for volumes less than 4 zzso (in the range 1-3 zzso the difference increased abruptly reaching values greater than zzso For the zzso head zzso errors ranged between zzso and zzso For the experimental test images, the accuracy level was within zzso zzso for volumes in the range zzso zzso The preliminary test of application on patients evidenced the suitability of the method in a clinical zzso 

The zzso zzso of tumor volume may reduce the acquisition time required for the experimental zzso Analysis of images of several simulated and experimental test objects, zzso head phantom and clinical cases demonstrated the zzso zzso zzso and speed of the proposed zzso Nevertheless, studies concerning tumors of irregular shape and/or zzso distribution of the background activity are still in zzso
