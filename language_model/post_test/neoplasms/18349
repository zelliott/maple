The tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso member LIGHT has potent zzso activities through zzso of the immune response, and it is a promising candidate for use in cancer zzso However, there are no reports of the zzso effects of LIGHT protein in zzso because of the lack of easy, efficient methods of manufacturing this zzso Here, we developed a method of manufacturing zzso LIGHT protein using zzso coli through zzso of inclusion zzso we then evaluated the zzso activity of the zzso LIGHT protein expressed in zzso coli showed the same biological activities and binding affinities to its receptors as did LIGHT expressed in zzso zzso In addition, zzso injection of LIGHT significantly suppressed tumor growth, with zzso of zzso zzso cells in the regional zzso zzso and zzso These results indicate that LIGHT protein efficiently evokes the systemic zzso immune response, and thus zzso tumor zzso
