To investigate the zzso and zzso of high-dose intravenous zzso zzso 

Phase 1, zzso zzso study in patients with zzso 

A zzso cancer treatment zzso 

Fourteen patients (6 zzso with solid tumors that were unresponsive to standard therapy received 31 courses of zzso 

zzso zzso was administered in doses of 2, 3, 4, zzso 7, zzso 10, 12, 15, or 20 zzso as a continuous infusion over 48 zzso Patients also received zzso plus zzso for 24 hours before the start of and during the zzso zzso If no zzso zzso were encountered, subsequent doses were zzso Blood samples were collected at 24 and 48 hours after the start of the infusion, and hourly for 4 hours after stopping the zzso zzso was collected in five patients during the infusion and for 24 hours after stopping zzso Blood for measuring peripheral white blood cells was collected before and at the end of the infusion in seven patients to measure DNA chain breaks due to incorporation of zzso 

zzso was measured in plasma by zzso liquid zzso and in urine zzso polarization zzso Its incorporation into DNA was measured by determining DNA strand breakage in peripheral white blood cells using zzso zzso zzso models were fit to plasma zzso zzso using extended least squares zzso zzso high-dose zzso was generally well zzso with adverse effects related to large amounts of free water administered during the zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso values were total clearance zzso zzso zzso volume of distribution zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso There was considerable zzso zzso in total drug zzso Although zzso exposure increased zzso with increasing dose, two of three patients receiving the highest dose (20 zzso had markedly low total drug zzso The relation between the percentage of abnormal DNA in peripheral white blood cells and zzso area under the plasma zzso versus time curve was described by the zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of high-dose zzso administered by continuous infusion to patients with cancer are similar to those reported with lower doses in patients with infection due to the human zzso zzso Further study of potential zzso zzso behavior at doses above 20 zzso is zzso The high zzso zzso in zzso clearance results in variable levels of exposure in zzso and indicates the need for zzso or zzso study designs in the further evaluation of the agent's zzso zzso
