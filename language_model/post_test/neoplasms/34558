Almost all countries that have national health insurance schemes face financial zzso A better understanding of the financial burden that cancer places on Taiwan's National Health Insurance zzso is important for helping policy makers to plan under scarce zzso zzso This study attempts to estimate lifetime health expenditure for patients with 17 types of major zzso 

A total of zzso patients, each of whom was registered in Taiwan during 1990 to 2001 as having one of 17 major types of zzso were zzso All of them were followed until the end of zzso zzso Carlo simulation was used to extrapolate survival for up to 600 months to derive the life expectancy or lifetime survival function after diagnosis for different zzso The average annual health expenditure per case for each cancer type was calculated by using data from the zzso reimbursement zzso The lifetime health expenditure per case was estimated by zzso the monthly survival probability by the average monthly health zzso adjusting for the annual discount rate and the medical care inflation zzso By incorporating the number of annual zzso cases, the total lifetime health expenditure can also be zzso 

Of the 17 zzso zzso it was found that leukemia had the highest average annual health expenditure per case zzso zzso as well as the highest lifetime health expenditure per case zzso zzso without zzso zzso Breast cancer had the highest total lifetime health expenditure zzso million zzso because of the longer life expectancy and chronic zzso Furthermore, zzso cancer had the second highest total lifetime health expenditure zzso million zzso due to its high zzso 

The proposed method is a feasible way of zzso lifetime health expenditure for cancer patients even under high zzso zzso This would be helpful for zzso assessment of cancer prevention programs and for policy zzso
