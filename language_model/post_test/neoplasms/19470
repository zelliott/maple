zzso is a zzso of zzso used in zzso in paper zzso in water treatment, and as a soil zzso The zzso can cause several toxic effects and has the potential for human exposure either through the environment or from occupational zzso Recently, additional concern for the potential toxicity of zzso in humans has arisen with the finding of zzso formation in some processed zzso It has been established that following chronic exposure, rats exhibited an increase in the zzso of adrenal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso This has raised increased concerns regarding the zzso risk to humans from zzso zzso Studies examining the DNA zzso of zzso have been performed and have had differing zzso The tissue and organ pattern of zzso development seen in the rat following zzso exposure is not consistent with that seen with other strictly DNA zzso zzso Based on the pattern of zzso development, it appears that zzso is targeting zzso sensitive zzso In the current monograph, studies on the effect of zzso on DNA zzso and on altered cell growth in the target zzso in the rat are zzso DNA synthesis was examined in zzso rats treated with zzso zzso 2, or 15 zzso for 7, 14, or 28 zzso zzso increased DNA synthesis in the target zzso zzso zzso zzso adrenal zzso at all doses and time points zzso In contrast, in a zzso tissue zzso no increase in DNA synthesis was zzso zzso of DNA damage using single cell gel zzso (the zzso zzso showed an increase in DNA damage in the target zzso but not in zzso tissue zzso In addition, a cellular transformation model, (the Syrian zzso zzso zzso cell zzso transformation zzso was used to examine potential mechanisms for the observed zzso of zzso zzso cell studies showed that zzso zzso zzso by zzso was important in the cell transformation zzso Treatment with a zzso donor compound zzso reduced zzso transformation while depletion of zzso zzso resulted in an enhancement of zzso In zzso zzso caused both an increase in DNA synthesis and DNA damage in zzso zzso and cells suggesting that DNA zzso and cell zzso in concert, may contribute to the observed zzso zzso in the rat and has implication on the possible risk for human zzso zzso
