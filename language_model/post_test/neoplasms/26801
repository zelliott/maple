zzso zzso zzso has been suggested to function as a zzso zzso zzso zzso that activates multiple signaling zzso especially in cancer zzso By contrast, the current study establishes a clear correlation between the zzso zzso growth zzso concentration in human cancer cells and the Ki for the zzso of activity of zzso human zzso zzso 

The in zzso growth zzso effects of seven cardiac zzso including five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and their respective zzso zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso and their respective zzso zzso were determined by means of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso effects were zzso by means of quantitative zzso The binding affinity of ten of the 14 compounds under study was determined with respect to human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso releases and oxygen consumption rates were also determined in cancer cells treated with these various cardiac zzso 

Although zzso steroid zzso usually display weaker binding affinity and in zzso zzso activity than the corresponding zzso the current study demonstrates that the zzso zzso zzso pair is at odds with respect to this zzso In addition, while some cardiac steroid zzso zzso zzso but not the zzso display a higher binding affinity for the zzso and zzso than for the zzso complex, both zzso and its zzso zzso display zzso higher binding affinity for zzso than for the zzso and zzso zzso Finally, the current study highlights a common feature for all zzso steroids analyzed here, namely a dramatic reduction in the oxygen consumption rate in zzso and zzso cells, reflecting a direct impact on zzso zzso zzso 

Altogether, these data show that the binding affinity of the zzso and zzso under study is usually higher for the zzso and zzso than for the zzso zzso complex, zzso for zzso and its zzso form, zzso with zzso being as potent as zzso in zzso in zzso cancer cell zzso
