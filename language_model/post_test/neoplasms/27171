Cancer progression is driven by genetic and zzso events giving rise to zzso of cell zzso and by selection forces that shape the changing composition of zzso The selection forces are dynamic and depend on many zzso The cells favored by selection are said to be more zzso zzso They tend to leave more viable offspring and spread through the zzso What cellular characteristics make certain cells more fit than others? What combinations of the zzso characteristics and zzso characteristics make the zzso cells win the evolutionary zzso In this review we concentrate on two zzso characteristics of zzso their zzso potential and their zzso We show that migration has a direct positive impact on the ability of a single zzso cell to invade a pre-existing zzso Thus, a decrease in the zzso potential can be compensated by an increase in cell zzso We further demonstrate that the neutral zzso (the set of all types with the invasion probability equal to that of the host zzso remain zzso under the increase of system size (for large system zzso thus making the invasion probability a universal characteristic of the zzso selection zzso We list very general conditions under which the optimal zzso is just one single strategy zzso leading to a zzso type invading the zzso or a large set of strategies that differ by their zzso zzso and migration zzso but have a zzso zzso In the latter case the evolutionary competition will result in a highly zzso zzso
