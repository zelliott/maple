It is clear that zzso cause zzso The implicated mechanism is zzso That is, a zzso series of zzso is zzso to effect the cellular zzso upon which natural selection acts to yield increasingly zzso zzso leading ultimately to zzso zzso It is no wonder then that the zzso zzso is considered zzso having evolved via random zzso zzso zzso however, has also been depicted as something less than foreign, bordering on zzso This is because cancer shares zzso and invasive qualities with the native zzso processes of zzso and adult tissue zzso A question then zzso If key features of zzso already naturally exist within zzso programs, why reinvent this zzso via zzso zzso schemes rather than reactivate it largely en zzso Indeed, as will be zzso zzso do harbor a zzso potential capable of zzso Specifically, this capability is maintained by stem cells zzso inherited such from embryonic zzso zzso controlled by a zzso favoring perpetual rearing by zzso stem cells of zzso progeny for orderly renewal over zzso zzso normally zzso stem cells, when amid zzso disruption to local surroundings, produce progeny tending by default toward zzso zzso over zzso Because such zzso zzso act zzso zzso this zzso state is potentially zzso but subsequent zzso zzso can impair particular zzso zzso already zzso from zzso Thus, a scenario wherein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso autonomously and then zzso slow its zzso cell zzso commonly zzso as zzso may constitute a zzso mechanism for the genesis of zzso that are stem cell zzso
