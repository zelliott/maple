A cell cycle zzso zzso model has been developed and used to investigate the effects of zzso drugs on the proliferation of zzso The drug effects simultaneously considered are zzso zzso killing and cycle zzso killing of cells, zzso progression delay of cells through the cell cycle zzso which may bring about an zzso of cells in various zzso of the cell cycle, and zzso zzso of cell cycle zzso These effects are analyzed in terms of possible variations in the behavior of cell kinetic parameters zzso cell cycle times, cell loss rate, and growth zzso and are implemented in the model specifying proper functional forms for the zzso The zzso of drug distribution in a zzso system is also described by a zzso model and the factors affecting drug action are zzso formulated as a function of drug zzso zzso is carried out to examine the effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the cell cycle and proliferation zzso of zzso zzso and the results of the simulation compare favorably with available experimental zzso Also discussed are the sensitivity of drug effects to variation in dosage schedule and the different zzso of drug actions exerted on each cell cycle zzso
