The aims of the investigation were: 1) to determine if there are defects in zzso 2 zzso 2) regulation either on zzso zzso or non zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso in cancer patients, in order to ascertain the role of zzso 2 in this disease, and 2) to carry out preliminary experiments for a direct quantitative evaluation of zzso zzso 2 production by zzso cultures of cancer zzso An assessment of zzso zzso was also performed with zzso zzso in a selected group of zzso A total of 159 patients entered the zzso Cancer sites were: zzso zzso breast, zzso lung zzso 25; zzso 18; and zzso zzso In the former 3 cancer sites, staging showed localized or only locally advanced disease and in the later 2 sites it showed zzso zzso Our results provided evidence that the cancer patients exhibit a T cell functional zzso which zzso during tumor growth, so that the localized disease shows a zzso zzso and advanced disease shows a high-grade zzso Our data also clearly suggested that the factor involved with a primary role in this functional immune impairment is the zzso 2 zzso In our study we have not found a substantial difference of activity between zzso and zzso zzso 2, although the comparison of the relative activities of the two types of zzso 2 is not easy to make, since they are expressed in different zzso however the zzso one appeared to be slightly more active, probably for the higher zzso Our data also seem to support the perspective of the in zzso therapeutic administration of zzso 2 in cancer zzso
