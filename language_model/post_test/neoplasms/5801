Many strategies for experimental zzso of zzso aim at inducing and expanding zzso zzso zzso One of the most promising approaches uses zzso zzso zzso zzso which are able to accumulate and activate human zzso cells at the tumor zzso Human resting peripheral zzso or T cells targeted by appropriate zzso to tumor cells expressing a zzso zzso display multiple signs of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso peptides and zzso and induce an efficient tumor cell zzso in zzso Moreover, zzso zzso which were treated by zzso zzso zzso and human peripheral blood zzso had complete zzso of established tumors and most or all animals were cured by human zzso or zzso zzso zzso Local tumor zzso zzso of zzso was demonstrated, and enhanced zzso and zzso expression together with the results of zzso experiments suggest both mechanisms as the major contributors to the zzso machinery of zzso zzso zzso in zzso The encouraging results of this approach, which is able to cure animals with even advanced zzso tumors, together with the local zzso zzso cell zzso which suggests minimal side effects, warrant the clinical evaluation of this zzso zzso As zzso from tumor patients can be adequately activated by the respective zzso the clinical application of zzso promises to become a safe, efficient and simple approach which should be readily zzso to the treatment of human zzso that cannot be cured by standard zzso
