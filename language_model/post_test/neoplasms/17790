Many zzso zzso result in the abnormal regulation of protein zzso involved in the progression throughout the cell division zzso The zzso zzso zzso family has received special attention due to their function as sensors of the zzso signals and their central role in cell zzso These zzso are frequently zzso in human cancer most frequently due to zzso of their zzso partners or zzso of the zzso zzso A plethora of zzso zzso zzso have been characterized in the last years and some of them are currently under clinical zzso Other zzso protein zzso such as the Aurora proteins zzso Aurora A and zzso or zzso zzso zzso are receiving increased attention as putative cancer zzso Other less studied zzso zzso such zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins might also be relevant candidates as new targets of interest in cancer therapy since they play relevant roles on zzso progression and the zzso zzso Although targeting cell cycle zzso is an efficient procedure to arrest cell zzso the best strategy to zzso and specifically inhibit tumor cell proliferation is not obvious zzso Thus, some cell cycle zzso may be of interest as targets to abrogate checkpoints and favor zzso cell death in tumor zzso New zzso and genetic studies are required to clarify the use of these zzso as targets in new opportunities to improve cancer zzso
