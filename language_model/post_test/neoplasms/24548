zzso are the special zzso that forms the ends of zzso consisting of zzso repeats and associated zzso zzso protect the ends from degradation and zzso and are essential for zzso zzso Both a minimal length of zzso repeats and the zzso proteins are required for zzso zzso zzso is a DNA zzso that specifically zzso zzso in this way regulating zzso length and zzso A minimal zzso length is required to maintain tissue zzso On one hand, critically short zzso trigger loss of cell viability and premature death in mice deficient for zzso zzso Furthermore, altered functioning of zzso and zzso proteins is present in some human premature zzso syndromes and zzso A new mouse model with critically short zzso has been generated by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These mice show short zzso in the presence of zzso activity, leading to premature aging and increased zzso Short zzso in zzso mice can be rescued in the absence of the zzso zzso indicating that this zzso rapidly degrades zzso in the presence of increased zzso zzso zzso mice represent a new tool to understand the consequences of critical zzso zzso a zzso genetic background, more closely resembling human cancer and aging zzso
