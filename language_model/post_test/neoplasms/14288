A simple, robust and specific liquid zzso tandem mass zzso zzso method was developed and validated to determine the concentration of zzso zzso which is usually regarded as a stress zzso in mouse zzso Since Cort is an zzso hormone, a zzso zzso strategy was adopted using the stable zzso zzso as a surrogate of the authentic zzso to generate the zzso zzso With zzso as the internal standard, the zzso were extracted with zzso ethanol and zzso zzso zzso and separated on a zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso column using a mobile phase consisting of zzso zzso acid in zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in multiple reaction monitoring mode with an zzso zzso source operated in positive zzso zzso The standard zzso were linear zzso zzso zzso over the dynamic range of zzso zzso with a lower limit of zzso of zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso were less than zzso of the relative standard zzso This method was further used for analysis of serum samples from zzso zzso mice before and after the treatment of zzso zzso of the zzso and its application to the analysis demonstrated that the method was zzso to determine meaningful changes in Cort zzso in serum samples of the zzso mice for the stress status zzso
