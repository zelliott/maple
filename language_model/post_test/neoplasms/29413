Several studies have shown that zzso zzso is zzso or zzso in various human zzso and cancer zzso Although the function of zzso is currently unknown, high zzso expression zzso with improved prognosis in high-grade zzso gastric cancer and zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso studies have revealed that zzso of zzso in zzso causes a significant reduction in their zzso The aim of this study was to examine levels of zzso zzso in several human zzso with focus on breast cancer, by examining affected and normal zzso 

By zzso a human Cancer zzso zzso with a radioactive probe against zzso we evaluated the level of zzso zzso in 154 paired normal and tumor samples encompassing 19 different human zzso Furthermore, we used quantitative real-time zzso to zzso the levels of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cancer and breast cancer, using a distinct set of normal and tumor zzso 

From the Cancer zzso zzso we saw that the level of zzso zzso was reduced by at least zzso in almost a third of the tumor samples, compared to the normal counterpart, and we observed a marked decreased level in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso However, a zzso correction showed that none of the zzso showed a significant reduction in zzso zzso expression in tumor tissue compared to normal zzso Using quantitative zzso we observed a significant reduction in the level of zzso zzso in a distinct set of tumor samples from both zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso and breast cancer zzso zzso zzso compared with normal zzso zzso zzso was not significantly altered in breast cancer or in zzso zzso cancer, compared with normal zzso In zzso zzso no correlation was found between zzso and zzso zzso levels, but in breast tissue we found a zzso significant correlation with a positive zzso in both normal and tumor zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso zzso are regulated zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso is reduced in many different human zzso Using quantitative zzso we have verified a reduction in zzso cancer and zzso for the first time, that zzso zzso is statistically significantly zzso in breast zzso Furthermore, our observations indicate that other zzso such as zzso and zzso can have lower levels of zzso zzso in tumor tissue compared to normal zzso
