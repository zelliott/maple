In this review, we focus on the zzso applications of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso other than zzso zzso and the novel quantitative approaches in PET zzso zzso zzso PET zzso can be broadly zzso into 3 groups: those labeled with zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso and zzso are labeled with different zzso zzso zzso involved in fatty acid zzso protein zzso zzso acid transport zzso and zzso linked to zzso acid zzso These zzso are also labeled with specific zzso for zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso or zzso The other zzso zzso can be labeled with zzso zzso zzso zzso and are aimed to detect cell zzso bone metabolism and zzso Many of these have shown promising results in the management of various zzso where zzso has limited zzso These zzso have more specific mechanism of zzso and is likely be investigated in the near zzso In the era of fusion imaging, novel approaches for accurate quantitative analysis include partial volume correction for measured values in small zzso zzso point and delayed PET imaging, and global zzso activity for assessment of various stages of zzso Major changes are likely to occur in the future that may overcome deficiencies that are associated with the current quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso
