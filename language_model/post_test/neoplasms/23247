To perform dynamic tumor tracking zzso with the zzso zzso a correlation model zzso zzso zzso zzso between the displacement of infrared markers on the abdominal wall and the three-dimensional position of a tumor indicated by a minimum of three implanted gold markers is zzso However, the gold markers cannot be detected successfully on zzso images under the following situations: zzso overlapping of the gold zzso and zzso a low intensity ratio of the gold marker to its zzso In the present study, the authors proposed a method to readily determine the optimal zzso monitoring angle for creating a zzso model utilizing zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso mounting two zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso can separately rotate the zzso along an zzso zzso and the zzso along its vertical zzso The optimal zzso monitoring angle was determined on CT images by minimizing the zzso of water equivalent path lengths zzso on the zzso lines passing all of the gold markers while rotating the zzso and the zzso The zzso monitoring angles at which the distances between the gold markers were within 5 zzso at the zzso level were excluded to prevent false detection of the gold markers in consideration of respiratory zzso First, the relationship between the zzso zzso zzso and the intensity ratios of the gold markers was examined to assess the zzso of our proposed zzso Second, our proposed method was applied to the zzso images at the zzso phase for 11 lung cancer patients who had four to five gold zzso To prove the necessity of the zzso monitoring angle zzso the intensity ratios of the least visible markers zzso intensity zzso that were estimated from the zzso were compared under the following conditions: the optimal zzso monitoring angle and the angles used for setup zzso Additionally, the zzso and zzso variations in the intensity ratio were examined from the optimal zzso monitoring zzso 

A negative strong correlation was observed between the zzso zzso and the intensity ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso + 1, R zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso Our proposed method effectively avoided having the zzso beam pass through zzso structures, although there were large zzso variations in the optimal zzso monitoring angle because of the geometric arrangement between the gold markers and the anatomical zzso The minimum intensity ratios that were estimated from the zzso at the optimal zzso monitoring angle ranged from zzso to zzso which was an average of zzso times zzso zzso higher than the angles used for setup zzso The maximum zzso and zzso decreases in the intensity ratio were zzso and zzso zzso 

The authors demonstrated that the optimal zzso monitoring angle for creating a zzso model can improve the visibility of gold zzso
