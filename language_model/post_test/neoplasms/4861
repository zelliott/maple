The potential of bacteria as zzso for cancer has a long history, dating at least as far back as the early zzso zzso zzso have a large zzso that can be manipulated in order to target and eradicate zzso Many types of bacteria have been shown to target tumors but most are zzso zzso whose growth is confined to the zzso parts of tumors, thereby limiting their zzso zzso on the other hand, are zzso zzso that can grow zzso or zzso and, therefore, grow on viable tumor tissue as well as zzso zzso 

The article focuses on the double zzso zzso of zzso zzso These zzso which have no attenuating zzso and can grow in both viable and zzso areas of tumors but not normal zzso have shown particular effectiveness in mouse models of zzso zzso The approach described here is a significant improvement over previous bacterial zzso strategies which must be combined with toxic chemotherapy in order to be zzso This review uniquely discusses the critical points to zzso engineer zzso zzso for cancer zzso 

zzso therapy offers significant advantages over chemical or biological drugs or zzso zzso Of these types of bacterial therapy, bacteria that can grow in both viable and zzso areas of the tumors without growing in normal tissue hold the greatest promise in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso shows much promise for this zzso
