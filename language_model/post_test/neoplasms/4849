Red blood cell distribution zzso zzso has been shown to predict clinical outcomes in cardiovascular zzso We studied whether zzso is useful to predict early mortality in patients with acute zzso at an emergency department zzso 

We zzso analyzed zzso patients with acute zzso who visited the zzso from January 2009 to May zzso zzso outcome was 30-day zzso 

Acute zzso heart failure zzso was the most common adjudicated discharge diagnosis followed by cancer zzso and pneumonia zzso There was a zzso increase of 30-day mortality risk from lowest zzso to highest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso Cox hazard analysis, zzso was an independent predictor of 30-day mortality after adjusting for other risk factors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Adding zzso to conventional clinical zzso significantly improved prediction for 30-day mortality as measured by the area under the zzso curve zzso from zzso to zzso zzso and the net zzso improvement zzso zzso discrimination improvement zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that zzso measured at zzso is an independent and additive predictor of early mortality in patients with acute zzso
