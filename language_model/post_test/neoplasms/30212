We sought to determine the association between influenza vaccination and major adverse vascular events because the association remains zzso 

A total of 31 546 participants were enrolled from 40 zzso zzso included age zzso years and known vascular zzso The primary outcome was a composite of death resulting from cardiovascular causes, zzso zzso or stroke during 4 influenza seasons zzso zzso vaccination was associated with a lower risk of the outcome during 3 influenza seasons zzso using World Health Organization zzso zzso 2004 to 2005 zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 2005 to 2006 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 2006 to 2007 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the same years that circulating influenza matched the vaccine zzso In 2003 to 2004, there was an incomplete match between circulating influenza and the vaccine zzso and there was no association between influenza vaccination and the outcome zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, tests of potential biases in the analyses revealed associations between influenza vaccination and outcome during zzso seasons except 2003 to zzso The summary zzso in the influenza season zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso season zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were almost zzso The reduction in risk of zzso death associated with the influenza vaccine ranged from zzso to zzso 

Although initial analyses suggest that influenza vaccination was associated with reduced risk of major adverse vascular events during influenza seasons when the influenza vaccine matched the circulating virus, sensitivity analyses revealed that risk of bias zzso A zzso trial is needed to definitively address this zzso
