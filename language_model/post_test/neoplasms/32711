zzso a humanized zzso zzso directed to the zzso zzso present on B zzso could potentially abrogate the zzso immune response to zzso zzso zzso or zzso by depleting zzso B zzso 

A Phase II study of zzso an zzso targeting the Lewis Y tumor zzso in combination with zzso was conducted to test the hypothesis that zzso could abolish or diminish the development of human zzso to zzso Five patients were treated in this study and received 375 zzso zzso on days 1 and 7 followed by 45 zzso zzso zzso on days 10, 12, and zzso The development of human zzso against zzso was detected using a serum zzso and zzso 

All five of the patients had a total suppression of circulating zzso zzso population before the administration of the first dose of the zzso Before zzso treatment, the mean percentage of zzso B cells in the five treated patients was zzso zzso zzso of the total peripheral zzso After two doses of zzso zzso B zzso constituted zzso of the total peripheral zzso Despite absent circulating zzso B cells, before and during zzso treatment, all of the patients developed zzso zzso to the zzso by day 21 of drug administration, which prevented zzso 

Even though zzso caused complete depletion of circulating zzso B cells, it had no effect in suppressing the human zzso response to zzso and may be of limited utility in suppressing human zzso responses to other zzso zzso
