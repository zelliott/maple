zzso is a compound that has been developed as a zzso and zzso It is a zzso giving rise to the active zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to reduce the toxicity of zzso radiation, zzso agents and platinum zzso zzso studies have shown that zzso can reduce the zzso of zzso in a zzso model zzso system without reducing the efficacy of zzso In fact, in this model system, the zzso effects of zzso against the zzso cell line were actually greater with than without zzso Based on these zzso studies, clinical trials of the combination of zzso and zzso have been zzso A phase I trial of zzso and zzso in zzso patients demonstrated that two doses of zzso zzso zzso may be safely administered with zzso The maximum tolerated dose zzso of zzso that could be administered with zzso was 500 zzso suggesting the hypothesis that zzso increases the zzso of zzso from 400 to 500 zzso To test this hypothesis, a zzso trial of zzso 500 zzso versus zzso 500 zzso plus two doses of zzso 910 zzso has been zzso Analysis of this trial is not complete, but initial results suggest a reduction of zzso zzso from a median zzso zzso value of 85 zzso zzso zzso for zzso alone to 144 zzso zzso zzso for the combination of zzso plus zzso Similarly, the median zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso without zzso but zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso Neither of these zzso differences was statistically zzso but these effects are being maintained with repeated zzso so that an increase in delivered cumulative zzso dose seems possible with the use of zzso These promising data indicate that continued studies of zzso with zzso are justified and that the effects of zzso on the zzso produced by zzso combination chemotherapy regimens should be zzso
