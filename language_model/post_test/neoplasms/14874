zzso genes control normal development, primary cellular processes and are characterized by a unique zzso network zzso zzso D zzso genes play an important role in limb generation and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression has been detected in breast cancer, melanoma, cervical cancer and zzso We have investigated the epidemiology of zzso expression in human zzso and its potential deregulation in the zzso of specific zzso zzso zzso expression has been detected using zzso technology zzso more than 4,000 normal and zzso tissue samples including 79 different tumor zzso zzso of zzso expression has been performed, at zzso level, for selected tumor zzso zzso differences are zzso between specific normal zzso and corresponding tumor types with the majority of zzso showing an increase in zzso expression zzso normal zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso and stomach tumor zzso display the opposite zzso Interestingly, detection of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso shows that its negative expression has a significant and adverse effect on the prognosis of patients with pancreatic cancer independent of the T or N stage at the time of zzso Our study provides, for the first time, an overview of a zzso protein expression in a large series of normal and zzso tissue types, identifies pancreatic cancer as one of the most affected by the zzso zzso and zzso the way zzso can be associated to human zzso
