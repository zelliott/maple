zzso virus 40 zzso is a monkey virus that was introduced in the human population by contaminated zzso produced in zzso monkey cells, between 1955 and zzso zzso evidence now suggests that zzso may be zzso transmitted in humans by horizontal infection, independent of the earlier administration of zzso zzso This evidence includes detection of zzso DNA sequences in human zzso and of zzso zzso in human zzso as well as rescue of infectious zzso from a human zzso zzso of zzso DNA sequences in blood and zzso and of zzso zzso in sewage points to the zzso zzso and zzso routes as means of virus transmission in zzso The site of zzso infection in humans is not known, but the presence of zzso in urine suggests the kidney as a possible site of zzso as it occurs in the natural monkey zzso zzso in humans is associated with inflammatory kidney diseases and with specific tumor zzso zzso lymphoma, brain, and zzso These human tumors zzso to the zzso that are induced by zzso experimental zzso in zzso and by generation of transgenic mice with the zzso early region gene directed by its own early zzso The mechanisms of zzso zzso in humans are related to the properties of the two viral zzso the large T zzso zzso and the small zzso zzso zzso zzso acts mainly by blocking the functions of zzso and RB tumor zzso zzso as well as by inducing zzso aberrations in the host zzso These zzso zzso may hit genes important in zzso and generate genetic instability in tumor zzso The zzso activity of zzso which fixes the zzso damage in the infected cells, may explain the low viral load in zzso human tumors and the observation that zzso is expressed only in a fraction of tumor zzso zzso and zzso seems the most plausible mechanism to support this zzso The small tag, like large zzso displays several functions, but its principal role in transformation is to bind the protein zzso zzso This leads to zzso zzso of the zzso pathway, resulting in continuous cell zzso The possibility that zzso is implicated as a zzso in the zzso of some human tumors has zzso the preparation of a vaccine against the large zzso Such a vaccine may represent in the future a useful zzso and zzso intervention against human tumors associated with zzso
