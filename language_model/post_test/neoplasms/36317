Since the invention of cancer zzso its primary goal has been to maximize lethal radiation doses to the tumor volume while keeping the dose to surrounding healthy zzso at zzso Sadly, conventional radiation sources zzso or X rays, zzso used for decades, including multiple or modulated beams, inevitably deposit the majority of their dose in front or behind the zzso thus damaging healthy tissue and causing secondary zzso years after zzso Even the most recent pioneering advances in costly zzso or carbon zzso therapies can not completely avoid dose buildup in front of the tumor zzso Here we show that this ultimate goal of zzso is yet within our zzso Using intense zzso infrared laser zzso we can now deposit a very large energy dose at unprecedented microscopic dose rates (up to zzso zzso deep inside an zzso zzso zzso volume, without any dose deposit in front or behind the target zzso Our infrared laser zzso produce high density avalanches of low energy electrons via laser zzso a phenomenon that results in a spatial energy density and zzso dose rate that both exceed by orders of magnitude any values previously reported even for the most intense clinical zzso zzso Moreover, we show that zzso the type of final damage and its mechanisms in zzso media, at the molecular and zzso level, is comparable to that of conventional zzso radiation, and zzso at the tumor tissue level in an animal cancer model, the laser zzso method shows clear therapeutic zzso
