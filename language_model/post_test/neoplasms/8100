The metabolism of zzso is strictly regulated during the zzso cell zzso Before the zzso transition, the zzso and zzso concentration is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso protein prostate zzso response 4 zzso that may be zzso inherited during cell zzso Only one daughter cell dies shortly after zzso a mechanism we suggested to regulate the number of neural stem cells during embryonic zzso The progeny cells, however, may protect themselves by converting zzso to zzso and other zzso In particular, complex zzso have been found to sustain cell survival and zzso The cell cycle may thus be a turning point for zzso metabolism and explain rapid changes of the zzso composition in cells that undergo zzso zzso zzso In the proposed model termed zzso zzso progression through the cell cycle, zzso or zzso may rely on a delicate balance of zzso second zzso that zzso the zzso zzso transition or zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle delay at zzso is either followed by zzso zzso or by conversion of zzso to zzso a proposed key regulatory zzso that zzso cells from re-entry into a zzso decision at zzso We propose a zzso model for zzso protein scaffolds zzso that regulate zzso decisions and will discuss the biological consequences and pharmacological potential of manipulating the zzso cell fate program in cancer and stem zzso
