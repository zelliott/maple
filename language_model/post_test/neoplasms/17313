In recent years, significant progress was achieved in the field of zzso and zzso but the development of new zzso for reliable detection of diseases at an early stage, molecular imaging, targeting and therapy remains zzso The disadvantages of commonly used organic zzso include zzso zzso zzso and scattering when zzso zzso or visible light is used for zzso The limited penetration depth of the zzso light and the visible zzso into and from the biological tissue is a further drawback with regard to in zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso emitting in the zzso zzso range under zzso zzso may overcome those zzso Due to the outstanding optical and magnetic properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso host materials doped with zzso zzso zzso are promising candidates for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso have a high potential as zzso markers allowing the combination of zzso optical imaging and magnetic resonance imaging zzso of high spatial zzso Recent progress in our research on zzso zzso zzso fluorescent zzso for in zzso zzso zzso will be discussed in this zzso
