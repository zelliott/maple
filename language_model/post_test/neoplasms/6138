zzso zzso including adoptive zzso therapy and zzso therapy, has shown encouraging results in cancer treatment zzso However, active zzso of solid zzso remains an elusive zzso It is now known that the human innate immune system recognizes zzso molecular patterns zzso among microbes or zzso molecular patterns released from tissue injuries to initiate zzso immune responses during infection and tissue zzso zzso In contrast, how the innate immune system recognizes zzso arising cancer remains poorly understood at the molecular level, which poses a significant roadblock to the development of active cancer zzso We hereby review the current knowledge of how solid zzso directly and indirectly interact with cells of the human innate immune system, with a focus on the potential effect of such interactions to the zzso zzso immune responses against zzso We believe that understanding cancer and innate immune system interactions may allow us to better manipulate the zzso immune system at the molecular level to develop effective active zzso against zzso Current and future perspectives in clinical development that exploits these molecular interactions are zzso
