zzso outcomes for patients with cancer hinge on the development of new targeted therapies with acceptable short-term and long-term zzso Progress in zzso zzso and clinical zzso spanning cellular zzso synthetic biology, and zzso technologies has paved the way for clinical applications of zzso zzso zzso zzso This new form of targeted zzso zzso the exquisite targeting specificity of zzso zzso with the potent zzso and long-term persistence provided by zzso T zzso Although this field is still in its zzso clinical trials have already shown clinically significant zzso activity in zzso chronic zzso zzso and B cell lymphoma, and trials targeting a variety of other adult and pediatric zzso are under zzso zzso work is focused on identifying optimal tumor targets and on zzso and manipulating both zzso and zzso factors to support expansion and persistence of the genetically engineered cells in zzso The potential to target essentially any zzso zzso zzso for which a zzso zzso can be made opens up an entirely new arena for targeted therapy of zzso
