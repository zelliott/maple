ABC zzso zzso proteins zzso a wide variety of structurally zzso mostly zzso compounds from zzso The special role of these zzso both at the zzso barriers and in cancer cells is based on their extremely broad zzso zzso Since zzso compounds are known to partition into the zzso zzso and accumulate in zzso the zzso zzso model for the mechanism of zzso zzso proteins has been challenged, and alternative models suggesting zzso recognition within the zzso zzso have been zzso Although much effort has been made to validate this concept, zzso evidence for direct drug zzso from the plasma membrane has not been provided zzso Here we show a detailed zzso microscopic analysis of cellular zzso of fluorescent zzso drugs, zzso and zzso A, by a key human zzso zzso zzso Using the fully active zzso zzso and exploiting the special character of zzso that gains zzso in the zzso environment, we were able to determine zzso drug zzso separately in the plasma membrane and the zzso zzso Different kinetic models describing the various transport mechanisms were generated and the experimental data were analyzed using these zzso On the basis of the kinetic analysis, drug zzso from the zzso can be zzso thus, our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso directly from the plasma zzso
