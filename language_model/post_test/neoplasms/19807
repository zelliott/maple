The process of new blood vessel formation from pre-existing ones is called zzso Beyond playing a critical role in the zzso development of the vascular system, zzso is a zzso hallmark of zzso zzso zzso approaches are required to complement the current knowledge, and intimately understand the molecular mechanisms regulating this process in zzso and pathological zzso In this review we describe the cellular and molecular dynamics regulating the zzso growth of vessels and their deregulation in cancer, survey in zzso and in zzso models currently exploited to investigate various aspects of zzso and describe state-of-the-art and most widespread methods and technologies in zzso shotgun zzso Finally, we focus on current applications of zzso to better understand zzso cell zzso and propose how modern zzso can impact on zzso zzso
