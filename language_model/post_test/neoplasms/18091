zzso is a novel gene that shows sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso of lung cancer PG zzso However, the mechanism by which zzso performs these activities is a compelling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso through multiple zzso including zzso In this study, we found that zzso binds specifically to the zzso domain of zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso forms a complex with zzso that such a complex zzso the zzso association of zzso with zzso zzso and that disruption zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, resulting in suppression of cell zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso depletion of zzso markedly enhanced the association of zzso with zzso zzso elevated zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Together, our results provide evidence that zzso is involved in the regulation of zzso through zzso zzso zzso zzso and may represent a novel therapeutic target for zzso
