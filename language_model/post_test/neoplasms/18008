zzso DNA zzso patterns, including zzso of tumor zzso zzso have been described in many human zzso These zzso zzso can be reversed by DNA zzso zzso which provide novel opportunities for cancer zzso Clinical concepts for zzso therapies are currently being developed by using zzso for the treatment of zzso and other zzso These trials will greatly benefit from the inclusion of molecular markers for monitoring zzso changes in patients and for maximizing zzso zzso In addition, novel zzso need to be developed that result in a direct and specific zzso of DNA zzso zzso Several recent developments indicate that rational design of small zzso DNA zzso zzso is feasible and that this approach can result in the establishment of novel drug zzso The use of novel DNA zzso zzso in clinical trials that allow monitoring of drug-induced DNA zzso changes should provide the foundation for improved zzso cancer zzso
