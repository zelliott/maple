There is a growing interest in analysis of cell zzso in a field of clinical zzso The development of a zzso zzso to zzso zzso a zzso zzso is zzso making in the research of cell zzso and flow zzso zzso combined with the zzso zzso clinical use of information concerning cell zzso of tumor zzso In this review article, we show flow zzso analysis of cell zzso using the zzso Two color analysis of zzso makes it easy and rapid to obtain cell kinetic data of both tumor and zzso cells, without the use of DNA precursors labeled with zzso A fraction of labeled cells in the mid S phase zzso method provides more detail analysis of the cell cycle, although it needs multiple zzso after pulse labeling with zzso zzso a short term continuous labeling method can roughly estimate cell kinetic parameters but this method very zzso Furthermore, effects of zzso drugs and radiation to human zzso tumors can be rapidly evaluated with the above zzso The protocol of cancer treatment will be determined based on cell kinetic data from an individual zzso
