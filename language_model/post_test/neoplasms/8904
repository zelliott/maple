To gain a better insight into the zzso of platinum drugs, it is important to increase our knowledge over the phenomena allowing their entry into zzso root zzso zzso A deeper understanding of zzso transport mechanisms in zzso would represent not only a step forward in the zzso interpretation of their zzso but would also disclose possible treatment options to prevent this severe zzso achievable through zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and organic zzso zzso have been identified as putative targets for the pharmacological zzso of zzso cell zzso of platinum drugs and damage, and this possibility has been demonstrated by animal zzso The zzso of drug zzso activity is a promising strategy to limit the zzso of platinum drugs, provided that a) complete characterization of drug zzso is obtained and b) selective zzso activity is targeted without reducing zzso drug zzso
