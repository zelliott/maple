The zzso zzso is the first zzso zzso that drains a primary zzso A negative zzso zzso zzso accurately predicts the absence of zzso to any other regional zzso zzso A higher rate of zzso sensitivity, zzso and diagnostic accuracy in zzso zzso zzso mapping has been demonstrated of cancer of the breast, zzso and zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which we developed for gastric cancer in 1994, was also useful in accurately predicting zzso status in zzso zzso gastric cancer zzso the rate of sensitivity, zzso and accuracy was zzso zzso and zzso zzso Therefore if the zzso zzso zzso biopsy is free of zzso limited surgery such as wedge zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso is zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso allows dissection of regional zzso zzso to be avoided and results in an improved quality of life in zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso biopsy has the advantages of enhancing staging zzso detecting zzso and identifying variations in the regional zzso zzso Further progress may change the mode of zzso dissection and the indications for zzso chemotherapy for zzso
