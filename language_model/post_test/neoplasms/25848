In patients with cancer, zzso in the expression of zzso zzso molecules in zzso zzso zzso as well as in circulating zzso have been zzso By quantitative flow zzso analysis, decreased or absent expression of the zzso chain in zzso or zzso T cells as well as in natural killer zzso cells was demonstrated in patients with zzso Changes in the expression of zzso are biologically zzso because the absence or low expression of this signaling zzso in zzso of patients with stage III or IV head and neck cancer predicts a significantly shorter zzso survival than that of patients with normal zzso expression in zzso zzso evidence indicates that expression of zzso in zzso may not only influence survival but also predicts a favorable response to zzso zzso Patients with cancer also show significantly greater spontaneous ex zzso zzso in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso compared to normal controls, as measured by a terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso While no correlation could be established between the proportions of cells with low zzso chain expression and those that spontaneously zzso ex zzso the zzso chain has been shown to be zzso by zzso in T cells zzso with tumor cells or with T cells exposed to zzso zzso which zzso zzso upon zzso zzso on the cell zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso chain expression and zzso zzso may be manifestations of negative effects of the tumor on the host immune zzso
