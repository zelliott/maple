Different zzso drugs clinically approved by international regulatory organizations present poor water zzso and low stability after systemic zzso Their administration requires suitable carriers capable of maximizing therapeutic zzso zzso and zzso zzso particularly zzso are widely used to deliver zzso in the zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso lipids and zzso can affect their efficacy and play a pivotal role in zzso zzso are the main components of zzso and their interactions with therapeutic agents are widely investigated in the pharmaceutical field using differential scanning zzso zzso In this work, zzso was exploited to investigate the interaction between zzso zzso zzso zzso tamoxifen and zzso with zzso zzso zzso carriers are prepared using zzso zzso a zzso zzso showing the same zzso features of the main lipids in the biological zzso zzso was used as a biological membrane model to evaluate interaction, passage, zzso and zzso of zzso These processes were evaluated through the variation of zzso parameters of the biological membrane zzso zzso studies were carried out in heating and cooling zzso zzso demonstrated a modification of zzso zzso and this effect is strictly related to the zzso fraction and zzso features of zzso Furthermore, the interaction between zzso and biological zzso affects their zzso and distribution inside tumors and this process depends on zzso crystal transition of zzso zzso results provide suitable information about this effect and can be used as tool to predict further interaction between zzso and biological zzso
