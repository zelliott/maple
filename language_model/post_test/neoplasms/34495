The relative zzso potency of single graded intramuscular doses of zzso and zzso was evaluated in a zzso study in patients with chronic pain due to zzso When both intensity and duration of analgesia are considered zzso zzso zzso zzso was 2/3 to 3/4 as potent as zzso while in terms of peak zzso it was zzso to zzso In doses producing equivalent peak effect, zzso had a shorter duration of action than zzso zzso zzso was also compared to intramuscular zzso in a similar patient zzso In terms of total zzso effect, zzso was 10 times as potent as zzso while in terms of peak analgesia it was 12 times as zzso These relative potency relationships of zzso taken in conjunction with the zzso potency ratios of zzso and zzso established in the previous paper and several previous relative potency zzso involving zzso zzso and zzso demonstrate a highly consistent pattern of zzso zzso relationships encompassing zzso zzso zzso and zzso The results of these studies do not appear to support the hypothesis that, in man, the zzso activity of zzso is due to its zzso to zzso
