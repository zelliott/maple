To review the routine use of zzso dose rate zzso zzso for replacement of low dose rate manual zzso using classical dose rates and hourly zzso zzso zzso zzso time zzso planned zzso and safety zzso to personnel, machine zzso of 110 implants in 101 patients were evaluated during the period from August 10, 1993 to December 27, zzso

After an initial period of zzso problems, all treatments were supported well in all but one patient and could generally be given within 5 zzso of the planned time although the room was entered at a mean zzso of 79 zzso Whenever a problem that could interfere with proper machine function is zzso a message zzso zzso is zzso A median of one status code zzso 0 to 24) occurred during a single zzso zzso codes were caused by an open door when a pulse had to be given zzso or related to difficulty of movement of the check zzso through plastic tubes zzso the remaining status codes were due to a variety of zzso The dose received by the personnel decreased almost zzso as compared to the period when permanent implants were zzso
