Chemical variations of small compounds are commonly used to probe biological systems and potentially discover zzso compounds with selective target zzso zzso zzso are either generated by synthesis or acquired through directed searches of commercially available compound zzso The data generated when testing the zzso in various biological systems constitutes a zzso zzso The ability to detect variations and zzso biological responses requires the analysis of a compound in multiple zzso While the concept of a zzso relationship is straightforward, its zzso can vary considerably depending on the biological system under study and the probe library selected for zzso The analysis presented here will focus on the accumulated compound library used to screen for growth zzso across the National Cancer Institute's panel of 60 tumor zzso The considerable chemical and biological diversity inherent in these data offers an opportunity to establish a quantifiable connection between chemical structure and biological zzso We find that the connection between structure and biological response is not zzso with biological response better at predicting chemical structure than vice zzso zzso and functionally similar compounds can have distinguishable biological responses reflecting different mechanisms of zzso
