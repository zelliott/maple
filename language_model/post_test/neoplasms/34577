The immune system recognizes and potentially eliminates tumors that express zzso zzso The theory of zzso zzso describing zzso as sentinels capable of recognizing nascent transformed cells and thus maintaining tissue zzso has been proposed as far back as 50 years zzso The modern vision of immune responses against cancer is more complex because the immune system sculpts the zzso zzso of developing tumors by not only zzso their zzso but also their progression in regards to the role of regulatory T cells and the zzso of natural killer T cells zzso zzso of zzso immunity through therapeutic approaches is relevant to prevent zzso and, in some cases, to treat primary tumors if the relevant zzso have been zzso Here we review the use of zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and their use as vaccines in clinical and zzso zzso We also describe a new experimental vaccine model for the generation of zzso zzso T cells zzso that involves designer zzso zzso with high affinity for class I molecules of the major zzso complex zzso
