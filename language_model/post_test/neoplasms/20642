zzso cells zzso are essential for stimulating zzso zzso including immunity against tumor zzso We hypothesized that systemic administration of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso which promote zzso to differentiate into zzso cells in zzso might enhance the number and zzso activity of zzso cells in zzso Patients with zzso solid zzso were treated with daily zzso injections of either zzso alone zzso zzso or zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso When given alone, zzso increased the number of zzso cells but did not enhance the zzso expression of zzso markers or zzso zzso In contrast, combination therapy with zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells to acquire several zzso characteristics including increased expression of zzso and zzso decreased zzso increased zzso activity, and the ability to stimulate T cells in a mixed zzso zzso Combination therapy also induced a zzso increase in the number of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso significant and sustained tumor zzso was observed in one zzso zzso therapy with zzso and zzso may provide a mechanism for increasing the number and function of zzso in patients with zzso
