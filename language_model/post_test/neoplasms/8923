We report the development of a zzso zzso sensor to be used in zzso margin identification during zzso robotic zzso Although this is a generic platform, the sensor we describe was adapted for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso robotic zzso On such a platform, the zzso sensor is intended to identify ambiguous tissue margins during zzso zzso To maintain zzso of the probe during surgical intervention, a zzso sleeve was specially zzso A straightforward zzso interface was implemented where a supervised zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso different tissue types based on specific zzso fingerprints so that it could be used without prior knowledge of zzso data zzso The protocol avoids zzso zzso in data and the sensor system is not restricted for use in the zzso of a particular tissue zzso Representative tissue zzso assessments were performed using this system on excised zzso
