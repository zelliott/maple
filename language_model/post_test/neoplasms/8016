zzso zzso is regulated by the balance between factors that activate and inhibit zzso zzso levels of zzso have been associated with a poor prognosis in cancer patients, but little is known about the net balance between circulating zzso and zzso in these zzso This study was designed to determine whether the balance between circulating zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso and the zzso zzso differs from that in healthy zzso and to shed light on the possible role of zzso in this zzso Twenty-five cancer patients and 18 healthy subjects were zzso zzso and plasma zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were measured by zzso Our results showed that in healthy subjects the balance between the zzso and zzso zzso in serum and in serum minus plasma was twice to three times as high as in cancer patients zzso zzso zzso The theoretical zzso content per zzso was greater in healthy subjects than in patients zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indirectly as the plasma concentration of zzso was greater in cancer patients zzso zzso 48 zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated significantly with serum concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and showed a tendency toward correlation with plasma concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Our findings show that the circulating zzso balance is diminished in cancer zzso zzso zzso may play an important role in this decrease and may ultimately lead to increased zzso activity in these zzso
