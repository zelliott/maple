The production of zzso T cells with specificity for cancer cells is a rapidly evolving branch of cancer zzso A variety of approaches aim to amplify zzso zzso T cell responses using zzso zzso zzso cell zzso or zzso zzso complexes in differing zzso presenting zzso Using a zzso zzso zzso targeting system, zzso zzso zzso complexes were attached to the surface of B cells via the zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso class I indicated that targeted zzso zzso complexes remain on the surface of B cells in culture for periods in excess of 72 zzso zzso were zzso in zzso for zzso days using the zzso B cells as zzso presenting zzso Following a single cycle of stimulation specific zzso T cell responses to targeted zzso complexes containing the zzso zzso and zzso A peptides could be demonstrated by zzso zzso and zzso release zzso With the zzso complex up to zzso of zzso cells were zzso positive producing zzso zzso zzso : T 10 : 1) of zzso target cells in an in zzso zzso zzso compared to baseline levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso from a healthy donor treated with two cycles of zzso with targeted zzso A complexes, demonstrated expansion of the zzso zzso zzso population from zzso to zzso producing zzso zzso of zzso A zzso target zzso With further consideration to the key variables of zzso complex density, the ratio of zzso to zzso cells and optimum zzso support, this system should offer an easy and effective method for the in zzso amplification of specific zzso T cell responses and warrants development for the in zzso induction of zzso T cell responses in cancer zzso
