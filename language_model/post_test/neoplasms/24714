The current zzso cancer risk assessment for zzso zzso is based on deterministic zzso based zzso zzso modeling involving comparative metabolism of zzso by the zzso zzso in the lung and liver of humans and zzso Recent advances in zzso modeling include zzso methods and, in particular, zzso zzso to zzso address zzso and uncertainty zzso Although zzso analysis of human zzso models has been published, no such efforts have been reported specifically addressing the zzso apart from results included in the OSHA final rule on zzso Certain aspects of the OSHA model, however, are not consistent with current approaches or with the zzso current zzso cancer risk zzso zzso zzso analysis of the mouse zzso model and zzso modeling was undertaken to support development of an improved cancer risk assessment for zzso A zzso population model was developed and prior zzso zzso were selected to reflect zzso values that were considered the most appropriate and best zzso zzso modeling was conducted using zzso a publicly available software program for zzso zzso zzso Carlo zzso Mean zzso values from the zzso model were used to develop internal dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso in the lung and liver using exposure zzso and results from the zzso mouse zzso consistent with the approach used by the zzso for its current zzso cancer risk zzso Internal dose metrics were 3- to zzso higher than those that support the current zzso zzso zzso A decrease of similar magnitude was also noted in zzso modeling zzso These results show that the zzso zzso model in the mouse provides an improved basis for a cancer risk assessment of zzso
