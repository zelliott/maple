The aim was to compare zzso zzso zzso health zzso and risk factors in the French and German part of Switzerland and to discuss to what extent variations between these regions reflect differences between France and zzso 

Data were used from the general population of German and French Switzerland with zzso million individuals aged zzso years, contributing 176 zzso deaths between 1990 and zzso zzso mortality risks were calculated from the Swiss National zzso a zzso zzso record linkage zzso zzso were contrasted with zzso analyses of zzso and risk factors zzso Health zzso zzso and with zzso national and international mortality rates for 1980, 1990 and zzso 

Despite similar zzso zzso there were substantial differences in zzso mortality between Swiss zzso Deaths from circulatory disease were more common in German Switzerland, while causes related to alcohol consumption were more prevalent in French zzso Many but not all of the mortality differences between the two regions could be explained by variations in risk zzso Similar patterns were found between Germany and zzso 

zzso mortality and zzso differentials between the zzso and the zzso parts of Switzerland could also be found between Germany and zzso However, some of the international variations in mortality were not in line with the Swiss regional comparison nor with differences in risk zzso These could relate to peculiarities in assignment of cause of zzso With its cultural diversity, Switzerland offers the opportunity to examine cultural zzso of mortality without bias due to different statistical systems or national health zzso
