To clarify the strategy for early diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso without zzso zzso and to zzso examine gallbladder before cancer zzso 

The anatomy of the union of the pancreatic and zzso ducts was assessed by using zzso retrograde zzso zzso Patients with a long common channel in which communication between the pancreatic and zzso ducts was maintained even during zzso contraction were diagnosed as having zzso Of these, patients in which the zzso diameter of the zzso duct was less than 10 zzso were diagnosed with zzso without zzso zzso The process of diagnosing 54 patients with zzso without zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso gallbladder specimens from 8 patients with zzso without zzso zzso or cancer was zzso 

zzso zzso patients without zzso zzso were diagnosed with gallbladder cancer after showing clinical symptoms such as abdominal or back pain zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso surgery for gallbladder cancer was only possible in 11 patients zzso and only 4 patients zzso survived for 5 zzso Eight patients were suspected as having zzso without zzso zzso from the finding of gallbladder wall zzso on ultrasound and the diagnosis was confirmed by zzso and/or magnetic resonance zzso zzso The median age of these 8 patients was younger by a decade than zzso patients with gallbladder zzso All 8 patients underwent zzso zzso and zzso duct cancer has not zzso Wall thickness and zzso height of the 8 zzso zzso were significantly greater than controls, and zzso changes, zzso muscular layer, zzso fibrosis, and zzso were detected in 7 zzso 5 zzso 7 zzso and 5 zzso patients, zzso zzso labeling index was high and zzso zzso was detected in 3 of 6 zzso 

To detect zzso without zzso zzso before onset of gallbladder cancer, we should perform zzso for individuals showing increased gallbladder wall thickness on zzso
