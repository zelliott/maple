The effect of zzso zzso on sister zzso exchange zzso induction was determined in 13 human primary tumor cell zzso zzso cultures were derived from surgical specimens of solid tumors composed of a variety of zzso Three to 16 days after zzso depending on the growth rate, cultures were treated with graded zzso of zzso for 1 h and the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced per zzso versus zzso zzso showed a wide range in zzso sensitivities that was not dependent on zzso zzso frequency zzso showed that several of the primary cultures contained both zzso and zzso zzso For six of the cultures, the zzso induced per zzso at 15 zzso zzso were plotted versus the zzso determined from a survival zzso A line fit to those points yielded a correlation zzso of zzso These results show a relationship between the activity of zzso in the zzso zzso and in the survival zzso which suggests that zzso analysis may be useful for predicting zzso zzso In addition, characterization of cellular zzso in zzso sensitivity using the zzso zzso may provide additional information useful in the prediction of tumor response to zzso
