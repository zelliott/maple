zzso generation of zzso oxygen species zzso during normal cellular metabolism of an zzso is generally balanced by similar rate of consumption by zzso zzso between zzso production and zzso defense results in increased level of zzso causing zzso stress which leads to promotion of zzso zzso is a zzso modified base analogue of zzso found at first zzso position of zzso family of zzso These zzso are completely modified with respect to zzso in terminally differentiated zzso cells, however zzso of zzso is close association with cell zzso zzso modification is essential for normal development, differentiation and cellular zzso zzso is a zzso factor to zzso It is found to promote cellular zzso defense system and inhibit zzso The activities of zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are found to be low in Dalton's zzso zzso transplanted zzso mouse liver compared to zzso However, zzso administration of zzso to zzso mouse improves the activities of zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso promotes zzso defense system by increasing zzso zzso activities and in turn zzso zzso stress and zzso
