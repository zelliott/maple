A zzso bar code describes the colored pattern of zzso segments and is derived by zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of defined molecular zzso Published approaches to the simultaneous differentiation of whole zzso with bar codes have not allowed the unequivocal identification of all zzso segments because of color zzso of the patterns from a multitude of zzso colored zzso Here, we present a zzso bar code approach in which the problem of color zzso has been zzso It allows the detailed description of zzso including zzso as well as zzso zzso in the zzso of tumor zzso The resolution of zzso bars was increased to 100 bars per zzso zzso set by including human zzso zzso and more zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso no limitation to further increase in the resolution of the pattern became zzso The approach was validated by the analysis of four established tumor cell lines widely used as models in cell biology, revealing numerous zzso and zzso zzso zzso bar coding as presented here may provide further useful information for the zzso assignment of zzso zzso in complex zzso zzso as found in various zzso that cannot be obtained by zzso painting or classical zzso techniques zzso
