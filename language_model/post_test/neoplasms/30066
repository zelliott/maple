zzso specifically zzso to zzso tumors in zzso a trait potentially zzso as a delivery system for cancer zzso To characterize mechanisms and genetic responses of zzso during interaction with living zzso cells, we zzso a zzso zzso reporter containing bacterial zzso Analysis of a library containing zzso independent zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso with melanoma or colon zzso cells identified five bacterial genes specifically activated by cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso linked zzso zzso a common characteristic of the tumor zzso to a strong, specific, and zzso stimulus for zzso of these zzso genes in zzso and in zzso Indeed, a zzso reporter strain zzso a zzso zzso regulated by the zzso promoter, which contains a zzso zzso showed zzso zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso expressing zzso toxin from the zzso promoter provided potent and selective zzso activity in zzso and in zzso showing the potential for a conditional zzso zzso zzso 

zzso which often encounter zzso environments during classical host infection, may co-opt zzso zzso pathways for tumor colonization in response to the zzso tumor zzso We identified specific promoter sequences that provide a platform for targeted zzso tumor therapy in zzso
