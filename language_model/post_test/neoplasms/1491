To establish the safety, zzso and zzso parameters of zzso a selective inhibitor of the zzso target of zzso in patients with advanced zzso 

Using a modified continuous reassessment method, we performed a phase I with zzso study of zzso given as a weekly 30 minutes intravenous zzso zzso 

zzso patients received zzso at doses ranging zzso to 220 zzso No zzso effect was zzso zzso zzso occurred in two patients at 34 or 45 zzso At 220 zzso zzso zzso consisted of zzso syndrome, zzso and zzso in two of nine patients, preventing further dose zzso The most frequent drug-related zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso All zzso were zzso on treatment zzso zzso concentration and area under the zzso curve increase zzso with zzso Mean zzso volume of distribution ranged from zzso to zzso zzso was a major zzso zzso ratio range, zzso to zzso Whole blood clearance was zzso ranging from 19 to 51 zzso zzso to 220 zzso zzso predicted with flat doses appears comparable with data based on zzso zzso zzso zzso responses were observed in one patient with zzso zzso zzso and in one patient with breast zzso 

zzso displayed no zzso effects with manageable and zzso adverse events at doses up to 220 zzso the highest dose zzso Based on our results, weekly doses of 25, 75, and 250 zzso zzso not based on classical definitions of zzso dose are being tested in phase II trials in patients with breast and zzso zzso
