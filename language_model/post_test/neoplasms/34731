A critical event in tumor growth and progression is the zzso of zzso Thus, targeting zzso has become an attractive treatment zzso in cancer zzso Our study analyzed various solid tumor types for the expression of zzso a zzso zzso zzso member of the zzso protein family that has been proposed as a tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso high-grade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso and melanoma zzso zzso 30) were zzso analyzed for zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the effects of zzso were studied in zzso in primary zzso zzso cells zzso and in zzso in a mouse melanoma zzso In comparison to normal zzso the number of blood vessels expressing zzso was increased in zzso high-grade zzso melanoma and zzso zzso zzso laser scanning zzso revealed that zzso zzso localized also in zzso zzso zzso In zzso cell proliferation and migration of zzso was not significantly affected by zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso Interestingly, tube formation in zzso decreased after zzso of zzso and increased after zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells significantly increased zzso density in the zzso melanoma zzso Thus, we zzso a novel function of zzso in zzso cells as a differentiation factor involved in zzso the tumor zzso
