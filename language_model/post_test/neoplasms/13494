The burden of zzso zzso cells which remains after a course of treatment that has resulted in clinical zzso is referred to as minimal residual disease zzso zzso is increasingly considered as a zzso of local or systemic recurrence in cancer zzso During the last 20 years, methods for the detection of rare cancer cells have evolved from mere zzso investigations to a variety of zzso and molecular zzso Since surgical therapy remains the best treatment option for cancer patients with zzso tumors, the first question to address is whether the removal of the tumor was complete or some cancer cells remained from the tumor at the primary zzso Several zzso DNA zzso have been identified to solve this diagnostic zzso zzso detecting zzso DNA zzso have been applied to zzso margins and body zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic juice, zzso zzso and zzso Due to the higher sensitivity of zzso and zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso the second question to be addressed is whether systemic zzso or zzso spread of cancer cells zzso zzso cancer cells have been detected in bone zzso zzso peripheral blood, and zzso zzso zzso and cancer cell dissemination is regarded as a relevant and independent zzso zzso Thus, sensitive techniques for the detection of zzso are likely to guide indications for surgical or zzso therapy protocols in clinical zzso However, since many of the zzso for the detection of zzso are complex, and results are influenced by a variety of technical aspects, the majority of diagnostic applications have not yet been sufficiently zzso zzso quality control and zzso of minimal disease detection zzso remain zzso zzso zzso well controlled collaborative studies are urgently required to evaluate indications and diagnostic standards for these zzso This review summarizes technical aspects and their implications for the clinical application of presently available zzso for zzso detection in zzso zzso
