To develop an automated system to safeguard radiation therapy treatments by analyzing electronic treatment records and reporting treatment zzso 

zzso zzso Aided Treatment Event zzso zzso was developed to detect treatment events by retrieving and analyzing electronic treatment zzso zzso is designed to make the treatment monitoring process more efficient by zzso the search of the electronic record for possible zzso from zzso zzso such as logical inconsistencies as well as zzso treatment parameters zzso beam energy, dose, table position, prescription change, treatment zzso zzso Over a 5 month period zzso zzso zzso physicists were assisted by the zzso software in conducting normal weekly chart checks with the aims of zzso determining the relative frequency of particular events in the zzso clinic and zzso incorporating these checks into the zzso During this study period, zzso patients were treated at the University of Iowa zzso and zzso for a total of zzso zzso 

All treatment records from the 5 month analysis period were evaluated using all the checks incorporated into zzso after the training zzso About zzso events were detected as being exceptions, although none of them had significant zzso impact on patient zzso These events included every known event type that was discovered during the trial zzso A frequency analysis of the events showed that the top three types of detected events were couch position override zzso extra cone beam imaging zzso and significant couch position zzso zzso The significant couch zzso is defined as the number of treatments where couch vertical exceeded two times standard zzso of all couch zzso or couch zzso exceeded three times standard zzso of all couch zzso and zzso On average, the application takes about 1 s per patient when executed on either a zzso computer or a mobile zzso 

zzso offers an effective tool to detect and report treatment zzso zzso and rapid processing enables electronic record interrogation daily, alerting the medical physicist of zzso potentially days prior to performing weekly zzso The output of zzso could also be zzso as an important input to failure mode and effects zzso
