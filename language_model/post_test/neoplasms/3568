The purpose of this pilot project was to explore the feasibility of using a zzso computerized system to monitor zzso symptoms and to test the mechanism of generating alert communications to zzso providers about symptoms that are poorly zzso 

zzso patients with cancer participated in the study by calling the zzso care (TLC) system daily during a single cycle of chemotherapy and reporting on seven common zzso zzso Using selected symptom data, symptoms that met a zzso threshold for severity generated a fax notification of the patient's symptom pattern to the zzso Patients then were interviewed about their satisfaction with TLC and about suggestions for zzso 

The study demonstrated that TLC is easy to learn and use and that it captures daily symptom information from patients in their zzso A majority of patients experienced symptoms that were severe enough to generate zzso zzso Patient satisfaction with TLC was zzso The technique, TLC voice, and the duration of the calls were acceptable to zzso There were few technical zzso 

The TLC system has the potential to improve dramatically symptom monitoring and symptom care of patients with cancer at zzso Further testing is needed, but the TLC chemotherapy monitoring application shows promise for improving zzso service delivery for cancer zzso In its initial test, the TLC chemotherapy monitoring application has been shown to be highly acceptable to patients, able to generate useful symptom data, and able to generate zzso alerts to zzso providers, thus improving communication about poorly controlled zzso
