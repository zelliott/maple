zzso receptors zzso especially zzso zzso 2, are found expressed at relatively higher levels in many tumor cells and in zzso blood vessels relative to normal zzso This creates an opportunity for developing various zzso zzso zzso that selectively target zzso zzso zzso some potent zzso agents such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been coupled to zzso zzso zzso zzso These new zzso zzso zzso display significant zzso zzso abilities in many different types of zzso For instance, the zzso zzso zzso in which zzso is coupled to the zzso of a zzso zzso analog zzso had wide ranging zzso and zzso zzso This zzso also showed an ability to overcome zzso resistance zzso in zzso and zzso human pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso another zzso zzso zzso made by zzso zzso to the zzso analog zzso displayed indirect zzso activity against zzso zzso cell lung cancer zzso tumor growth by directly targeting zzso zzso vessels of host zzso These zzso zzso zzso should deliver zzso agents to zzso sites, enhance zzso zzso reduce toxic side effects to normal zzso and to some extent, overcome zzso These and other zzso zzso may possibly represent a newer generation of zzso cancer zzso This review discusses the progress with reference to zzso and zzso zzso cancer zzso
