zzso interference zzso gene zzso approaches appear very promising for therapies based on the targeted zzso of zzso zzso The major hurdle to the therapeutic development of zzso strategies remains, however, the efficient delivery of the zzso zzso the short interfering zzso zzso and short hairpin zzso zzso to the target zzso With respect to cancer treatment the development of efficient delivery methods into solid tumors appears as a critical zzso However, very few studies have addressed this zzso In this study we have investigated the contribution of zzso zzso delivery of zzso into zzso tumors zzso expressing an enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso target reporter zzso The zzso of zzso gene expression was zzso over time by zzso imaging in the living zzso Our study indicates that electric field can be used as an efficient method for zzso delivery and associated gene zzso into cells of solid tumors in zzso
