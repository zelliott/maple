The aim of this study was to assess cancer zzso in zzso systemic lupus zzso zzso 

We zzso zzso within zzso zzso at 10 pediatric zzso zzso were linked to cancer zzso for the zzso zzso spanning 1974 to zzso The ratio of observed to expected zzso represents the standardized zzso ratio zzso or relative cancer risk in zzso zzso versus the general zzso 

There were zzso patients aged zzso at cohort zzso Most zzso were female and zzso mean age at cohort entry was zzso years zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed for a total of zzso zzso zzso zzso Within this zzso only three invasive zzso were zzso However, 14 invasive zzso occurred with an zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso Three zzso zzso were found zzso zzso lymphoma, one zzso for an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The zzso zzso by age group and sex, were similar across these zzso There was a trend for highest cancer occurrence 10 to 19 years after zzso zzso 

These results suggest an increased cancer risk in pediatric onset zzso versus the general zzso In absolute terms, this represents relatively few zzso Of note, risk may be highest only after patients have transferred to adult zzso
