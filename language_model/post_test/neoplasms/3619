Providing up-to-date estimates of cancer patient survival rates is an important task of cancer zzso A few years ago, a new method of survival analysis, zzso period analysis, was proposed to enhance the zzso of long-term survival zzso The aim of this paper is to provide a comprehensive empirical evaluation of the use of this zzso 

Using data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer zzso we compare zzso and 10-year relative survival rates of 371 zzso patients diagnosed with one of the 16 most common forms of cancer in Finland at various time intervals between 1953 and 1992 with the most up-to-date estimates of zzso or 10-year relative survival that might have been obtained in those time intervals by traditional methods of survival analysis and by period analysis of zzso 

Survival rates strongly increased over time for most forms of zzso For these zzso traditional estimates of zzso and 10-year survival rates would have severely lagged behind the survival rates later observed for newly diagnosed patients, and period analysis would consistently have provided much more up-to-date estimates of survival zzso 

We conclude that period analysis should be implemented as a standard tool for providing up-to-date estimates of long-term survival rates by cancer zzso
