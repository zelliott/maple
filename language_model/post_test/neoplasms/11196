Biological evolution ensures that several backup mechanisms always exist to prevent the failure of cellular processes of critical importance for zzso This notion applies to processes aimed at preventing cancer zzso Recent research suggests that the DNA damage response, activated in one of the earliest cellular responses to zzso may elicit two independent tumor surveillance zzso The first, and most well known, is zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and subsequent cellular zzso The second, reported in a recent study, is induction of the expression of zzso for the zzso immune zzso zzso That DNA damage zzso two independent tumor surveillance responses demonstrates how one tumor surveillance mechanism may be assisted by another to secure efficient protection against early zzso The results also support the zzso theory of cancer and suggest that it may operate at very early stages of zzso
