zzso molecules are zzso composed of zzso whose primary structures may zzso This is due to alternative zzso in at least two regions zzso and zzso of the zzso Using two zzso zzso specific for two different zzso of domain 5 zzso affinity for zzso we have zzso analyzed the expression of the zzso sequence in human zzso from different zzso The results demonstrated that the percentage of zzso zzso containing the zzso is higher in zzso from zzso or zzso virus zzso human cells than in zzso from human plasma or normal human zzso Furthermore, we observed that zzso of zzso zzso from transformed cells or normal embryonic zzso are zzso on the zzso domain 5, whereas this occurs in only zzso of zzso zzso from normal adult zzso On the contrary, no zzso was observed on domain 5 in zzso from human zzso
