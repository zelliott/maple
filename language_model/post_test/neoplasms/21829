Exposure to zzso is associated with increased risk of breast and other types of human zzso zzso are converted to zzso particularly the zzso zzso zzso that can react with DNA to form zzso zzso These zzso are released from DNA to generate zzso zzso zzso base zzso repair of this damage may lead to the zzso that can initiate breast, prostate and other types of zzso The reaction of zzso with DNA forms the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These two zzso constitute more than zzso of the total DNA zzso zzso Increased levels of these zzso and their reaction with DNA occur when zzso metabolism is zzso Such an imbalance is the result of zzso of zzso zzso zzso and/or deficient expression of the zzso zzso zzso This unbalanced metabolism has been observed in breast biopsy tissue from women with breast cancer, compared to control zzso Recently, the zzso zzso zzso has been detected in the urine of prostate cancer patients, but not in urine from healthy zzso zzso by zzso has been approached from two different zzso one is zzso activity in the zzso reporter gene in Fisher 344 rats and the other is study of the reporter zzso gene in mouse skin and rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been observed in the zzso tissue of rats implanted with the zzso zzso zzso zzso have also been observed in the zzso gene in mouse skin and rat zzso zzso within zzso h after treatment with zzso suggesting that these zzso arise by zzso base zzso repair of the zzso sites generated by the zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells, which are zzso zzso immortalized human breast zzso cells, with zzso zzso or zzso zzso their zzso transformation in zzso even in the presence of the zzso zzso This suggests that transformation is independent of the zzso zzso The transformed cells exhibit specific zzso in several zzso zzso differentiated zzso develop when aggressively transformed zzso cells are selected and injected into severe combined immune depressed zzso zzso These results represent the first in zzso zzso model of zzso zzso in human breast zzso zzso In other studies, the development of zzso tumors in zzso zzso knockout mice expressing the zzso zzso zzso provides direct evidence that zzso may cause breast cancer through a zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso this evidence strongly indicates that zzso can become zzso tumor initiators when zzso react with DNA to form specific zzso zzso zzso cells may be promoted by a number of zzso including hormone zzso zzso zzso These results lay the groundwork for assessing risk and preventing zzso
