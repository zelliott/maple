To assess the clinical implications of zzso directed against different parts of the zzso beta zzso in patients with zzso 

A systematic assessment of the clinical, laboratory, and zzso characteristics of 48 zzso positive patients from six European zzso was zzso zzso zzso were determined with an zzso using four overlapping fragments spanning the entire zzso acid sequence of the zzso Data were compared with results for a large group of zzso negative patients with zzso published zzso 

zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso and inclusion body zzso In general, zzso with zzso zzso was zzso by relatively mild disease, sometimes accompanied by zzso symptoms, including zzso arthritis, zzso phenomenon, and zzso lung zzso zzso disease was not seen, and treatment response was zzso No differences were found between patients with zzso to different fragments of the zzso beta zzso except for a potentially increased risk of cancer in patients with zzso directed to the zzso zzso of the zzso 

zzso zzso are not a marker of a specific zzso of zzso No significant differences between patients with zzso to different fragments of the zzso beta zzso are found, with the possible exception of an increased risk of cancer in patients with zzso to the zzso zzso
