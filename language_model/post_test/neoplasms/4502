To reassess the natural history of zzso zzso and to obtain reliable estimates of both zzso of zzso and survival for use in defining the sample size for therapeutic clinical zzso 

zzso cohort study of patients with zzso who had been followed for 20 zzso 

11 Italian zzso zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso which was diagnosed according to criteria established by the zzso Vera Study Group and commonly used in clinical zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and stroke were classified as major zzso events, and zzso and peripheral zzso zzso were considered minor zzso zzso The number of patients who died and the number of those who had major zzso events zzso end zzso were used as a comprehensive measure of the zzso ratio associated with the use of zzso zzso 

zzso fatal and nonfatal zzso and zzso zzso were recorded in zzso patients zzso zzso of these episodes occurred during follow-up in 230 patients zzso and zzso occurred either at presentation or before zzso zzso events occurred more frequently in the 2 years preceding diagnosis, suggesting a zzso relation between the zzso zzso disorder and the vascular zzso The zzso of zzso during follow-up was zzso older patients or those with a history of zzso had a higher risk for zzso zzso mortality was zzso patients per year; zzso events and zzso or zzso zzso had similar effects on zzso Patients receiving chemotherapy died three to four times more frequently than those not receiving zzso The increased risk for cancer in patients receiving zzso agents was seen approximately 6 years after zzso In addition, the combined end point, zzso as the sum of the hardest available events zzso nonfatal zzso zzso or zzso suggests that zzso agents have an overall zzso zzso 

zzso favorably affects the zzso of zzso events, but aggressive treatment seems to be associated with increased risk for zzso These results provide a basis for zzso the therapeutic strategy in patients with zzso zzso and for zzso the size of clinical trials aimed at testing new therapeutic zzso
