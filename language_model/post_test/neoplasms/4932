zzso expressed gene 3 zzso is an imprinted gene belonging to the imprinted zzso locus located at zzso zzso in zzso Its mouse zzso zzso also known as gene trap locus 2 zzso is located at zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a long zzso zzso zzso and is expressed in many normal zzso zzso gene expression is lost in an expanding list of primary human tumors and tumor cell zzso Multiple mechanisms contribute to the loss of zzso expression in tumors, including gene zzso promoter zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso tumor cell proliferation in culture and colony formation in soft zzso This growth zzso is partly the result of zzso induced by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso stimulates zzso from a zzso promoter, and selectively regulates zzso target gene zzso zzso deletion of the zzso gene in mice results in skeletal muscle defects and zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to a significant increase in expression of zzso genes and zzso formation in the zzso These lines of evidence strongly suggest that zzso functions as a novel zzso tumor zzso
