zzso zzso zzso zzso often zzso with increased zzso potential of transformed cells, and in several model systems zzso produced by the tumor cells or by zzso cells - has been shown to enhance zzso zzso zzso elements in the zzso promoter have been identified on the basis of their ability to interact with protein factors associated with the zzso process in one or more cell zzso One of these is a zzso zzso zzso that binds a zzso the zzso factor zzso whose ability to form a complex with the zzso is zzso by Ras signaling in zzso and zzso zzso Another is the T cell zzso binding site, which in the zzso promoter can zzso zzso zzso when bound by the zzso zzso In zzso 37 rat zzso zzso cells zzso suppresses zzso zzso and the zzso zzso A third promoter segment consists of two sequences in the zzso to zzso region of the human zzso promoter able to bind several known zzso factors, including zzso zzso and zzso which may act zzso to stimulate zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Although expression of other genes may also be regulated by these zzso factors, evidence suggests that often zzso alone can stimulate zzso In this communication we address two issues: zzso How does zzso facilitate the zzso zzso zzso What mechanisms are responsible for the increase in zzso zzso in zzso cells?
