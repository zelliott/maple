Since our review 5 years ago, a new generation of zzso emulsion has been developed and is undergoing extensive zzso This new generation is the result of the application of zzso principles, applied to both the choice of the zzso itself and the zzso as well as advances in zzso zzso The efficacy of zzso in general for oxygen transporting capability has been fully zzso as exemplified by the limited license issued to zzso The latter also represents the recognition of the relative absence of major toxicity of zzso in zzso The development of new products owes much to the lessons learned during the past 20 years and to advances made in the physical chemistry of zzso These advances now permit the rational selection or design of the most appropriate zzso and the design of zzso best suited for the zzso zzso represents a clear advance over the zzso zzso It is only one but the most advanced of the second-generation zzso At least three other commercial entities zzso Green Cross, zzso are also developing products based on the above zzso Five years ago we concluded that, in spite of the enormous complexity of zzso zzso as large volume zzso they have shown remarkable zzso The advances in the past 5 years have confirmed this zzso The advances occurring during the past 5 years show that the application of the proper technology can lead to product improvement, and that zzso preparations with significant zzso and zzso potential are, in fact, zzso It remains to be seen whether high zzso emulsion can be successfully deployed in initial, zzso resuscitation zzso The high zzso content will reduce the absolute requirement for the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso in the case of zzso for optimal zzso The second-generation products also seem to lend themselves to zzso use, because they can be removed from the blood zzso by zzso zzso They are also suitable in combination with zzso blood zzso All of these potential applications are in various stages of exploration and, if found to be zzso will likely conserve the supply of whole blood and blood zzso The zzso applications, particularly those in diagnostic imaging, seem to show substantial zzso Because they involve smaller doses than zzso applications, they may enter clinical use zzso The applications in radiation and chemotherapy of zzso diseases represent an intermediate position between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
