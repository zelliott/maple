Over the past decade, the investigation of human zzso and disease has pursued both common and uncommon zzso variation and shown that both can be associated with altered risk for cancer and its zzso This line of investigation has not only begun to generate markers for disease but also insights into the biological pathways that are altered in zzso Already, there is emerging evidence that zzso genetic variation can alter zzso to different types of zzso including pediatric zzso It is evident that common genetic variation has emerged as a key component of a comprehensive understanding of pediatric cancer and its zzso Future studies should unravel the complex interaction between genes and the zzso
