zzso and other zzso have been thought to have zzso activity, either because of zzso activity or because of their ability to be converted to vitamin zzso Nevertheless, two large scale intervention studies in humans using high doses of zzso found that zzso supplementation resulted in more lung cancer rather than less lung cancer among smoking and zzso exposed zzso Studies conducted in the ferret have zzso molecular mechanisms behind this zzso in that high-dose zzso and smoke exposure in these animals leads to zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso High dose zzso in the smoke exposed animals was found to give rise to a number of transient zzso zzso which include zzso zzso that result in the destruction of zzso acid, and diminished zzso zzso and enhanced cell zzso In addition, eccentric zzso zzso zzso facilitate the binding of smoke derived zzso to zzso In other ferret studies low dose zzso smoke exposure provided mild protection against zzso zzso Thus, it appears that the explanation of the apparent paradoxical effects of zzso on lung cancer is related to zzso The metabolism and breakdown of natural products should be thoroughly investigated in animal models before embarking on large scale intervention trials, particularly when using unusually high doses that greatly exceed normal dietary zzso
