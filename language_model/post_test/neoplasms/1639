To assess the usefulness of a hybrid imaging system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for functional anatomical mapping zzso using various zzso and the additional value of fused zzso images compared with zzso zzso 

Eighty-one consecutive patients studied for various clinical situations were zzso 10 with zzso four with zzso zzso five with zzso red blood cells, two with zzso zzso four with zzso 10 with zzso seven with zzso zzso zzso nine with zzso 21 with zzso two with zzso three with zzso zzso zzso one with zzso zzso zzso and three with zzso zzso zzso The acquisition of both anatomical zzso and functional zzso data was performed during a single zzso zzso data were first interpreted alone and then re-evaluated with the addition of zzso 

zzso anatomical maps allowed for the precise anatomical zzso of zzso images in 79 of the 81 zzso zzso had a significant impact on the results in 33 zzso of the 81 zzso zzso provided the correct zzso of zzso findings in 23 cases, allowed the definition of the functional significance of CT zzso in two and enabled the exclusion of disease in sites of zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso with this hybrid system is a feasible technique yielding zzso zzso zzso zzso allows a more precise interpretation of zzso studies in several cases and fused images can improve the diagnostic accuracy of zzso in various clinical zzso
