The frequency of chronic zzso zzso among cancer patients is zzso The aim of this study was to determine the frequency of impaired zzso function within a population of cancer zzso One thousand two hundred zzso patients zzso women, zzso zzso with cancer underwent serum zzso concentration and zzso zzso rate zzso zzso The zzso formula was used to estimate the zzso from the zzso clearance zzso Renal zzso was defined as a zzso zzso zzso Among this population, 72 zzso demonstrated an abnormal serum zzso concentration zzso zzso According to the zzso formula evaluations, however, 330 zzso of the patients had an estimated zzso zzso zzso Among these, the zzso was between 60 and 89 zzso in zzso patients zzso 30 and 59 zzso in 75 patients zzso and 15 and 29 zzso in 7 patients zzso 7 patients zzso had a zzso zzso zzso As a result, zzso of patients demonstrating a normal serum zzso level had abnormal zzso zzso Renal function should be evaluated in all cancer patients, regardless of their serum zzso level, before any drug regimen is zzso The zzso formula appears to be more accurate than serum zzso concentration for diagnosing zzso zzso in patients with cancer, but more prospective studies in this population will be necessary to confirm this zzso
