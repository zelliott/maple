zzso are the zzso of zzso Yet, little is known about the degree and nature of zzso in tumors because measurement of zzso load in tumors and normal zzso was generally not possible until the advent of transgenic mouse zzso detection zzso zzso we present the first analysis of zzso frequency and pattern in zzso tumors from a mouse model of zzso syndrome zzso zzso zzso using the Big Blue zzso with sequencing of all zzso We also make the first characterization of zzso frequency and pattern in zzso zzso zzso The data more than triple the literature on all zzso repair deficient tumors for which zzso are identified by sequence analysis, allowing zzso frequency and pattern to be zzso Most tumors had a normal zzso frequency and a normal zzso zzso Five tumors showed modest increases in zzso frequency zzso or zzso zzso in zzso patterns were zzso zzso and not necessarily associated with increases in zzso zzso Given the data from two spontaneous tumors zzso zzso frequency with an abnormal pattern in a zzso mouse and low zzso frequency in a zzso control zzso we zzso that tumors sometimes can carry a low zzso zzso The study was not without certain zzso zzso load could not be compared between tumor and normal tissue from the same zzso sample sizes for zzso tumor types were small, and only point zzso and zzso insertions and zzso up to 2 zzso were zzso However, the data clearly show key differences in tumors from zzso mice compared with mismatch repair deficient zzso a lack of dramatic increase in zzso frequency and absence of a signature of zzso
