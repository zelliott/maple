Although cancer is a diverse set of diseases, cancer cells share a number of zzso zzso zzso pH is emerging as a hallmark of cancer because zzso show a zzso pH zzso with a zzso increased zzso pH that is higher than the zzso zzso This zzso enables cancer progression by promoting zzso the evasion of zzso zzso adaptation, migration and zzso Several new advances, including an increased understanding of pH sensors, have provided insight into the molecular basis for zzso cell zzso that are relevant to cancer cell zzso We highlight the central role of pH sensors in cancer cell adaptations and suggest how zzso pH could be exploited to develop zzso zzso
