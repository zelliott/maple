zzso of plastic zzso zzso used in zzso zzso obstruction remains a major zzso In zzso studies have shown that side zzso a standard feature of commercially available zzso may contribute to zzso zzso In a pilot study, we designed and zzso evaluated a new zzso zzso without side holes zzso zzso 

Over a 12-month period, 55 consecutive patients zzso age 75 zzso with zzso zzso common zzso duct obstruction and without zzso or zzso tumor zzso underwent zzso placement of the Tannenbaum zzso for the zzso treatment of zzso 

Tannenbaum zzso zzso was technically successful on the first attempt in all patients and was accompanied by a significant reduction in mean serum zzso levels zzso zzso Fifty-one patients were followed until death zzso survival of 130 zzso the symptomatic zzso rate was zzso the dislocation rate was zzso and the median zzso zzso was 64 zzso Aside from zzso zzso there were no zzso 

The Tannenbaum zzso provided effective zzso zzso zzso in all zzso The zzso rate was longer than that reported in the literature for conventional plastic zzso with side holes and compared favorably with zzso rates that have been reported for the metallic zzso zzso zzso The results of this pilot study are encouraging and warrant further zzso
