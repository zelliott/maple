The zzso zzso zzso is an elaborate zzso that is essential for cellular function and zzso zzso that interfere with zzso functioning can lead to the zzso of unfolded zzso which are detected by zzso sensors that then initiate the unfolded protein response zzso to restore zzso zzso If the zzso response fails, zzso cell death zzso Many studies have focused on how this failure zzso zzso particularly because zzso zzso zzso is implicated in the zzso of several diseases, including zzso Whether the zzso zzso zzso growth or protects zzso cells by zzso their adaptation to stressful conditions within the zzso zzso is unknown, and dissection of the zzso network will likely provide answers to this zzso In this review, we aim to zzso the paradoxical role of the zzso in zzso and zzso
