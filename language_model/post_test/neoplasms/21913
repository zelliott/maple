zzso cells metabolize abundant zzso relative to normal cells in order to satisfy the increased energetic and anabolic needs of the transformed zzso This review will zzso the requirement of zzso for the regulation of zzso in cancer cells and their potential utility as targets for the development of zzso zzso 

The zzso concentration of zzso controls the overall rate of zzso by zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso The zzso concentration of zzso is controlled by a family of zzso zzso that are zzso by four independent genes zzso The zzso zzso by the zzso gene has the highest zzso activity ratio of the four zzso and thus contributes significantly to the synthesis of zzso zzso is activated by zzso inflammatory and hypoxic zzso and was recently found to be zzso expressed by several human zzso and solid tumor zzso By setting the zzso zzso zzso zzso controls zzso flux to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and is selectively required for the zzso growth of zzso zzso 

These findings demonstrate a key role for the zzso in zzso transformation and provide rationale for the development of agents that selectively inhibit the zzso zzso as zzso zzso
