Over half of cancer patients in Singapore use some form of complementary or alternative medicine zzso to improve their immunity and general health zzso The effectiveness of zzso however, in reducing acute complications is currently zzso Concerns also exist as to whether zzso may cause toxic effects in patients with zzso 

To investigate the changes in general health status, zzso and organ function over a zzso period in zzso and zzso users with zzso 

The authors designed a zzso retrospective cohort zzso The patients had participated previously in a zzso prevalence survey about the types of oral zzso they were using in addition to zzso The authors used the data from the survey and clinical and zzso information from patients' medical and pharmaceutical records to complete the current zzso

As a whole, zzso use provided an absolute reduction of infection episodes by zzso zzso and of zzso use by zzso zzso zzso analysis showed a reduction of documented infection by zzso zzso and a zzso decrease in zzso due to infections zzso among zzso cancer patients who used zzso zzso usage was not associated with significant changes of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso use in patients with cancer was associated with a reduction in zzso and requirements for zzso zzso use was not associated with significant changes in zzso and zzso zzso There is a need for well-designed, prospective clinical studies to confirm these zzso
