zzso is the main cause of cancer zzso As the tumor progresses, cells from the primary tumor site are shed into the zzso as circulating tumor cells zzso Eventually, these cells colonize other zzso and form distant zzso It is therefore imperative that we gain a better understanding of the biological characteristics of zzso for development of novel treatment zzso to minimize zzso cancer zzso In recent years, rapid developments in technologies for the study of zzso have taken zzso We now have a variety of tools for the isolation and examination of zzso which were not available zzso This review introduces some commonly used protein markers in zzso investigations and summarizes a few advanced technologies which have been successfully applied for studying zzso biology at the protein zzso
