The differences in zzso biology between zzso and zzso animals provide alternative approaches to major problems in zzso zzso The high zzso of the zzso American zzso the zzso zzso zzso during early zzso development to zzso chemical induction of zzso tumors with a close zzso and zzso resemblance to those in the human suggests that the zzso zzso may offer unique opportunities for the study of zzso during zzso without zzso interference and under a maternal influence limited to the constituents of milk and contact with skin zzso Although there is as yet no experimental data on zzso tumor induction in the zzso several aspects of zzso zzso including a primitive zzso zzso zzso devoid of zzso and an apparent, partial nutritional autonomy of the developing zzso imply that the zzso in zzso may, like the zzso zzso be more accessible to tumor induction than its zzso zzso The results of preliminary attempts to develop zzso and zzso life support systems zzso culture and an artificial zzso suggest the feasibility of further reducing maternal influence on the developing zzso in order to enhance the utility of the zzso Currently, the zzso and the zzso mouse zzso zzso appear to be the zzso of choice for zzso zzso zzso
