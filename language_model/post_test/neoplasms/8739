Whereas zzso T cells are essential for zzso zzso tumors often evade zzso T cell surveillance by zzso As the initiators of zzso immune responses, zzso are likely to play a central role in regulating the balance between immunity and tolerance to tumor zzso and are specialized in their ability to zzso zzso tumor zzso on zzso class I molecules to initiate zzso T cell zzso However, it remains unclear whether and how tumors zzso DC functions to suppress zzso T cell zzso We have shown previously that zzso signaling in zzso promotes zzso zzso T cell zzso Here, we tested the hypothesis that zzso in zzso mediates zzso suppression of zzso T cell immunity by zzso the ability of zzso in zzso zzso was activated in zzso by multiple tumors in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso mice, when vaccinated with zzso zzso zzso fused with tumor zzso exhibited dampened zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso mice were deficient in zzso and zzso zzso T cells primed in these mice resulted in dampened zzso memory zzso zzso zzso mice completely abrogate zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso of zzso is dependent on zzso Finally, enhancing zzso at the zzso or recall phase rescued zzso zzso immunity in zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of zzso represents a new and potentially general mechanism that tumors employ to achieve zzso
