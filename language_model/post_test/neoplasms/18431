Despite the strong association between zzso disease and zzso disorders, the molecular and cellular basis of this relationship remains zzso We evaluated the hypothesis that zzso tissue zzso zzso in plasma contribute to zzso zzso 

We developed zzso flow zzso to zzso zzso and size zzso in zzso zzso We evaluated the number of tissue zzso zzso in a cohort of cancer patients of different zzso (N zzso zzso and conducted a zzso study of 30 cancer patients diagnosed with an acute zzso zzso event zzso compared with 60 cancer patients of similar age, stage, sex, and diagnosis without known zzso as well as 22 patients with an idiopathic zzso 

zzso zzso zzso were detected in patients with advanced zzso including two thirds of patients with pancreatic zzso zzso levels of tissue zzso zzso were associated zzso in cancer patients zzso odds ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso In cancer patients without zzso a retrospective analysis revealed a zzso cumulative zzso of zzso of zzso in patients with tissue zzso zzso versus zzso in those without zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso test P zzso zzso median number of tissue zzso zzso in the cancer zzso cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly greater than both the idiopathic zzso and zzso zzso groups zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso zzso in three patients eliminated or nearly eliminated these zzso which zzso the zzso tumor zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso tissue zzso zzso are associated with zzso in cancer patients and may be central to the zzso of zzso zzso
