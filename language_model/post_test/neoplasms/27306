zzso of zzso class zzso zzso expression is a widespread mechanism used by tumor cells to escape zzso zzso immune zzso However, it is not known why zzso cells cannot lyse these zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso must select additional routes of escape from zzso zzso An attractive hypothesis is that the zzso expression of zzso zzso class zzso molecules in tumors provides the required zzso signal to zzso cells, rendering tumor cells resistant to zzso zzso To analyze the possible role of zzso molecules in providing tumor cells with an zzso escape zzso we studied the cell surface expression of this zzso class zzso zzso in a variety of tumor cell lines with zzso zzso class zzso zzso Tests were done with the zzso zzso zzso recognizing cell surface zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso was mainly detected in zzso cell zzso In addition, zzso was detected in tumor cell lines of different zzso This expression was related with the availability of free zzso zzso in the zzso of tumor zzso zzso was detected in tumor cell lines showing an imbalance in heavy zzso zzso particularly in tumor cell lines with zzso in the expression of zzso zzso Several lines of evidence favor these zzso zzso In the zzso and zzso melanoma tumor systems, the reduction in zzso class zzso expression paralleled the increased cell surface detection of zzso zzso A cervical tumor zzso and a melanoma cell line zzso expressing a single zzso zzso also expressed zzso zzso The addition of human zzso to tumor cell lines that expressed the zzso zzso increased zzso cell surface zzso zzso There was no zzso cell surface expression in tumor cell lines with total loss of zzso class zzso zzso including cell lines with low zzso of zzso class I heavy chains or with zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the biological consequences of these cumulative genetic and molecular changes in tumor cells lead to the appearance of zzso in a limited number of tumor cell lines with peculiar zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso free zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso expression might be of particular biological relevance in those zzso tumor zzso that express a single zzso zzso when zzso zzso is markedly reduced due to the zzso of zzso and -C zzso
