The regulation of zzso zzso activity by zzso zzso zzso zzso has become a paradigm for understanding how zzso protein zzso zzso zzso pathways elicit specific changes in gene zzso through selective zzso of nuclear zzso zzso Selective zzso of zzso by zzso is determined by a specific zzso motif in zzso the delta region, which enables zzso to associate physically with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso motifs have subsequently been found in several other zzso factors, indicating that this is a general mechanism for ensuring specificity of signal zzso zzso and zzso studies in mice, flies and cultured cells have provided evidence that signals relayed by zzso through zzso regulate a range of cellular processes including cell zzso zzso zzso and embryonic zzso Despite these advances, in most cases, the genes or programs of gene expression downstream of zzso and zzso which control these zzso have not been zzso Here, we review the current understanding of the molecular basis and biological consequences of zzso zzso via zzso and highlight some of the zzso issues, which remain to be zzso
