Novel zzso for the diagnosis of zzso disease with PET and zzso are being developed as the most commonly used zzso zzso zzso zzso shows certain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives for specific imaging of the truncated zzso cycle potentially allows more specific zzso zzso zzso zzso of the novel zzso BAY zzso a zzso zzso was calculated and the effective dose zzso was compared with that of zzso 

Five healthy volunteers were included in the zzso zzso zzso zzso scans were performed from 0 to 90 zzso at 120 and at 240 zzso after injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso of BAY zzso zzso with moderate to high zzso at any of the imaging time points were used as source zzso Total activity in each organ at each time point was zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined for the whole body and all source zzso The resulting zzso were fitted to exponential equations and accumulated activities were zzso zzso software was used to calculate individual organ doses and the zzso zzso from the acquired zzso 

zzso of the zzso was highest in the zzso due to zzso zzso of the zzso followed by the zzso heart wall and zzso zzso The mean organ doses were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heart wall zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso The calculated zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Based on the distribution and dose estimates, the calculated radiation dose of BAY zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso at a patient dose of 300 zzso which compares zzso with the radiation dose of zzso zzso zzso
