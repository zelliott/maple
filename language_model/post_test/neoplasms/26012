The four primary objectives of this descriptive study were to: 1) design a zzso instrument for institutional cancer zzso zzso 2) evaluate the existing zzso in Colombia with the designed zzso 3) categorize the different zzso according to their quality and prioritize efforts that will efficiently promote better zzso with the limited resources available, and 4) determine the institution with the greatest likelihood of successfully establishing zzso second zzso cancer zzso In 1990 the National Cancer Institute of Colombia developed 13 zzso cancer zzso in different Colombian cities in order to promote the collection of data from a large group of cancer diagnostic and treatment zzso During the first half of 1997, this evaluation reviewed 12 zzso one of the original 13 no longer zzso All of the Colombian institutions zzso that maintain zzso cancer zzso were included in the zzso At each institution, a brief survey was administered to the hospital director, the registry coordinator, and the zzso zzso zzso Researchers investigated the institutions by looking at six zzso that are in standard use zzso Within each domain, questions were developed and selected through the zzso zzso Each domain and each question were assigned weights through a consensus zzso In most cases, two zzso went to each site to collect the zzso The university hospitals in zzso Pereira, and zzso had substantially higher scores, reflecting a good level of zzso Four of the 12 institutions had almost no cancer registry work going zzso Five of the 12 hospital directors considered that the information provided by the cancer zzso influenced their administrative zzso Three of the zzso had patient survival zzso Four of the institutions allocated specific resources to operate their cancer zzso in the other 8 hospitals there was no clear budget zzso Seven of the hospital directors could not identify five or more objectives of a cancer zzso Data management was usually poor and resources insufficient at most of the zzso In zzso the cancer registry system in Colombia varies greatly from institution to zzso A few of the hospitals do a good job while others have neglected the zzso The high, identical total scores for zzso and zzso suggest they would be good locations to establish new zzso cancer zzso similar to the existing one in zzso However, the overall characteristics in zzso may provide a more appropriate environment for the second registry, with zzso as an zzso
