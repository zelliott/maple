The synthesis and biological activity of zzso zzso 1), the zzso analogue of zzso are zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso under zzso zzso conditions gave zzso and zzso zzso as a mixture of zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (12 zzso was converted into zzso by zzso The structure of 12 beta was determined by zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso proved to be zzso against a number of zzso lymphoma, and solid tumor cell lines at zzso similar to those of zzso but was more potent than the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and an increase in zzso pools zzso with a concurrent decrease in zzso levels zzso The results obtained confirm the hypothesis that the presence of zzso such as S or zzso in the zzso in position 2 with respect to the zzso bond is essential for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity in this type of zzso
