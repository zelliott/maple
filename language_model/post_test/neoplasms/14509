The exchange of zzso for zzso across the plasma membrane is zzso by a carrier transport system known as the zzso zzso We have recently reported the specific zzso of zzso zzso activity in cardiac and skeletal muscle zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In this review, we zzso the properties of the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso complex reacting with this zzso The zzso zzso was produced against human acute zzso cells and recognizes a molecular complex composed of two zzso of the apparent molecular weights 95 zzso and 38 zzso linked by zzso zzso Two other zzso zzso react with the same zzso which binds to the same zzso as zzso and specifically zzso the zzso zzso activity, and zzso which zzso with a distinct zzso and does not inhibit zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso with nerve fibers in brain and zzso convoluted zzso of zzso both known to possess zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso sections is restricted to certain zzso of zzso The zzso of the zzso is very weak with resting zzso in zzso however, activated T zzso and zzso cells show increased binding to zzso zzso Several zzso cell lines express high levels of the zzso zzso The zzso of a human zzso with zzso zzso is much greater than that observed with normal zzso The zzso by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso activity and the similarity in tissue distribution of the zzso zzso complex and the zzso system suggests that these two molecules might be zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
