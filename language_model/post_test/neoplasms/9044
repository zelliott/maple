The complement system is composed of soluble factors in plasma that enhance or zzso zzso killing through innate and zzso zzso zzso of complement causes recruitment of immune zzso zzso of coated zzso and direct killing of affected cells through a membrane attack complex zzso zzso cells zzso complement zzso factors - one of several strategies to evade the immune zzso In many cases as the tumor progresses, dramatic increases in complement zzso factors are found on these zzso This review focuses on the classic complement zzso and the role of major complement zzso factors in cancer immune evasion as well as on how current protein engineering efforts are being employed to increase complement fixing or to reverse complement resistance leading to better therapeutic outcomes in zzso Strategies discussed include engineering of zzso to enhance complement zzso zzso that neutralize complement zzso proteins as well as engineered zzso that specifically target zzso of the complement zzso
