zzso are lacking for prophylaxis against D zzso after zzso zzso zzso A rational basis for the application of prophylaxis would be beneficial for institutions in which inventory constraints demand the administration of large numbers of zzso zzso 

A retrospective analysis was performed of all zzso zzso zzso administered at a pediatric research hospital over a zzso zzso Patients exclusively received zzso zzso zzso and did not receive zzso zzso Numbers, source, zzso type, duration of zzso zzso and level of zzso contamination of zzso zzso were zzso All positive D zzso in the institution over a zzso period were examined to determine cause and potential association with zzso zzso 

Thirty-five patients not receiving bone zzso transplant and seven bone zzso transplant patients received zzso and 255 zzso zzso respectively, over zzso zzso Patients had various diagnoses, predominantly zzso zzso percent of zzso zzso were zzso zzso An estimated zzso incompatible zzso were performed over zzso zzso No case of D zzso was zzso 

D zzso is generally unnecessary in pediatric zzso patients receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso not visibly contaminated by zzso Further studies to validate these observations in the pediatric population and to extend them to other population groups are zzso
