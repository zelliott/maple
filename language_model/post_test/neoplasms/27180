The Social zzso zzso zzso zzso everyday problems experienced by cancer patients, including difficulties with zzso work and zzso Early development and zzso evaluation studies have validated the zzso for computer zzso However, several recent studies have administered the zzso on zzso We sought to test the score zzso of electronic and paper versions of the zzso 

A zzso zzso crossover trial in a sample of cancer patients with varied zzso Patients completed electronic (via the zzso and paper versions of the zzso with half randomly assigned to complete the electronic version first zzso zzso zzso and half the paper version first zzso zzso zzso Patients were asked to complete both versions at home, within 2 zzso zzso were performed for the zzso summary score and three zzso 

zzso zzso and internal zzso for the paper and electronic versions were highly zzso There were no significant differences between mean summary or zzso scores for the two administration zzso All mean score differences (all zzso of a scale zzso were well below the zzso established minimally important differences, and all 95 % confidence intervals were narrow and included zzso zzso correlations between paper and electronic scores were zzso high and significant (all zzso and above the standard acceptable level of zzso 

Paper and electronic versions of the zzso can be considered equivalent and used zzso This is important because, despite the growth of electronic formats, paper versions are currently still necessary to ensure inclusive use of the zzso with representative zzso
