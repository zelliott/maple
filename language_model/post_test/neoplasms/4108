zzso induce tumors of different zzso types when zzso into experimental zzso An zzso role for this virus group in the development of zzso tumors in humans remains questionable, despite several reports demonstrating the presence of zzso zzso and zzso DNA in human zzso Only two human zzso types are known to date: zzso causing progressive zzso zzso zzso under severe zzso and zzso first isolated from the urine of a zzso transplant recipient and associated with zzso zzso We developed a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso in an attempt to identify zzso presently unknown human zzso types that may be involved in the zzso transformation of human zzso A large part of the gene coding for the viral zzso protein zzso is highly zzso in nine zzso types (and their zzso and was therefore selected as most suitable for the primer zzso zzso zzso zzso were deduced from four different zzso zzso acid motifs in this zzso Three different sets of zzso were included in each test to obtain the highest sensitivity in combination with zzso with the lowest zzso zzso The sensitivity obtained ranged from 1 zzso for bovine zzso to 100 zzso for zzso after zzso zzso zzso and was increased at least zzso after zzso with a zzso zzso A subsequent zzso amplification allowed for the detection of 1 zzso for zzso These zzso zzso were applied to analyze zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors, and zzso cell zzso No zzso DNA sequences could be zzso
