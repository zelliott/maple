Genome instability is a hallmark of cancer cells, and defective DNA zzso repair and zzso have been linked to its zzso zzso evidence suggests that proteins influencing zzso processes such as replication fork movement and stability, repair events and replication zzso have significant roles in maintaining zzso zzso DNA damage and replication stress activate a signal zzso zzso often referred to as the checkpoint zzso A central goal of the replication checkpoint is to maintain the integrity of the replication zzso while zzso replication completion and DNA repair and zzso these events with cell cycle zzso zzso through the cell cycle in spite of defective or incomplete DNA synthesis or zzso DNA zzso may result in broken zzso zzso zzso and an zzso of zzso In this review we discuss the multiple roles of the replication checkpoint during replication and in response to replication stress, as well as the zzso activities that cooperate with the checkpoint zzso to promote fork resumption and repair of DNA zzso thereby contributing to zzso zzso
