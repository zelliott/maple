Because of its location and function, the liver is continuously exposed to a large zzso load that includes zzso zzso tumor cells and harmless dietary zzso The range of local immune mechanisms required to cope with this diverse zzso challenge is now being zzso The liver has an zzso zzso and contains large numbers of zzso cells, zzso cells and zzso and is a site for the production of zzso complement components and acute phase zzso In this review, we focus on the zzso zzso system, which is currently emerging as an important arm of the immune system in the liver for targeting pathogens as well as for the recognition of cells that are modified as a result of infection or tumor zzso We show that this organ contains a zzso of zzso cells with diverse recognition mechanisms and zzso There are conventional T zzso that use zzso receptors to identify and respond to zzso peptides presented in the context of zzso class I and class II major zzso complex zzso zzso But these cells are outnumbered by zzso cells that recognize common structures using receptors with limited zzso These zzso of innate immunity against infectious pathogens and zzso cells respond immediately to stimuli and function as a zzso (and perhaps zzso bridge for the zzso immune zzso
