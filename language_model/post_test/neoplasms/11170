Although most patients with cancer respond to therapy, few are zzso Moreover, objective clinical responses to treatment often do not even translate into substantial improvements in overall zzso For example, patients with zzso zzso who achieved a complete zzso with zzso therapies in the zzso era did not experience a survival advantage over similar patients treated with a zzso and zzso zzso Several studies have also shown that neither the magnitude nor the zzso of clinical response has an impact on survival in multiple zzso Recent data suggesting many zzso arise from a rare population of cells that exclusively maintains the ability to zzso and sustains the tumor zzso zzso stem zzso may help explain this paradox that response and survival are not always zzso zzso that successfully eliminate the differentiated cancer cells characterizing the tumor may be ineffective against rare, biologically distinct cancer stem zzso New methods for assessing treatment efficacy must also be developed, as traditional response criteria measure tumor bulk and may not reflect changes in rare cancer stem cell zzso In this article, we discuss the evidence for cancer stem cells in zzso zzso and possible ways to begin targeting these cells and measuring clinical effectiveness of such treatment zzso
