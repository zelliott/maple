The growth and spread of cancer depends as much on the host response to tumor as on the biological characteristics of the tumor zzso This interaction is at its most intimate and dynamic within the tumor zzso It is here that the battle is fought that leads to mutual evolution of tumor and host cell zzso zzso to this evolutionary process are zzso changes distinctive for the tumor zzso such as zzso low zzso levels, low zzso zzso and high zzso fluid zzso These largely result from the chaotic zzso zzso but are impacted by the nature of the tumor and the inflammatory and wound healing responses that are zzso Numerous zzso immune cells, including zzso zzso natural killer cells and zzso cells zzso the zzso contributing to high levels of growth factors, hormones, and zzso We suggest that the integrated interplay between host and tumor factors results in distinct zzso that determine the response to therapy as well as tumor zzso zzso the tumor zzso to awaken or zzso immune cells, or to redirect it from a zzso to an zzso state, will require understanding of this zzso Current conventional therapies target tumors not tumor cells and clearly affect the host zzso and the zzso characteristics of the tumor zzso This may an advantage that has yet to be effectively exploited due to lack of knowledge of existing zzso resulting from the zzso zzso The same lack of knowledge impacts outcomes of clinical zzso zzso trials that have so far not broken through the ceiling of zzso success rate that seems to exist even in zzso It seems obvious that more could be achieved by combining therapies that tackle zzso from multiple angles, with the tumor zzso zzso to support a powerful zzso arm generated by zzso The challenge is how to design combination therapies that modify the tumor zzso so as to promote immunity and better combat both local and systemic zzso
