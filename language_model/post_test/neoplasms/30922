In this study, we analyzed the expression of zzso zzso for zzso B1 chain, alpha 1 zzso chain of type IV zzso and zzso type IV zzso in 15 primary lung zzso and in two zzso zzso to the zzso The results show that the zzso synthesis for these proteins mainly occurs in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In a proportion of tumors, zzso for zzso B1 chain and zzso type IV zzso could also be observed in zzso cells, but the amount of zzso was considerably lower in them than in the zzso zzso There were no convincing signals for the presence of the alpha 1 zzso chain of type IV collagen zzso in any of the zzso zzso A simultaneous expression or lack of expression of signals for zzso B1 chain and zzso type IV zzso zzso could be observed in zzso cells of 12 cases, suggesting that the zzso of these two genes may be somehow zzso There was no association between the zzso expression and the differentiation degree or the size of the zzso The occurrence of the zzso synthesis for the zzso type IV zzso in zzso zzso and zzso cells indicates that the zzso cells of tumors have a more pronounced impact on the spread of the zzso disease than previously zzso The results further show that in their ability to zzso these proteins the zzso cells of tumors resemble those of developing embryonic zzso This resemblance is probably connected with the constant zzso of zzso zzso in response to the zzso activity of zzso zzso
