There is increasing interest in the use of therapeutic exercise for cancer zzso Apart from the directly beneficial effects on muscle, exercise has the potential to zzso some of the zzso and hormonal abnormalities found in zzso This review summarizes the findings of recent studies, which have explored such effects in patients with cancer, and discusses their relevance to patients with cancer zzso 

Our search identified 11 studies in patients with breast, zzso zzso and prostate cancer, predominantly with early stage disease or following primary zzso zzso Overall, exercise was associated with reduced levels of zzso protein zzso but not other markers of systemic zzso There was no consistent impact on levels of zzso insulin or measures of insulin sensitivity or, in patients with prostate cancer, on levels of zzso 

There is limited scope to extrapolate these findings to patients with cancer zzso who are more likely to have advanced disease, higher levels of systemic zzso and greater degrees of zzso zzso Studies specific to this group are required to explore what, if any, changes exercise can make to levels of zzso and other immune and hormonal zzso along with their potential clinical zzso
