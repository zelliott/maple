Hospice care has increasingly been shown to affect quality of zzso care at both the individual and institutional zzso However, an institutional effect has only been addressed in single comprehensive cancer zzso community zzso 

To investigate the impact of an zzso hospice unit on the parent hospital's quality of zzso zzso 

This was a retrospective cohort study using administrative data from the entire population of zzso Taiwanese pediatric and adult cancer patients who died in zzso zzso variables were adjusted by zzso zzso zzso for five groups of zzso zzso 1) patient demographics and disease zzso 2) primary hospital zzso 3) primary physician specialty, 4) health care resources at the hospital and regional levels, and 5) historical zzso 

Taiwanese cancer patients who received primary care in a hospital with an zzso hospice unit zzso or not they received hospice care) were significantly less likely to be zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and use mechanical ventilation support zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in their last month of zzso They also were more likely to use hospice care before death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, if they used hospice care, they tended to be referred earlier than cancer patients being cared for in a hospital without an zzso hospice zzso 

zzso both acute care and zzso care approaches to caring for terminally ill cancer patients in the same hospital may influence the quality of zzso care throughout the hospital as evidenced by our findings that these patients have lower likelihood of being zzso with mechanical ventilation support in the last month of life, greater propensity to receive hospice care in the last year of life, and a trend toward earlier referral to hospice zzso The zzso of these results may be limited to patients who died of a zzso cause and by the two groups not being exactly matched for patients' zzso
