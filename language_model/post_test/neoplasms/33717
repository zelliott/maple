zzso substances that promote zzso in zzso may also account for fat zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso might improve if this zzso action of cancer cells could be zzso This study examined the zzso activities of media from four tumor cell lines after treatment with zzso acid zzso a cell differentiation zzso An in zzso zzso zzso measured zzso All four tumor cell lines were zzso zzso with elevated baseline zzso activities relative to zzso controls zzso to zzso of control, p less than zzso After a zzso exposure to zzso in culture medium followed by 3 days of continued growth in fresh zzso two of four cell lines (both rat zzso zzso showed significantly reduced zzso activities zzso and zzso of corresponding zzso controls, p less than zzso These reductions in zzso activity after zzso treatment were not generalized zzso nor were they simply caused by cell zzso as the other cell lines zzso zzso melanoma and human zzso zzso showed no reductions despite evidence of cell zzso No effect on zzso activity was seen after only a 24-hour exposure to zzso We conclude that zzso can affect the zzso activity of certain tumor cells in zzso perhaps by influencing zzso zzso zzso
