A historical cohort of service station attendants is zzso It is aimed at evaluating possible excess cancer risk in relation to exposure zzso In this paper we discuss the feasibility of a retrospective exposure assessment by evaluating the association between indicators of workload and the exposure intensity to some aromatic zzso measured in a sample of current zzso Available for the analysis were 703 personal samples from 111 filling station zzso Measured zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso time weighted zzso averaged zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The number of vehicles zzso the daily sales of super premium gasoline and motorbike fuel, and the winter season were all significant zzso of the log concentration of zzso in simple zzso zzso The size of the station acted as an effect zzso While no single variable was able to predict the zzso level in large stations, for small stations an increase of zzso and of zzso in the log zzso concentration per unit increase in super premium gasoline zzso I) and in motorbike fuel (10 I) zzso was zzso The overall zzso explained by the zzso model, however, was only zzso zzso a clear categorization of groups with homogeneous and significantly different exposure levels is not zzso From the point of view of exposure assessment, workers in small stations with higher sales of super premium gasoline tend to have higher exposure zzso This group should be examined in detail when the final results of the cohort study are zzso
