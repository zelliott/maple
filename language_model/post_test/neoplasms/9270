zzso small zzso zzso are involved in host immune responses to zzso In this study, we used zzso 2 zzso to explore the possible role of zzso in cancer gene zzso A zzso zzso expressing a zzso form of zzso was zzso The biological activities of zzso in immature zzso cells zzso were tested in zzso and in zzso The zzso effects were investigated in three established tumor zzso The zzso zzso was detected and exhibited zzso activity in zzso both in zzso and in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in tumor niches resulted in significant tumor growth zzso zzso transfer of zzso and depletion of immune cell zzso revealed that zzso T zzso responses zzso the increased tumor zzso Furthermore, we also found that zzso and zzso activities in zzso in tumor milieu contributed to enhanced local zzso zzso Our study indicates that gene therapy with zzso can mediate specific zzso immunity and augment local zzso zzso Our study also suggested that zzso may merit further exploration for cancer zzso as promising zzso
