The use of zzso in zzso allows the possibility of producing nuclear reactions in a specific target inserted in the zzso zzso is being used to induce reactions zzso zzso a technique called zzso zzso capture zzso I have studied the possibility of inducing a similar reaction using the nucleus of zzso for which the reaction cross section presents zzso for zzso zzso the highest peak occurring at zzso zzso Here zzso by means of zzso Carlo simulation of zzso sources of zzso in this energy range, is an enhancement effect on the absorbed dose in water by the addition of zzso zzso In addition to this, as the range of the alpha particle is of the order of a zzso cell size, the energy deposition via this reaction results mainly inside the cells adjacent to the interaction zzso The main conclusion of the present work is that the zzso of these zzso atoms in zzso cells would enhance the effect of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
