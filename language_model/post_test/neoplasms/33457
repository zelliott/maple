zzso is increasingly being used to prevent zzso B zzso in patients with cancer who test positive for zzso B surface zzso zzso and are undergoing zzso 

To determine whether preventive zzso reduces zzso zzso B virus zzso morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer who test positive for zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched in all languages until June zzso 

Clinical trials and cohort studies that reported the efficacy of preventive zzso versus control on zzso zzso in patients who tested positive for zzso and were receiving chemotherapy were zzso Additional requirements included minimum sample size zzso participants per treatment zzso and reported zzso morbidity and mortality zzso 

Two investigators independently did literature searches and data zzso and 2 other investigators independently confirmed study eligibility and data zzso 

Fourteen studies (2 randomized, controlled zzso 8 prospective cohort zzso and 4 retrospective cohort zzso met the zzso criteria for zzso There were 275 patients in the preventive zzso group and 475 control participants for the primary end point of zzso zzso With preventive zzso the relative risk for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso None of the patients in the preventive zzso group developed zzso zzso failure zzso of 108 patients zzso 21 of 162 zzso and only 4 deaths were attributable to zzso (4 of 208 patients zzso 27 of zzso zzso in the preventive zzso zzso zzso was well zzso and no adverse effects were zzso 

The studies included in the zzso did not consistently report all of the outcomes of zzso Sample sizes were small and only 2 studies had a randomized, controlled zzso 

Preventive therapy with zzso for patients who test positive for zzso and are undergoing chemotherapy may reduce the risk for zzso zzso and zzso morbidity and zzso
