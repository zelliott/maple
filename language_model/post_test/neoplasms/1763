The role of dietary factors in the zzso of human cancer is an area, which has attracted intense interest in recent zzso The suggestion that approximately one third of all zzso may be caused by an zzso balance of food components has led to the attractive contention that we can significantly decrease cancer zzso through dietary recommendations and a change in dietary habits in zzso Thus, a key issue must be to establish clear criteria, which must be met in order to be able to make zzso risk zzso claims for food zzso In this area, the one true marker is the zzso human zzso which for practical reasons is usually not accessible to zzso In its absence, we must rely on alternative zzso zzso This paper mainly deals with the link of these zzso to the zzso zzso and their usefulness for making zzso Some claims have been made based on zzso zzso 

Can we identify zzso zzso in the chain of events from initial zzso to overt zzso zzso whose modification can be used to make zzso claims for food zzso 

We identified 18 zzso in the above chain of events whose modification zzso the zzso to be used for zzso of cancer zzso claims for food zzso These zzso fall under 5 broad zzso zzso and zzso changes; cellular zzso gut zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso 

The strongest markers presently available are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in humans and zzso zzso and zzso in animal zzso The only marker that presently can be used for a zzso of disease zzso claim zzso zzso for food components is zzso zzso Type B claims cannot be made on the basis of results in animal zzso All of the other zzso examined presently lack validation against the zzso zzso the zzso and thus cannot be used for type B zzso zzso of disease zzso claims in the area of zzso zzso should be based primarily on human intervention studies using zzso zzso An important area for future research will be the validation of these surrogate zzso
