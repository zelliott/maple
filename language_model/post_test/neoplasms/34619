zzso and immunity development are well recognized as responses to tumor treatment by zzso therapy zzso To demonstrate that another major host response zzso process, acute phase response, may be also induced by this cancer treatment zzso the expression of serum zzso P component zzso acknowledged as a hallmark acute phase zzso in the mouse was investigated following zzso of zzso zzso zzso The results reveal almost zzso increase in the expression of zzso gene in the liver of mice bearing tumors treated by zzso zzso while serum zzso levels increased around zzso at the peak zzso about 24 zzso post zzso The same tumor treatment induced also the liver gene zzso and serum levels zzso of another established acute phase zzso zzso zzso A zzso Both zzso and zzso were found to accumulate in zzso tumors, but this includes local production because their genes in these tumor zzso were zzso as zzso Gene zzso zzso protein zzso was also zzso almost zzso in the same tumor zzso suggesting a rare example of zzso participation in host response of the zzso zzso and zzso hormones were identified as major zzso promoting tumor zzso zzso of liver zzso zzso Moreover, zzso were found to act as critical zzso of zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso The study definitely proves the occurrence of a strong acute phase response following tumor zzso and reveals that zzso hormones released during this development impact the expression of host zzso genes in zzso zzso
