zzso of an automated light microscope system to the zzso adherence zzso zzso provides a rapid automated zzso of cell zzso zzso zzso between the numbers of live zzso cells counted by eye and by machine yields no statistical differences in the per cent adherence or in the standard errors when performing either 10 or 20 replicate counts per zzso zzso Using the cell counter in a zzso mode, the counting is performed 10 times as fast in comparison to the manual zzso A zzso system is zzso The procedure requires from 4-6 X zzso zzso cells and from 2-3 zzso crude zzso extract using a standard zzso The value of the technique lies in its availability as a rapid zzso for both research applications and zzso monitoring in the clinical zzso
