We report the zzso and clinical results in a series of patients with advanced zzso zzso pelvic and lower limb tumors treated with zzso zzso zzso 

We performed 77 zzso with the zzso zzso technique in 55 patients zzso women and 30 zzso mean age: 53 zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso block zzso were performed in 11 patients, 33 abdominal hypoxic zzso zzso in 26 patients, 17 hypoxic pelvic zzso zzso in 11 patients and 9 hypoxic lower limb zzso zzso in 7 zzso zzso procedures were followed by zzso 

No technical complications were zzso zzso patients in our series are still alive zzso zzso 14 zzso and 23 have died zzso zzso 8 zzso zzso of them zzso for disease zzso Three of 77 patients zzso died within 7 days of the procedure (2 zzso 1 zzso At CT or MR zzso responses zzso 50% were observed in zzso of the procedures and clinical zzso was achieved in zzso patients zzso In the zzso classified by zzso positive responses were observed in 56, 48, 59 and zzso respectively for zzso zzso zzso and zzso Clinical zzso was observed in 67, 67, 71 and zzso zzso The death rate for disease progression relative to the overall death rate was 100, 86, 75 and zzso Hematologic toxicity according to WHO criteria zzso 2) was observed in zzso of the whole of procedures zzso zzso analysis showed no relationship between zzso responses and type of zzso drug or previous zzso zzso 

zzso procedures permit the effective control of many advanced tumors which cannot be treated otherwise, with a high rate of positive zzso and of complete clinical zzso The best results were obtained in hypoxic zzso of the lower zzso The results were not correlated with previous zzso zzso However, the high rate of zzso and the low zzso tolerance of those procedures must be zzso
