Stem cell factor zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso stimulating factor zzso zzso stimulating factor zzso and zzso stimulating factor zzso are members of a group of zzso called zzso zzso zzso These zzso regulate the growth and differentiation of zzso zzso cells and functionally activate mature zzso or zzso The effect of zzso is not limited to bone zzso zzso Some studies have shown that zzso can also stimulate the proliferation of zzso zzso The receptors for zzso have been detected in cancer cell lines, and stimulation of zzso receptors induced proliferation of tumor zzso Moreover, some investigations have shown HC zzso expression in these cell lines and recent studies have demonstrated that zzso can stimulate tumor zzso Several cells of zzso tumors have been observed to zzso large amounts of zzso and increased zzso of zzso have been found in the zzso of cancer zzso There are a number of situations in which the measurement of zzso may provide clinically useful information, particularly regarding prognosis and response to zzso In this paper we discuss the results of studies that have examined the potential use of zzso as tumor zzso
