In this retrospective cohort study, the cancer zzso of commercial pilots was studied to determine whether exposure at work has any influence on the zzso of zzso 

The cohort was established from the files of the Civil Aviation Administration and included people who had valid licenses as commercial pilots between 1946 and zzso Basic data about their flight careers were recorded, and exposure to zzso radiation was zzso The cohort was linked to the Cancer Register of zzso The observed number of cases was compared with that expected based on national zzso 

A group of zzso male pilots was followed over 70 zzso zzso There were 200 cases of cancer versus zzso expected, with a standardized zzso ratio zzso of zzso and a zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso of zzso No significant decreased risk was found for any cancer zzso Excess risks were found for zzso melanoma zzso cases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso skin cancer zzso cases, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso melanoma, there was a significant trend for the zzso by cumulative zzso 

For most cancer sites, the zzso among pilots did not zzso from that of the general population and could not be related to block hours of flight time or zzso It seems more likely that the excess risks of zzso melanoma and skin cancer are explained by factors related to zzso rather than by conditions at zzso
