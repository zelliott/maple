Advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of cancer and the availability of technology to genetically engineer viruses have led to the development of zzso viruses to treat zzso In theory, zzso viruses offer several appealing properties as biological agents for cancer therapy: they kill tumor cells zzso and their replication leads to amplification of their zzso zzso Most zzso experiments in tissue culture and in animal models support this zzso Clinical data on the first generation of zzso viruses are now rapidly zzso The therapeutic index, and ultimately the clinical outcome, will depend on a complex balance between host and viral zzso This review discusses strategies to kill cancer cells based on our understanding of their molecular defects and the progress being made using zzso viruses for tumor zzso We focus our discussion on a zzso zzso called zzso that has recently demonstrated encouraging results in clinical trials
