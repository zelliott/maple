The Connecticut zzso zzso zzso has collected cancer data for a sufficiently long period of time to capture essentially all prevalent cases of cancer, and to provide unbiased estimates of cancer zzso However, prevalence proportions estimated from Connecticut data may not be representative of the total zzso particularly for zzso zzso The purpose of this study is to apply the zzso approach developed by zzso and De zzso to cancer data from the zzso zzso and End zzso zzso Program of the National Cancer Institute to obtain more representative US zzso cancer prevalence proportion estimates for white and black zzso 

zzso and relative survival were zzso and used to obtain estimated zzso zzso of zzso prevalence proportions for all cancer sites combined, stomach, zzso zzso skin zzso zzso zzso lung and zzso zzso female breast, and zzso For validation purposes, zzso zzso zzso were zzso for Connecticut and compared with empirical zzso zzso (the ratio of Connecticut based prevalence proportion estimates using zzso data to zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to adjust zzso prevalence proportion estimates for white and black zzso 

Model validation showed that the adjusted zzso cancer prevalence proportions provided reasonably unbiased prevalence proportion estimates in general, although more complex zzso of the zzso zzso is necessary for female zzso of the zzso melanoma, breast, zzso and all zzso zzso The zzso cancer prevalence proportions are incomplete for most cancer sites, more so for women, zzso and at older zzso For all zzso combined, prevalence proportions tended to be higher for whites than zzso For the zzso zzso this was true for stomach, zzso zzso zzso and lung and zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso the prevalence proportions were higher for blacks through ages 59 zzso and 64 zzso and then for the remaining ages they were higher for zzso zzso proportions were lowest for stomach cancer and highest for prostate and female breast zzso Men experienced higher prevalence proportions than women for skin zzso zzso zzso lung and zzso and zzso zzso 

The zzso approach applied to zzso data generally provided reasonable estimates of cancer zzso These estimates are useful because they are more representative of cancer prevalence than previously obtained and reported in the zzso
