The quality of zzso analysis of solid zzso has greatly improved in the past decade, but a number of technical difficulties remain which limit the characterization of solid zzso zzso by conventional zzso zzso The identification of regions of zzso zzso has been aided by the introduction of molecular zzso techniques such as zzso in zzso zzso zzso Of these, a recently developed approach, comparative zzso zzso zzso has had a particular impact on the zzso analysis of solid zzso It incorporates the sensitivity of in zzso techniques and overcomes many of the drawbacks of conventional zzso zzso This review first outlines the zzso method, giving details for the preparation of DNA zzso and target human zzso zzso together with information on the in zzso technique and data handling criteria used in our zzso It then presents an overview of some of the current applications of zzso together with a discussion of future directions in the zzso
