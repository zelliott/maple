An association between therapeutic zzso of tumor necrosis factor zzso and solid zzso was observed during the zzso zzso zzso Trial zzso which included 180 patients with zzso with zzso zzso zzso The present study was conducted to determine the zzso risk beyond the time of exposure to study zzso 

The occurrence and type of solid zzso were zzso using a standardized data zzso Data collected included vital status, zzso findings, and therapeutic zzso The zzso zzso and zzso database was used to estimate a standardized zzso rate zzso for solid zzso 

zzso followup data were available for 153 patients zzso of the original zzso with a median followup time of 43 zzso Fifty percent of these patients had received zzso There were no differences in demographic characteristics between the zzso and zzso zzso Thirteen new solid zzso were zzso 8 in the zzso group and 5 in the zzso zzso Compared to the general population, the risk of solid zzso in the zzso group was increased zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso but was not different from the risk in the zzso group compared to the general population zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso All solid zzso occurred in patients who had been exposed to zzso The overall duration of disease and a history of zzso before trial enrollment were associated with the development of zzso during zzso zzso 

The zzso of solid zzso remained increased during long-term followup of the zzso zzso However, this could not be attributed solely to zzso exposure during the zzso zzso therapy with zzso appears to further increase the risk of zzso observed in patients with zzso treated with zzso agents and should be avoided in these zzso
