A certain number of pediatric cancer patients still succumb to zzso following conventional treatment of their zzso One of the mechanisms of zzso is escape from zzso zzso cellular zzso with zzso cells has the potential to overcome this zzso In adults, the zzso zzso cell, a zzso killer zzso cell, appears to be a promising zzso cell type with the greatest zzso This zzso cell type may work in children as zzso No similar studies with children have been zzso We speculated that expanded zzso zzso cells obtained from pediatric cancer patients during zzso would act similarly against various pediatric tumor cell zzso therefore, we undertook the present study to find support for our zzso This study was undertaken to generate and expand zzso zzso zzso cells from normal peripheral blood zzso cells zzso obtained from 6 children with cancer (2 with acute zzso zzso 2 with large cell lymphoma, and 2 with zzso in zzso after intensive chemotherapy and to study the zzso activities of these cells against chronic zzso leukemia cell line zzso zzso 4 pediatric tumor cell lines zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Ewing zzso zzso zzso and 2 pediatric zzso zzso cultured cell lines zzso and zzso zzso cells were generated and expanded in culture medium to which zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso and zzso 2 were added at appropriate zzso zzso were counted by flow zzso Net zzso zzso release from target cells incubated with zzso cells was used as an index of zzso cell zzso against various pediatric tumor cell zzso The results show that after 21 days in culture zzso zzso zzso cells derived from the 6 pediatric patients accounted for a median of zzso of the entire culture zzso zzso Before expansion no such cells were found in any of the 6 zzso Median zzso activity rates of zzso cells were zzso to zzso rates that contrasted drastically to the zzso activity rates of zzso which were only zzso to zzso The findings of the present study are zzso They provide information for developing adoptive zzso for future clinical trials with pediatric cancer patients, particularly those patients with minimal residual disease after intensive chemotherapy or stem cell transplantation (especially zzso transplantation zzso
