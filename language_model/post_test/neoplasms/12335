Rising serum tumor markers may be associated with negative imaging in the presence of zzso CT and zzso PET may yield zzso results in the assessment of tumor zzso The present study evaluates the incremental role of zzso zzso for the diagnosis and management of cancer patients with increasing levels of tumor markers as the sole indicator of potential recurrence after initial successful zzso 

zzso cancer patients with increasing levels of tumor markers during follow-up and negative CT underwent zzso zzso which showed 111 sites of increased zzso zzso zzso was compared with PET results on a zzso analysis for characterization of zzso zzso and on a zzso analysis for diagnosis of zzso The clinical impact of zzso on further patient management was zzso 

Thirty patients zzso had recurrence in 85 zzso sites zzso For the zzso analysis, PET had a sensitivity, zzso zzso positive zzso value, and negative zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, as compared with the performance zzso of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was a statistically significant difference between the specificity zzso zzso zzso and accuracy zzso zzso zzso of PET and zzso for precise characterization of suspected zzso For the zzso analysis, PET had a sensitivity, zzso and accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, as compared with zzso with values of zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso zzso not zzso zzso was the single zzso that directed further management and treatment planning in 12 patients zzso 

The results of this study indicate that zzso may improve the accuracy of zzso cancer detection and further lead to management changes in patients with increasing levels of tumor markers as the sole suspicion of zzso zzso
