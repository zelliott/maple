The purpose of this study was to evaluate the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso in pediatric patients studied for zzso zzso 

zzso children and young adults with known or suspected zzso underwent zzso PET and CT zzso Imaging began zzso zzso after injection of zzso zzso (20 zzso per zzso zzso of body surface zzso Images were acquired from the top of the head through the mid zzso zzso zzso values were determined using regions of interest drawn on the CT image and transferred to the corresponding zzso PET zzso 

The highest zzso of zzso were found in the zzso and zzso Less intense zzso was seen in other regions, such as the zzso zzso zzso and bone zzso There was little zzso in the zzso fat (including brown zzso zzso and zzso zzso in bone zzso zzso zzso and zzso was slightly but statistically significantly higher in men than zzso zzso bone zzso and left zzso zzso increased with zzso There was little zzso statistically between comparisons of zzso change and groupings of age, race, sex, and patients studied at the time of diagnosis versus previously treated zzso 

High zzso of zzso is reliably found in the zzso and liver, consistent with the anabolic functions of these zzso Low zzso in the brain, neck, chest, zzso and zzso will facilitate tumor zzso in those zzso However, intense zzso in the upper abdomen may limit the diagnostic utility of zzso in that zzso
