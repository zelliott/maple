The results from the published studies on the association between zzso 3' untranslated region C zzso T gene zzso and cancer risk are zzso This zzso was performed to evaluate the relationship with cancer zzso overall, and to explore whether the T zzso or zzso zzso could become a zzso marker for cancer zzso 

Association studies were identified from the databases of zzso zzso and Cochrane Library as of March 1, 2012, and eligible investigations were zzso using the zzso zzso zzso were expressed with odds ratios zzso for zzso data, and zzso confidence intervals zzso were also zzso 

Six investigations were identified for the analysis of association between the zzso 3' untranslated region C zzso T gene zzso and cancer risk, covering of zzso patients with cancer and zzso zzso There was a positive association between the T zzso and cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso might play a protective role zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso analysis, zzso 3' untranslated region C zzso T gene zzso and cancer risk appeared associated with the risk of breast cancer, but not zzso zzso 

Our results indicate that T zzso is a significant genetic molecular marker to predict cancer zzso and zzso zzso is zzso especially for breast zzso However, more investigations are required to further clarify the association of the zzso 3' untranslated region C zzso T gene zzso with cancer zzso
