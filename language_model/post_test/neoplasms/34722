In order to investigate the zzso component of zzso regulation, we analyzed the zzso status of its zzso zzso island in relation to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso restores zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso DNA zzso and low levels of zzso signatures are observed in zzso and zzso zzso cell lines, while the opposite characterizes zzso zzso T and B zzso zzso zzso is not necessary to repress zzso in zzso and zzso where zzso mechanism involves zzso zzso We show that DNA zzso directs zzso zzso and zzso status in tumor cell lines, while in primary cells is mainly regulated by zzso zzso
