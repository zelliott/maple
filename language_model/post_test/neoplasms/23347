zzso has a critical role in the growth and zzso spread of tumors, and involves recruitment of circulating zzso zzso cells zzso from bone zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso could promote tumor zzso and found that the tumor growth was enhanced by the administration of zzso To test the hypothesis that genetically modified bone zzso zzso can be effective carriers of therapeutic agents to tumor sites, we conducted human zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso with a virus zzso in zzso When zzso was applied in the ex zzso culture of zzso zzso zzso achieved efficient killing of the total population of zzso cells, indicating a bystander effect was zzso by zzso zzso in zzso When zzso cancer cells were zzso along with ex zzso cultivated zzso subcutaneous injection in nude mice, the tumor growth was zzso However, the zzso effect of zzso zzso offset the zzso character of zzso and the tumor growth, and the vascular density of tumor zzso increased by zzso zzso were decreased upon zzso zzso In addition, overall expression levels of vascular zzso growth factor in tumor zzso were decreased upon zzso zzso zzso our results suggest that zzso zzso could be useful as a zzso drug delivery zzso
