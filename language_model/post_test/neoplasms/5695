I zzso that chronic reduced zzso even limited to zzso areas of zzso may lead to respiratory deficiencies, to a proliferation of simplified cells as a result of a lack of energy, and to defects in immune zzso In these situations, reduce resistance and specific zzso might occur in zzso zzso the entire organ be zzso and cell zzso might come about, as several authors have described experiments in conditions of zzso The zzso cells, possibly in these areas as well, could more easily emerge as zzso because they are removed from immune control and surrounded by a terrain of reduced zzso zzso zzso would be easier to control than adult forms because it is harder for zzso to reach the latter's site of zzso
