Cell zzso and zzso activity may be useful to clinicians in treating children with solid zzso Frozen specimens from children with zzso solid tumors were tested at the time of diagnosis for zzso and zzso zzso The flow zzso DNA zzso were examined to assess the sensitivity of the tumor cell preparation and zzso zzso All the frozen tumors received zzso zzso zzso from children aged 1 zzso to 17 zzso were analyzed and included in this zzso The more common tumors were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso The majority of tumors zzso exhibited a zzso peak from the significant proportion of zzso cells in the tumor zzso The tightness of the zzso zzso zzso as measured by their zzso of variations zzso produced a mean zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso range zzso to zzso The zzso zzso from the zzso zzso had a mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the range zzso to zzso There was, however, a proportion of tumors zzso which showed no normal zzso peak on the zzso These tumor cell suspensions had insignificant numbers of zzso zzso Unless the position of the zzso peak could be identified on the DNA zzso the zzso result from such tumors would be zzso zzso zzso cells can be added to cell suspensions prepared from frozen tumors in order to identify the position of the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells cannot be added to single cell preparations from zzso embedded zzso therefore making it impossible to define the zzso peak position in these zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
