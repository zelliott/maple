Soft tissue deficits associated with exposed zzso and absent zzso pose difficult zzso problems due to zzso zzso poor range of motion, poor zzso and donor site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Corp zzso zzso is a skin substitute widely used in zzso surgery, including the incidental coverage of zzso However, zzso zzso functionality of the zzso has not been well zzso We report the results of using zzso for soft tissue reconstruction zzso zzso with loss of zzso in upper and lower zzso soft tissue zzso 

zzso patients (35 men and 7 zzso with exposed zzso due to trauma zzso cancer zzso zzso or chronic wounds zzso were reconstructed using zzso zzso were compiled in a prospective manner, including age, zzso wound location, wound size, time to final closure, operative time, follow-up zzso zzso skin graft percentage take and active zzso range of zzso zzso using zzso a literature search of current surgical techniques for the treatment of exposed zzso and the results from the literature were compared with these study zzso 

All patients healed with an average zzso skin graft take rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso patients not lost to follow-up achieved an average range of motion of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso offers a convenient, efficient operative procedure with minimal zzso demonstrating good zzso and zzso zzso Thus, zzso may offer an alternative option for immediate zzso coverage in both the upper and lower zzso
