A model is presented to simulate the cooling processes during tumor zzso with different kinds of flows through the zzso The heat flux between the zzso wall and the zzso the heat transfer zzso under different inflow conditions are obtained zzso The impact of the inlet mass flow rate, gas volume fraction on these parameters is zzso It is found that the heat transfer zzso decreased significantly when inflow changed from zzso zzso flow to zzso flow, and to gas zzso The inlet gas volume fraction and flow zzso only significantly affect the freezing ability of the probe when the inflow is gas or in zzso zzso zzso of the tumor temperature profiles under different flow conditions show that the heat transfer zzso is a crucial zzso in temperature prediction during zzso zzso indicate that when the zzso wall is assumed at a constant temperature zzso the cooling effect could be zzso It would be more reasonable to use the constant wall heat transfer zzso to simulate the cooling progress under a specific zzso
