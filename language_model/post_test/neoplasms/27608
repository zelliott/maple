zzso expression profiling appears particularly promising for a deeper understanding of cancer biology and to identify molecular signatures supporting the zzso zzso schemes of zzso zzso However, molecular zzso based on zzso data presents major challenges due to the overwhelming number of variables and the complex, zzso nature of tumor zzso Thus, the development of marker selection methods, that allow the identification of those genes that are most likely to zzso high zzso accuracy of multiple tumor types, and of zzso zzso schemes is of paramount zzso 

A zzso procedure for marker identification and for zzso of zzso gene expression data through the application of zzso principal component models is zzso The identified features represent a rational and zzso reduced base for understanding the basic biology of diseases, defining targets for therapeutic intervention, and developing diagnostic tools for the identification and zzso of multiple pathological zzso The method has been tested on different zzso data sets obtained from various human tumor zzso The results demonstrate that this procedure allows the identification of specific zzso markers and can zzso previously unseen instances in the presence of multiple zzso
