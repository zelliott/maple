zzso zzso zzso is a zzso human zzso zzso most useful clinically in colon zzso However, the clinical usefulness of zzso is limited by the zzso overall poor specificity and low sensitivity in patients with minimal zzso CA 195 is a recently discovered human zzso zzso that can be measured in serum using an zzso zzso CA 195 is expressed on the membrane of human colon cancer cells and shares an zzso with the Lewis A blood group zzso The authors initiated a study to compare the clinical utility of serum CA 195 with zzso in patients with advanced zzso A control population was studied to assess the effects of age, zzso alcohol, and tobacco on the measured levels of serum CA zzso 

Using a zzso zzso zzso zzso serum CA 195 and zzso levels were measured in 71 control subjects and 167 patients with a prior diagnosis of zzso The tumor zzso types included breast cancer, 49 zzso colon cancer, 38; prostate cancer, 24; lung cancer, zzso gastrointestinal zzso cancer, 7; and zzso zzso Among patients with a history of cancer, 124 zzso had active zzso disease, and 43 zzso were without evidence of active zzso The control population was composed of subjects without a history of zzso Clinical data collected from them included age, zzso smoking history, and alcohol zzso 

In this laboratory, the normal ranges established for CA 195 and zzso in the control group were: zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In the control subjects, the serum CA 195 level, unlike that of zzso was not affected by age, zzso alcohol consumption, or tobacco zzso In the study population, CA 195 had either equivalent or inferior specificity and sensitivity to zzso in all tumor zzso A determination of the additive specificity and sensitivity of CA 195 and zzso did not significantly improve its clinical utility compared with zzso zzso However, CA 195 was significantly elevated in three patients with a prior history of colon cancer thought to be without evidence of active zzso Because all three of these patients had a zzso within the next zzso months, CA 195 might identify early relapses of colon cancer in some zzso 

Based on these results, it was concluded that CA 195 is not superior to zzso as an indicator of disease activity in advanced colon cancer or other solid zzso However, studies utilizing CA 195 in the detection of early relapses of colon cancer may be zzso A review of the English literature revealed that CA 195 might be a useful marker in pancreatic zzso
