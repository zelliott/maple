During the last decade, numerous zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been developed for cancer zzso However, only a limited number of these agents have been shown to significantly improve survival of zzso zzso it is of crucial importance to identify the subset of patients who benefit from targeted zzso zzso can play an important role in selecting the right drug for the right zzso 

In this review, the potential role of molecular imaging of drug delivery for patient selection in targeted therapy will be zzso The advantages and limitations of molecular imaging will be compared to those of conventional zzso Moreover, we will address the factors that affect imaging of drug delivery, such as target zzso type of drug, in zzso accessibility of the zzso zzso vascular density, vascular zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso and retention zzso effect, zzso zzso zzso protein dose and timing of zzso 

zzso imaging of drug delivery clearly has potential for patient selection for targeted zzso The main advantage of this technique is that not only can zzso expression be measured zzso but also target accessibility is taken into zzso However, up to now, most of these studies have been performed in zzso zzso zzso future research should focus on bringing promising zzso to the clinic, preferable in an early stage of drug development in order to test their potential role as a zzso
