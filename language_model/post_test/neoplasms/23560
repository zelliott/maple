Cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is a master zzso regulator and resistance factor that suppresses tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso triggered by chemotherapy agents in zzso zzso zzso is expressed as long zzso short zzso and zzso zzso zzso in human zzso zzso binds to zzso and/or zzso or zzso and TRAIL zzso 5 zzso in a zzso and zzso fashion and forms an zzso zzso complex zzso This interaction in turn prevents zzso signaling complex zzso formation and subsequent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are also known to have zzso roles in various signaling zzso as well as zzso and/or zzso several zzso and zzso signaling proteins including zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso has been found in various tumor types, and its zzso has been shown to restore zzso triggered by zzso and various zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important target for cancer zzso For example, small interfering zzso zzso that specifically zzso the expression of zzso in diverse human cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso recruitment and increased the efficacy of zzso agents, thereby enhancing zzso zzso stimulation and zzso Moreover, small molecules causing degradation of zzso as well as decreasing zzso and protein levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been found, and much effort is focused on developing other zzso cancer zzso This review focuses on zzso the zzso role of zzso zzso zzso in preventing zzso and inducing zzso and chemotherapy drug resistance, zzso the molecular mechanisms and factors that regulate zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso expression and function to eliminate cancer cells or increase the efficacy of zzso zzso This article is part of a Special zzso entitled zzso Four Decades zzso
