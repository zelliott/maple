The zzso zzso apparatus has been used for quantitative comparison of the interaction of zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso cells, which zzso zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells, which function by a zzso zzso The derived zzso from each line were as effective as the intact cells in inducing zzso on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso size on zzso vessels was greater than on zzso vessels by fivefold for zzso cells and zzso and by zzso for zzso cells and zzso for zzso zzso The results show that zzso from both cell lines initiate interactions between zzso and zzso identical to those caused by intact tumor zzso The results also demonstrate that intact tumor cells in the circulation may not be necessary for the zzso complications of zzso
