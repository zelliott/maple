The aim of this cohort study was to investigate the risk of zzso zzso and mortality in patients with diabetes treated either with human insulin or with one of three insulin zzso 

Data were provided by the largest German statutory health insurance fund zzso January 1998 to June 2005 zzso on patients without known zzso disease who had received first-time therapy for diabetes zzso exclusively with human insulin, zzso zzso or zzso The primary outcome was the diagnosis of a zzso zzso Data were zzso by multiple Cox zzso models adjusting for potential zzso 

A total of zzso patients were included, with a mean follow-up time of zzso zzso zzso maximum zzso zzso A positive association between cancer zzso and insulin dose was found for all insulin zzso Because patients receiving combined therapy with insulin zzso and human insulin were zzso the mean daily dose was much lower for zzso than for human insulin, and a slightly lower cancer zzso in the zzso group was zzso After adjusting for dose, a zzso increase in cancer risk was found for treatment with zzso compared with human insulin zzso zzso zzso the adjusted zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for a daily dose of 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for a daily dose of 30 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for a daily dose of 50 zzso No increased risk was found for zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with human zzso 

Considering the overall relationship between insulin dose and cancer, and the lower dose with zzso the cancer zzso with zzso was higher than expected compared with human zzso Our results based on zzso data support safety concerns surrounding the zzso properties of zzso in diabetic zzso Prospective long-term studies are needed to further evaluate the safety of insulin zzso especially zzso
