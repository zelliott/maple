The combination of specific gene targeting technologies with efficient gene delivery systems could provide the means to evaluate the concept of zzso strategies designed to block expression of potentially zzso tumor promoting zzso Here, we constructed zzso expressing zzso targeted to two of these factors, the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso depleted the respective zzso and inhibited protein expression significantly in three different human cancer cell zzso This resulted in almost complete zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso thus demonstrating the feasibility of this approach as a future cancer gene zzso
