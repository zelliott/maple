A promising role of cellular therapies in cancer treatment is reflected by the constantly growing number of clinical trials with zzso transferred zzso zzso and indirect cell labeling for the nuclear imaging of transferred cells has been proven reliable for imaging adoptive cellular zzso Both methods show their advantages and zzso zzso labeling is a relatively easy, zzso and well-established zzso zzso labeling using a reporter gene imaging paradigm allows for reliable, stable, and harmless zzso of cellular trafficking, zzso zzso and function at the target zzso It is expected that new zzso reporter genes will be rapidly translated into clinical applications that require repetitive imaging for the effective monitoring of various genetic and cellular zzso
