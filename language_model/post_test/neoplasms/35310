The cell cycle is implicated in diseases that are the leading cause of mortality and morbidity in the developed zzso Until recently, the search for drug targets has focused on relatively small parts of the regulatory network under the assumption that key events can be controlled by targeting single zzso This is valid provided the impact of zzso to the wider scale context of the network can be zzso The resulting depth of study has revealed many new zzso however, these have been won at the expense of breadth and a proper understanding of the consequences of links between the different parts of the zzso Since it is now becoming clear that these early assumptions may not hold and successful treatments are likely to employ drugs that simultaneously target a number of different sites in the regulatory network, it is timely to zzso this zzso However, the substantial increase in complexity presents new challenges and zzso parallel theoretical and experimental zzso We review the current status of theoretical models for the cell cycle in light of these new zzso Many of the existing approaches are not sufficiently comprehensive to simultaneously incorporate the required extent of zzso Where more appropriate levels of complexity are zzso the models are difficult to link directly to currently available zzso Further progress requires a better integration of experiment and zzso New kinds of data are required that are zzso have a higher zzso resolution and that allow simultaneous quantitative comparison of the concentration of larger numbers of different zzso More comprehensive models are required and must accommodate not only substantial uncertainties in the structure and kinetic parameters of the networks, but also high levels of zzso The most recent results relating network complexity to zzso of the dynamics provide clues that suggest progress is zzso
