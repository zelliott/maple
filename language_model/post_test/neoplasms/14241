In cancer medicine, next generation sequencing zzso has emerged as a practical method to generate zzso and zzso genetic data for optimal selection of targeted zzso zzso sequencing allows clinical testing to focus on zzso zzso thus maximizing the zzso sensitivity and specificity for zzso zzso In this review, we zzso the current regulatory environment surrounding clinical zzso including regulations and professional opinions established by the College of American zzso the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the Clinical Laboratory Improvement zzso the Clinical and Laboratory zzso Institute, the Association for zzso zzso the New York State Department of Health, and the American College of Medical zzso We outline practical considerations for the design of targeted zzso zzso with an emphasis on zzso zzso Finally, we discuss components of the validation process for clinical zzso zzso as well as challenges that still remain for clinical zzso
