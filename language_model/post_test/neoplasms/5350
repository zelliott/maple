To validate the utility of a previously reported 3-point limited sampling model zzso for determining zzso area under the curve to zzso zzso 

Secondary analysis of data from two clinical trials of zzso 

University medical center clinical research zzso 

Thirty-four patients with different zzso 

zzso was administered as a zzso infusion to 34 zzso zzso plasma samples were drawn over 24 hours after the infusion and analyzed for zzso by zzso liquid zzso 

The 3-point zzso zzso was compared with a zzso actual zzso calculated by the linear zzso zzso zzso and predicted zzso by the zzso were highly correlated zzso zzso The zzso predictions had a mean absolute error of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a mean error of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nine patients with poor zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso tended to have zzso low or high peak zzso 

Our findings suggest the development of more robust zzso using other techniques, such as zzso models, that can accommodate a greater degree of zzso zzso
