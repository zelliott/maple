To evaluate the long-term therapeutic effects of zzso peripheral blood stem cell transplantation zzso on the treatment of zzso and solid zzso 

Fifty-one patients were recruited in this zzso study, in which several potentially important parameters were studied including the optimal time for stem cell collection, the dose of stem cell zzso the time of zzso zzso the disease free survival zzso and overall survival zzso complications related to zzso and maintenance chemotherapy after zzso 

After zzso zzso and zzso survival rates of NHL were zzso those of zzso were zzso those of zzso were zzso and zzso those of ALL were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was greatly promoted by zzso colony stimulating factor zzso The mean time for patients' zzso to recover up to zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso was zzso days in the group of the patients receiving zzso in contrast to zzso days in the group receiving no zzso The most common complications of transplantation were fever, liver dysfunction and zzso which were zzso No death was due to transplantation related zzso 

Comparing with conventional chemotherapy, our study suggests that zzso is a very important therapeutic option that can significantly improve the prognosis in the patients with zzso and solid tumors, especially in the patients with zzso and zzso
