zzso zzso and zzso are highly expressed on tumor cells and/or by the tumor zzso of many human zzso and represent promising targets for zzso zzso Novel chemically programmed zzso zzso targeting these zzso were prepared using the zzso zzso zzso zzso programming zzso The effects of the zzso on cellular functions related to tumor progression were examined in zzso using tumor cell lines and their zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso functions of the zzso and their specificity were examined based on interference with zzso and zzso interactions related to tumor zzso Cell binding analyses of the zzso zzso revealed high affinity for tumor cells that zzso zzso and zzso zzso and weak interactions with zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that the zzso strongly inhibited zzso interactions through zzso zzso and they had little or no immediate effects on cell viability and zzso On the basis of these zzso the zzso are likely to have a broad range of activities in zzso as they can target and antagonize one or multiple zzso zzso expressed on tumors and tumor zzso Presumably, these zzso may inhibit the establishment of zzso tumors in distant zzso through interfering with cell zzso more effectively than zzso or compounds targeting one zzso zzso These zzso zzso may also provide useful zzso to study combined effect of multiple zzso zzso on cellular functions in zzso on zzso including tumor zzso fibrosis, and zzso zzso in zzso
