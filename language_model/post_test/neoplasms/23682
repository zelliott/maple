The background of regulatory limit values for zzso agents in Sweden is discussed and exemplified with the ambient and occupational air pollutants zzso and zzso (especially zzso zzso zzso radiation, and zzso The estimated cancer risks at different limit values are zzso as is the estimated number of cancer cases annually due to existing zzso zzso Although the individual lifetime cancer risks are much higher at the occupational limit values for zzso and zzso than what is recommended for the general public, the estimated number of cancer cases annually is lower at existing zzso zzso The individual cancer risk at the occupational dose limit for zzso radiation is comparable to the occupational cancer risk with zzso but higher than the one for zzso At the dose limit for the general public, the radiation risk would be higher than what is recommended for individual air zzso However, doses from man-made radiation are usually much lower than the dose limit due to zzso Thus, the estimated number of cancer cases annually due to radiation is low and comparable to the estimated number due to the chemical air pollutants zzso In contrast, the lung cancer risk with zzso in dwellings both at limit values and existing levels is high and comparable to occupational limits for the chemical zzso and for zzso The estimated number of cancer cases annually at existing zzso zzso zzso zzso is much higher than for the other discussed pollutants zzso cases each) and also higher than the estimated number of lung cancer cases due to total air pollution zzso 100 zzso
