Patients with solid tumors zzso to standard therapy were administered zzso 5, 10, 15, 20 and 25 zzso zzso once every 3 zzso Grade 3 zzso were considered as dose zzso The maximum tolerated dose zzso was a dose at which two out of six patients had Grade 3 zzso 

zzso patients, aged zzso zzso zzso years, with solid tumors were enrolled and a total of 32 cycles of zzso were zzso zzso were generally zzso Grade 3 zzso of zzso zzso was observed in one patient at 25 zzso and was considered to be dose zzso zzso was not reached up to a dose level of 25 zzso The serum concentration of zzso declined slowly zzso zzso is approximately 3 zzso The zzso zzso increased over the dose range zzso There was limited evidence of activity zzso disease 2; progressive disease 13; and not zzso zzso however, tumor shrinkage and tumor marker decrease were observed in an zzso cancer and a zzso lung cancer patient, zzso 

zzso is well tolerated up to 25 zzso Although objective tumor response was not observed, it is worth evaluating as a flat dose and in combination with other zzso and zzso zzso
