Storage of zzso zzso 5 days provides improved zzso logistical management and decreased zzso Promising results on in zzso parameters and on in zzso zzso recovery and survival of zzso zzso in healthy volunteers have earlier been zzso To provide additional zzso zzso patient zzso studies are zzso 

Sixty zzso zzso zzso cell transplant recipients were zzso to receive zzso zzso zzso stored in zzso additive solution zzso for zzso days the first time a zzso zzso was needed after zzso followed the second time by zzso stored for zzso days or vice zzso The corrected count zzso zzso for 1 and 24 h were zzso 

zzso 1 h and zzso 24 h were higher for zzso stored zzso days as compared to zzso days, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Time to next zzso zzso was significantly longer after a zzso of zzso stored for zzso days as compared to zzso stored for zzso days: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso days, respectively zzso zzso zzso No differences in bleeding events and no zzso reaction were zzso 

The advantage of an extension of zzso storage time beyond day 5 should be balanced against the increased need for zzso zzso that may occur and the conceivable risk of zzso zzso
