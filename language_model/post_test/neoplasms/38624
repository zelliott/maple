zzso zzso human solid tumors zzso and zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso were cultured with 1000 zzso of zzso zzso 2 zzso in long-term zzso zzso isolated from 26 primary zzso cell zzso of the head and neck expanded better zzso less than zzso and achieved higher total zzso units of activity against fresh tumor cell targets zzso less than zzso than zzso zzso obtained from primary zzso zzso zzso zzso 7) showed a higher degree of expansion than those from zzso liver tumors zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso from zzso tumors of the head and neck, liver, and zzso were delayed up to 50 days in their zzso response to zzso zzso mass cultures in zzso of zzso zzso or normal zzso were serially monitored for zzso with different cultured and fresh tumor cell targets and for zzso markers of the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was found in cultures enriched in zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso sorting of such cultures followed by zzso zzso confirmed that the human zzso zzso expressed either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso cells had little or no zzso zzso The two types of zzso zzso cells were present in low numbers in fresh zzso zzso or normal zzso in contrast, in some zzso long-term cultures, they represented a majority of zzso zzso This study identifies for the first time two types of zzso zzso cells in zzso cultures of human zzso one of which may represent activated natural killer cells on the basis of the absence of the zzso and expression of the zzso zzso These zzso zzso cells mediate zzso zzso of fresh or cultured tumor cell targets of different zzso zzso
