The zzso zzso and zzso zzso plays an important role in maintaining zzso integrity during DNA replication through the zzso and zzso of zzso and regulation of the DNA damage zzso zzso studies have shown that disruption of zzso zzso can exacerbate the levels of replication stress in zzso zzso tumors to promote cell zzso Additionally, zzso of zzso can zzso tumor cells to radiation or zzso zzso evidence suggests that targeting zzso can selectively sensitize cancer cells but not normal cells to DNA zzso Furthermore, in hypoxic conditions, zzso blockade results in overloading replication stress and DNA damage response causing cell zzso Despite the attractiveness of zzso zzso in the treatment of cancer, specific zzso zzso have remained zzso In the last two years however, selective zzso zzso suitable for in zzso and - most recently - in zzso studies have been zzso In this article, we will review the literature on zzso function, its role in zzso and the potential of zzso zzso to enhance the efficacy of radiation and zzso
