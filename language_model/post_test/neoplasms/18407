Recent advances in zzso zzso techniques have shown the potential to simplify clinical zzso With this motivation in mind, this paper demonstrates for the first time the use of zzso zzso optical zzso zzso for the robust and zzso detection of a clinically important protein zzso in zzso serum, using zzso zzso zzso as the test zzso We zzso an zzso zzso method to sensitively detect zzso at clinically relevant levels and to determine the zzso zzso of unknown samples in both buffer and zzso fetal bovine zzso zzso with a commercial zzso zzso zzso zzso kit reveals that the zzso zzso sensor platform has a comparable limit of detection (2 zzso and superior accuracy in the measurement of zzso concentration across a 3 order of magnitude dynamic zzso zzso we report the lowest limit of detection to date for a zzso zzso sensor applied to a clinically relevant cancer zzso Although this report describes the robust zzso capabilities of silicon zzso zzso zzso zzso for a single zzso zzso future work will focus on utilizing the platform for highly zzso zzso zzso
