A Phase I study of zzso a novel zzso agent originally isolated from the dogfish shark zzso zzso was conducted in patients with advanced zzso to: zzso determine the maximum tolerated dose zzso zzso toxicity zzso and zzso of zzso zzso when given as a zzso continuous zzso infusion every two zzso and zzso to obtain information on prolonged zzso continuous zzso infusions in patients who have tolerated zzso zzso 

A rapid dose escalation scheme was used that permitted zzso dose zzso Three or more patients were treated at each dose, of which at least one patient started treatment de zzso at that zzso Once zzso was encountered, the dose was decreased by one dose level, and the duration of infusion was prolonged from 10 up to 30 days in zzso zzso 

zzso patients were treated at eight zzso dose zzso the number of zzso level who received zzso infusions were zzso as dose in zzso zzso of patients initiated de zzso at that zzso number of patients treated at that zzso 6 zzso 12 zzso 24 zzso 48 zzso 96 zzso 192 zzso zzso zzso and 538 zzso zzso was encountered at zzso zzso zzso de zzso patients, zzso total zzso and 538 zzso zzso de zzso patients, zzso total zzso and consisted of zzso characterized by grade 3 zzso zzso that resolved zzso days after zzso zzso zzso Three patients did not experience zzso when first treated at zzso zzso but developed zzso at the same dose when zzso from 538 zzso Other zzso included grade 1-3 fatigue, grade 1-2 zzso zzso and zzso zzso The maximum duration of continuous zzso infusion was 20 days at a dose rate of 192 zzso in one patient without adverse zzso zzso calculations revealed a linear relationship between area under the curve or zzso and zzso dose rate up to zzso zzso with a prolonged terminal zzso persistence in patient plasma zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso range, zzso zzso zzso tumor responses were observed in a patient with zzso cell zzso and a patient with breast zzso with zzso zzso 

The best tolerated dose rate of zzso when administered as a zzso continuous zzso infusion was 192 zzso however, patients without prior exposure to zzso appeared to tolerate a dose rate of zzso zzso without zzso On the basis of zzso evidence of zzso with zzso agents and demonstration of human safety from this trial, additional clinical trials have been initiated with zzso in combination with chemotherapy for patients with late stage lung cancer and zzso zzso
