The formation of new zzso blood vessels, a process termed zzso is one of the most pervasive and fundamentally essential biological processes encountered in zzso zzso zzso is an important event in a variety of zzso settings, such as embryonic development, chronic zzso and wound zzso It is a process that is tightly regulated in both time and zzso zzso is driven by a cocktail of growth factors and zzso zzso and is tempered by an equally diverse group of zzso of zzso zzso is also central to the zzso and zzso of a number of pathological processes that include, among others, solid tumors, diseases of the eye, and chronic inflammatory disorders such as zzso arthritis, zzso and zzso Based on recent work from several laboratories, it is now eminently clear that most if not all zzso and zzso disease processes are not only a consequence of the unrestricted production of normal or zzso forms of zzso zzso but also the result of a relative zzso in zzso zzso In this review, I will describe how these zzso zzso systems function to coordinate and regulate the zzso response, and how disruption in the molecular controls that regulate the production of zzso and zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso and zzso The implications of these findings in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for the treatment of diseases characterized by zzso zzso will also be zzso
