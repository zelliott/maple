To assess genetic and environmental influences on adult zzso we followed 960 families that included children born during the period 1924 through zzso who were placed early in life with adoptive parents unrelated to zzso We evaluated the risks of dying from all causes or from specific groups of causes between the ages of 16 and 58 years for zzso with a zzso or adoptive parent who died of the same cause before the age of either 50 or zzso We compared these risks with the zzso risk of dying from the same causes between the ages of 16 and 58 when either the zzso or adoptive parents were still alive at the ages of 50 and zzso The death of a zzso parent before the age of 50 resulted in relative risks of death in the zzso of zzso (95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso for all causes, zzso zzso to zzso for natural causes, zzso zzso to zzso for infections, zzso zzso to zzso for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular causes, and zzso zzso to zzso for zzso The death of an adoptive parent resulted in relative risks of death in the zzso that were close to unity for all causes, natural causes, and infections, zzso zzso to zzso for vascular causes, and zzso zzso to zzso for zzso A similar but weaker pattern was observed when either a zzso or adoptive parent died before the age of zzso We conclude that premature death in adults has a strong genetic zzso death due to infections and vascular zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
