The sequencing of the human zzso will have a major impact on the zzso diagnosis, treatment, monitoring, and outcome of zzso Progress will most likely occur in a zzso fashion with the biggest initial impact in diagnosis and molecular targeting of new zzso Advances in zzso and zzso have already resulted in major findings that are zzso earlier cancer diagnosis and disease zzso New treatments that target specific pathways are well zzso for many zzso and likewise, molecular analyses aimed at finding medicines with reduced zzso are being zzso Close interaction with the Food and Drug Administration will be very important to integrate these new technologies into product development and the approval of new medicines and zzso Clearly, we are now approaching the era of personalized medicines in which one has the opportunity to maximize the efficacy and minimize the side effects of the cancer zzso The ability to translate this new technology into improving cancer patient care and outcomes will require that scientists from academia, industry, and zzso work together closely to develop the framework and standards necessary to maximize the benefit of the human zzso zzso
