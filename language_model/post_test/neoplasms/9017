The role of emergent zzso surgery in the setting of advanced zzso remains a subject of zzso 

The purpose of this study was to identify clinical zzso of outcome in patients with cancer who undergo zzso abdominal zzso 

zzso who underwent urgent and emergent abdominal operations between 2006 and 2010 at a zzso cancer center were zzso 

zzso were performed to identify zzso of 30-day morbidity and mortality as well as overall survival zzso A risk score was derived from zzso of zzso 

Of 143 patients, 93 zzso had active disease zzso defined as evidence of zzso at time of zzso zzso morbidity and mortality were zzso and zzso zzso Independent zzso of 30-day mortality included zzso score zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Median zzso was zzso months in patients with zzso and was not reached in patients without zzso zzso Independent zzso of decreased zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso indication zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso A risk or zzso index zzso score zzso patients into groups with discreet zzso 

Although zzso did not predict 30-day zzso it was the dominant independent predictor of zzso zzso In cancer patients undergoing emergency abdominal surgery, outcome is anticipated by disease status and other independent zzso of zzso
