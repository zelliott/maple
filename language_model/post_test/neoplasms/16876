To study the health of Royal New Zealand Navy personnel who participated in atmospheric nuclear weapons tests conducted by the United Kingdom at zzso Island and Christmas Island in 1957 and zzso 

zzso controlled follow up of up to 30 zzso 

New zzso 

zzso Men known to have participated in the tests and a control group of zzso men who were in the Royal New Zealand Navy during the same period but did not participate in the zzso 

zzso and zzso of zzso 

Follow up for the period zzso was zzso complete in test participants and zzso complete in the zzso There were 70 deaths among test participants and 179 deaths among controls, yielding a relative risk of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso The relative risk of death from causes other than cancer was zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso whereas the relative risk of death from cancer was zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso and of the zzso of cancer was zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso For zzso other than zzso zzso the relative risk was zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso for mortality and zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso for zzso There were seven deaths from zzso zzso among test participants zzso risk zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso including four zzso zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso The relative risk for zzso of zzso zzso was zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso and that for zzso was zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso There were no cases of multiple myeloma in the test participants during the follow up period, but the expected number was only zzso 

Although the numbers are small, the findings for zzso are similar to those for British participants in the nuclear weapons test zzso Some zzso and possibly some other zzso zzso may have resulted from participation in this zzso There is little evidence of an increased risk for zzso zzso and there is no evidence of an increased risk for causes of death other than zzso
