To determine if zzso factor zzso primary prophylaxis is associated with a lower risk of zzso zzso zzso than zzso zzso 

This was a retrospective, cohort study of medical records from a random sample of patients with solid zzso and zzso treated in 99 community zzso practices in 2003 zzso zzso patients treated with chemotherapy and either zzso zzso zzso zzso or no zzso were included zzso zzso zzso zzso estimated the odds of zzso in patients receiving zzso primary prophylaxis zzso 3 days of first chemotherapy zzso compared with zzso prophylaxis zzso or no zzso 

Patients receiving primary prophylaxis were less likely to develop zzso than patients receiving zzso prophylaxis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso characteristics were associated with development of zzso including, zzso of at least three chemotherapy drugs versus one zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and regimens with at least one zzso drug zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Patients receiving zzso primary prophylaxis had significantly lower odds of developing zzso than those receiving zzso zzso zzso of zzso may be underestimated, as care not recorded in the medical zzso chart was not zzso
