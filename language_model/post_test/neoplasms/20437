Gene zzso via promoter zzso island zzso offers tumor cells growth zzso This zzso event is zzso zzso and uncovering a unique set of zzso genes in tumor cells can bring a new avenue to cancer zzso However, zzso tools capable of surveying the zzso status of multiple gene promoters are needed for this discovery zzso zzso we describe an zzso zzso technique that is both versatile and sensitive in revealing zzso in defined regions of the zzso DNA samples are zzso and zzso to distinguish zzso zzso that are zzso from those that are zzso zzso labeled zzso products are zzso to arrayed zzso that can discriminate between zzso and zzso zzso in regions of zzso Using this technique, two clinical zzso of zzso zzso mantle cell lymphoma, and grades zzso zzso lymphoma, were further separated based on the differential zzso profiles of several gene zzso Work is zzso in our laboratory to extend the interrogation power of this zzso system in multiple candidate zzso This novel zzso therefore, holds promise to monitor the outcome of various zzso therapies on cancer zzso
