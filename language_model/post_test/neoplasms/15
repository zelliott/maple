We investigated the ability of nine zzso cell strains from patients with the zzso form of zzso zzso to handle various types of zzso agents and compared the results with those obtained in nine normal zzso Cell strains were exposed to zzso which causes DNA zzso zzso D, a zzso zzso and zzso C, a zzso zzso agent leading to zzso zzso Cell strains were studied for their ability to survive in a zzso zzso Nine normal strains exhibited a mean zzso zzso of the slope of the straight line portion of the survival zzso of zzso zzso after radiation exposure, compared to a range of zzso zzso in the nine RB strains zzso zzso zzso Similarly, exposure to zzso D led to zzso values of zzso zzso in the nine normal strains and zzso values of zzso zzso in the RB strains zzso zzso zzso The nine RB strains did exhibit a small overall increase in sensitivity after exposure to zzso C, with zzso values ranging from zzso zzso versus zzso zzso in the nine normal strains zzso zzso zzso however, when the two most resistant normal strains were excluded from analysis, results were zzso Three RB cell strains derived from individuals who had either developed second zzso or who had a family history of additional zzso consistently exhibited increases in sensitivity to all three zzso agents studied compared with other zzso RB cell strains as well as normal zzso The results suggest that normal human zzso cell strains exhibit a wide response to zzso agents, especially chemical zzso Most zzso RB strains exhibit sensitivity well within the normal zzso however, strains from RB patients predisposed to second zzso exhibit increases in sensitivity to zzso zzso The zzso ability to repair DNA damage may play a role in the development of second zzso zzso in zzso predisposed zzso
