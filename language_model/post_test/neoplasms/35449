The purpose of this study is to examine gene expression changes occurring in cancer from a zzso perspective by analyzing the level of zzso zzso in tumor zzso in comparison with their normal zzso zzso in zzso regulation patterns can be considered either as a result of or as a contributing factor to genetic instability and possibly zzso Our analysis has identified pathways that show a significant change in their zzso level in tumor zzso some of which are tumor type specific, indicating novel targets for cancer zzso zzso Pathways are found to have a general tendency to lose their gene expression zzso in tumor zzso when compared with normal zzso especially for signaling zzso The selective growth advantage of cancer cells over normal cells seems to originate from their preserved control over vital pathways to ensure survival and altered zzso allowing excessive zzso We have additionally investigated the zzso instability of zzso providing valuable clues to the cellular processes underlying the zzso and/or growth of specific cancer zzso Pathways that contain known cancer genes zzso zzso zzso show significantly greater instability and are more likely to become incoherent in tumor zzso Finally, we have proposed strategies to target instability zzso pathways that are prone to zzso by identifying compound groups that show selective activity against pathways with a zzso zzso change in zzso These results can serve as guidelines for selecting novel agents that have the potential to specifically target a particular zzso that has relevance in zzso
