zzso depletion using small interfering zzso zzso technology represents a potentially valuable technique for the treatment of zzso However, delivering therapeutic quantities of zzso into solid tumors by chemical zzso is not zzso whereas viral zzso efficiently zzso many human tumor cell zzso Yet producing sufficient quantities of viral zzso that elicit acute and selective zzso remains a major obstacle for zzso and clinical zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line, we were able to produce high zzso stocks of zzso zzso zzso virus zzso that express short hairpin zzso zzso and that efficiently zzso zzso zzso expressed in cancer 1), or zzso zzso protein zzso a zzso protein directly involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso checkpoint zzso zzso of zzso protein results in persistent zzso checkpoint zzso followed by cell zzso Because zzso expression and activity are only present in zzso cells, zzso cells were not affected by zzso zzso On the basis of the results of screening 56 human tumor cell lines with three different zzso zzso we used a tumor zzso model to test the effects in zzso The effects of the zzso zzso were evident in zzso and stained zzso The experiments with zzso zzso demonstrate the utility of producing zzso in zzso cells to obtain sufficient zzso and quantities for solid tumor zzso This addresses an important requirement for cancer gene therapy, to produce zzso zzso in sufficient quantities and zzso to enable quantitative zzso and selective killing of solid tumor zzso
