High mobility group box 1 protein zzso is considered an important biological marker during inflammation and zzso Here, we evaluated sample handling and effects of ex zzso necrosis on zzso zzso 

Plasma samples were obtained from healthy volunteers zzso simulating the standard laboratory conditions, overnight zzso and harsh zzso zzso levels were evaluated by zzso or western zzso Additionally, levels of zzso zzso index and zzso zzso were zzso 

Plasma levels of zzso were zzso increased in samples stored overnight at room temperature, as compared to those processed zzso The rapid zzso prevented the increase of zzso in stored zzso zzso zzso index and zzso zzso zzso showed significant correlations with zzso zzso 

zzso of blood samples is important for the accurate zzso of systemic zzso We propose that all samples with high zzso zzso should be evaluated for markers of ex zzso zzso
