Modern cancer therapies, mainly zzso radiation and certain classes of zzso target zzso Although these treatments disrupt the zzso their rationale is zzso They prevent cancer cells from dividing and zzso Nevertheless, cancer cells can survive by zzso a wide range of DNA repair pathways to eliminate the induced zzso In this context, DNA repair mechanisms are considered to be a vital target to improve cancer therapy and reduce the resistance to many DNA damaging agents currently in use as zzso zzso Here, we focus on two important DNA repair zzso namely base zzso repair zzso and zzso zzso repair zzso Specifically, our focus is on two protein targets that are linked to the hallmark zzso and zzso zzso zzso These are zzso zzso zzso Group 1 zzso and DNA zzso beta zzso zzso The former is a key player in zzso while the latter is the zzso zzso of zzso Our objective is to list all known zzso for the two targets and provide an overview of the great efforts that were made in their zzso While in the DNA pol zzso case more than sixty zzso were identified, very few zzso have been discovered on the zzso zzso It is hoped that this review will assist in the discovery of novel, potent and specific drug candidates aimed at improving existing cancer therapies including zzso radiation, zzso zzso zzso agents and zzso
