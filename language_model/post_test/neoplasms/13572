zzso of imprinted genes on human zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso syndrome zzso an overgrowth syndrome associated with zzso zzso and tumor zzso The molecular basis of zzso is complex and zzso The syndrome is associated with zzso in two distinct zzso zzso on zzso a zzso domain containing the zzso and zzso genes and a zzso domain including the zzso and zzso zzso It has been zzso that disorders of zzso in the zzso domain are associated with overgrowth and cancer zzso whereas those in the zzso domain involve zzso but not tumor zzso In this study of 125 zzso cases, we confirm the association of tumors with constitutional defects in the zzso zzso zzso six of 21 zzso cases with zzso zzso zzso of zzso developed tumors and one of three of the rare zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso gene developed zzso Most importantly, we find that five of 32 individuals with zzso and zzso defects in the zzso domain developed zzso zzso Furthermore, the type of tumors observed in zzso cases with zzso defects are different from those seen in zzso cases with defects limited to the zzso zzso Whereas zzso tumor was the most frequent tumor seen in zzso cases with zzso for zzso or zzso zzso none of the zzso tumors with zzso defects at zzso was a zzso zzso This suggests that distinct tumor predisposition profiles result from zzso of the zzso domain versus the zzso domain and that these zzso defects activate distinct genetic pathways for zzso zzso
