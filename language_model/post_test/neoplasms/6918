Members of the family zzso are known to contain a number of biologically active zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the present study, human cancer cell lines, zzso cells zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso and human melanoma cell line, zzso were treated for 72 h with zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso The results zzso for the first time, that zzso inhibited cancer cell viability in a zzso zzso In addition, the treatment with this compound at zzso zzso zzso induced zzso cell death, demonstrated by the fragmentation of zzso DNA and by a significant increase of zzso zzso The significant production of zzso oxygen species zzso evidenced in these experimental conditions could trigger the zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso zzso the growth of human cancer cells, at least in part, triggering an zzso process, and they may offer a further impulse to the development of its zzso with more potent efficacy against human cancer zzso
