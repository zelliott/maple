zzso zzso zzso gamma zzso zzso is capable of zzso several nuclear receptors and zzso factors that participate in the regulation of multiple zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso conversion of zzso into zzso and contributes to the zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso levels in plasma and zzso This study demonstrates zzso zzso as a novel target gene of zzso which zzso the zzso and zzso activity of zzso in various cancer cells and thus zzso their zzso to zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression occurs at its zzso level that is zzso by an zzso zzso zzso binding site zzso to zzso base zzso mapped in the promoter region of zzso zzso Our zzso studies using zzso reporter construct together with zzso mobility shift zzso confirm the binding of zzso to zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso signaling by zzso zzso compromises the ability of zzso to induce the transcript of zzso indicating zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Finally, the zzso of zzso zzso breast and colon cancer cells to growth zzso by zzso presumably by inducing zzso in tumor cells and zzso can inhibit the zzso Taken together, our results corroborate the regulatory function of zzso in zzso zzso and imply its links with the energy zzso The zzso zzso of this association between both cellular pathways should advance the clinical use of zzso zzso
