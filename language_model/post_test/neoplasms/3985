The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of zzso CT for early detection of pneumonia in zzso patients with an unknown site of infection and normal or zzso findings on chest zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso that persisted for more than 2 days despite zzso zzso treatment underwent 146 prospective zzso If findings on chest zzso were normal zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CT zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso If zzso CT scans showed zzso zzso zzso was zzso 

zzso on chest zzso were zzso for pneumonia in 20 zzso of 146 cases, and CT findings in those cases were suggestive of zzso zzso were detected in 11 of those 20 zzso Seven of the 11 cases were not zzso treated before CT diagnosis, the other four were sufficiently zzso zzso on chest zzso and zzso CT scans were normal in 56 zzso of 146 zzso In 70 zzso of 146 cases, findings on chest zzso were normal, whereas findings on zzso CT scans were suggestive of zzso zzso were detected in 30 of the 70 zzso zzso of 30 cases were not zzso treated before CT, whereas the other 11 cases were sufficiently treated before zzso In 22 zzso of these 70 cases, an zzso was observed on the chest zzso during the 7 days after the CT zzso Only three zzso of 56 zzso occurred during the first 7 days after zzso CT studies with normal findings zzso zzso zzso Additional risk factors for pneumonia occurring later that were zzso on chest zzso were poorly defined zzso zzso zzso zzso consolidation zzso zzso zzso and younger age zzso zzso zzso 

zzso CT scans show findings suggestive of pneumonia about 5 days earlier than chest zzso show suggestive zzso When zzso CT scans show findings suggestive of pneumonia, the probability of pneumonia being detected on chest zzso during the zzso follow-up is zzso whereas the probability is only zzso when the findings on the prior zzso CT scan were normal zzso zzso zzso All zzso patients with fever of unknown origin and normal findings on chest zzso should be examined with zzso zzso
