zzso genetic evidence suggests that each product of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso possesses zzso activity zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso 2001; zzso et zzso zzso We report the generation and characterization of a zzso knockout zzso zzso and direct comparison with mice and zzso cells deficient for zzso both zzso and zzso and zzso Like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were highly susceptible to zzso zzso exhibited enhanced zzso efficiency at low density, and resisted both zzso and zzso growth zzso In contrast, the biological profile of zzso zzso in these zzso more closely resembled that of zzso zzso In zzso however, both zzso and zzso animals were significantly more tumor prone than zzso animals, but each less so than zzso or zzso animals, and with differing tumor zzso These data confirm the zzso role of zzso over zzso in cell zzso zzso of zzso yet also underscore the importance of the analysis of tumor zzso across many cell types within the zzso The zzso conditions of mice zzso deficient for either zzso or zzso agree with data derived from human cancer zzso and reinforce the view that both gene products play significant and zzso roles in suppressing zzso transformation in zzso
