Cell cycling and protein synthesis are both key zzso tasks for cancer zzso Here we present a model for how the zzso phase of protein zzso governed by zzso factor 2 and zzso factor 2 zzso both zzso and responds to cell zzso Within this framework we also discuss zzso a protein with both zzso and zzso roles whose persistence in the cell is tied to protein synthesis due to its short zzso Finally, we provide a brief overview of efforts of cancer researchers to target zzso and zzso zzso
