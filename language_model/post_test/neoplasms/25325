The results of a series of projects on the zzso drug response of human zzso zzso are zzso All were performed in one laboratory, using conventional zzso mice that were usually zzso by zzso zzso zzso treatment, and zzso zzso zzso on human zzso arising in 9 anatomical sites are included, with the main emphasis on zzso zzso breast, lung and zzso zzso also zzso Growth acceleration during successive passage of most of these zzso types was zzso When therapeutic response was measured by a zzso method there were wide differences in response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso lung zzso responded well; breast zzso showed modest zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso lung zzso responded zzso Studies of zzso cell survival were made in 11 zzso zzso zzso They confirmed the range of responsiveness and tendency towards individuality of the growth delay zzso Cell survival in most cases was zzso related to drug zzso This compilation of a large amount of experimental data supports the belief that human zzso zzso broadly maintain the level of zzso responsiveness of the source zzso in zzso
