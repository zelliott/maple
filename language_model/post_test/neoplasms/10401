zzso zzso discovered almost 35 years ago, keeps the main role in cell cycle control, zzso pathways and zzso zzso gene is found zzso in more than 50% of all human zzso in different zzso Many structures from viral to non viral were designed to incorporate and deliver in appropriate conditions forms of zzso gene or its zzso zzso to target tumor cells and to eliminate them through zzso or to restore the normal tumor zzso gene zzso Each delivery system presents advantages and low performance in relation to immune system recognition and zzso One of the major discoveries in the last years, zzso of zzso represents a powerful tool for zzso post zzso control of gene zzso According to several studies, the zzso zzso technology for zzso transcripts together with other carriers or zzso at zzso level can be used for creating new therapeutic zzso zzso interference for zzso uses different zzso zzso molecules like short interfering zzso zzso and, despite the difficulty of introducing them into zzso cells due to immune system response, it can be exploited in cancer zzso
