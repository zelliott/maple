The study of the zzso action of zzso zzso is important not only to understand the regulation of neuroendocrine zzso that express receptors zzso but also zzso zzso which express these zzso We previously demonstrated the presence of zzso in a wide panel of cell lines from human zzso Although hypotheses have been put forward that treatment with zzso or its zzso may be beneficial in zzso patients, this does not appear to be the case in zzso patients with high zzso levels (who are therefore sensitive to zzso zzso have per zzso a relatively positive zzso zzso zzso treatment with zzso is not zzso zzso patients with a poor prognosis are essentially characterized by a low expression of zzso (and therefore are insensitive to a therapy with zzso In these patients zzso treatment with zzso might be zzso but would have little chance of zzso Although the majority of neuroendocrine zzso expresses zzso zzso and prostate cancer express zzso but not zzso and are therefore insensitive to zzso treatment which binds zzso to zzso zzso like zzso zzso and breast cancer also express zzso in their more zzso zzso However, the concentration of zzso in zzso cancer is similar, if not lower than that in the surrounding normal zzso zzso the probability of successful zzso therapy with zzso is relatively zzso In breast cancer, it is possible that sensitivity to zzso may have a positive influence on the expression of zzso This might justify clinical trials with zzso in breast zzso
