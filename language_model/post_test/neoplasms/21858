To investigate the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso disposition in Asian cancer zzso 

zzso was administered over 90 zzso either at 100 zzso on days 1, 8 and 15 with the regimen being repeated every 28 days zzso or at 375 zzso once every three weeks zzso Plasma zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso after the first dose of the first cycle and the influence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on the disposition of zzso and its zzso were zzso 

zzso parameters were obtained from 71 cancer zzso zzso zzso showed the clearance of zzso to be zzso lower in patients carrying the zzso zzso than cancer patients with the reference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The area under the plasma zzso curve from zero to zzso and zzso by dose and body surface area zzso were significantly higher in patients zzso the zzso zzso than patients with the reference zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The exposure levels to zzso also showed a statistically significant trend among the zzso zzso pairs, being approximately zzso lower in patients with zzso zzso than with patients zzso the reference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso may have a significant influence on the disposition of zzso and its zzso in Asian cancer patients, and zzso patients with zzso zzso may be susceptible to increased sensitivity to zzso which may manifest itself either by increased efficacy or toxicity or both zzso to the increased exposure levels to zzso
