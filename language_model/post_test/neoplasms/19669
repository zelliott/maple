zzso damage to biological systems is determined by the type of radiation, the total dosage of exposure, the dose rate, and the region of the body zzso Three modes of cell zzso zzso and zzso well as accelerated zzso have been demonstrated to occur in zzso and in zzso in response to radiation in cancer cells as well as in normal zzso The basis for cellular selection for each mode depends on various factors including the specific cell type involved, the dose of radiation absorbed by the cell, and whether it is zzso and/or zzso Here we review the signaling mechanisms activated by radiation for the induction of toxicity in transformed and normal zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms of radiation toxicity is critical for the development of radiation zzso as well as for the improvement of clinical radiation in cancer zzso
