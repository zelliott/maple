We compared the main characteristics of zzso dose reduction during zzso and zzso beam treatment, based on an analysis of zzso zzso To simulate target movement, a target zzso was delineated in a scanned phantom and displaced by 3 to 20 zzso Although the dose reductions to the target in the 2 treatment systems were similar for zzso zzso to beam zzso target motion, they were completely different for zzso zzso to beam zzso target zzso While both zzso showed a relationship between the degree of target shift and the reduction in dose coverage, dose reduction showed a strong directional dependence in zzso beam zzso Clinical simulation of target movement for a prostate cancer patient showed that, although coverage and conformity zzso for a zzso lateral movement of the prostate were reduced by zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso beam treatment, they were reduced by only zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso zzso This difference was greater for a zzso target movement in the lateral direction, which lowered the coverage and conformity zzso by zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso beam treatment, but changed little during zzso zzso In addition, we found that the equivalent uniform dose zzso and zzso index show similar characteristics during target zzso These results suggest that zzso dose reduction differs significantly between zzso and zzso beam zzso Attention should be paid to the target margin in zzso beam treatment due to the distinct characteristics of heavy zzso zzso
