The zzso zzso product, zzso is an zzso protein zzso that zzso the zzso activity of the tumor zzso zzso and promotes its zzso About 50% of all human zzso present zzso or deletions in the zzso zzso In the remaining half of all human zzso that express the zzso zzso aberrations of zzso regulators, such as zzso account for zzso zzso For this reason, designing zzso zzso of the zzso zzso interaction is a promising strategy for the treatment of zzso retaining zzso zzso The development of zzso has been zzso Although many zzso zzso zzso have shown potent in zzso activity, only a limited number of compounds have demonstrated to possess acceptable zzso properties for in zzso zzso To date, the most studied zzso have been zzso (such as zzso zzso and zzso The zzso were the first discovered potent and selective zzso zzso of the zzso interaction and they continue to show therapeutic zzso This review will focus on recent molecular modeling approaches zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso zzso zzso used with the aim to better understand the behavior of these proteins and to discover new zzso zzso of the zzso zzso interaction for the treatment of zzso
