This study was undertaken to determine the safety, zzso zzso zzso zzso dose zzso and zzso of zzso in cancer patients with zzso impairment and to develop dosing guidelines for zzso in such zzso 

Sixty adult patients with advanced solid tumors and varying zzso function zzso zzso clearance zzso zzso 60 zzso mild dysfunction, zzso 40 to 59 zzso moderate dysfunction, zzso 20 to 39 zzso and severe dysfunction, zzso zzso 20 zzso received daily zzso doses of 100 to 800 zzso Treatment cycles were 28 days zzso 

The zzso was not reached for any zzso zzso occurred in two mild group patients zzso and 800 zzso and two moderate group patients zzso and 600 zzso Serious adverse events zzso were more common in the zzso dysfunction groups than in the normal group zzso zzso zzso There was no correlation between dose and zzso in any zzso No responses were zzso Several patients had prolonged stable zzso zzso exposure, expressed as zzso zzso area under the curve, was significantly greater in the mild and moderate groups than in the normal zzso There was a positive correlation between serum zzso acid zzso zzso concentration and plasma zzso and an inverse correlation between plasma zzso concentration and zzso zzso zzso zzso accounted for zzso to zzso of the daily zzso zzso 

Daily zzso doses up to 800 or 600 zzso were well tolerated by patients with mild and moderate zzso dysfunction, respectively, despite their having increased zzso zzso
