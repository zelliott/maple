The presence of zzso solid stresses in tumors has been suspected for some time, but these stresses were largely estimated using mathematical zzso Solid stresses can zzso the surrounding zzso and compress zzso zzso and blood zzso zzso of zzso vessels zzso zzso fluid pressure, whereas zzso of blood vessels reduces blood zzso zzso blood flow, in turn, leads to zzso which promotes tumor zzso zzso zzso invasion, and zzso and lowers the efficacy of zzso zzso and zzso Thus, strategies designed to alleviate solid stress have the potential to improve cancer zzso However, a lack of methods for measuring solid stress has hindered the development of solid zzso zzso Here, we present a simple technique to estimate the zzso solid stress accumulated within animal and human tumors, and we show that this stress can be reduced by depleting cancer cells, zzso zzso and/or zzso resulting in improved tumor zzso Furthermore, we show that therapeutic depletion of zzso zzso with an inhibitor of the sonic zzso zzso reduces solid stress, zzso blood and zzso vessels, and increases zzso In addition to providing insights into the zzso of tumors, our approach can serve as a rapid screen for zzso and zzso zzso
