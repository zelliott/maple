The identification of zzso and zzso neural stem cells zzso in the zzso brain holds promise for the treatment of neurological diseases and has yielded new insight into brain zzso However, the complete repertoire of signaling pathways that zzso the proliferation and zzso of zzso which we refer to as the zzso zzso remains largely zzso Although the candidate gene approach has uncovered vital pathways in zzso biology, so far only a few highly studied pathways have been zzso Based on the intimate relationship between zzso zzso and zzso zzso we undertook a chemical genetic screen for zzso of zzso proliferation in order to probe the operational zzso of the zzso The screen recovered small molecules known to affect zzso pathways previously thought to operate primarily in the mature central nervous system; these compounds also had potent zzso effects on cultures enriched for brain cancer stem zzso These results suggest that clinically approved zzso may zzso the mature central nervous system and find application in the treatment of brain zzso
