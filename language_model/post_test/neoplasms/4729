The cellular zzso is constantly subject to DNA damage caused by zzso factors or zzso by damaging agents such as zzso radiation or various zzso zzso The base zzso repair zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and the zzso involved in zzso synthesis zzso have been shown to contribute to cellular tolerance and repair of DNA zzso by zzso treatments, particularly the platinum zzso zzso Moreover, there is robust zzso evidence linking zzso in DNA pol zzso and zzso zzso levels to zzso DNA zzso may therefore be potential targets to increase the sensitivity of cancer cells to chemotherapy zzso In this article, the physical and chemical properties of DNA zzso zzso and the zzso synthesis zzso are reviewed with a view to identifying how they may act as targets for zzso zzso The potential clinical role of new DNA zzso zzso is discussed and how they may be combined with conventional zzso zzso
