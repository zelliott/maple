For zzso zzso the vast majority of zzso studies zzso are performed on zzso specimens for diagnostic purposes, and they can be performed on zzso or previously stained direct zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso has been approved for the preparation of zzso zzso there is scant literature describing the utility of zzso methodology on zzso specimens fixed and processed by this zzso 

zzso fresh specimens were obtained from the surgical gross room and zzso or scraped to collect cells for thin layer zzso and direct zzso zzso zzso included a variety of zzso and zzso samples that were either zzso zzso stained or zzso zzso One group of US zzso slides was subjected to zzso retrieval zzso zzso was graded zzso Each sample acted as its own zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso insulin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso collagen IV, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso overall results zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There were five zzso results, 2 with zzso and 3 with zzso and 1 zzso zzso 

zzso performed on the zzso Processor showed equal or greater intensity and distribution of proper zzso when compared to direct zzso with the following zzso zzso cleaner background, easier to zzso zzso less zzso required in a smaller area; zzso zzso can be done on zzso thin layer zzso zzso thin layer slides can be modified for multiple zzso tests; zzso additional thin layer slides can be prepared for zzso bases on zzso No significant differences of zzso were seen when comparing thin layer zzso and zzso zzso zzso retrieval offered no advantage in this zzso
