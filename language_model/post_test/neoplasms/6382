The zzso gene zzso is involved in cancer development through cell growth zzso by inducing zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso consisting of two zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso 2 that are in complete linkage zzso has been extensively studied in association with cancer zzso We performed a zzso of published studies that examined the association between this zzso zzso zzso and cancer by searching for relevant studies on zzso and zzso up to February 28, zzso zzso data from 19 zzso studies that included zzso cancer cases and zzso controls, we found that carriers of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had an increased global risk of cancer zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso There was no evidence of an effect modification of zzso zzso by age, zzso ethnicity or smoking status in zzso zzso however, a zzso statistically significant increased risk was found among individuals zzso years zzso In zzso analysis, the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was associated with the presence of the zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is suggestive of a biological interaction between the two genes in zzso In conclusion, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso might be a risk factor for cancer, especially in combination with the zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso Further studies looking at zzso zzso and zzso zzso 4 zzso interaction are required to support our zzso
