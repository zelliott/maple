Monitoring of progress in cancer patient survival by cancer zzso should be as up-to-date as zzso Period analysis has been shown to provide more up-to-date survival estimates than do traditional methods of survival zzso However, there is a zzso between zzso and the precision of period estimates, in that increasing the zzso of survival estimates by restricting the analysis to a relatively short, recent time period, such as the most recent calendar year for which cancer registry data are available, goes along with a loss of zzso The authors propose a zzso approach to maximize the zzso of period estimates at minimal loss of zzso The approach is illustrated for monitoring of zzso relative survival of patients diagnosed with one of 20 common forms of cancer in Finland between 1953 and 2002 by use of data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer zzso It is shown that the zzso approach provides survival estimates that are as up-to-date as the most up-to-date conventional period estimates and at the same time much more precise than the zzso The modeling approach may further enhance the use of period analysis for zzso up-to-date cancer survival zzso
