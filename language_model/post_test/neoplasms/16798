A zzso model is represented, that allows to estimate the number of surviving tumor cells at the end of zzso series with equivalent zzso On this base a zzso for zzso calculation was zzso The zzso allows to estimate optimal conditions of dose zzso in which a zzso of a maximum number of tumor cells is zzso For the zzso of zzso tumors, characterized by the zzso number zzso greater than 2, optimal parameters can be obtained by means of simple mathematical zzso The elaborated model allows to increase the efficiency in zzso of zzso tumors with known zzso zzso
