There is growing evidence that zzso patients receiving zzso therapy are at greater risk of developing zzso zzso due to the zzso of an active zzso zzso zzso which is usually zzso by the zzso This study examined the relationships between zzso zzso zzso function, and trough plasma zzso of zzso and its zzso zzso in 21 patients zzso zzso zzso years: 11 zzso receiving either oral or subcutaneous zzso for terminal cancer zzso The median daily zzso zzso zzso were: orally zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The median plasma zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were: zzso zzso and zzso zzso The plasma zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were each significantly related to the daily zzso dosage zzso zzso 21, zzso r zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was dependent on zzso zzso The plasma zzso of zzso and zzso when divided by the zzso zzso were significantly related to the calculated zzso clearance of the zzso Patients receiving oral zzso had higher plasma concentration ratios of zzso than those receiving subcutaneous therapy, presumably due to zzso zzso The results of this study confirm that zzso of the zzso active zzso is related to zzso function, which probably explains the observation that zzso dosage requirements are generally reduced in patients with zzso zzso
