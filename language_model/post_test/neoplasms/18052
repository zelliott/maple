Cancer stem cells are supposed to be resistant to zzso but information for this is quite zzso Cancer stem cells are usually isolated as zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso called zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso dye itself zzso zzso the SP cells isolated by such method are not suitable for evaluation of zzso For accurate assessment, SP cells must be isolated without zzso zzso Here, we found that zzso was highly expressed in SP cells of two zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Then, the high expression of zzso was used for isolation of cancer stem cells among zzso zzso cell lines as a surrogate zzso zzso expressing high level of zzso zzso were resistant to zzso induced by serum depletion as in the case of SP zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells showed high zzso zzso molecules such as zzso were abundantly expressed in both SP cells and zzso zzso These findings indicated that SP cells as revealed to be zzso cells were tolerant to zzso The high expression of zzso may be a useful character for SP cells in evaluating their zzso
