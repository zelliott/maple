The purpose of this study was to investigate the efficacy and safety of oral zzso given alone or in combination with zzso in the control of zzso delayed zzso 

This was an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso parallel group zzso A total of 640 zzso patients received zzso 8 zzso zzso and zzso 20 zzso zzso for the control of acute zzso prior to zzso zzso or zzso 70 zzso on day zzso Patients who were not rescued or withdrawn on day 1 were to be zzso 24 hours after the start of zzso administration to one of four zzso group I zzso oral zzso twice daily zzso on days 2-6 zzso zzso zzso group II zzso (8 zzso zzso zzso on days 2/3 followed by zzso zzso zzso on days 4-6 zzso zzso zzso group III zzso (8 zzso zzso zzso on days 2-6 zzso zzso zzso group IV zzso (8 zzso zzso zzso plus zzso (4 zzso zzso zzso on days 2-6 zzso zzso zzso 

On day 1, zzso of patients had complete control of acute zzso with zzso having no zzso and no zzso Over days 2/3 and over days 2-6, significantly more patients receiving zzso plus zzso zzso zzso reported no zzso and no zzso zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso alone zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso for all zzso zzso There were no significant differences in the control of zzso over days zzso where zzso of patients had complete zzso control zzso zzso zzso with zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso II + zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso In the distribution of zzso grades, zzso plus zzso zzso zzso was significantly superior to zzso zzso II + zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso over days zzso Over days 2-6 there were no significant differences in the control of zzso however a comparison of the distribution of zzso grades over days 2-6 showed zzso plus zzso zzso zzso to be significantly superior to zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso All treatments were well tolerated and no unexpected drug-related adverse events were zzso There were no differences in the overall zzso of adverse events between the active treatment groups or zzso zzso and headache, zzso side effects of zzso zzso antagonists, were the most commonly reported adverse events with the zzso of zzso with zzso alone zzso zzso being significantly greater than with over days 2-6 zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

In contrast to some previous zzso in this study, zzso alone appears to have a minor role in the control of zzso delayed zzso and zzso In conclusion, the combination of oral zzso plus zzso is superior to zzso and to zzso
