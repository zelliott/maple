The genetic modification of T zzso is an important methodology for investigating zzso biology and bears great promise as a possible strategy for cancer zzso Several genetic approaches under evaluation aim to facilitate and increase the recognition of tumor zzso enhance zzso activities, and counteract the multiple mechanisms responsible for tumor immune evasion in zzso T cells can also be engineered in an attempt to control their zzso to increase the safety of adoptive zzso therapies, and express markers that can be tracked by zzso imaging zzso
