Poor zzso is a unique and prevalent feature of solid tumors associated with poor patient zzso In part, this is caused by a series of zzso cellular responses that together have a large impact on gene expression and cell zzso zzso plays a key role in this response by zzso a zzso program that stimulates genes involved in zzso cell zzso cell survival and cell zzso Recently, zzso has also been shown to suppress protein synthesis through the regulation of the initiation step of zzso zzso This appears to be a common feature of the cell in response to zzso and is zzso by two distinct zzso The first occurs zzso is zzso and is associated with zzso of the unfolded protein response zzso that occurs in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during this initial phase is due to zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso zzso in a zzso dependent zzso Although this effect is zzso overall levels of translation remain low during zzso due to zzso of a second zzso initiation complex, zzso This second mechanism is zzso but due at least in part to zzso of the zzso zzso Although each of these pathways leads to a general zzso in translation, the consequence at the individual gene level is highly zzso This is due to sequences in the zzso and 3' untranslated regions zzso of zzso that zzso their ability to zzso or even increase, translation efficiency in spite of the overall zzso zzso regulation of zzso translation appears to be an important zzso of gene expression during zzso
