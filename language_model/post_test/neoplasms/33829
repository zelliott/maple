Cancer is a genetic disease, most prominent in developed countries, with still a high mortality zzso Cancer cells are continuously proliferating, and this uncontrolled growth is zzso by the zzso of different signal zzso pathways that ultimately lead to the zzso zzso zzso a large effort has been devoted to design specific molecules that interfere with these signaling zzso involved in zzso In the last decades, research has resulted in improvements in both detection and treatment of zzso However, it is still necessary to develop novel zzso therapies that would allow an appropriate treatment for each cancer zzso These novel, zzso and zzso therapies will have a dramatic impact in improving the overall survival zzso Ras is one of the most important zzso so far identified in human zzso zzso the regulation of zzso zzso under normal and zzso environments may provide clues for the design of efficient specific zzso zzso In this review we will illustrate how the family of Ras zzso may be a valid model for the development of new cancer zzso
