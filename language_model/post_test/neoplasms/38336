zzso zzso distribution in zzso will lead to a zzso absorbed zzso The aim of this study was to investigate how zzso control probability zzso depends on the zzso distribution in the zzso both zzso and at the zzso zzso The absorbed dose in the cell zzso of zzso was calculated for zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso were zzso distributed within the zzso compartment and they were zzso normally or zzso distributed among the cells in the zzso When all cells contain the same amount of activity, the zzso activities required for zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and 2-3 times higher when the activity was distributed on the cell membrane compared to in the cell nucleus for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso was not affected by different zzso zzso whereas for zzso it was slightly affected when the zzso was in the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were affected by different zzso zzso to a great extent when the zzso were in the cell nucleus and to lesser zzso when the zzso were distributed on the cell membrane or in the zzso When the activity was distributed in the nucleus, zzso increased when the activity distribution became more zzso for zzso and zzso and the increase was large when the activity was normally distributed compared to zzso zzso When the activity was distributed on the cell zzso zzso was not affected for zzso and zzso when the activity distribution became more zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were not affected by different activity zzso neither zzso nor zzso
