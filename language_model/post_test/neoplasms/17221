The transfer of T cell zzso zzso genes into patient T cells is a promising approach for the treatment of both viral infections and zzso Although efficient methods exist to identify zzso for the treatment of these diseases, comparable strategies to identify zzso have been zzso We have developed a zzso zzso strategy to identify zzso sequences by the capture and sequencing of zzso DNA fragments zzso the zzso zzso We establish the value of this approach by assembling a large library of cancer zzso tumor zzso zzso Furthermore, by exploiting the quantitative nature of zzso gene capture, we show the feasibility of identifying zzso zzso in zzso T cell populations from either human material or zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate the ability to identify zzso zzso within zzso T cell zzso without knowledge of zzso zzso which may be the first step toward the development of zzso zzso gene therapy to target zzso zzso in human zzso
