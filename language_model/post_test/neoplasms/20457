We have previously reported that zzso tumor cells can be either zzso or zzso in zzso depending on whether or not these cells are heat stressed before induction of zzso zzso zzso cells express heat shock proteins on their plasma zzso and zzso cells are capable of distinguishing them from zzso zzso zzso Here we provide evidence that when zzso heat shock protein 70 or zzso cell zzso zzso from zzso normal tissue is used as an zzso with zzso zzso tumor cells in zzso potent zzso immunity can be zzso This zzso immunity is zzso by T cells because zzso effects are not observed in either severe combined zzso or T zzso zzso We further demonstrate that vaccination of mice with zzso tumor cells mixed with zzso zzso as zzso were capable of enhancing the production of zzso zzso inducing specific zzso T zzso and zzso long-lasting zzso zzso Stress proteins from zzso normal tissue components therefore can serve as danger signals to enhance the zzso of zzso tumor cells and stimulate zzso immunity
