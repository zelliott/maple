This phase I zzso study was designed in order to verify if the sequential administration of zzso a zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso a zzso zzso factor zzso was superior to zzso alone in improving tolerance of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A group of 10 heavily zzso patients with stage IV disease and no therapeutic option were enrolled into the zzso They received two courses of the same chemotherapy with zzso and zzso at doses of 1,500 zzso and 400 zzso zzso zzso doses were escalated from 450 to 600 zzso After chemotherapy each patient was allocated randomly to receive either 14 days of zzso zzso zzso or 7 days of zzso followed by 7 days of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the second chemotherapy course was zzso Both zzso and zzso were given 5 zzso zzso Twenty chemotherapy courses are zzso 10 in each zzso Absolute zzso count zzso 1 zzso zzso was observed for 54 days in arm A zzso 68 days in arm B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso count zzso 20 zzso zzso 57 days zzso 30 days zzso zzso zzso days of hospitalization 35 zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 107 zzso 58 zzso zzso zzso packed red blood cell unit zzso 15 zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso Seven patients had zzso These data indicate that zzso chemotherapy may be delivered without bone zzso or peripheral stem cell support, with acceptable zzso and that, while zzso alone shortens days of zzso the combination of the two zzso shortens the time of zzso and decreases the number of zzso zzso
