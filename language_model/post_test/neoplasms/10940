zzso aberration frequency in peripheral zzso of healthy individuals has been found to be zzso of future cancer zzso The zzso of zzso aberrations over time, which is largely unknown, should be clarified to interpret the strength of this association and to determine its use in cancer zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso aberration frequency was therefore zzso From a pooled database zzso 11 national zzso zzso the authors included zzso blood samples from zzso subjects with at least one repeated zzso aberration zzso The generalized zzso correlation zzso of zzso was low, indicating high zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso resulting in a high likelihood of zzso The relation between zzso aberration frequency and future cancer risk has probably been underestimated in previous zzso A single zzso aberration measurement seems not to be representative of the whole lifespan level of zzso instability and greatly limits the use of zzso aberration zzso measured with zzso zzso individual risk zzso
