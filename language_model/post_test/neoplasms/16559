zzso zzso of zzso cells has provided a reliable approach for detection of specific zzso expression in zzso An advantage of fluorescent markers has been their zzso to zzso zzso cellular analysis by flow zzso zzso zzso has thus become an integral component of clinical laboratory zzso particularly in the areas of zzso and zzso One of the major drawbacks of traditional zzso zzso even with flow zzso zzso has been the difficulty in detecting low abundance cellular zzso some of which may have clinical and scientific zzso To address these problems, zzso techniques have recently been developed to increase the sensitivity of cellular zzso detection by flow zzso In this review we will describe a few of these techniques and focus on zzso amplification zzso as a means to generate a highly zzso zzso zzso We will also discuss practical applications of zzso amplification for zzso of clinical zzso
