Our work on zzso based on the possible risk characteristics for local recurrence in tumor zzso and the zzso of treatment plans using biological objective functions that are zzso are zzso 

A series of intensity modulated zzso techniques are compared to their corresponding intensity modulated plans in which the entire zzso is treated to a single dose level, delivering the same equivalent uniform dose zzso to the entire zzso zzso and zzso maps are introduced as a tool to aid the planner in the evaluation of the resulting zzso dose zzso zzso and zzso maps are akin to zzso maps in zzso zzso zzso The impact of the currently limited diagnostic accuracy of functional imaging on a series of zzso techniques is also zzso 

zzso biological parameters zzso zzso in the generation of zzso plans results in an increase in the therapeutic ratio as compared to conventional zzso plans in which zzso techniques based on physical dose are zzso 

zzso employing biological parameters appears to be a promising approach for individualized zzso and zzso zzso
