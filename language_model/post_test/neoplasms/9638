zzso protein zzso zzso zzso are key signaling pathways involved in the regulation of normal cell zzso survival and zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso contribute to cancer and other human zzso In particular, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been the subject of intense research scrutiny leading to the development of zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso is a downstream component of an zzso zzso signaling module that is activated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso activates the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso which then activate zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso supports the important role of this zzso in human zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso is a key downstream zzso of the Ras small zzso the most frequently zzso zzso in human zzso Finally, Ras is a key downstream zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso which is zzso activated and/or zzso in a wide variety of human zzso zzso zzso also promotes zzso expression of zzso zzso promoting an zzso growth loop critical for tumor zzso Thus, the zzso signaling network has been the subject of intense research and pharmaceutical scrutiny to identify novel zzso approaches for cancer zzso In this review, we zzso the current status of the different approaches and targets that are under evaluation and development for the therapeutic intervention of this key signaling zzso in human zzso
