Between 1988 and 1993, 57 superficial and subsurface zzso of various zzso type were treated with a zzso zzso heating zzso Mean zzso zzso depth of the 57 zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso Total radiation dose ranged from 20 to 70 zzso with a mean of 53 zzso For the remaining three zzso zzso was zzso zzso was given once a week, and a total of zzso heat sessions was zzso Our goal of zzso treatment was to elevate all monitored zzso points zzso 41 degrees C for zzso 30 zzso The mean zzso number of zzso zzso points was zzso zzso The goal of zzso treatment was achieved in zzso of the zzso At the time of maximum zzso regression, complete response was noted in zzso of the zzso treated with zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that parameters including zzso type zzso cancer versus zzso zzso depth, minimum zzso temperature, average zzso temperature, minimum equivalent time at 43 degrees C, and number of heat sessions achieving the treatment goal significantly affected the zzso response of the combined treatment, while total radiation dose and number of heat sessions were not significant factors for zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that only zzso depth zzso 3 versus zzso or zzso 3 zzso was a significant zzso factor for zzso response zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso cancer versus others) and a number of heat sessions achieving the treatment goal zzso versus zzso were found to be of borderline significance in the zzso analysis zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The number of heat sessions achieving a minimum zzso temperature of zzso 41 degrees C for zzso 30 zzso seems a practical zzso zzso that influences zzso zzso The present study indicates the importance of quality and quantity of heat session on the treatment outcome of zzso
