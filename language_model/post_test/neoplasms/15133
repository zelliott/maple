The zzso tumor zzso is a key regulator of cell growth and survival upon various forms of cellular zzso zzso is a zzso zzso factor that binds specifically to DNA and activates zzso of target zzso The core domain of zzso holds a zinc atom that protects zzso from zzso and is critical for DNA zzso A large fraction of human tumors carry zzso zzso allowing evasion of zzso and tumor zzso Restoration of wild type zzso expression triggers rapid elimination of tumors in zzso This makes zzso zzso an attractive target for novel cancer zzso Small molecules have been identified that reactivate zzso zzso and induce zzso in tumor zzso Interestingly, several of these compounds share the ability to target zzso and affect the zzso state of zzso indicating that this is critical for zzso zzso zzso The identification of a common chemical activity among zzso zzso compounds will facilitate the design of even more potent and selective zzso zzso drugs for improved cancer therapy in the zzso
