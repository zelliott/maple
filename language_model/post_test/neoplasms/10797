We developed zzso reveals zzso zzso an zzso that uses next-generation sequencing reads with partial alignments to a reference zzso to directly map structural variations at the zzso level of zzso Application of zzso to zzso sequencing data from five pediatric zzso acute zzso zzso zzso and a human melanoma cell line, zzso identified 160 zzso structural zzso Experimental validation exceeded zzso demonstrating that zzso had a high zzso zzso
