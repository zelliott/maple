zzso zzso of cancer zzso transfer of T cells or zzso can lead to some objective clinical responses, thus demonstrating that the immune system can reject zzso However, passive zzso is not expected to yield memory T cells that might control tumor zzso Active zzso with zzso cell zzso vaccines has the potential to induce zzso zzso and memory T zzso Clinical trials testing first-generation DC vaccines zzso with tumor zzso provided a zzso that therapeutic immunity can be zzso Newer generation DC vaccines are built on the increased knowledge of the DC system, including the existence of distinct DC zzso and their plasticity all leading to the generation of distinct types of zzso Rather than the quantity of zzso zzso T cells, we should aim at generating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells able to reject tumors and zzso memory zzso T cells able to prevent zzso
