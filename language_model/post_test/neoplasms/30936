A cohort of 1971 chemical workers licensed to handle zzso oxide was followed up zzso from 1940 to 1984 and the vital status of each subject was zzso No quantitative information on exposure was available and therefore cohort members were considered as presumably exposed to zzso zzso The cohort comprised zzso subjects allowed to handle only zzso oxide and zzso subjects who obtained a zzso valid for zzso oxide as well as other toxic zzso Potential zzso arising from the exposure to these other chemical agents was taken into zzso zzso of death were found from death certificates and comparisons of mortality were made with the general population of the region where cohort members were zzso zzso six deaths were reported whereas zzso were zzso the difference was statistically zzso The number of zzso for any site exceeded the expected number zzso mortality ratio zzso zzso zzso 43 observed zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and approached statistical zzso For all considered cancer sites the zzso were higher than 100 but the excess was only significant zzso zzso zzso two sided zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso revision zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso four observed zzso zzso zzso zzso The excess of cases for all zzso of zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso also approached statistical significance zzso zzso zzso six observed zzso zzso zzso zzso Focusing the analysis on the zzso of the zzso oxide only licensed workers, who are likely to have experienced a more severe exposure to this gas, it became evident that all but one of the observed cases of zzso tissue zzso in the cohort were confined to this zzso enhancing the relevant zzso to 700 zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso
