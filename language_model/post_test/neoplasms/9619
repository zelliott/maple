This study aimed to evaluate whether experimental zzso disease in acute phase under zzso therapy can cause DNA damage in peripheral blood, liver, heart, and zzso cells or induce zzso oxide synthesis in zzso zzso Twenty zzso mice were distributed into four groups: control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso infected and submitted to zzso zzso and only treated with zzso The results obtained with the single cell gel zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso was able induce DNA damage in heart cells of both zzso treated or zzso infected zzso Similarly, zzso zzso infected animals showed an increase of DNA zzso in zzso zzso Regarding zzso oxide zzso statistically significant differences zzso were observed in all experimental groups compared to negative control, the strongest effect observed in the zzso zzso infected zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso zzso may increase the level of DNA damage in mice heart and zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide plays an important role in DNA damaging whereas zzso was able to minimize induced zzso zzso zzso effects in zzso zzso
