To determine the role of the zzso tumor gene zzso in zzso of solid tumors, expression of the zzso gene was examined in 34 solid tumor cell lines (four gastric cancer cell lines, five colon cancer cell lines, 15 lung cancer cell lines, four breast cancer cell lines, one germ cell tumor cell line, two zzso cancer cell lines, one zzso cancer cell line, one zzso cancer cell line, and one zzso zzso cell line) by means of quantitative reverse zzso chain zzso zzso gene expression was detected in three of the four gastric cancer cell lines, all of the five colon cancer cell lines, 12 of the 15 lung cancer cell lines, two of the four breast cancer cell lines, the germ cell tumor cell line, the two zzso cancer cell lines, the zzso cancer cell line, the zzso cancer cell line, and the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of the 34 solid tumor cell lines zzso 28 zzso expressed zzso Three cell lines expressing zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso lung cancer cell line zzso and zzso cancer cell line zzso were further analyzed for zzso and/or deletions in the zzso gene by means of zzso zzso zzso zzso However, no zzso or deletions were detected in the region of the zzso gene ranging from the 3' end of zzso 1 to zzso 10 (the zzso gene consists of 10 zzso in these three cell zzso Furthermore, when zzso zzso and zzso cells were treated with zzso zzso zzso the growth of these cells was significantly inhibited in association with a reduction in zzso protein zzso Furthermore, constitute expression of the zzso zzso gene in cancer cells inhibited the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso on cell zzso These results indicated that the zzso gene plays an essential role in the growth of solid tumors and performs an zzso rather than a zzso gene zzso
