In addition to its possible role as a replacement source in zzso degenerative diseases, neural transplantation may be used to augment the normal production of zzso zzso Our laboratory at the University of Illinois at Chicago has zzso in both acute and chronic pain models, that transplantation of adrenal zzso tissue or isolated zzso cells into zzso pain zzso regions can reduce pain sensitivity in zzso zzso cells were chosen as the donor source since they produce high levels of both zzso peptides and zzso substances which reduce pain sensitivity when injected locally into the spinal zzso zzso The analgesia produced by these transplants probably results from the release of both zzso peptides and catecholamines since it can be blocked or attenuated by both zzso and zzso zzso Studies indicate that even over long periods there is no apparent development of zzso Promising results have been obtained in preliminary clinical studies using zzso of adrenal zzso to relieve cancer zzso This clinical review encompasses results at two Medical zzso of Illinois at Chicago and University Paul zzso zzso zzso assessing efficacy of zzso adrenal zzso transplantation for alleviating cancer zzso Our clinical and autopsy data strongly support our previous laboratory studies, zzso that zzso cell transplants into the zzso space represent a promising new approach to the zzso of chronic zzso It is suggested that further clinical studies are now zzso
