By analyzing the gene expression profile between tumor cells and zzso counterparts that have a suppressed zzso zzso we previously reported a significant zzso of zzso controlled tumor protein zzso in the zzso In the present study, we zzso by using the zzso zzso as a selective agent, zzso from three major solid zzso zzso zzso and melanoma cell zzso These cells have a strongly suppressed zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso The level of zzso is decreased in most of the zzso To verify whether zzso of zzso expression zzso changes in the zzso zzso in the classical, well established model of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso By zzso the expression of zzso the number of zzso cells was raised to zzso instead of the reported rate for spontaneous flat zzso of zzso Because zzso encodes for a zzso factor, we tested the hypothesis that zzso of the zzso zzso could be effective against tumor zzso We show that some zzso compounds zzso and zzso and other pharmacological compounds with a related structure (including zzso and zzso kill tumor cells and significantly decrease the level of zzso All together, these data suggest that, with tumor zzso used as a working model, zzso was identified as a target and drugs were selected that decrease its expression and kill tumor zzso
