The five examples given here illustrate new zzso agents at different stages of zzso In all cases, considerable effort has gone into detailed zzso studies conducted before and during the clinical phase I zzso Has this effort contributed significantly to the development of these zzso At present, it has to be said that the contribution made in the case of these particular agents has been zzso For the zzso the availability of the zzso data did not permit a zzso guided dose escalation to be performed because of zzso zzso and a similar comment can be made for zzso since the human plasma zzso values at the zzso were much lower than in the zzso For the zzso zzso a detailed knowledge of the zzso of the closed and open forms of the various agents did not influence the way in which the studies were conducted, nor did zzso information appreciably do so for zzso although some comfort was gained by clinical investigators when the short zzso seen in zzso species was also observed in zzso For zzso therapeutic drug monitoring is clearly essential, although toxicity remains a zzso Of course, a proper understanding of the zzso and metabolism of these agents greatly improves the interpretation of the clinical observations made and is often critical in planning the next stages of zzso This is more clearly seen with agents that have unusual forms of zzso such as zzso zzso acid, for which the achievement of zzso target zzso is a key element in clinical trials zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Moreover, as reviewed elsewhere zzso and zzso zzso see also Graham and Kaye, this zzso there are several other instances where zzso guided dose escalation has greatly improved the conduct of a phase I zzso Good examples of this are zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso et zzso 1992) and DNA zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Not surprisingly then, zzso can help guide early clinical studies of some compounds but not others and whether they will be of value can only be determined by carrying out the zzso zzso The real value of the zzso studies for the five compounds reviewed may not yet have been zzso zzso variations in drug handling can play a major part in determining levels of zzso activity as well as zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
