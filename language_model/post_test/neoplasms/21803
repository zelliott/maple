zzso patterns of cancer death rates in the zzso have zzso been presented by county or zzso into state economic or health service zzso zzso we present the geographic patterns of cancer death rates in the zzso by congressional zzso Many congressional districts do not follow state or county zzso However, counties are the smallest geographical units for which death rates are zzso Thus, a method based on the zzso relationship of census geographic units was developed to estimate zzso death rates for congressional districts using data obtained at county zzso These rates may be useful in zzso to legislators and policy makers about the cancer burden and potential impact of cancer control in their zzso 

zzso data were obtained from the National Center for Health Statistics zzso for zzso for 50 states, the District of Columbia, and all zzso We zzso annual average zzso death rates for all cancer sites combined, the four major zzso zzso and zzso zzso female breast, and zzso zzso and cervical zzso Cancer death rates varied widely across congressional districts for all cancer sites combined, for the four major zzso and for cervical zzso When examined at the national level, broad patterns of mortality by sex, race and region were generally similar with those previously observed based on county and state economic zzso 

We developed a method to generate cancer death rates by congressional district using zzso mortality zzso zzso the cancer burden by congressional district may be useful in promoting cancer control and prevention programs, and persuading legislators to enact new cancer control programs and/or strengthening existing zzso The method can be applied to state legislative districts and other analyses that involve data zzso from different geographic zzso
