In 1987 a Canadian company implemented an exposure tracking and health information zzso The exposure tracking method aligned closely with published concepts for describing workplace exposure, with over zzso similar exposure groups being used to describe occupational zzso The database has been actively maintained and is subject to a number of quality zzso Recently, the company initiated a cancer morbidity study, with one objective being to examine whether the exposure tracking data could be used to reconstruct exposure estimates for the zzso Five zzso zzso petroleum zzso zzso hydrocarbon zzso and fuels, hydrocarbon zzso and an index for exposure to operations derived from noise zzso selected for development of occupational exposure estimates for each cohort zzso The cohort consisted of workers first employed between January 1964 and December 1994 and who were employed for at least 1 zzso Work history records were associated with a similar exposure group, using human resources data and knowledge of local industrial zzso Only employees with zzso duration of their work history assigned were kept in the cohort zzso people out of a possible zzso For each similar exposure group zzso the substances were identified that contributed to each of the five agents being zzso Exposure estimates before 1987 were modified using historic occupational exposure zzso Rules were created to sum the exposure from multiple substances found in any one similar exposure zzso The zzso of exposure estimates was tested via comparison with results documented in industrial hygiene survey zzso Industrial zzso who were unaware of the derived exposure estimates evaluated several hundred industrial hygiene surveys and prepared benchmark zzso The two lists were then evaluated for zzso which was found to be significantly different from that occurring by zzso We conclude that the process described can create valid exposure estimates for use in epidemiology zzso
