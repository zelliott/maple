zzso zzso at moderate temperatures zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso is currently being investigated to assess its effectiveness as an zzso to other cancer zzso At our institution, the zzso heating is achieved by a combination of hot air circulation and zzso zzso heating at zzso zzso This paper reports the results of a study of the zzso energy deposition pattern associated with the zzso zzso The zzso consists of a single loop of nearly elliptical shape with dimensions 20 zzso 46 zzso The loop is embedded in a mattress and is fed by lead wires entering the side of the zzso zzso mapping in a heated gelatin phantom placed just above the zzso loop showed maximum heating near the lead wires and a cool region above the center of the zzso zzso of the zzso induced and zzso contributions to the electric field near the zzso indicate that the heating near the lead wires is largely zzso in zzso This feature of the zzso heating is of interest because zzso fields result in preferential heating of fatty zzso Further calculations showed that the zzso heating contribution falls away much more rapidly than the induced field contribution with increasing distance from the plane of the zzso zzso
