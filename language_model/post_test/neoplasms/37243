zzso in the von zzso zzso gene are correlated with a diverse group of zzso including zzso clear cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genetic studies suggest that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso complementary DNA zzso into zzso cells zzso their ability to form tumors in nude zzso Recently, it was discovered that the zzso gene product zzso binds to two zzso of the zzso zzso complex zzso zzso resulting in decreased activity of this complex in zzso It is proposed that zzso functions in zzso as a negative regulator of zzso zzso however, the zzso zzso of zzso has not been clearly zzso zzso zzso has been observed in either the nucleus or the zzso of cultured cells, depending on the density of the cell zzso In this article, the cellular zzso of zzso in normal and zzso human zzso is documented using three different zzso zzso Strong expression of zzso was observed in the zzso cells of all zzso zzso particularly in zzso zzso and was exclusively zzso Lesser degrees of zzso also zzso were observed in other cell zzso A variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso breast, zzso and zzso showed strong zzso zzso for zzso including four of five sporadic clear cell zzso Of the zzso zzso zzso only one zzso an zzso zzso failed to stain for zzso The findings establish zzso expression of zzso at the protein level and provide strong evidence that most, if not all, zzso is localized to the zzso of cells in zzso
