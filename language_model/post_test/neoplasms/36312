This paper proposes a new zzso zzso in a zzso device with zzso and a zzso zzso channel network for the formation of cancer cell zzso The zzso can generate rapid and uniform cell clusters in zzso and test in zzso zzso of zzso drugs including sequential drug treatments, long term culture of zzso and cell viability zzso zzso ports are connected to the zzso by a zzso resistance zzso This uniform distribution of cell suspensions results in regular zzso zzso zzso cancer cells were trapped in zzso and zzso into tumor zzso within 3 zzso A zzso test of the zzso in zzso was subsequently processed in the same device without the extraction of zzso The in zzso zzso zzso of tumor zzso in zzso was comparable with the zzso zzso on hanging drop zzso using a conventional zzso zzso It was observed that the zzso rate of the zzso was less than that in the zzso culture dish and the effect on tumor zzso was different depending on the zzso zzso This device could provide a convenient in zzso zzso tool to assess the zzso of zzso drugs on tumor zzso offering more information than the conventional zzso culture zzso
