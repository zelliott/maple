An area of active research in DNA zzso analysis focuses on identifying zzso expressed genes between normal and zzso zzso The analysis is complicated by the presence of several unreliable expression zzso Here, we illustrate a methodology where the expression estimates are modeled as censored data and discriminating genes are selected using zzso zzso
