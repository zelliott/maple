The impact of total serum cholesterol as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease decreases with age, which casts doubt on the necessity for cholesterol-lowering therapy in the zzso We assessed the influence of total cholesterol zzso on specific and zzso mortality in people aged 85 years and zzso 

In zzso participants zzso age 89 zzso total cholesterol zzso were measured and mortality risks calculated over 10 years of zzso Three categories of total cholesterol zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso zzso In a zzso of 137 participants, total cholesterol was measured again after 5 years of zzso zzso risks for the three categories of total cholesterol zzso were estimated with a Cox zzso model, adjusted for age, sex, and cardiovascular risk zzso The primary causes of death were coded according to the International zzso of Diseases zzso 

During 10 years of follow-up from Dec 1, 1986, to Oct 1, 1996, a total of zzso participants zzso Each 1 zzso increase in total cholesterol corresponded to a zzso decrease in mortality zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso This risk estimate was similar in the zzso of participants who had stable cholesterol zzso over a zzso zzso The main cause of death was cardiovascular disease with a similar mortality risk in the three total cholesterol zzso zzso from cancer and infection was significantly lower among the participants in the highest total cholesterol category than in the other categories, which largely explained the lower zzso mortality in this zzso 

In people older than 85 years, high total cholesterol zzso are associated with longevity zzso to lower mortality from cancer and zzso The effects of cholesterol-lowering therapy have yet to be zzso
