Three chief cell types were studied in 8 canine mixed zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso cells, and filament cells, the last being the zzso cells recognized by light zzso Most zzso filaments in the zzso cells were 5 to 8 zzso thick, whereas another type of filaments were scattered, 8 to 10 zzso zzso Almost all zzso filaments in the filament cells were 8 to 10 zzso zzso In the zzso parts of the tumors, zzso cells were chiefly seen, along with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were rarely observed without zzso zzso of zzso The filament cells were largely confined to the zzso and zzso parts of the zzso The presence of cells of transitional forms in zzso areas suggested that the filament cells were derived from the zzso zzso
