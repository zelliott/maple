zzso gene expression analysis plays an important role in identifying zzso expressed genes in various pathological states, gene expression regulation and zzso shedding light on gene zzso Although zzso is widely used as a powerful tool in this regard, it is zzso zzso and unable to detect unknown gene zzso Here we demonstrated effective detection of differential expression and zzso of certain genes by expressed sequence tag analysis using a selected subset of zzso zzso We discussed the issues of sequencing depth and library preparation, and propose that increased sequencing depth and improved preparation procedures may allow detection of many expression features for less abundant gene zzso With the reduction of sequencing cost and the emerging of new generation sequencing technology, in-depth sequencing of zzso pools or libraries may represent a better and powerful tool in gene expression profiling and cancer zzso zzso We also propose using zzso zzso to remove hundreds of the most abundant zzso genes to increase sequencing depth without affecting relative expression ratio of other zzso as transcripts from as few as 300 most abundantly expressed genes constitute about zzso of the total zzso zzso sequencing also represents a unique advantage of detecting unknown forms of zzso such as alternative zzso zzso fusion zzso and regulatory zzso as well as detecting zzso and zzso that may play important roles in disease zzso
