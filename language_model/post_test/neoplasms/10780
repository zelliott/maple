zzso a new member of the B7 family, may participate in the negative regulation of zzso zzso while zzso zzso expression is detected in some tumors and it zzso in the occurrence and development of the zzso In this study, we developed one zzso zzso zzso whose clone zzso was zzso against the zzso zzso of zzso through zzso of zzso mice with the zzso cells that expressed zzso zzso zzso And we detected the expression characteristics of zzso in various tumors using zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly higher in the tumor zzso derived from zzso breast, and colon than in their corresponding normal zzso Further, the zzso expression was related to the stage of the zzso In contrast, zzso expression did not differ significantly between the tumor zzso derived from the stomach and liver and the normal zzso Different expression levels of zzso in the tumors indicated that zzso may be involved in tumor formation and zzso zzso zzso against zzso will be useful in studying the role of zzso in tumor zzso and pathological zzso
