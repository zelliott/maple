zzso survival of children with zzso diseases is in part due to the application of zzso zzso therapies, including zzso surgery, zzso and zzso zzso Such interventions have the potential to induce complex zzso zzso and nutritional effects that may interfere with skeletal mass acquisition during childhood and zzso it is possible that such childhood cancer survivors may therefore reach adulthood with diminished peak bone mass and be at increased risk for clinically significant osteoporosis later in their zzso 

A bone mineral density zzso was measured in 26 zzso former cancer patients attending the zzso zzso Clinic at zzso Anderson Cancer zzso zzso was measured at the zzso spine and the hip using dual X-ray zzso zzso zzso In addition, the patients' complete medical records were reviewed with particular attention to disease type, age zzso of treatment, and hormonal residual zzso 

The median age of patients at the time of cancer diagnosis was 8 years zzso zzso to 16 zzso Median age at zzso determination was 23 years zzso 18 to 41 zzso and the median zzso since cancer diagnosis and zzso was 18 years zzso 5 to zzso Overall, their zzso was decreased relative to peak bone mass at all sites: zzso was especially pronounced in patients with a history of zzso zzso who had developed evidence of zzso zzso during childhood or zzso Overall, the median zzso zzso was zzso at the zzso spine, zzso at the zzso neck, and zzso for total zzso For patients with prior zzso zzso zzso at the zzso spine was zzso zzso zzso to zzso at the zzso neck zzso zzso zzso to zzso and for total hip zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso for zzso patients was significantly lower than zzso of patients without zzso zzso We could not discern an independent impact of other disease characteristics or treatment zzso in this small group of zzso 

zzso is a prominent finding in young adults who are survivors of childhood zzso it is likely that zzso treatments during childhood and adolescence impede peak bone mass zzso We suggest that systematic attention to this potential complication is needed in order to identify what zzso of children may require regular surveillance and what interventions are required for its prevention or zzso
