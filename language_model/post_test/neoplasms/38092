zzso fractures and zzso unlike zzso disease, have been associated with increased zzso Total and zzso zzso of these spinal zzso were studied to produce zzso zzso 

A population of zzso Finnish men and women 20 to 92 years of age participated in a health examination from zzso Their spinal zzso were assessed from chest zzso by two zzso zzso zzso and Cox's model were used to estimate risk ratios and to control zzso The follow-up period was 30 zzso 

zzso fracture significantly predicted total zzso and this increase in mortality was due to an excess of cancer and respiratory zzso The increased risk of cancer death persisted even when those subjects with a history of cancer and the first 5 years of follow-up were excluded to avoid the effect of zzso fractures, and when zzso was zzso In this analysis the relative risk of cancer death in subjects with a baseline zzso fracture was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 

zzso fracture significantly predicted increased mortality from zzso To clarify the zzso the fractures should be studied further for their associations with defined and zzso cancer zzso
