To determine the relative risks of zzso and of zzso zzso in patients with zzso arthritis zzso 

In a prospective cohort study, zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso were enrolled from 1966 to 1974 and were followed up for up to 35 years zzso zzso zzso at the University of Saskatchewan zzso Disease zzso All diagnoses of cancer were zzso with the Provincial Cancer zzso zzso cancer zzso rates were determined based on province of Saskatchewan population statistics matched to each study patient for age, sex, and calendar zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso of the zzso cancer zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso were then zzso 

A total of 136 cases of cancer were observed compared with zzso expected zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The relative risk of zzso zzso was significantly reduced in the zzso study population zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A significant excess of leukemia was found zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso rates for Hodgkin's disease and zzso zzso and all other zzso zzso were not found to be significantly different from general population zzso 

In our cohort of zzso patients, zzso cancer was detected in only half the expected number of zzso This risk reduction may be related to long-term zzso zzso drug zzso use in zzso as has been suggested in several other studies of long-term zzso zzso An increased risk of leukemia was zzso This may be due to the persistent immune stimulation associated with zzso itself, since other potential explanatory factors for increased leukemia were not zzso Despite the excess of zzso zzso and despite treatment of zzso with potentially zzso agents, the overall risk of zzso was reduced in this zzso zzso
