The cell is a complex system functioning outside a zzso zzso The prediction of cellular functions based exclusively on molecular evidence is still impossible because of the large number of interacting molecules and the zzso interactions between cellular zzso The system cell displays a surprisingly small spectrum of zzso zzso degrees of zzso Their number and zzso however, are different in normal and zzso zzso As illustrated by image zzso zzso and other cell biological data we demonstrate that certain cellular zzso order zzso serve as indicators for normal and zzso zzso The data indicate that the transition between normal and zzso growth can be understood as a phase transition of the zzso zzso zzso In this zzso the order parameters of normal and zzso cells are the result of cellular zzso
