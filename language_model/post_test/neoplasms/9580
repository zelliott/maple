The biological evolution has resulted in adaptation of both zzso and zzso organisms to negative effect of excessive zzso in reply to gradual increase of free oxygen zzso contents in the earth zzso This adaptation has led to formation of various zzso systems in the zzso Such system within the cell has zzso structure and is represented by at least than three levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The first and most effective zzso level is represented as zzso zzso able to perform several zzso One of these functions is zzso since the very the zzso capability to be a main zzso consumer in the cell provides for low but sufficient for zzso and energy supply levels of zzso partial pressure and dependent zzso of active zzso zzso The zzso being signal molecules at certain values, modify regular and synthetic processes in the cells either directly or zzso This is the possibility for zzso to more extensively affect the zzso processes than simply produce zzso In case of defective of the cell first protection line the zzso starts due to poor zzso of the incoming zzso Change in zzso zzso zzso size and maturity level of zzso anyway occurring in the cells are an efficient way of regulation of the zzso condition zzso zzso and related signal zzso The relationship between changes in the condition of cells, zzso from their normal state to different zzso forms, and growing zzso zzso between its zzso zzso and zzso zzso components has been zzso It is expected that during the evolution the cell could have supposedly acquired a sequence of zzso zzso zzso Each sequence needs to implement a certain set of zzso zzso The probability of zzso zzso zzso with zzso of their value ranges has been zzso These ranges identify or impact certain cell state, namely proliferation of normal cell zzso zzso zzso A1 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The cited assumption allows us to: zzso explain reverse dependence of cell proliferation due to the level of their zzso increase in the amount and activity of zzso as an indispensable condition for the zzso shift towards zzso zzso bring up the idea that zzso of the cells, and in particular zzso cells, directly results from the zzso zzso decrease to certain levels under the influence of reverse zzso zzso explain relatively easy and frequent embryonic and stem cells zzso and also their reversal zzso These phenomena occur due to small number and/or size of zzso in the designated zzso To verify the above mentioned hypotheses it is primarily necessary to be able to stimulate and slow down the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso cancer and other zzso
