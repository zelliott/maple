zzso are the zzso element of cell cycle zzso zzso in their functional mechanism lead to several zzso zzso Aurora A protein is a zzso protein that regulates the zzso zzso and its zzso are associated with multiple cases of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in Aurora A is reported to induce cancer like zzso and disrupt its binding with zzso zzso In this study, we have demonstrated the structural consequences of Aurora A zzso zzso and the atomic changes that influenced the loss of zzso zzso zzso and molecular dynamics simulation results suggested significant loss in atomic contacts between zzso Aurora A and zzso zzso Further, we observed a notable changes in zzso of zzso Aurora zzso zzso complex as compared to the zzso Loss of binding affinity rendered the zzso domain free which then induced unfolding in its coiled region and enabled the overall expansion of zzso complex as compared to the zzso The significant outcomes obtained from this study will facilitate in future cancer researches and in developing the potent drug zzso
