The cell cycle is a tightly regulated series of events that zzso cell replication and zzso zzso of cell cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can initiate a zzso cell zzso and cause zzso instability, thus zzso zzso zzso zzso agents targeting zzso have been developed as potential zzso agents for over 20 years, evolving from early zzso zzso to second-generation zzso with much greater specificity and zzso Despite these advances in drug design and highly successful zzso zzso zzso zzso have yet to achieve their expected efficacy in clinical zzso In addition, zzso of other cell cycle zzso are currently progressing through clinical zzso Recent zzso and genetic studies might be used to improve the effectiveness of cell cycle zzso zzso as zzso agents through better drug design, therapeutic combinations, and patient zzso
