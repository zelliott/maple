To analyze the putative relationship between zzso zzso and the probability of a tumor zzso 

A total of 89 consecutive patients with advanced cancer were treated with zzso zzso zzso in a prospective zzso 

Twenty patients developed zzso zzso zzso positive tests for zzso zzso developed in zzso of the zzso Twenty-two patients achieved a zzso There was no relationship between the formation of zzso and the probability of zzso There appeared to be a trend toward a relationship between zzso dysfunction and response zzso zzso zzso A strong relationship was found between response on the one hand and cumulative dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso and treatment duration with zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso The frequency of zzso dysfunction was also significantly correlated with treatment duration zzso zzso zzso After adjustment for cumulative dose of zzso and treatment zzso no relationship between zzso dysfunction and response remained zzso zzso zzso 

There is no relationship between zzso dysfunction and the probability of tumor zzso zzso dysfunction is merely a function of treatment duration and cumulative dose of zzso
