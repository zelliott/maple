We have studied the generation of zzso cells zzso in zzso from healthy children and children with newly diagnosed zzso zzso blood derived adherent cells were harvested and cultured in the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso DC were characterized zzso and analyzed by flow zzso and zzso mixed zzso reaction zzso The numbers of adherent cells were zzso higher in healthy children than in those with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of blood zzso versus zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso No significant differences were found in the cell survival or yield after the in zzso zzso of adherent zzso zzso examination of cultured cells showed that they were similar to DC in adults, being large, zzso zzso with several thin membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso DC from healthy controls expressed zzso and zzso but did not express zzso markers zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of DC from cancer patients was otherwise similar, except that a substantial proportion zzso continued to express zzso zzso zzso zzso DC derived both from cancer patients and controls were strong zzso in zzso zzso We conclude that functionally capable DC can be generated in zzso from zzso adherent cells in children, but children with zzso cancer yield lower numbers of DC than healthy zzso The continued expression of zzso on DC derived from cancer patients may indicate that adherent cells from cancer patients are more resistant to signals inducing differentiation into zzso
