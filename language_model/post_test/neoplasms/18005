A novel zzso method has been developed to zzso zzso cellular zzso In this study, the zzso was zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for the complementary zzso zzso as an zzso Half the tumor cells were incubated with the zzso zzso zzso and the other half with the same zzso at the same concentration but zzso zzso targeting zzso After zzso the same dosage of zzso zzso was added to the zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso of the direct targeting cells represented the sum of both zzso and zzso zzso whereas the zzso of the zzso cells resulted only from the zzso zzso as the zzso zzso does not penetrate the cell zzso zzso the difference in zzso zzso between zzso and direct targeting provides the zzso zzso In this example, the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells was zzso and the average zzso residence time was determined as 2 zzso This method of measuring zzso zzso is directly zzso to zzso applications but can be a universal alternative to the conventional zzso method, with the advantage of leaving the cell membrane zzso
