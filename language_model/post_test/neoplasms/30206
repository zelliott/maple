The presence of activated zzso T cells zzso clinically with better prognosis in patients with zzso Although tumor vaccines can increase the number of zzso zzso T cells in systemic zzso they frequently fail to increase the number of active and tumor zzso T cells within the zzso Here we show that treatment with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specific zzso of zzso zzso T cells as well as their zzso expansion in several mouse tumor zzso We found that zzso of zzso trafficking from zzso zzso did not impair zzso tumor rejection or the zzso of zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso T cells expressed elevated levels of the zzso zzso and were directly activated by zzso resulting in prominent zzso of zzso and zzso Although zzso T cells, regulatory T cells, zzso cells, and zzso cells have been reported as prominent targets of zzso in the tumor zzso we found that expression of the zzso was required only on zzso T cells to facilitate zzso tumor rejection as well as in zzso expansion and proliferation of zzso zzso T zzso Together, our findings indicate that zzso activates zzso zzso tumor control and suggest that zzso may represent a potential tumor zzso in human patients with zzso
