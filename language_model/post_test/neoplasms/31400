zzso T cell receptors with specificity for zzso zzso are successfully used to target T cells to tumor zzso The efficacy of this approach, however, is reduced by soluble zzso that is frequently present in high serum zzso To overcome this situation, we constructed an zzso zzso zzso whose zzso zzso is composed of a humanized single chain zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso constant zzso of human zzso The zzso zzso consists of the zzso chain of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a completely humanized zzso zzso After zzso the zzso zzso zzso is expressed as a zzso on the surface of zzso T zzso zzso with zzso tumor cells specifically activates grafted zzso T cells indicated by zzso zzso and zzso activity against zzso tumor zzso zzso the efficacy of zzso zzso is not affected by soluble zzso up to 25 zzso demonstrating the usefulness of this zzso zzso for specific cellular zzso by zzso zzso even in the presence of high zzso of zzso as found in patients during progression of the zzso
