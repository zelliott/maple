Finding the proper balance between too much and not enough zzso is just as important in the late zzso period as it is during the first year after zzso In general, too much zzso leads to an increase in patient zzso whereas inadequate zzso can lead to an zzso high rate of zzso failure zzso zzso In the late zzso period, patient and zzso survival are both critically dependent on the degree of zzso and on the long-term side effects of the agents used to achieve this zzso zzso zzso is important in treating and preventing the acute zzso rejection episodes that are common during the first year after transplantation zzso zzso Some data suggest that the severity of early acute rejection episodes may influence the development of chronic zzso the most common cause of graft failure in the late zzso zzso Otherwise, the role of zzso in treating and preventing chronic rejection is zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso patients is a major cause of late graft zzso Whether the zzso of zzso will also result in graft failure in the very late zzso period is still zzso The agents used to achieve zzso along with decreased graft function and zzso contribute to zzso hypertension, and zzso These and other risk factors have a negative impact on both graft and patient zzso Thus, zzso is directly, or indirectly linked to most of the common causes of death and graft failure after zzso zzso Although potent new zzso protocols have increased the rate of short-term patient and zzso survival after zzso zzso future advances in long-term survival after zzso transplantation will depend on improvements that are effective in the late zzso zzso Currently, the best approach to preventing complications in the late zzso period is to maintain a vigilant, comprehensive program of zzso medical zzso The minimal amount of zzso required to prevent zzso rejection should be used, while adhering to the principle that it is better to lose the graft than to lose the zzso
