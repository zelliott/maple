This paper proposes extending the zzso zzso model by adopting the zzso distribution for the life length of the intermediate zzso The investigation concentrates on the survival function and the mean value zzso The approach is basically zzso making use of the zzso software zzso The paper also provides a closed form expression for the survival function for a variation of the original zzso model, where all the model parameters are zzso zzso
