Blood lead concentration has been associated with mortality from different causes in several zzso Many effects of lead exposure that might increase risk of death are likely to result from cumulative exposure, for which bone lead is a better zzso than blood zzso The association between bone lead levels and mortality has not been zzso 

We zzso assessed the association between both blood lead and bone lead, analyzed with the use of zzso zzso fluorescence, and mortality among zzso men in the zzso Aging zzso We identified zzso deaths over an average of zzso zzso years of zzso We calculated adjusted hazard ratios and zzso confidence intervals using Cox zzso zzso Compared with the lowest zzso of zzso bone lead, the fully adjusted hazard ratios in the highest zzso for zzso and cardiovascular mortality zzso zzso were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso hazard ratio for zzso heart disease mortality zzso zzso in the highest zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso were similar for zzso zzso Bone lead was not associated with cancer, and blood lead was not associated with any mortality zzso 

We found bone lead to be associated with zzso and cardiovascular mortality in an environmentally exposed population with low blood lead zzso This study suggests that cumulative lead exposure from prior decades of high environmental zzso continues to significantly affect risk of death despite recent declines in environmental lead zzso
