zzso the molecular basis of aging has been difficult, primarily zzso to the zzso and zzso nature of the aging zzso There are many often interacting symptoms of aging, some of which are obvious and appear to be common to every aged individual, whereas others affect only a subset of the elderly zzso Although at first sight this would suggest multiple molecular mechanisms of aging, there now appears to be almost universal consensus that aging is ultimately the result of the zzso of zzso damage in cellular zzso with zzso oxygen species likely to be the main zzso zzso What remains significant is zzso how such damage can give rise to the large variety of aging symptoms and how these can be zzso Although humans, with over a century of clinical zzso remain the obvious target of study, the zzso with a relatively short zzso easy genetic accessibility and close zzso to humans, is the tool par excellence to model zzso zzso and test strategies of zzso Here we present the argument that mouse models with engineered defects in zzso maintenance systems are especially important because they often exhibit a premature appearance of aging zzso zzso studies on human zzso zzso zzso most of which are based on zzso zzso in genes involved in zzso zzso the results thus far obtained with mouse models strongly suggest that lifespan and onset of aging are directly related to the quality of DNA zzso This may be in keeping with the recent discovery of a possible zzso zzso zzso that improves zzso zzso and zzso maintenance and simultaneously extends lifespan in the mouse and several zzso zzso
