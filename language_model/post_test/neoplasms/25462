We have developed quantitative zzso solid phase zzso for the host protein zzso from mouse cells and from human zzso The first zzso for mouse zzso depends on having two zzso zzso reacting with different zzso on the zzso zzso With this zzso we have shown that zzso cells have approximately zzso more zzso than zzso mouse cells and that other transformed cells have intermediate zzso zzso zzso cell lines have approximately zzso less zzso than zzso zzso This is in contrast to the high levels of incorporation of zzso into zzso in these cells and indicates that zzso zzso is not a valid approach for measuring zzso zzso The second zzso for human zzso required a different approach and made use of the zzso zzso detected in the zzso of some breast cancer zzso Human zzso cell lines contained amounts of zzso varying from the high level seen in zzso human zzso down to less than one zzso of this zzso zzso human cells showed low levels of zzso The data confirm that many, but not all, human zzso cell lines contain more zzso than normal zzso
