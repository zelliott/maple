Human zzso zzso zzso are extensively used as gene transfer zzso However, a serious obstacle for the use of these zzso in clinical applications is due to pre-existing immunity to human zzso affecting the efficacy of gene zzso One of the approaches to circumvent host immune response could be the development of zzso based on zzso zzso that are able to zzso genes into human zzso In this study, we explored the possibility of using avian Ad zzso zzso as zzso zzso For this purpose, we constructed a set of zzso zzso viruses and demonstrated that they are able to deliver zzso into various zzso on the background of pre-existing immunity to human zzso The created zzso zzso restored the function of the zzso tumor zzso both in cultured human tumor cells in zzso and in their zzso in nude mice in zzso The latter effect was accompanied by zzso of tumor zzso zzso the delivery of zzso led to zzso of zzso target genes in cells showing zzso of zzso zzso by three different mechanisms, that is, in the human zzso zzso zzso lung zzso zzso and cervical zzso zzso
