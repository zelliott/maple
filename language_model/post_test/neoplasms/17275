Recent data have linked zzso a classic feature of the tumor zzso to the function of specific zzso zzso however, whether zzso affects other types of zzso transcripts is currently zzso Starting from a zzso expression zzso we demonstrate for the first time a functional link between oxygen deprivation and the zzso of long zzso transcripts from zzso regions, termed zzso regions zzso Interestingly, several zzso zzso henceforth named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are also zzso in clinical samples from colon cancer zzso We show that these zzso are predominantly nuclear and that the zzso factor zzso is at least partly responsible for the induction of several members of this zzso One specific zzso zzso (or zzso is part of a retained zzso of the host zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso with the hypothesis that zzso have important function in tumor formation, zzso supports cell proliferation specifically under hypoxic conditions and may be critical for optimal zzso of proteins when oxygen tension is zzso Our data gives a first glimpse of a novel functional hypoxic network zzso zzso transcripts and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso
