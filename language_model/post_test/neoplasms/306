Experimental procedures are described for the zzso of human tumors by zzso zzso zzso zzso in animal model zzso zzso of tumor zzso was clearer in nude mice as compared to zzso zzso mice due to the higher viability of the tumors in nude zzso zzso zzso in tumor tissue was greatly enhanced when zzso fragments rather than intact zzso molecules were zzso Although tumors could be zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso fragments without using background zzso zzso ratios of zzso were highest for zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments of eight zzso against human zzso zzso melanoma or lung zzso localized specifically only in those tumors that bound the zzso in zzso and not in unrelated zzso zzso fragments of zzso with other zzso zzso virus zzso did not zzso in zzso All zzso that inhibited tumor growth in nude mice effectively localized these tumors by zzso On the other hand, some zzso were effective in zzso tumors but ineffective in zzso their zzso The ability of the specific zzso zzso fragments to zzso in tumor zzso correlated significantly with zzso binding affinity and density of zzso sites on tumor cells together, but not with either in zzso binding zzso zzso Thus, zzso analysis of zzso binding to tumor cells may be an effective means to screen for zzso with tumor zzso zzso
