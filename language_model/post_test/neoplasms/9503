The zzso of zzso end in a specialized complex of proteins and repetitive DNA called the zzso zzso form a protective cap that prevents zzso zzso protects zzso ends from degradation, and assists in positioning zzso in the zzso In the absence of zzso mechanisms, zzso DNA is lost during each cell cycle zzso to incomplete zzso zzso damage, and zzso zzso The zzso complex zzso zzso this loss of zzso DNA, but its activity is absent in most differentiated human zzso Thus, the aging process results in ever zzso lengths of zzso zzso Related to this is the requirement for a mechanism of zzso DNA maintenance in tumors, leading to zzso expression in zzso of all zzso zzso The integral roles of zzso biology in these zzso states have substantially motivated its zzso Here, the literature on the human zzso will be reviewed with an emphasis on the relationship to human zzso
