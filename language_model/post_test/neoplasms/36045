The zzso factor heat shock factor 1 zzso is the master regulator of the heat shock zzso It is crucial for cell zzso and implicated in aging, neurodegenerative disease and zzso Although induction by zzso of the expression of molecular zzso and other regulators of protein quality control, both folding and degradation, is well established, the precise and detailed zzso network that zzso regulates in cancer is poorly zzso An important new study identifies an zzso zzso program in highly zzso cells that is surprisingly distinct from the traditional heat shock zzso The results have significant implications for our molecular understanding of cancer and the development of new zzso
