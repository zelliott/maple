In designing phase III zzso clinical trials zzso the expected magnitude of the benefit of the experimental therapy zzso determines the number of patients required and the number of zzso of zzso We conducted a systematic review to evaluate how reliably zzso zzso the observed benefit zzso in zzso that evaluated cancer zzso 

zzso evaluating systemic therapy in adult cancer patients published in 10 journals from January 1, 2005, through December 31, 2009, were zzso Data were extracted from each publication independently by two zzso The zzso Sign test was used to determine whether the median difference between zzso and B was statistically significant in different study zzso and was zzso 

A total of zzso zzso met the eligibility criteria and were included in the zzso Regardless of whether benefit was defined as zzso change zzso difference between zzso and B zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso absolute change zzso difference between zzso and B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso or median increase in a zzso zzso zzso difference between zzso and B zzso zzso months, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso was consistently and statistically significantly larger than B zzso zzso zzso for each, zzso This relationship between zzso and B was independent of year of publication, industry zzso management by cooperative trial groups, type of control arm, type of experimental arm, disease site, zzso treatment, or treatment for advanced disease, and likely contributed to the high proportion of negative zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

Investigators consistently make overly optimistic assumptions regarding treatment benefits when designing zzso Attempts to reduce the number of negative zzso should focus on more realistic zzso of zzso Increased use of interim zzso certain zzso trial designs, and better biological characterization of patients are potential ways of zzso this zzso
