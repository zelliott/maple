zzso variation in cancer rates is thought to be the result of two major factors: environmental agents varying zzso and the zzso genetic or cultural, of the populations inhabiting the areas zzso These attributes in turn result from the history of the populations in zzso We had previously constructed an zzso database for Europe since zzso zzso permitting estimates of the ethnic composition of modern European zzso We were able to show that these estimates correlate with genetic zzso In this study, we wanted to see whether they also correlate with cancer zzso We employed two data sets of cancer zzso from 42 types of cancer for the European Economic Community and for Central zzso We subjected spatial differences in cancer zzso zzso zzso and geographic distances to zzso zzso tests to determine the magnitude and significance of their zzso Our findings are that distances in cancer zzso are correlated more with zzso distances than with genetic zzso Possibly the cancer rates may be affected by zzso other than the genetic systems available to us, and/or by cultural factors zzso by the zzso zzso We find it remarkable that patterns of frequently ancient ethnic zzso are still reflected in modern cancer zzso zzso correlations with geography suggest that local environmental factors affect the zzso as zzso
