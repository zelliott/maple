zzso left zzso ejection fraction zzso is a relative zzso for the use of potentially cardiotoxic zzso A resting zzso of 50% is usually used as the lower limit of normal zzso The decision to change chemotherapy, however, is complex and is affected by many factors, including ejection zzso 

To determine how zzso data were used by clinical zzso in clinical decision making, we performed a retrospective analysis of patients referred for ejection fraction zzso from the zzso zzso of Stanford University from March 1992 through March zzso The records of zzso patients treated with potentially cardiotoxic chemotherapy were zzso 

zzso zzso 50% were found in 153 zzso The charts of patients with reduced ejection zzso were reviewed to determine if the zzso measurement resulted in either zzso of the cardiotoxic agent or substitution of a less cardiotoxic drug or mode of zzso These specific changes in therapy occurred in only 43 of the 153 zzso patients with ejection zzso below zzso 24 of the 43 zzso had ejection zzso zzso or zzso zzso Patients with lower ejection fraction values were more likely to have their therapy changed than those with zzso close to zzso Patients with ejection zzso zzso or zzso 30 generally had cardiotoxic agents zzso Of patients who had a resting zzso zzso 50% and whose therapy was not changed, zzso had a normal increase in zzso with zzso 

In clinical practice at our institution, ejection fraction zzso 50% is not used as an absolute zzso to cardiotoxic zzso When the zzso is less than zzso potentially cardiotoxic therapy is most often discontinued or zzso zzso evidence of cardiac reserve may account for decisions to continue cardiotoxic agents despite ejection zzso zzso 50% in the majority of zzso Further study will be needed to establish standard zzso Reserve function, as measured by the change in ejection fraction from rest to stress may be an important zzso used by zzso to help select patients for continued therapy in spite of a reduced ejection zzso Our results argue that use of fixed criteria may be too zzso
