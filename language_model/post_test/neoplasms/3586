The currently preferred zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso is zzso zzso Increased zzso of this zzso analogue in zzso cells is based on elevated zzso metabolism by zzso cells and subsequent zzso in the zzso In the search for new PET zzso zzso acids have been widely zzso A new zzso acid zzso should preferably have similar high zzso in zzso cells but low zzso zzso in normal zzso and any pathology other than zzso In recent years, several zzso acids have been zzso with either gamma zzso zzso or zzso zzso the most commonly used being zzso However, the longer zzso of zzso matches better with the relatively slow process of protein synthesis and also zzso shipping of the zzso zzso acids to hospitals without an on-site zzso or dedicated zzso zzso The number of fluorinated zzso acids under investigation is zzso and one of the major points of discussion is the underlying mechanism of the zzso zzso While it has been shown that some zzso acids can be used to measure the protein synthesis rate, others are used with the sole aim of measuring the rate of zzso into the zzso The differences between measuring zzso acid transport zzso and protein synthesis rate with zzso zzso acids are zzso
