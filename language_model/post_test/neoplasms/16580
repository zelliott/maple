A number of relatively rare, high-risk genes have been identified which zzso to common zzso such as breast, zzso and zzso Although these are clearly important in the clinical setting, it is also relevant to discuss the impact of these genes at the population level and to contrast these with that which could be ascribed to more common genetic zzso which only zzso a modest increased risk of zzso In this review, we examine zzso about the role of zzso in cancer from ecological studies of zzso patterns from a number of zzso studies of familial and attributable zzso The relationship between the genetic model zzso risk, zzso frequency, mode of zzso and the expected impact in the population in terms of both attributable risk and familial risk is zzso The advantages and limitations of using cancer occurrence in twins to measure the genetic contribution to specific cancer sites is zzso The potential role of zzso genes in the overall cancer burden may be significant but may pose significant problems in the public health zzso
