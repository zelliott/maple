zzso factor zzso expression by tumor cells zzso with zzso clinically and supports zzso in experimental zzso However, the precise pathways zzso zzso to zzso remain incompletely zzso Here, we show that zzso formation by zzso indirectly enhances tumor cell survival after arrest in the zzso during experimental lung zzso by recruiting zzso characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso (but not zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso by either induction of zzso zzso inhibitor zzso or by treatment with zzso respectively, zzso zzso recruitment and tumor cell zzso Furthermore, impairment of zzso function, in either zzso mice or in zzso toxin zzso mice in which zzso cells were zzso decreased tumor cell survival without altering zzso formation, demonstrating that the recruitment of functional zzso was essential for tumor cell zzso This effect was independent of zzso zzso Moreover, a similar population of zzso was also recruited to the lung during the formation of a zzso zzso zzso inhibited their zzso and prevented the enhanced zzso associated with the formation of the zzso Our study, for the first time, links zzso induced zzso to zzso recruitment in the zzso zzso
