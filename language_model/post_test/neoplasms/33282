The zzso of many and perhaps all tumors may be zzso rather than inhibited by a zzso low level of zzso The reason tumors have zzso may be that tumors do not develop in zzso in the absence of at least a minimal immune zzso in this sense, cancer may be considered an zzso zzso This review, based largely on the work of our own laboratory, outlines the data showing that the zzso of zzso immunity exhibits the phenomenon of zzso zzso the zzso curve is zzso such that low levels of immunity are generally zzso but larger quantities of the same immune zzso may inhibit tumor zzso Evidence is also reviewed that suggests that the immune response may vary zzso and zzso during zzso such that there seems to be, during zzso a very low level of immune reaction that aids initial tumor growth, followed by a larger reaction that may cause zzso of early zzso followed, if the zzso zzso by a relative zzso tolerance to the tumor that may be dependent, at least in part, on zzso zzso This knowledge may help to explain some clinical observations concerning the relationships among tumor types and the organ distribution of zzso
