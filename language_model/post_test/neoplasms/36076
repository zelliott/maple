zzso zzso has important anabolic effects on muscle protein metabolism through a decrease in the zzso zzso zzso The role of zzso in human cancer zzso is zzso The aim of this study was to assess the relationship between zzso zzso in cancer patients with zzso at diagnosis of zzso and 8 weeks zzso An zzso study of 21 cancer patients (with and without zzso and 8 healthy subjects was zzso Body composition was measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were assessed at baseline and after 4 and 8 zzso zzso zzso values were similar in cancer patients and in healthy zzso Cancer patients with lower baseline levels of zzso zzso had significantly higher fat mass zzso along the zzso zzso patients completed the zzso five patients showed an increase of zzso at the end of the study zzso of body zzso and showed a mean increase of zzso of zzso zzso at 4 weeks and zzso zzso at 8 weeks, as compared with mean decrease of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the 13 patients who lost weight zzso and zzso zzso Changes of zzso at 4 and 8 weeks were directly associated with changes in body weight, body mass index zzso zzso mass and muscle mass zzso and indirectly associated with percentage of weight loss zzso In zzso although the results indicate that zzso does not have a role in cancer zzso zzso the association during evolution between serum zzso and changes in weight and muscle mass suggests a possible role of zzso as a marker of the body composition response in cancer patients who are losing weight at the time of zzso
