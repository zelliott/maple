Type I zzso zzso including zzso are known to enhance zzso zzso presentation and to promote the expansion, survival and zzso function of zzso zzso zzso zzso during viral zzso Furthermore, zzso is a potent candidate for zzso zzso however, zzso zzso is too unstable for use in tumor therapy in zzso In this study, we therefore examined the efficacy and mechanism of zzso zzso as a zzso for tumor therapy, using zzso zzso zzso zzso as a therapeutic agent in a mouse zzso zzso and zzso tumor cells exposed to zzso showed growth zzso and cell death in zzso and tumor growth as well as tumor zzso was inhibited in zzso The zzso zzso effect was dependent on zzso T cells in zzso rather than on a direct zzso effect of zzso zzso T zzso depletion was observed in tumor tissue after zzso injection with zzso Despite the T zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso zzso T cells was increased in zzso mice compared to control zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso might contribute to the zzso of tumor growth by depleting zzso T zzso and enhancing proliferation of zzso zzso T zzso
