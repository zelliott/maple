zzso is a zzso zzso protein that promotes cell survival and zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that is complementary to zzso zzso has a prolonged tissue half life, enhances drug efficacy in zzso models, and reduces zzso expression in humans with a biologically effective dose of 640 zzso The objective of this study was to determine a recommended phase II dose of zzso in combination with zzso 

Patients with zzso known from the literature to express zzso were zzso zzso was given by zzso zzso infusion starting at 40 zzso weekly after loading doses on days 1, 3, and zzso zzso was given zzso 30 zzso weekly for 5 of 6 weeks zzso zzso or 75 zzso every 3 weeks zzso zzso All patients had serial samples of peripheral blood zzso cells and serum assessed for zzso zzso 

Forty patients were enrolled to eight zzso zzso could be given at the full biologically effective zzso dose of 640 zzso with both zzso zzso zzso effects were primarily zzso fatigue, hair loss, gastrointestinal effects zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso and fever zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased zzso with no apparent effect on zzso zzso At the end of cycle 1, serum zzso showed mean decreases of zzso and 38% zzso zzso at the zzso dose zzso 

zzso can be given at a biologically effective dose with standard doses of zzso Phase II trials of combined zzso and chemotherapy are ongoing in patients with zzso breast, and lung zzso
