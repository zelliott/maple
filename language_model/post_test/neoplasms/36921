Our laboratory has found zzso zzso of a large zzso domain of human zzso identifying six imprinted genes within this zzso zzso zzso growth factor II zzso an important zzso growth factor in a wide variety of zzso zzso zzso an untranslated zzso that is a putative growth zzso gene regulating zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso inhibitor that causes zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a gene that is zzso to mouse zzso which is implicated in zzso zzso and zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso We zzso that zzso harbors a large domain of imprinted zzso genes that are important in zzso Several lines of evidence support this zzso zzso we have discovered a novel genetic zzso in cancer, loss of zzso which affects several of these zzso and is one of the most common genetic changes in human zzso zzso we have found that the zzso disorder zzso syndrome, which zzso to cancer and causes prenatal zzso involves zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we have found both genetic zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso we can partially reverse abnormal zzso using an inhibitor of DNA zzso We propose a model of zzso zzso as a dynamic zzso process involving a zzso zzso According to this model, cancer involves both genetic and zzso mechanisms affecting this imprinted domain and the genes within zzso
