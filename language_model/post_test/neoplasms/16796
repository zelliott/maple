Experimental evidence indicates that cancer development is a zzso process, and that multiple genetic changes are required before a normal cell becomes fully zzso These genetic changes involve zzso tumor zzso zzso and possibly zzso zzso From studies in zzso using several different animal models, the stages are broadly defined as zzso zzso and clearly involve both genetic and zzso zzso Studies in zzso using cell culture systems have allowed the zzso process to be dissected in greater detail at both the cellular and molecular genetic zzso In the Syrian zzso zzso cell culture model, zzso progression requires four zzso changes, involving zzso of two zzso and loss of two tumor zzso zzso Like the experimental systems, a limited number of studies of human tumors suggest that the zzso paradigm is also zzso and that similar genetic events are involved in the development of cancer in zzso
