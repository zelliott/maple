We report the use of small zzso and block zzso zzso zzso zzso for deep ex zzso imaging of tumor zzso in zzso excised tumors using zzso zzso zzso zzso The fluorescent zzso were administered to mice via zzso injection, after which the tumors were zzso zzso and zzso without further sample zzso Both zzso zzso demonstrated specific targeting to tumor blood vessels, and this selectivity imparted excellent contrast in zzso zzso that captured high-resolution 3-D images of the tumor zzso up to depths of 830 zzso in Lewis Lung Carcinoma zzso zzso zzso ex zzso zzso zzso clearly revealed tumor vessels, while differences in the sensitivity of tumor vessel imaging were apparent between the small zzso and block zzso zzso Both the small zzso and zzso zzso absorbing probe zzso are valuable for deep tissue tumor zzso zzso
