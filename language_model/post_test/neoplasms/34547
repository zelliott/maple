zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is an important component of disease progression in many chronic disease states and is the initiating event in the formation of the tumor zzso in zzso It is the balance of zzso zzso degrading zzso the zzso zzso zzso and their zzso zzso that determine the extent of tissue zzso zzso zzso activity can result in significant tissue damage, facilitate disease progression and is associated with host responses to zzso injury such as zzso and zzso The tissue zzso of zzso zzso have been shown to regulate zzso zzso However, recent findings demonstrate that the tissue inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso the zzso response of human zzso zzso cells to growth factors, such as zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso The mechanism of this effect is independent of zzso zzso Our lab is the first to demonstrate a zzso signaling zzso for a member of the zzso family and suggest that zzso functions to regulate cellular responses to growth zzso These new findings are discussed in terms of a model of zzso regulation of cellular functions in the tumor zzso
