The Guam Cancer zzso zzso collects data on cases of cancer in Guam residents whether their initial diagnosis is made on Guam or as a result of a referral to an zzso medical zzso It also collects data on cancer of zzso diagnosed on zzso Although including zzso resident cancer cases in statistical tables will have the effect of raising local cancer rates, this probably only partially compensates for the number of zzso cancer cases that are diagnosed zzso and not reported to the zzso Cases are also collected by a periodic review of death certificates filed with the Guam Office of Vital zzso To test this hypothesis zzso records were reviewed to determine the number of reported cancer cases for each ethnic group that claimed to be Guam zzso Since a high proportion of zzso seen among zzso on Guam represent cases referred from their home islands, it may also be that these cases only represent those zzso most likely to be referred to Guam rather than being representative of the zzso most commonly occurring within these ethnic groups in their home zzso
