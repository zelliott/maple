The zzso characteristics and clinical pathological significance of zzso and zzso fluid were studied in patients with zzso zzso tuberculosis or liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were measured by zzso zzso zzso and tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were higher in zzso zzso and tuberculosis compared with liver zzso whereas zzso levels were significantly higher in liver zzso and zzso zzso than in tuberculosis zzso zzso patients showed statistically higher zzso zzso and Pl zzso than zzso zzso patients, which, in turn, were higher than those in liver zzso zzso zzso levels were markedly higher in zzso zzso and liver zzso than in zzso In the zzso zzso group, only zzso level was significantly different between the samples that contained cancer cells and those that did zzso We found significant differences between the zzso characteristics in zzso and zzso fluid in patients with zzso zzso tuberculosis and liver zzso The analysis of several zzso parameters could help to determine the quality of zzso and zzso fluid, and also to further understand the pathological processes of these zzso
