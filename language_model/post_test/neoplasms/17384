The folate zzso zzso is a promising target for nuclear imaging due to its zzso in many different cancer zzso A drawback of using folate zzso is the high zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso the aim of this study was to develop a zzso folate zzso with an zzso entity to enhance the blood circulation time and hence improve the zzso zzso 

The novel zzso was prepared by zzso of a zzso zzso zzso to an zzso folate precursor containing an zzso entity via zzso zzso zzso The zzso was tested in zzso on zzso zzso tumor cells and by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging studies using zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso yield of zzso zzso corrected zzso and a zzso purity of zzso The specific activity of zzso ranged from 20 to zzso In zzso experiments revealed zzso binding of zzso to zzso tumor zzso In zzso we found an increasing zzso of zzso into tumor zzso over time reaching a value of zzso injected dose zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was approximately fourfold reduced compared to previously published zzso zzso acid zzso An excellent zzso of tumor zzso with an unprecedentedly high zzso ratio zzso was obtained by PET zzso 

zzso showed a favorable zzso in tumor zzso compared to the same folate zzso without zzso zzso Moreover, the increased zzso ratios improved the PET imaging quality significantly, in spite of a somewhat higher background zzso which was a consequence of the slower blood clearance of zzso
