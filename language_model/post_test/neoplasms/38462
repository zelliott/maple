The importance of a subset of cells which have zzso zzso characteristics and are capable of tumor initiation has been reported for a range of zzso Isolation of these zzso cells zzso has largely been based on differential cell surface protein zzso However, there is still much debate on the functional significance of these markers in initiating tumors, as many properties of tumor initiation are modified by zzso zzso In particular, the relationship between zzso and their zzso is poorly understood but has therapeutic zzso as the zzso can maintain tumor cells in a prolonged period of zzso However, a major limitation in advancing our understanding of the zzso between zzso and their zzso is the lack of sensitive techniques which allow the in zzso tracking and monitoring of zzso Application of new in zzso cellular and molecular imaging technologies holds much promise in uncovering the mysteries of zzso behavior at the three-dimensional zzso This review will describe recent advances in our understanding of the zzso concept and how the application of in zzso imaging techniques can advance our understanding of the biological fate of zzso A supplementary resource guide describing zzso from different zzso is also zzso
