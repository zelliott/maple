zzso detection and monitoring of lethal diseases, such as cancer, are considered as effective factors in treatment and zzso We describe a new disease diagnostic approach, zzso zzso based upon reactions between blood zzso and an array of zzso zzso different lipids and zzso zzso a chromatic zzso We show that reactions between zzso and such a zzso zzso array produce chromatic patterns which depend both upon the zzso composition as well as the specific zzso constituents within the zzso The chromatic patterns were processed through zzso zzso and the zzso analysis could distinguish both between zzso and healthy patients, respectively, as well between two types of zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso are the primary components in zzso which react with the chromatic zzso zzso This zzso zzso concept is highly zzso zzso and does not require a zzso knowledge upon specific disease markers in zzso zzso it could be employed as complementary or alternative approach for disease zzso
