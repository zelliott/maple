zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso with the zzso analog zzso zzso is currently the most widely used suicide zzso system for gene therapy of zzso Despite the broad application of the zzso approach, zzso of zzso to its active state is inefficient such that high, zzso doses of zzso are needed to observe an zzso zzso One strategy used to overcome the poor zzso specificity of zzso towards zzso zzso zzso 45 zzso has been to create novel forms of zzso with altered zzso zzso Such zzso zzso have shown benefit and are currently in clinical zzso We describe here a second strategy to increase the amount of zzso zzso zzso by involving the second zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso zzso As a means to overcome the bottleneck of zzso zzso from the zzso to the zzso we sought to combine both the critical zzso and zzso activities zzso In this report we describe the construction of a fusion or zzso protein of zzso and zzso zzso show data that demonstrate it zzso a approximately zzso decrease in zzso compared to zzso alone in response to zzso treatment in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells and finally, we present zzso evidence of a kinetic basis for this improved cell zzso
