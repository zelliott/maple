The formation of a zzso zzso a process referred to as tumor zzso is a zzso reaction essential for tumor zzso zzso of tumor zzso suppresses tumor growth in many experimental models, thereby indicating that zzso zzso may be a relevant target to inhibit tumor zzso Among the zzso molecules reported to date many are peptides and zzso They include zzso zzso zzso to vascular growth factors and growth factor zzso soluble zzso fragments derived from zzso zzso proteins and small synthetic zzso The zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso was the first drug registered for the regional treatment of human cancer, whose mechanisms of action involved selective disruption of the tumor zzso More recently, zzso zzso an zzso against vascular zzso growth factor zzso was approved as the first systemic zzso drug that had a significant impact on the survival of patients with advanced zzso cancer, in combination with zzso Several additional peptides and zzso with zzso activity are currently tested in clinical trials for their therapeutic zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso are emerging as leading molecules among the plethora of compounds with zzso zzso In this article, we will review some of these molecules and discuss their mechanism of action and their potential therapeutic use as zzso agents in zzso
