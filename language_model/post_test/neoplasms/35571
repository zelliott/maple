The study of fluctuating asymmetry has been controversial because of conflicting results found in much of the primary zzso It has been suggested that the source of this conflict is the fact that the basis of fluctuating asymmetry is poorly understood and that, as a consequence, methodology of fluctuating asymmetry studies may be zzso A new model for the zzso basis of fluctuating zzso that variation in fluctuating asymmetry is in large part due to the random exponential growth of cell populations zzso zzso zzso that are terminated randomly around a genetically programmed development time, is presented zzso If termination of development has a genetic zzso then zzso effects and zzso in the distribution of fluctuating asymmetry should increase with genetic zzso of the zzso This model prediction was tested by comparing the distribution of zzso size and shape fluctuating asymmetry in large samples collected from both wild populations and four moderately zzso lines of zzso zzso It was found that while wild populations were best described by a zzso distribution with zzso scaled tails, the zzso lines derived from the wild stock were dramatically zzso zzso in three of four zzso As predicted, the zzso zzso of the upper tail of the distribution of fluctuating asymmetry increased with zzso while the zzso and mean fluctuating asymmetry decreased with zzso The model suggests an additional explanation of zzso in fluctuating zzso zzso and zzso of the statistical distribution of fluctuating asymmetry in a population is related directly to genetic differences between individuals and these differences affect their ability to buffer the process of development against random zzso
