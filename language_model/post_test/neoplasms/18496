The zzso factor zzso plays a critical role in maintaining zzso as it relates to cellular growth, zzso and zzso In an effort to identify novel zzso target zzso a zzso approach was zzso to identify zzso (also known as zzso as a robust candidate zzso zzso is a highly zzso member of the short chain alcohol zzso zzso with a reported role in zzso and zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso protein that is shuttled to the zzso via an zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso One important function of the zzso is synthesis of neutral lipids that are packaged into zzso droplets whose zzso occurs from zzso zzso zzso is enriched at focal points of zzso zzso budding where it also zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso zzso in a manner consistent with zzso enrichment in the zzso As a zzso target zzso the observations of zzso location and potential function provide novel insight into an unexpected role for zzso in zzso zzso dynamics with implications in cancer cell metabolism and zzso
