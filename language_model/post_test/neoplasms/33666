zzso zzso has several features that make it potentially attractive as a clinical zzso zzso zzso The experience with experimental tumors suggests that zzso zzso is effective against a broad range of zzso and solid tumors, including drug-resistant tumors zzso et zzso zzso zzso tumor cells are likely to occur in heavily zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not zzso dependent zzso and zzso zzso It kills both resting and cycling zzso In this regard, zzso zzso is a valuable complement to zzso specific zzso zzso zzso There is a large differential in sensitivity between normal zzso zzso stem cells and leukemia and zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of action of zzso zzso is different from that of zzso zzso and most zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso portion of the plasma membrane and membrane lipids are probably a primary target of the toxic zzso zzso and zzso react with proteins and carbohydrates and most drugs have zzso targets zzso nuclear zzso We would therefore expect little zzso if zzso zzso were used in combination with other zzso zzso The small amounts of dye that remain associated with the zzso graft and are infused into the patient are approximately zzso less than the zzso (in zzso and therefore unlikely to cause any zzso The outcome of the first clinical application of the technique supports this view zzso et zzso zzso A better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms will undoubtedly lead to more effective applications of the technique and perhaps to the identification of more potent zzso of zzso
