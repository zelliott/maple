Micro zzso zzso are a class of small, zzso zzso species that play critical roles throughout cellular development and zzso zzso expression patterns taken from various tissue types often point to the cellular lineage of an individual tissue type, thereby being a more zzso hallmark of tissue zzso Recent work has shown that these zzso expression patterns can be used to zzso tumor cells, and that this zzso can be more accurate than the zzso achieved by using zzso zzso gene expression zzso One aspect of zzso zzso that makes them particularly attractive as a zzso is the fact that they are maintained in a protected state in serum and zzso thus allowing the detection of zzso expression patterns directly from zzso This study is focused on the evaluation of zzso expression patterns in human serum for five types of human cancer, zzso zzso zzso breast and zzso using a zzso zzso high density zzso This zzso platform enables the simultaneous analysis of all human zzso by either fluorescent or zzso signals, and can be easily redesigned to include newly identified zzso We show that sufficient zzso are present in one zzso of serum to detect zzso expression patterns, without the need for amplification zzso In addition, we are able to use these expression patterns to correctly discriminate between normal and cancer patient zzso
