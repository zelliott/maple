The complexity of the process of zzso is widely zzso We report zzso on a zzso feature of high compared to low zzso cells that is linked to their ability to survive early after their arrival at secondary zzso Using novel zzso imaging strategies that assess tumor cell interaction with the lung zzso we have determined that most high and low zzso cells can be distinguished within 6 hours of their arrival in the lung and further that this difference is defined by the ability of high zzso cells to resist zzso at the secondary zzso Despite the complexity of the zzso zzso the performance of cells during this critical window is highly defining of their zzso zzso To explore mechanisms, we next evaluated zzso pathways that may be linked to this survival zzso in highly zzso zzso Interestingly, we found no association between the zzso survival zzso and this zzso zzso Of all pathways zzso only protein zzso C zzso zzso was significantly linked to survival of highly zzso zzso These data provide a conceptual understanding of a defining difference between high and low zzso zzso The connection to zzso zzso may provide a zzso rationale for the use of zzso zzso in the prevention of zzso zzso
