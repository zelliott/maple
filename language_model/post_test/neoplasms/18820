Practically all data on familial risk in zzso and other zzso are based on incident cancer, whereas zzso in cancer mortality is largely zzso If fatal forms of cancer are a highly familial zzso then familial risk for mortality may exceed that of zzso which is relevant for clinical decision making and zzso 

zzso cancer patients in the nationwide Swedish Family Cancer Database were classified according to fatal and nonfatal zzso family zzso zzso risks for incident and fatal zzso cancer were calculated for offspring based on their parental or sibling family history of any cancer using standardized zzso ratios zzso for zzso and standardized mortality ratios zzso for zzso zzso without family history were zzso 

The database included zzso mothers and zzso daughters with zzso zzso When a mother had zzso cancer, the zzso for incident zzso cancer in daughters was zzso and when a sister had zzso cancer it was zzso The zzso for fatal cancer by fatal cancer in zzso were zzso and zzso zzso For fatal zzso zzso among siblings, the zzso was zzso compared with zzso for the zzso zzso zzso cancer was associated with maternal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso breast cancer zzso zzso Another zzso association was between zzso and paternal prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso familial risks were higher for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso than the corresponding incident zzso This may suggest that highly fatal zzso exist for these zzso calling for genetic zzso
