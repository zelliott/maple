zzso DNA zzso is being analyzed by an increasing number of laboratories in order to investigate its potential role as an active marker of zzso in various types of zzso Here we question the conclusions drawn in most of these zzso especially those published in zzso cancer research zzso under the evidence that a significant number of these medical zzso studies are based on obviously flawed sequencing zzso 

In our zzso we take a zzso approach and employ thorough database searches, which together have proven successful for detecting erroneous sequences in the fields of human population zzso and zzso Apart from conceptual problems concerning the interpretation of zzso variation in zzso in most cases, blocks of seemingly zzso zzso clearly point to contamination or sample zzso and, therefore, have nothing to do with zzso 

The role of zzso in zzso remains zzso Our findings of laboratory errors in many contributions would represent only the tip of the iceberg since most published studies do not provide the raw sequence data for inspection, thus hindering a zzso evaluation of the zzso There is no precedent for such a zzso of errors and zzso affecting a whole zzso of medical zzso
