Alcohol consumption has both adverse and beneficial effects on zzso We examined the balance of these in a large prospective study of mortality among zzso zzso 

Of zzso men and women zzso age, 56 years; range, 30 to zzso who reported their alcohol and tobacco use in 1982, 46,000 died during nine years of zzso We compared zzso and rates of death from all causes across categories of zzso alcohol consumption, adjusting for other risk factors, and related drinking and smoking habits to the cumulative probability of dying between the ages of 35 and 69 zzso 

zzso of death associated with drinking were zzso and zzso zzso of the mouth, zzso zzso zzso and liver zzso breast cancer in zzso and injuries and other external causes in zzso The mortality from breast cancer was 30 percent higher among women reporting at least one drink daily than among zzso zzso risk, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso The rates of death from all cardiovascular diseases were 30 to 40 percent lower among men zzso risk, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso and women zzso risk, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso reporting at least one drink daily than among zzso with little relation to the level of zzso The overall death rates were lowest among men and women reporting about one drink zzso zzso from all causes increased with heavier drinking, particularly among adults under age 60 with lower risk of cardiovascular zzso Alcohol consumption was associated with a small reduction in the overall risk of death in middle age zzso 35 to zzso whereas smoking approximately doubled this zzso 

In this middle-aged and elderly population, moderate alcohol consumption slightly reduced overall zzso The benefit depended in part on age and background cardiovascular risk and was far smaller than the large increase in risk produced by zzso
