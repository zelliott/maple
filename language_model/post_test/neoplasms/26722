zzso from cancer can be zzso difficult to treat, and greatly diminishes patients' quality of zzso It is therefore important to gain new information on the mechanisms of cancer pain and develop new treatment zzso We have used a zzso model of bone cancer pain to investigate underlying peripheral neural mechanisms and novel treatment zzso In this model, zzso of zzso cells into and around the zzso bone produces mechanical and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice develop spontaneous ongoing activity and zzso to zzso zzso However, it is unclear whether zzso of zzso to mechanical stimuli zzso the mechanical zzso seen in zzso zzso We therefore examined responses of zzso zzso to zzso mechanical stimuli in zzso mice and found they did not differ from those of zzso in control zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso to mechanical stimulation does not appear to zzso zzso mechanical zzso in this zzso model of bone cancer zzso We also examined the effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on spontaneous activity and responses evoked by mechanical stimuli of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso Selective zzso and zzso zzso were administered to determine the contribution of each zzso zzso to the effects of zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso zzso attenuated spontaneous discharge and responses evoked by mechanical stimulation of zzso zzso These effects were inhibited by prior zzso administration of selective zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso These results indicate that zzso of either zzso or zzso receptors reduced the spontaneous activity of zzso zzso associated with tumor growth as well as their evoked zzso Our results provide further evidence that zzso of peripheral zzso receptors may be a useful target for the treatment of cancer zzso
