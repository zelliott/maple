An in zzso tumor zzso zzso was zzso to measure the sensitivity of 800 individual patients' tumors to a variety of zzso zzso zzso separate zzso types of cancer were zzso Only 199 of the 800 patients' tumors zzso percent) both formed colonies in zzso and had enough cells in the biopsy or fluid zzso to perform drug sensitivity zzso In 123 instances the drug tested in zzso against the tumor was also used clinically to treat the zzso The zzso caring for the patient did not know the results of the in zzso zzso When analyzed in a retrospective manner, the probability of a positive prediction from the zzso given the patient responded zzso was zzso The probability for a negative prediction of the zzso given the patient did not respond, was zzso zzso of in zzso and in zzso results in the 123 correlations were highly significant zzso less than zzso We conclude that, as now zzso the human tumor zzso zzso can provide useful sensitivity information for only about 25 percent of the general zzso zzso zzso a prospective clinical trial of the zzso is needed to insure that the zzso is indeed zzso of which drug will produce a patient response and that it is not merely an indicator that a particular patient's tumor is highly responsive in zzso
