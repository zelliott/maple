To review the literature regarding the zzso of zzso in cancer patients with central zzso zzso zzso and weigh the evidence supporting zzso in this patient zzso 

Clinical literature was identified by searching zzso zzso 2007) using the key search terms zzso cancer, zzso zzso zzso and central zzso zzso 

An evaluation of retrospective and prospective clinical trials that studied the use of systemic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to prevent zzso with zzso was zzso Different patient zzso including those zzso with solid tumor or zzso zzso and those undergoing zzso stem cell zzso were evaluated for this zzso 

zzso associated with zzso is a common complication in cancer zzso Most zzso zzso will occur within 30 days after placement, with a majority within 8 zzso The zzso may depend on the type of zzso and location of the zzso zzso Despite recommendations against the use of systemic zzso for prophylaxis against zzso zzso a potential role continues to be explored in selected zzso Several variables are noted between published clinical trials, making any comparisons difficult to determine whether any benefit zzso Generally, the use of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso did not consistently reach significance in reporting a reduction in zzso zzso 

Available data do not support the routine use of zzso for zzso to prevent zzso zzso However, several inconsistencies can be found in the studies done to zzso More studies are needed to identify zzso of cancer patients who are at higher risk of developing zzso zzso and may benefit from zzso systemic zzso
