The majority of experimental studies examining zzso disease virus infection have used zzso injection of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to examine whether the route of entry of virus was critical in determining the outcome of zzso zzso zzso and resistant zzso White zzso chickens were infected with a very virulent zzso disease virus, zzso by either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso infected by the zzso route had earlier, higher or more sustained blood, zzso and lung viral zzso than those infected by the zzso zzso zzso birds had higher viral loads than zzso birds infected by the same zzso Clinical outcomes reflected these zzso zzso birds infected by the zzso route had an increased prevalence of zzso and shorter survival times compared with those infected by the zzso zzso zzso birds infected by the zzso route became zzso 10 days after zzso zzso birds had shorter survival times and increased zzso of zzso than zzso zzso The pathology and zzso seen with zzso infection could not be fully zzso by increasing the dose in zzso zzso We conclude that zzso of zzso dust produces a more aggressive infection that depends on the route of entry and form of virus, and not just on the challenge zzso
