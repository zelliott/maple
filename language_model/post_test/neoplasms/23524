X-ray zzso zzso zzso is one of the most powerful zzso diagnostic imaging techniques in modern zzso Nevertheless, the zzso molecules used as CT contrast agents in the clinic have relatively short circulation times in zzso which significantly restrict the applications of this technique in zzso imaging and zzso In addition, the use of these agents can present zzso For example, an adult patient typically receives approximately 70 zzso of zzso agent zzso zzso zzso because of zzso low contrast zzso Rapid zzso clearance of such a large dose of these agents may lead to serious adverse zzso Furthermore, some patients are hypersensitive to zzso zzso biomedical researchers have invested tremendous efforts to address these zzso Over the past decade, advances in zzso have created new zzso for zzso The unique properties of zzso such as their prolonged circulating zzso passive zzso at the tumor sites, facile surface zzso and integration of multiple diverse functions into a single zzso make them advantageous for in zzso zzso However, research on the zzso of zzso for CT imaging has lagged far behind their applications for other imaging techniques such as zzso and zzso imaging because of the challenges in the preparation of cost-effective zzso CT contrast agents with excellent zzso high contrast zzso long in zzso circulation time, and long-term zzso stability in zzso zzso This zzso reviews our recent work on the design and in zzso applications of zzso CT contrast zzso By zzso the contrast elements in the zzso according to the fundamental principles of X-ray imaging and by employing the surface engineering approaches that we and others have developed, we have zzso several zzso CT contrast agents with excellent imaging zzso For example, a novel zzso zzso agent provides enhanced contrast efficacy compared to currently available CT contrast agents under normal operating zzso To deal with special situations, we integrated both zzso and zzso with great differential in zzso value into a single particle to yield the first example of zzso contrast zzso This agent displays much higher contrast than zzso agents at different zzso and is highly suited to diagnostic imaging of various zzso Because of their prolonged in zzso circulation time and extremely low zzso these agents can be used for zzso
