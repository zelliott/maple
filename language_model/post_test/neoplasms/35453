zzso involves the acquisition of multiple genetic changes altering various cellular zzso These changes occur within the fixed time period of a human zzso and mechanisms that accelerate this process are more likely to result in clinical zzso zzso zzso decrease zzso stability and, zzso accelerate the zzso of random zzso including those in zzso and tumor zzso zzso However, if the zzso zzso is not in itself zzso acquiring that zzso would add an zzso potentially time-consuming step in zzso We present a deterministic mathematical model that allows quantitative prediction of the efficiency of zzso with and without a zzso zzso occurring at any time point in the zzso By focusing on the ratio of probabilities of pathways with and without zzso zzso within cell zzso we can define the frequency or importance of zzso zzso in populations independently of absolute rates and circumvent the question of whether zzso zzso are zzso for zzso to evolve within a human zzso We analyze key parameters that predict the relative contribution of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso involving zzso zzso are more likely if they occur zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso is favored by an increased initial zzso rate, by greater zzso in zzso rate due to the zzso zzso by increased required steps in zzso and by increased number of cell generations to the development of zzso
