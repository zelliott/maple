At the time of primary therapy zzso systemic chemotherapy and/or zzso zzso tumor cells in the bone zzso can be found in almost one-third of patients with cancer of the breast, zzso zzso stomach, zzso and other solid zzso Whereas the zzso impact of the mere presence of these cells is still a matter of debate, it has been shown that expression of zzso zzso in zzso tumor cells is linked to more aggressive zzso zzso further characterization of zzso tumor cells at the protein and gene level has become increasingly zzso To date, the most common detection method for zzso tumor cells in the bone zzso is an zzso approach using zzso zzso for detection of zzso cells and the zzso system for their zzso We have established a new double zzso technique enabling simultaneous zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso tumor zzso zzso cells from bone zzso are enriched by zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso Double zzso is performed using zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is recorded by zzso laser scanning zzso zzso using zzso labeled latex beads as the zzso zzso zzso of all the scans are then summed and zzso zzso zzso This zzso originally designed for zzso tumor cells in bone zzso can also be applied to zzso tumor cells in blood, to zzso cells or to cells present in zzso zzso or other zzso zzso The tumor cells detected may be used for gene and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso tumor cells also represent interesting targets for clinical studies on patient prognosis or prediction of therapy response as well as for specific zzso zzso
