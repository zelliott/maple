zzso disease and cancer are important health problems worldwide, yet our knowledge of these conditions is derived principally from populations of European zzso To investigate ethnic variations in major causes of death in Canada, the authors examined total and zzso mortality among European, south Asian, and Chinese zzso 

Canadians of European, south Asian and Chinese origin were identified in the Canadian zzso Database by last name and country of birth and in the population census by zzso zzso zzso death rates by cause, per 100,000 population, were calculated for ages 35 to 74 years from 1979 to 1993 and in zzso intervals grouped around census years zzso zzso and zzso 

Rates of death from zzso heart disease were highest among Canadians of south Asian origin zzso zzso women zzso and European origin zzso zzso women zzso and were markedly lower among Canadians of Chinese origin zzso zzso women zzso the rates declined significantly in all 3 groups over the study zzso Rates of death from cerebrovascular disease were relatively low and showed less ethnic variation zzso men of European, south Asian and Chinese origin zzso zzso and zzso zzso Canadian women of European, south Asian and Chinese origin zzso zzso and zzso zzso and declined similarly in all groups over zzso Rates of death from cancer were highest among Canadians of European origin zzso zzso women zzso intermediate among those of Chinese origin zzso zzso women zzso and lowest among those of south Asian origin zzso zzso women zzso Over time, cancer mortality increased in Canadians of European origin but remained constant or declined in those of south Asian and Chinese zzso 

zzso differences exist in rates of death from zzso heart disease and cancer among European, south Asian and Chinese zzso
