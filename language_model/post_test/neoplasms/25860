Solid tumors evolve from cells which have lost control functions safeguarding their zzso integrity by zzso within specific zzso zzso zzso cells within a tumor differ slightly from generation to zzso This permits the continuous production of new and subsequent selection of the best adapted cells, which retain this capacity of zzso The threat of zzso diseases is due to the clinical experience, that surgical zzso of all cells with this potential for autonomous evolution is often not achievable, since they were spread to distant zzso sites in the zzso before diagnosis and surgical removal of the primary tumor and might later grow out as zzso zzso Lack of diagnostic techniques to detect small zzso zzso as well as single spread cancer cells often causes delayed diagnosis when zzso therapy is no longer zzso Recent advances in characterizing the molecular basis of zzso instability, identifying specific gatekeeper zzso and their functional consequences in zzso cells now permit the development of new highly sensitive tests to identify zzso zzso as well as spread single cancer zzso These techniques carry a tremendous potential for simple cost effective cancer early detection and screening zzso as well as for diagnostic applications to identify spread cancer zzso Thus, they most likely will soon guide indication for surgical and zzso therapy protocols for patients with zzso or zzso zzso However, due to the complexity of the zzso and the great variety of technical aspects involved almost all diagnostic applications are not yet zzso This poses significant problems for quality control as well as zzso zzso of the results and zzso the urgent demand for well controlled collaborative efforts to evaluate indications and diagnostic standards for these zzso Here, the theoretical background, basic principles and some diagnostic applications of these new tests are zzso
