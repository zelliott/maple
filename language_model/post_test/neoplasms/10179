There is increasing evidence that the growth of human zzso is driven by a small proportion of zzso stem cells with zzso zzso Multiplication of these cells leads to loss of zzso and after division for a finite number of times the cells undergo programmed cell zzso Cell cycle times of human zzso have been measured in zzso and shown to vary in the range from two days to several weeks, depending on the zzso zzso cultured directly from zzso removed at surgery initially grow at a rate comparable to the in zzso rate but continued culture leads to the generation of cell lines that have shorter cycle times zzso zzso It has been zzso that the more rapidly growing zzso exhibits some of the properties of zzso stem cells and are the precursors of a slower growing zzso that comprise the bulk of the zzso We have previously developed a mathematical model to describe the zzso of cell lines and we extend this model here to describe the zzso of a system with two cell populations with different kinetic characteristics and a zzso zzso The aim is to provide a framework for understanding the zzso of cancer tissue that is sustained by a minor population of zzso stem zzso
