In spite of the known function of zzso group zzso genes in stem cell zzso control of cellular proliferation and zzso its role in cancer zzso is still poorly zzso We studied the expression by zzso of several zzso complex proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso human zzso using zzso zzso For selected genes zzso and zzso FISH analysis has been also carried zzso zzso proteins had a zzso and zzso expression zzso Some of them were highly selectively zzso such as zzso which was detected in germ cells in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso which was found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso By contrast, zzso was zzso expressed in every normal tissue zzso Changes in expression associated with zzso transformation have been found for zzso and zzso which exhibited increased expression in a large series of tumors, including gastrointestinal tumors, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso compared with their expression in zzso zzso The high level of expression of zzso protein observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso is associated in some cases with amplification of zzso zzso These findings imply that zzso of zzso may constitute a zzso marker in different types of cancer, mainly in zzso and zzso zzso zzso was lost in a group of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Lastly, zzso is zzso expressed in Hodgkin's zzso and zzso among others zzso A significant finding of the study is the identification of unique zzso profiles for some tumors, such as zzso zzso tumors, which have high levels of zzso expression and loss of zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso which expressed every zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso which was the only tumor other than zzso zzso tumors that did not express zzso
