Defining the relationship between zzso and cancer is a crucial but challenging zzso Mice deficient in zzso a zzso zzso in human zzso and involved in nuclear zzso A zzso zzso multiple features of zzso However, their short lifespan and serious zzso and zzso zzso restrict the application and interpretation of zzso zzso Here we present zzso mosaic mice that lack these zzso zzso mosaic mice develop normally and keep similar proportions of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells throughout life, revealing that zzso mechanisms are zzso for zzso zzso Moreover, zzso A zzso does not impair zzso initiation and growth, but it decreases the zzso of zzso oral zzso zzso zzso of zzso reduces human cancer cell zzso Our results support the potential of zzso and systemic therapies for zzso and highlight zzso as a new zzso zzso
