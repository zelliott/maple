Several zzso molecules zzso are used as clinical hypoxic tumor zzso but they are not effective as zzso These zzso zzso tumor cells zzso via zzso and in therapy, where high doses are required, their dose limiting zzso zzso zzso The synthesis and preliminary in zzso evaluations of three zzso members of a novel class of zzso zzso that are putative zzso of zzso transport proteins zzso and possess zzso zzso features, are now zzso The zzso zzso of several zzso provides a rational basis to develop these zzso because more selective zzso in hypoxic cells would decrease systemic zzso at effective zzso zzso partition zzso zzso zzso to zzso predict rapid in zzso clearance for low systemic zzso In zzso experimental data show that zzso are zzso and that they competitively inhibit zzso zzso
