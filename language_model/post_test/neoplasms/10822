It is puzzling to note that British and Danish citizens have a poorer cancer prognosis than citizens from other countries, and this study zzso that their low cancer survival could be partly rooted in the gatekeeper function undertaken by general practice in these two zzso 

To test the association between principles of gatekeeper systems and cancer zzso 

An zzso study with data from zzso and primary care zzso 

This hypothesis was tested in an zzso study on the association between three principles of gatekeeper systems and cancer survival in 19 European countries for which valid and full data were zzso 

It was found that zzso systems with a gatekeeper system do have a significantly lower zzso relative cancer survival than systems without such gatekeeper zzso 

The possible mechanisms behind this finding are discussed, and while all the positive aspects of zzso are zzso it is strongly recommended that further research be conducted to confirm or reject the study hypothesis on this possible serious adverse effect of zzso
