This study investigates the spatial pattern of zzso in Europe to check the feasibility of a large scale ecological epidemiology approach to cancer in zzso 

The zzso types relative zzso and cancer zzso (for men and zzso reported in the European cancer zzso were investigated by exploratory data analysis zzso zzso zzso of the female condition were considered as zzso 

The zzso of the European regional areas covered by the cancer zzso followed almost exactly the boundaries set by the long and zzso European history in terms of life styles and cultural zzso This result supports the notion of a zzso role of environmental factors in cancer zzso Further support to the above result was given by the finding of a correlation between differential zzso cancer zzso and socioeconomic zzso of the female zzso 

From a zzso point of view, the consistency of these results pointed to the feasibility of an ecological approach to zzso zzso
