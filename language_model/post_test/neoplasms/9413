zzso zzso are small zzso molecules that control gene expression by zzso of protein translation or degradation of zzso target zzso zzso strict Even though strict zzso and zzso regulation appears to be critical for zzso function, very little is known about the mechanisms governing zzso gene zzso Several recent studies have shown that zzso genes can regulated DNA zzso and other zzso zzso The observation of altered zzso gene zzso patterns in human zzso also suggested that zzso gene zzso is functional relevant for zzso We have now performed a comprehensive analysis of zzso genes and found that about half of these genes are associated with zzso islands and thus represent candidate targets of the DNA zzso machinery An expanded analysis of several zzso zzso islands in five cell lines indicated that zzso gene zzso is zzso at high zzso both in normal and zzso zzso zzso explanations for this phenomenon include the specific structure of zzso genes and/or their requirement for strict expression zzso
