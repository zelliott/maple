zzso of tumors is based on zzso and on determination of zzso In well differentiated zzso the tumor tissue reveals a similar zzso pattern similar to that of the normal tissue from which they have zzso In contrast less differentiated zzso do not show such similarities to normal tissue in conventional zzso and special procedures such as electron zzso or zzso have to be performed in order to detect cell specific zzso In many zzso tumors this is not possible because loss of differentiation and zzso in tumor cells do not allow the production of cell specific zzso A new possibility for determining the zzso of tumors is the use of zzso which are specific for one type of intermediate zzso Intermediate filaments are structures, which together with zzso and zzso form the zzso Intermediate filaments are composed of different zzso which show a cell type zzso zzso are the intermediate filaments characteristically found in zzso and zzso zzso zzso is the specific intermediate filament type of zzso visceral and some type of vascular smooth muscle zzso zzso filaments are characteristic of zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and most but not all zzso cells and the only intermediate filament type present in these zzso zzso are composed of three different zzso which form the so called zzso zzso and are characteristically found in central and peripheral zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso forms the intermediate filament system of normal and zzso zzso and also some zzso cells contain zzso Thus cells and zzso can be divided into five different types by the use of appropriate zzso or zzso zzso In the current study we were interested to determine with a large number of zzso whether primary tumors or zzso continue to express the intermediate type characteristic of the normal zzso The following results zzso there is abundant evidence that intermediate filaments can be used as cell type specific markers both for normal tissue and for zzso zzso To exclude wrong negative results by intermediate filament zzso a reliable detection of intermediate filaments should be performed on zzso sections or on material, which has been recently ethanol fixed and zzso zzso With many zzso fixation of the tissue in zzso results in a decrease of zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
