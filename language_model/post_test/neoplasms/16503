zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was initially identified on immature zzso zzso a small zzso of zzso peripheral blood zzso on zzso zzso lines and in fetal zzso zzso analysis of the zzso has identified molecular features that are characteristic of zzso zzso zzso To investigate the biological role and the potential usefulness of the zzso we have more extensively studied the pattern of zzso zzso expression in a panel of fetal zzso at different zzso ages, and on adult normal and tumor zzso In the fetal samples examined by zzso including zzso liver, lung and adrenal zzso we found that zzso zzso is widely expressed during early stages of fetal development and zzso during zzso Very poor or not zzso expression of zzso zzso was found at late zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and flow zzso analysis of a panel of normal adult zzso and benign zzso failed to find zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was highly zzso in a variety of cancer specimens from breast, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Based on these data zzso zzso for the wide expression on fetal zzso the zzso during zzso and the zzso in cancer cells, may be considered a novel zzso zzso of interest for biological investigation and clinical zzso
