We argue that the results published by zzso zzso zzso E 67, zzso zzso on zzso noise in zzso zzso are not zzso Their conclusion that, for larger values of the correlation zzso zzso , the cell population is peaked at zzso which denotes a high extinction rate, is also zzso We find the reverse behavior to their results, that increasing zzso promotes the stable growth of tumor zzso In particular, their results for the zzso zzso as a function of cell number, at different correlation strengths, presented in zzso 1 and 2 of their paper show different behavior than one would expect from the simple mathematical expression for the zzso zzso Additionally, their interpretation that at small values of cell number the zzso probability increases as the correlation zzso is increased is also zzso Another striking feature in their zzso 1 and 3 is that, for the same values of the parameters zzso and zzso their simulation produces two different curves, both zzso and zzso
