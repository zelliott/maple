Using a simple method for the selection of hybrid cell growth from the cell fusion of pairs of existing zzso cell lines, 2 different zzso cell lines were zzso Both zzso zzso zzso zzso with similar specificity for human zzso and for mouse zzso but in one case the parental zzso zzso were both zzso and in the other case the zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso zzso was zzso In a model in zzso system both zzso zzso were able to elicit potent cell killing of a zzso expressing mouse zzso cell line by human zzso cell zzso The cell blasts were generated from resting peripheral blood zzso cells using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The parental zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso was also able to mediate cell killing by zzso This zzso killing was inhibited by a zzso to the zzso zzso zzso but the killing zzso by the zzso zzso was zzso Both mechanisms of zzso cell killing may be of great potential in human zzso therapy with zzso
