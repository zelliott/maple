zzso transition zzso which is characterized by the suppression of the zzso protein zzso is a crucial process that promotes zzso and zzso properties of cancer zzso However, the zzso of cellular zzso is not sufficient to explain why cancer cells move, and the zzso nature of cancer cells undergoing zzso remains zzso Here, we identify a mechanism in which the zzso zzso zzso elicits cancer cell movement through zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso to suppress zzso zzso which results in zzso of zzso and zzso leading to zzso zzso and enabling zzso movement in three-dimensional zzso Moreover, the suppression of zzso contributes to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso axis in head and neck cancer patients zzso with zzso zzso and worse zzso Our results uncover an essential mechanism to explain how zzso zzso the zzso zzso cancer cell zzso beyond simply suppressing zzso
