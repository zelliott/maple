Major technical advances in zzso including zzso and zzso zzso have allowed for improved physical precision and increased dose delivery to the zzso with better sparing of surrounding normal zzso The development of zzso of the sensing and repair of DNA zzso breaks zzso is exciting and could be combined with precise zzso targeting to improve local control following zzso However, caution must be exercised in order that zzso zzso are combined with zzso in such a manner as to preserve the therapeutic ratio by exploiting repair deficiencies in zzso cells over that of normal zzso In this review, we discuss the rationale and current approaches to targeting zzso sensing and repair pathways in combined zzso with zzso We also describe potential zzso that could be useful in detecting functional zzso of zzso repair in a patient's zzso during clinical zzso zzso Finally, we examine a number of issues relating to the use of zzso molecular agents and zzso in the context of the tumor zzso effects on normal zzso and the optimal timing and duration of the agent in relation to zzso zzso
