A systematic review of the literature was undertaken to assess what published evidence is currently available to support the increasing use of zzso stem cell transplantation zzso and to evaluate the published data with regard to the comparative cost of high-dose and conventional zzso The review aimed to identify all published, zzso controlled trials zzso comparing high-dose therapy zzso with zzso versus conventional chemotherapy zzso in acute zzso zzso zzso lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple zzso and breast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The review also aimed to identify all studies that had compared the cost of the two treatment zzso Reports were identified by systematic searches of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of several conference zzso Where possible, pooled odds ratios zzso were calculated according to the zzso zzso A total of 18 zzso trials were identified in acute zzso zzso zzso lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, multiple zzso and breast, lung and zzso zzso Trials were generally small and no disease site had sufficient information to determine reliably whether high-dose therapy with zzso transplant is more effective than zzso Five studies were identified that compared the cost of the two zzso These found the cost of zzso to be between one and four times higher than that of zzso Further zzso trials are zzso Where appropriate, these should include economic assessment and assessments of long-term zzso
