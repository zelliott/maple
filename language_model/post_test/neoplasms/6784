An overall link between the potential for gene zzso and the timing of replication in S phase is now well established in zzso Here we discuss emerging evidence that highlights the possibility that replication timing is zzso linked with zzso zzso In particular, we bring together conclusions from a range of studies to propose a model in which zzso factors determine the timing of replication and the zzso of zzso events requires passage through S zzso These considerations have implications for our understanding of development, evolution and diseases such as zzso
