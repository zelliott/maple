To examine if the occurrence of different zzso was increased among rubber workers, as the highest known zzso of humans to zzso have occurred in the rubber zzso 

A cohort of zzso rubber workers zzso after 1 January 1950, still active or retired on 1 January 1981 and employed for at least 1 year in one of five study zzso was followed up for mortality from 1 January 1981 to 31 December zzso Work histories were reconstructed with routinely documented cost zzso codes, which allowed identification by employment in specific work zzso For each cost zzso code time and factory specific, zzso zzso to zzso (three zzso low, zzso zzso and other compounds were estimated by industrial zzso Rate ratios for medium zzso and high zzso zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso were calculated with Cox's zzso hazards models with the low exposure as zzso 

Exposure to zzso was significantly associated with an increased mortality from zzso of the zzso (13 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and of the oral cavity and zzso (17 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso A zzso trend of increasing mortality with exposure to higher zzso of zzso was found for mortality from cancer of the prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and the brain (six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso No association was found between exposure to zzso and cancer of the stomach zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso or lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

Exposure to high zzso of zzso is associated with increased mortality from zzso of the zzso oral zzso and zzso but not with increased mortality from zzso of the stomach or zzso
