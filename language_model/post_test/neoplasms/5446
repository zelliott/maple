zzso zzso genes are thought to be critical in the regulation of cellular proliferation and differentiation and are zzso in approximately zzso of all human zzso However, zzso and zzso are zzso for mouse zzso To characterize the normal role of zzso in growth and development, we have zzso it by gene targeting in the zzso On an zzso genetic background, zzso zzso for this zzso die between 12 and 14 days of zzso with fetal liver defects and evidence of zzso Thus, zzso is the only member of the zzso gene family essential for mouse zzso We have also investigated the effect of multiple zzso within the zzso gene zzso Most animals lacking zzso function and zzso for the zzso zzso exhibit abnormal zzso development and die between days 10 and 12 of zzso Thus, partial functional overlap appears to occur within the zzso gene family, but zzso provides a unique and essential zzso
