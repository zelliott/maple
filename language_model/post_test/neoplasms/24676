zzso zzso plays key roles in many zzso processes and is often zzso in pathological zzso Our current understanding of how protein zzso and zzso orchestrate the zzso changes that control cellular functions has made these zzso potential drug targets for the treatment of many zzso The success of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso in the treatment of some zzso has further zzso the development of zzso zzso as zzso zzso A large number of these compounds are currently undergoing clinical trials and there is much expectation on the therapeutic potential of these zzso as more specific and less toxic drugs than currently used generic zzso zzso In this zzso we review the current status of more than 30 protein zzso zzso with proven or potential therapeutic value for cancer zzso These include zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso as well as compounds that target different families of zzso zzso involved in zzso and cell cycle zzso We also briefly touch on the prospects of zzso zzso The combination of zzso zzso to target different components of zzso pathways that are found zzso in zzso is also emerging as an interesting approach for cancer zzso
