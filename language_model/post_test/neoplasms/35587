zzso of zzso has great potential in the quest for highly potent and specific drugs to treat diseases such as diabetes, cancer, and viral zzso One of the most effective ways of designing such compounds is by mimicking the transition zzso Here we describe the zzso zzso and zzso dissection of binding of two zzso compounds, which are among the most potent zzso zzso reported to date, with two family 1 zzso zzso while inclusion of the zzso zzso improves binding by a factor of zzso this does not appear to result from better zzso interactions with the zzso instead, improved affinity may be derived from significantly better zzso contributions to binding displayed by the zzso zzso zzso
