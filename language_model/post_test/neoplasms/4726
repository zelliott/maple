Base zzso repair zzso is an zzso zzso pathway, which could be considered the zzso repair mechanism of the zzso In particular, zzso zzso most forms of spontaneous zzso zzso products in DNA, as well as everyday zzso and zzso modifications to bases or the sugar zzso zzso The repair response involves five key zzso steps that aim to remove the initial DNA zzso and restore the genetic material back to its original state: zzso zzso of a damaged or inappropriate base, zzso incision of the zzso backbone at the resulting zzso site, zzso zzso zzso to permit unabated repair synthesis and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso to replace the excised zzso and zzso zzso of the final, remaining DNA zzso These repair steps are executed by a collection of zzso that include DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso components lead to reduced cell survival, elevated zzso rates, and zzso agent zzso In addition, the zzso plays a significant role in determining cellular responsiveness to relevant clinical zzso agents, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The molecular details of zzso and the contribution of the zzso to therapeutic agent resistance are reviewed zzso
