The purpose of this study was to compare the ability to collect human bone zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso from bone zzso versus peripheral blood zzso zzso cell zzso collections using in zzso and in zzso zzso Ten zzso samples of zzso collections mobilized from 11 patients undergoing zzso using chemotherapy followed by zzso zzso zzso were evaluated using in zzso and in zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso Additionally, 10 zzso samples of zzso bone zzso zzso as well as zzso collected after zzso using zzso 10 zzso obtained from 3 normal, zzso zzso donors were analyzed for zzso zzso and zzso The zzso were isolated and zzso as adherent cells in zzso and subsequently tested for the capacity to differentiate into zzso zzso in zzso using calcium zzso porous ceramic cubes implanted zzso in zzso zzso zzso sections of these cubes were analyzed zzso for the appearance of bone and zzso Seven zzso subjects with cancer received zzso after chemotherapy administration, whereas 4 cancer patients and all 3 normal donors received zzso alone as the zzso zzso For the zzso zzso collections and the normal zzso aspirations, median zzso zzso content was in the normal range for our zzso zzso were detected in in zzso cultures and as zzso ceramic cubes in samples of all 3 zzso donor bone zzso but in none of the 14 zzso and 6 zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso could not be recovered in zzso collections obtained from either normal donors or patients who underwent zzso collections after zzso therapy but could be obtained routinely from bone zzso zzso Although the role of transplanted zzso is an area of clinical investigation, this study points out a fundamental differences in the population of cells transplanted after collection from bone zzso versus peripheral zzso
