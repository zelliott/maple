Although much evidence has been gathered demonstrating that immune zzso can play a significant role in controlling tumor growth under natural conditions or in response to therapeutic zzso it is clear that zzso cells do evade immune surveillance in most zzso Considering that zzso active specific zzso seems to have reached a plateau of results and that currently no vaccination regimen is indicated as a standard zzso therapy, the dissection of the molecular events underlying tumor immune escape is the necessary condition to make zzso vaccines a therapeutic weapon effective enough to be implemented in the routine clinical zzso Recent years have witnessed significant advances in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying tumor immune zzso These zzso insights are zzso the development of rationally designed zzso aimed to zzso the zzso circuits that undermine an effective zzso immune zzso In this review, the best characterized mechanisms that allow cancer cells to evade immune surveillance are zzso and the most debated controversies zzso this complex field are zzso
