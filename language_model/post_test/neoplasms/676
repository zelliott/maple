The zzso transition zzso plays a critical role in tumor zzso To obtain a broad view of the molecules involved in zzso we carried out a comparative zzso analysis of transforming growth zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso A total of 36 proteins with significant zzso in abundance were zzso Among these zzso zzso heavy chain zzso a cellular iron storage zzso was characterized as a novel zzso in zzso zzso In response to zzso there was a dramatic decrease in the zzso levels, which caused iron release from zzso and, therefore, increased the zzso zzso iron pool zzso zzso the increase in zzso blocked zzso zzso In addition, increased zzso levels promoted the production of zzso oxygen species zzso which in turn activated zzso zzso protein zzso The elimination of zzso inhibited zzso whereas zzso treatment rescued zzso zzso in cells in which the zzso increase was zzso zzso of zzso zzso attenuated the increases in zzso and zzso production, leading to a suppression of zzso We also showed that zzso zzso of zzso occurs via 3' untranslated zzso repression of the translation of zzso zzso Moreover, we found that zzso zzso is an event that occurs between the early and highly invasive advanced stages in zzso zzso and that depletion of zzso or zzso suppresses the migration of tumor zzso Our data show that cellular iron zzso regulated by zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso
