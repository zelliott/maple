To determine whether a zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with a worse prognosis and/or a more advanced cancer stage and to evaluate the association between a zzso zzso and zzso survival when known zzso factors, such as age, stage, cancer type, and type of surgery, are zzso 

It is unknown whether zzso patients who develop a zzso zzso after a complete zzso zzso are at the same survival disadvantage as zzso patients with a spontaneous zzso 

A retrospective case control study was conducted at Memorial zzso Cancer zzso Years of zzso January 1, 2000, to December 31, zzso Median zzso zzso months zzso range zzso zzso All cancer patients who underwent zzso zzso zzso or soft tissue procedures and those who developed a zzso within 30 days of the procedure were identified from a prospective morbidity and mortality zzso zzso survival zzso was calculated for the entire zzso In the matched zzso zzso and zzso survival zzso were calculated for stages 0 to 3 and stages 0 to zzso 

A total of zzso cancer patients underwent an invasive procedure and zzso zzso had a zzso zzso zzso patients had a significantly worse zzso zzso compared to zzso patients zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso 205 zzso patients zzso zzso were matched to zzso controls by age, sex, cancer type, stage, and surgical zzso In this matched analysis, zzso patients continued to demonstrate a significantly worse prognosis with an inferior zzso zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso as compared to zzso The survival difference persisted in early stage disease zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in zzso patients with limited disease and a complete surgical zzso is associated with an inferior cancer zzso A zzso zzso remains a poor zzso factor, even when controlling for age, stage, cancer type, and surgical procedure further supporting an independent link between zzso and cancer zzso
