A wide number of genetic and zzso changes are required to drive normal cells towards zzso These changes participate in zzso zzso pathways that allow tumor cells proliferation and zzso zzso and zzso in their seminal paper zzso hallmarks of zzso described the classic cell hallmarks acquired in cancer development and zzso self-sufficiency in growth signals, zzso to zzso signals, evading zzso zzso replication potential, sustained zzso tissue invasion and zzso This review covers other recently described biological characteristics associated with the emergence of zzso Some of the main zzso hallmarks of cancer that are broadly accepted include: genetic instability, evasion of cell zzso zzso zzso of cancer zzso zzso interference zzso in the expression of cancer zzso changes in zzso and zzso zzso participation of cancer stem cells in cellular zzso zzso cell participation in the zzso zzso and changes in zzso presentation and zzso due to zzso in the zzso zzso The identification of molecular zzso of classical and non classical tumor processes in a specific tumor will allow a better understanding of its zzso It will also permit the design of ad-hoc therapeutic zzso
