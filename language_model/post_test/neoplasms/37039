To evaluate the association between weight zzso and disease zzso in zzso 

Prospective cohort study, following women from 1986 through zzso 

A zzso sample of zzso women aged zzso zzso free of cancer and heart disease, completed a zzso survey that included zzso body weights at ages 18, 30, 40, 50 zzso and zzso Weight zzso was defined as zzso the root mean square error around the slope of weight on age zzso and zzso zzso measures of weight zzso zzso measures were zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso breast, zzso zzso or other zzso total and hip zzso 

zzso relative risks of zzso stroke, diabetes, and hip fracture increased with increasing weight zzso The age and body mass zzso relative risks zzso for highest vs lowest zzso of zzso were: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lung zzso zzso other zzso zzso total zzso zzso hip zzso zzso The strongest associations between weight change categories and disease were for diabetes zzso compared to small zzso zzso large cycle, zzso small cycle, zzso large gain, zzso weight loss, zzso other pattern, zzso Large weight cycles were associated with higher risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso and stroke zzso zzso zzso 

These findings are consistent with previous studies and suggest that weight zzso is associated with higher risk of developing chronic zzso
