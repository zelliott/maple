zzso gene zzso zzso is a promising physical method for gene therapy, especially for cancer gene zzso To investigate the optimal zzso conditions and to determine whether the optimal zzso rate using zzso is comparable to that of zzso or zzso zzso we zzso different cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso using a zzso zzso ultrasound at different zzso pulse repetition zzso and exposure zzso The ideal ultrasound conditions were noted to be at zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso with a duty factor of zzso The results showed that zzso rate increased with the number of zzso and peaked between 10 and 15 zzso before it started to zzso Using such optimal conditions, we have shown that zzso is superior to zzso and zzso zzso at the fixed conditions used in the present zzso These findings suggest that zzso could be a better alternative to other zzso methods zzso zzso and zzso zzso of gene zzso particularly in cancer gene zzso
