In tumor cells, the zzso factor zzso has been described to be zzso and zzso and involved in the production of zzso factors such as vascular zzso growth zzso From these data, a zzso role of zzso has zzso Here, we examined in zzso cells whether zzso signaling zzso is involved in zzso the zzso properties of zzso zzso The current report describes that zzso unrelated agents with direct zzso effect induced zzso zzso in zzso zzso Our data showed that zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of human zzso induced zzso zzso in zzso cells in both cultured human zzso cells and in zzso in a mouse tumor zzso It was also found that zzso activity was required for the zzso activity, because zzso of zzso in zzso cells impaired the ability of zzso agents to block zzso of zzso cells and to overcome zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells can result in an unexpected zzso zzso Based on these data, the current approach of systemic treatment with zzso zzso may therefore be revisited because zzso zzso specifically targeted to zzso cells might represent an efficient strategy for the treatment of zzso
