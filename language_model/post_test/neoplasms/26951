zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso family of proteins has been shown to play a key role in cancer, zzso and cardiovascular diseases and is emerging as a possible drug zzso Here we describe a zzso method that has enabled the zzso X-ray structure determination of zzso zzso zzso of the X-ray structures of five zzso complexes from 3 different zzso illustrates that the zzso zzso binding site is able to accommodate a range of chemical diversity and different binding zzso The zzso system is also able to tolerate some protein zzso This crystal system provides a robust platform for zzso structure determination and future structure based drug zzso
