To zzso cancer survival in New South Wales by geographic zzso 

A survival analysis of all patients with zzso diagnosed in zzso between 1 January 1992 and 31 December zzso Survival was determined to 31 December zzso 

The relative excess risk zzso of death over 5 years was estimated for each geographic zzso category relative to the highly accessible category for 20 cancer types adjusted for age, sex, years since diagnosis and, zzso stage of cancer at zzso 

There were statistically significant differences in the zzso of death across zzso categories zzso zzso zzso for zzso of the zzso and prostate and for all zzso The zzso for the most remote categories zzso with the highly accessible zzso before and after adjustment for stage were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, there were significant variations in zzso of death by zzso for head and neck, lung and colon zzso and zzso zzso 

Cancer survival varies by zzso of residence in zzso for all zzso together and some zzso zzso Access to screening or early diagnosis probably contributes to this variation, but persistence after adjustment for stage suggests that treatment variation is also zzso
