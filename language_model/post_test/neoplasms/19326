For the best understanding of aging, we must consider a genetic pool in which genes with negative effects zzso genes that shorten the life zzso interact with genes with positive effects zzso genes that promote zzso in a constant zzso relationship that results in a zzso of the final expression under particular environmental zzso Examples of deleterious genes affecting aging zzso to zzso pathology and disease) are those that zzso risk for developing vascular disease in the heart, brain, or peripheral vessels zzso zzso zzso and zzso at factor II and factor V zzso a gene associated with sporadic zzso Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso associated with an increased fracture risk, and several genetic zzso involved in hormonal metabolism that affect adverse reactions to zzso replacement in zzso zzso In zzso the process of aging can be regarded as a zzso trait that results from an interaction between zzso events and sets of zzso zzso that have zzso zzso zzso zzso those zzso that zzso to disease and having the zzso genes zzso beneficial genetic zzso that zzso disease zzso are probably both important to such a remarkable survival zzso
