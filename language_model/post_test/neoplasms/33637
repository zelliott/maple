Recent studies have identified normal cellular DNA sequences which are lost in the development of zzso and adult zzso These zzso are thought to arise after a primary zzso in one zzso of such a sequence is followed by loss of its normal zzso In familial cases, the primary zzso is transmitted in the germ zzso The secondary zzso may involve a substantial loss of zzso material and thus lead to identification of the site of the inherited zzso We have examined constitutional and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso which develop in the zzso inherited cancer syndrome multiple zzso zzso type 2 zzso to locate the zzso gene in this zzso We observed deletion of a zzso region of DNA on the short arm of zzso 1 in seven out of zzso zzso Analysis of the parental origin of the deleted zzso in two families showed that it was derived from the affected parent in one case, which suggests that the deletion does not reflect the site of the inherited zzso in zzso The deleted region is zzso to the zzso commonly detected in zzso which share with the zzso of zzso zzso origin from zzso
