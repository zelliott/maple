zzso acid zzso techniques have been used for several decades in basic research to isolate zzso to determine their structure or zzso their zzso The possibility of using them in clinical biology has been considered for several zzso The transfer from basic to applied research can now take place due to the new technology of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso features the use of a probe zzso acid zzso and of a target zzso acid zzso It leads to the formation of a zzso zzso also called duplex, which can be detected with great zzso For this to be done, the probe can be zzso with a variety of labels such as a zzso or a zzso marker which can be detected for its fluorescence, zzso or zzso activity or by zzso zzso can be performed either in a liquid solution or on a solid zzso In the first case, zzso is generally followed by a separation step which makes use of solid phase to isolate the hybrid zzso zzso This separation can be achieved by zzso means zzso zzso differential zzso zzso zzso or by zzso means zzso zzso zzso In the second case, the support can be used in different ways according to the zzso format employed to perform zzso The target DNA can be immobilized by zzso the sample to be tested with the zzso simple zzso deposit with a zzso (for low zzso or by aspiration under vacuum or by zzso or zzso transfer from an zzso zzso In the sandwich zzso format, probe DNA is immobilized onto the support to specifically extract the target DNA from the medium under zzso Support to be employed for zzso purpose can be selected from the group consisting of: nylon zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mixed zzso cellulose and its derivatives; zzso supports zzso zzso zzso latex zzso polystyrene zzso The zzso procedures and capacity vary according to the type of support zzso
