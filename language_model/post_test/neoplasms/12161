The use of zzso for cancer detection is currently under zzso zzso zzso zzso detection methods are in use, but have limitations due to poor contrast between the zzso of the tumor and background zzso zzso contrast can be obtained with zzso techniques because of the differing lifetimes between zzso and zzso zzso that selectively accumulate within tumor zzso An imaging system is constructed using a zzso zzso zzso device zzso camera and a zzso zzso laser zzso To characterize the ability of the system to transfer object contrast to an image, the zzso transfer function zzso of the system is acquired by employing an extended zzso zzso A zzso target is assembled by drilling a zzso well into a block of zzso zzso zzso The imaging system records images of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso was chosen to test the system because of its strong zzso of zzso high zzso yield, and relatively long zzso lifetime zzso zzso zzso The results show that the system is capable of resolving zzso M zzso zzso as small as 1 zzso The findings of this study contribute to the development of a zzso imaging system using zzso zzso
