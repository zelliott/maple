zzso pain is a highly prevalent and difficult to manage cancer pain zzso Current strategies are frequently zzso in part because of a mismatch between the sudden onset and brief duration of breakthrough pain and the slower onset and more prolonged duration of oral zzso zzso Novel zzso interventions are needed to provide a closer match between the zzso profile of the pain and the zzso of the pain medication, and novel models of study of breakthrough pain are needed to evaluate zzso 

This is an zzso feasibility study of a model to evaluate zzso zzso for zzso breakthrough zzso The model has three zzso zzso upward zzso and optimal dose zzso 

Seven patients with breakthrough pain because of cancer entered the upward zzso phase of the trial, and 61 episodes of breakthrough pain were evaluated with zzso zzso at escalating doses ranging from zzso zzso zzso was generally mild and similar to patients' prior breakthrough zzso Four patients entered the optimal dose evaluation phase, and 39 discrete episodes of breakthrough pain were available for zzso zzso relief of pain occurred with a median onset of 5 minutes, and no serious adverse events were zzso 

This model of assessment of breakthrough pain, zzso each episode of pain is treated as a separate data set and multiple discrete episodes of breakthrough pain are assessed every 5 minutes in each patient, appears to be feasible within the cancer pain zzso zzso results suggest a very rapid onset of relief of breakthrough pain with zzso zzso when administered at the optimal dose, consistent with a highly favorable early zzso profile of zzso administered via this zzso Further study is zzso
