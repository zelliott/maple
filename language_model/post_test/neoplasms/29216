The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso L zzso blocks infections by some types of viruses through zzso of viral and cellular zzso zzso zzso induce type I zzso that initiate signaling to the zzso zzso zzso proteins are pathogen recognition receptors for the viral zzso molecular pattern, zzso zzso zzso zzso activates zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso Upon binding zzso zzso L is converted from an inactive zzso to a zzso active zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso L zzso from zzso to zzso a series of 9 zzso repeats, a zzso several protein zzso zzso and a zzso domain zzso to zzso zzso in the unfolded protein zzso In the past few years, it has become increasingly apparent that zzso L and zzso contribute to innate immunity in many zzso For example, small zzso zzso products produced by zzso L during viral infections can signal to the zzso zzso like receptors to amplify and perpetuate signaling to the zzso zzso In addition, zzso L is now implicated in protecting the central nervous system against zzso zzso A role in tumor suppression was zzso by mapping of the zzso L gene to the zzso prostate cancer 1 zzso zzso which in turn led to discovery of the zzso zzso zzso zzso A broader role in innate immunity is suggested by involvement of zzso L in zzso induction and zzso pathways that suppress bacterial zzso These newly described findings about zzso L could eventually provide the basis for developing zzso zzso zzso
