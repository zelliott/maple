The imaging of spontaneously occurring tumors in mice poses many technical and logistical zzso Recently a mouse model was generated in which a zzso protein consisting of zzso zzso degradation domain zzso fused to zzso was zzso expressed in all zzso zzso stress leads to the zzso of zzso in the zzso of this mouse model which can be identified by zzso zzso zzso Crossing this transgenic mouse with zzso mice yields solid tumors with hypoxic zzso that may be successfully zzso and characterized using the technique described zzso
