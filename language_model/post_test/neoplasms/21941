We examined whether zzso expression of zzso a surface zzso expressed on zzso from zzso and zzso zzso and zzso a zzso marker, are increased in the blood of cancer patients and whether these factors correlate with patient characteristics and are zzso factors of zzso 

We developed a real-time zzso method zzso acid zzso zzso to determine expression of zzso and zzso zzso in the peripheral blood zzso cells of 131 progressive cancer patients, 37 healthy volunteers, and 5 patients who received zzso zzso zzso zzso survival and other zzso variables were zzso Cox zzso hazards studies were zzso 

We show that patients with zzso disease have a significant increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically patients with bone zzso zzso zzso zzso Cancer patients with high zzso zzso zzso using a defined zzso value, show a decreased survival compared with patients with low or zzso zzso expression zzso versus zzso cumulative survival, respectively, after 20 zzso P zzso zzso Among patients with zzso to the bone, cumulative survival was zzso compared with zzso for patients with high or low zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso expression is an independent predictor for overall survival in patients with bone zzso zzso zzso was not increased in patients with cancer, nor did it correlate with clinical variables or zzso 

zzso but not zzso zzso expression is increased in cancer patients with zzso disease, specifically with bone zzso In addition, zzso zzso expression seems to be an independent zzso factor for overall zzso
