zzso levels of zzso zzso are determined largely by genetic variation in the gene zzso for zzso zzso the specific protein component of zzso that is very zzso to zzso High plasma levels of zzso increase the risk for premature zzso vessel zzso We investigated the zzso role of zzso as a risk factor for zzso zzso diseases, alone and in conjunction with established zzso risk factors of proteins regulating blood zzso and zzso 

zzso levels of zzso and zzso protein C, protein zzso and zzso as well as the size of zzso zzso and the presence of the factor zzso zzso were determined in 186 zzso admitted children from zzso to 18 years old with a history of zzso zzso and in 186 zzso and zzso control zzso Children with a history of zzso zzso had a significantly higher median zzso level (19 versus zzso zzso than control zzso The risk for zzso events in children with zzso levels in the upper zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The size of zzso zzso was zzso related to zzso levels and to the risk for zzso zzso Compared with the highest zzso of the zzso size distribution, the lowest zzso was associated with a risk of zzso In addition, zzso statistical analysis gives evidence that the factor zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso protein C zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were independent risk factors of childhood zzso zzso zzso of elevated zzso with factor zzso zzso or deficiencies of protein C or zzso further increased the risk for zzso events to zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is a risk factor for zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso should be included in the screening of zzso factors in children with zzso zzso zzso
