To evaluate the safety and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso administered by prolonged zzso infusion in patients with advanced zzso 

A total of 35 patients was treated in zzso of 3-6 with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso as a continuous infusion for 14 or 21 zzso Plasma levels of intact zzso zzso were measured in all zzso 

zzso was generally well zzso At the highest dose level examined in this study zzso zzso fatigue and transient zzso zzso of serum zzso zzso zzso became apparent after zzso days of zzso Both reactions were believed to be drug zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso plasma zzso of zzso were reached approximately 10 h after starting the infusion and increased zzso across the range of doses administered zzso zzso The terminal plasma zzso was approximately 2 zzso zzso studies using Western zzso performed on peripheral blood zzso cells on selected patients, demonstrated a decline in zzso protein levels during zzso No major zzso responses were zzso 

zzso zzso therapy is well zzso Relative to other zzso studies of zzso fatigue was somewhat more prominent in this study, possibly because of the protracted zzso infusion schedule of the zzso zzso Current zzso trials are using the highest daily dose established in this study given by shorter infusion periods zzso 7 zzso for zzso zzso to enhance the zzso activity of standard zzso zzso
