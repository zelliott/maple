zzso bone zzso zzso cells have been shown to home into the tumor vessels of zzso implanted tumor models and to functionally contribute to tumor zzso and tumor zzso However, whether zzso cells contribute to the vessels of in zzso developing tumors remains zzso We have taken advantage of the in zzso generation of zzso tumors in transgenic mice carrying the zzso virus middle T zzso zzso to determine whether transplanted zzso cells home to and incorporate into the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso 26 mice was used to rescue zzso zzso transgenic mice or their zzso zzso All transgenic mice were sacrificed when they developed easily palpable zzso zzso zzso cells recruited and incorporated into the zzso were identified by zzso of zzso and zzso evidence that these cells had a distinctive, zzso appearance and that they lined the vessel zzso We found that zzso cells home to and incorporate into zzso of the vessels of all in zzso generated zzso zzso examined zzso In contrast, zzso cells did not recruit into the vessels of colon or liver of the zzso zzso Whether these cells contribute to new vessel formation via zzso or zzso or simply attach to, and integrate into, the growing tips or shafts of pre-existing vessels has to be zzso zzso could be used as a vehicle for the specific transport of zzso signals into the tumor vascular zzso
