Whole zzso amplification zzso methods allow diagnostic laboratories to overcome the common problem of insufficient DNA in patient zzso Further, body fluid samples useful for cancer early detection are often difficult to amplify with traditional zzso zzso In this first application of zzso on the entire human zzso zzso we compared the accuracy of zzso DNA zzso sequence analysis after zzso to that performed without zzso zzso We applied the method to a small group of cancer cases and controls and demonstrated that zzso is capable of increasing the yield of starting DNA material with identical genetic zzso 

DNA was isolated from clinical samples and sent to zzso zzso were amplified by zzso and those with no visible amplification were zzso using the Multiple zzso zzso technique of whole zzso zzso All samples were analyzed by zzso for zzso DNA sequence to compare sequence zzso of the zzso samples with respect to native zzso zzso zzso analysis was conducted to determine the level of zzso amplification for both nuclear and zzso 

In total, 19 samples were compared and the zzso rate between zzso and native zzso sequences was zzso All of the cancer associated zzso in the native zzso were detected in the zzso amplified material and zzso in the native zzso were detected with high zzso in the zzso zzso In addition to the native zzso sequence present in the sample, 13 new zzso were detected in the zzso zzso 

zzso screening of zzso amplified by zzso is zzso for the detection of cancer associated zzso Our results show the feasibility of this method for: 1) increasing the amount of DNA available for analysis, 2) recovering the identical zzso zzso 3) accurately detecting zzso point zzso associated with zzso
