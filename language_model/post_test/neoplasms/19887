zzso of packed red blood cells is common in pediatric cancer patients who receive zzso This study was done to identify characteristics of pediatric cancer patients at risk of zzso secondary to frequent zzso 

In this retrospective chart review, all pediatric cancer patients who completed chemotherapy from January 2007 to January 2012 and had an assessment of serum zzso 6 months after the end of treatment were zzso zzso zzso age, sex, type of cancer diagnosis, weight and body surface area zzso at the time of diagnosis, number of zzso total zzso volume zzso total zzso volume per body weight zzso and weight and zzso change from the time of diagnosis to the time of zzso zzso 

Of 109 eligible patients, 85 zzso received zzso Sixteen patients zzso had zzso zzso and four zzso had zzso zzso Although age, weight and zzso at cancer diagnosis, number of zzso and zzso were correlated with the level of zzso independent risk factors were zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso zzso and zzso change from the time of diagnosis to the time of zzso check zzso zzso to zzso in patients with zzso zzso zzso in zzso was correlated with reduction of zzso in follow-up zzso zzso zzso 

In addition to zzso change in zzso is an independent predictor for the degree and possibly persistence of zzso in pediatric cancer patients and should be considered in decisions to initiate zzso
