zzso zzso were generated using zzso zzso zzso from the regional zzso zzso of cancer patients by fusion to the zzso human myeloma cell zzso A total of 35 zzso using the regional zzso zzso zzso of cancer patients, resulted in hybrid growth in zzso of zzso zzso with 21 zzso zzso positive zzso 6 of which have maintained stable human zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were separated on zzso and grown for zzso days in zzso zzso zzso and fused to the zzso human myeloma cell zzso zzso zzso producing membrane zzso zzso zzso have been isolated and react to the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from 8 breast zzso patients resulted in 13 zzso positive zzso 3 of which were stable after zzso A total of zzso zzso were zzso after zzso zzso fusion with zzso hybrid growth in zzso zzso zzso hybrid zzso after zzso zzso In 8 zzso using regional zzso zzso zzso of other types of cancer, including 6 zzso using zzso from zzso melanoma patients, there were zzso zzso zzso with positive growth in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Of these, 8 clones were zzso positive and 3 stable clones all producing zzso zzso zzso were zzso The overall hybrid frequency was 43 zzso zzso fused zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 45 zzso zzso zzso A total of 21 zzso clones were identified to crude zzso of zzso tumor cell lines and stable zzso production was achieved for 6 zzso stable zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
