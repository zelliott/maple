zzso spontaneous zzso of zzso T zzso in zzso hosts is rare, despite the expression of tumor zzso that are potentially highly zzso For example, failure of the immune system to raise competent responses against established tumors expressing the human zzso zzso allows this tumor to grow in zzso zzso We show that systemic in zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso into zzso mice results in tumor zzso zzso by zzso T zzso Treatment resulted in a strong expansion and systemic zzso of zzso zzso and depended on zzso expression on host cells, as the tumor was zzso and therapy failed in zzso zzso Local zzso administration of zzso zzso is equally effective in licensing strong, systemic zzso zzso resulting in the clearance of distant tumor zzso Our data indicate that the immune response after zzso interactions can be directed toward zzso leading to the cure of established tumors merely by delivery of a zzso zzso to zzso zzso
