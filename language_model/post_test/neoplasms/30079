zzso new zzso zzso zzso zzso and 18 zzso zzso derivatives were zzso Several zzso exhibited zzso activity at the zzso level against the zzso zzso and zzso cell lines and blocked cell cycle progression in zzso similarly to zzso In addition, zzso induced zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that these molecules induce DNA zzso zzso In contrast, zzso were less active than zzso and did not block cell cycle progression in zzso Finally, zzso 4 and 46 exhibited potent zzso activity in zzso zzso cells grafted onto chick zzso zzso which was similar to zzso and zzso zzso and without significant toxicity toward chick zzso These new compounds are members of a promising new class of zzso zzso
