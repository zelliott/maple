Estimates of the probability of developing or dying from cancer, either over a lifetime or over a specified number of years, are useful summary measures of the burden of cancer in a zzso 

The authors used publicly available zzso software and new, detailed, zzso data bases that were developed in the Surveillance Research Program of the National Cancer Institute to produce risk estimates for selected major zzso among American zzso black, Chinese, zzso native zzso Japanese, white zzso zzso and Hispanic zzso 

Japanese and zzso white men had the highest lifetime risk for developing cancer zzso and zzso respectively), and the American zzso population zzso zzso had the lowest lifetime risk among men zzso Among women, white and American zzso (in zzso populations had higher lifetime risks than Japanese women, whereas American zzso zzso zzso women had the lowest zzso The zzso probabilities of developing cancer within the next 10 years among men and women age 60 years and the lifetime probabilities of dying from cancer also were reported by zzso zzso 

zzso disparities in the lifetime risk of cancer may be because of differences in cancer zzso rates, but they also may reflect differential mortality rates from causes other than the cancer of zzso Furthermore, because zzso zzso and mortality rates are used in calculating the zzso lifetime risk estimates, results must be interpreted with caution when events, such as the widespread and rapid zzso of a new screening test, are known to have influenced disease zzso
