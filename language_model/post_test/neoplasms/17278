zzso are large clusters of zzso enhancers that drive expression of genes that define cell zzso zzso understanding of the roles that zzso play in biology would be afforded by knowing the constellation of factors that constitute these zzso and by identifying zzso across the spectrum of human cell zzso We describe here the population of zzso factors, zzso zzso regulators, and zzso apparatus occupying zzso in embryonic stem cells and evidence that zzso are highly zzso We produce a catalog of zzso in a broad range of human cell types and find that zzso associate with genes that control and define the biology of these zzso Interestingly, zzso variation is especially enriched in the zzso of zzso cell zzso Furthermore, we find that cancer cells generate zzso at zzso and other genes important in tumor zzso Thus, zzso play key roles in human cell identity in health and in zzso
