zzso constitute an important class of cell zzso receptors responsible not only for zzso zzso but also for signaling zzso across the zzso zzso are involved in many biological processes such as zzso zzso zzso osteoporosis and zzso zzso thus play a key role in many severe human zzso In this review we will describe recent research and development of zzso zzso zzso for medical applications including drug design, zzso drug zzso as well as zzso zzso Many zzso have been developed for targeting the zzso zzso in order to block zzso or zzso but there are also other zzso like zzso and zzso which become more and more interesting for similar zzso zzso constitutes a potent target in zzso zzso but the search for suitable zzso is still zzso We will reconstruct the drug development process for these zzso zzso considering selected examples with focus on structure based zzso Different structural requirements are pointed out concerning zzso activity and particularly the selectivity towards the distinct zzso zzso Furthermore, we will show recent progress in tumor and zzso imaging based on zzso zzso zzso binding zzso or zzso zzso zzso further advances in zzso research are zzso We describe the coating of different implant materials with various zzso recognizing zzso for the purpose of increasing cell attachment and zzso
