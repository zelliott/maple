Evidence for heightened capacity for signal zzso in rat zzso as well as in human breast and zzso zzso cells as reflected by coordinate increases in zzso zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso sequence leading to the production of second zzso zzso and zzso is zzso The linkage of signal zzso zzso with zzso growth is also seen as zzso 435 human breast zzso or zzso zzso cells express their zzso capacity in tissue culture in the log zzso In both cases, zzso inhibit cell proliferation with a decline in zzso zzso activity and zzso levels preceding the growth zzso seen with zzso The elevated steady state activities of zzso and zzso zzso indicate a zzso zzso in signal zzso capacity of cancer cells which is zzso by zzso Since the gain in function zzso in the zzso capacity for signal zzso zzso selective growth advantage to cancer cells, increased activities of zzso and zzso zzso may be considered as sensitive targets for cancer zzso The potential of zzso as an zzso of zzso signal zzso mechanisms needs to be zzso
