The zzso zzso zzso is responsible for protein zzso In rapidly zzso tumor cells, the zzso tends to be overloaded with unfolded and zzso proteins due to high zzso zzso With the limited zzso capacity of the zzso tumor cells often suffer from more zzso stress than do normal zzso Thus, cellular stress responses to cope with zzso stress, such as the unfolded protein response zzso and zzso might be more activated in cancer cells than in normal zzso The complex signaling pathways from the zzso to zzso provide promising zzso zzso a number of zzso zzso agents are currently in development in zzso and clinical zzso In this short review we will discuss the potential zzso efficacy of zzso of cellular stress responses, especially zzso and zzso on the basis of their signaling zzso In addition, the current zzso status of the zzso agents will be zzso
