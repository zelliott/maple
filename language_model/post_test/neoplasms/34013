Cancer drugs have traditionally been identified in screens designed to produce broad biological end points such as cell zzso A serious zzso outcome of drugs discovered in these screens is that the mechanism of drug action is unknown and such drugs often have adverse side zzso zzso cancer drugs that act on specific targets offer the advantage that the mechanism of drug action can be understood and accurately monitored in clinical trials leading to development of better zzso The pharmacological industry has recently shifted to a target directed drug discovery zzso However, until recently potential cancer drug targets comprised of only a small fraction of the human zzso The human zzso project and zzso structural and functional zzso have dramatically increased the number of cancer drug zzso Deciphering cancer drug targets requires the understanding of zzso pathways that are affected in the cancer zzso It has been suggested that zzso of zzso zzso zzso will aid in identifying individuals at high risk of developing certain zzso and will also help in development of tailored medication or identify genetic profiles of specific drug action and zzso Achieving successful new cancer drug development schemes will require a merger of research disciplines that include zzso zzso comparative zzso functional zzso zzso and zzso In this review the significance and challenges of these rapidly evolving technologies in cancer drug target discovery are zzso
