DNA zzso breaks are associated with various zzso zzso such as transcription, zzso zzso and with the process of active cell death, which aims to eliminate zzso In addition, DNA zzso breaks can be induced by zzso exposure to zzso increased formation of zzso oxygen species, and, zzso during repair of other types of DNA damage or as a consequence of zzso zzso In addition to the neutral filter zzso of DNA, the recently introduced zzso gel zzso is capable of determining DNA zzso breaks with higher accuracy and sensitivity and is expected to increase our knowledge on the frequency and the role of DNA zzso Parallel determination of parameters for zzso is necessary to zzso the zzso primary zzso Although the repair of DNA zzso breaks is a complex task, cells are capable of zzso or without errors and up to a certain zzso surviving this DNA zzso Gene zzso zzso zzso and deletions arising during repair and zzso of zzso breaks may contribute to cell transformation and tumor zzso
