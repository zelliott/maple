zzso cells are characterized by abnormal segregation of zzso during zzso zzso generally considered a result of zzso originating in genetic zzso However, recent evidence supports a zzso concept that zzso of zzso (and zzso zzso zzso due to abnormalities in zzso itself is the primary cause of zzso rather than a mere zzso In normal zzso zzso replicate into sister zzso which are then precisely separated and transported into zzso sets by structural protein zzso called zzso zzso and zzso both composed of zzso The elegant yet poorly understood zzso movements and geometric organization occurring in zzso have suggested guidance by some type of organizing field, however neither electromagnetic nor chemical zzso fields have been demonstrated or shown to be zzso It is proposed here that normal zzso zzso is organized by quantum zzso and quantum entanglement among zzso zzso and zzso zzso which ensure precise, complementary zzso of daughter cell zzso and recognition of daughter cell zzso Evidence and theory supporting organized quantum states in zzso (and quantum optical properties of zzso in zzso at zzso temperature are zzso zzso of quantum zzso and/or entanglement among zzso zzso zzso and zzso can result in abnormal distribution of zzso abnormal differentiation and uncontrolled growth, and account for all aspects of zzso New approaches to cancer therapy and stem cell production are suggested via zzso zzso effects aimed at quantum optical states of zzso
