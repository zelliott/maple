Living systems use information and energy to maintain stable zzso while far from zzso zzso The underlying first principles have not been zzso 

We propose that stable zzso in living systems, in the absence of zzso zzso requires an information zzso zzso or zzso which is zzso to first order zzso zzso and death represent key feedback mechanisms that promote stability even in a zzso zzso A system moves to low or high information depending on its energy status, as the benefit of information in maintaining and increasing order is balanced against its energy zzso zzso which lack specialized zzso zzso zzso are zzso and constrained to an information zzso Acquisition of zzso is viewed as a critical evolutionary step that, by allowing zzso to achieve a sufficiently high energy state, permitted a phase transition to an information zzso This state, in contrast to the zzso zzso allowed evolution of complex, zzso zzso A special case is a zzso cell, which is modeled as a phase transition from a maximum to minimum information zzso The minimum leads to a predicted zzso governing the in zzso growth that is confirmed by studies measuring growth of small breast zzso 

We find living systems achieve a stable zzso state by maintaining an extreme level of zzso The evolutionary divergence of zzso and zzso resulted from acquisition of specialized energy zzso that allowed transition from information zzso to zzso zzso zzso represents a reverse zzso of an information maximum to zzso The progressive information loss is evident in accumulating zzso zzso zzso and functional decline characteristics of human zzso The findings suggest energy restriction is a critical first step that triggers the genetic zzso that drive zzso evolution of the zzso zzso
