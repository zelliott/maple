zzso is a method for creating artificial proteins by combining functional zzso motifs in a zzso zzso zzso are often short zzso acid sequences within natural proteins that are associated with particular biological zzso zzso also can be created de zzso using molecular zzso In particular, zzso zzso which have been isolated as specific zzso against various targets, are believed to be promising motif blocks for creating novel zzso through zzso It is now known, however, that simple zzso addition does not always work with zzso simple zzso of zzso and zzso does not always result in a zzso zzso To solve this zzso in zzso we have been employing a zzso approach, which we called zzso In zzso we prepare a library of artificial proteins that contain multiple motifs in various numbers and orders, from which clones having the desired functions are zzso In zzso a zzso is first rationally designed so that the zzso peptides contain zzso and then zzso zzso with zzso or deletion zzso at the junctions between zzso zzso Because of zzso zzso proteins translated from a single zzso zzso are zzso diverse, originating from the zzso of three reading zzso and are thus zzso zzso of three zzso By embedding functional motifs into different reading frames of a single zzso zzso zzso of functional motifs are easily zzso zzso zzso retained in the overall structure of proteins contributes to the formation of ordered structures, and enhances the chances of zzso biological zzso This method is particularly well suited for developing liaison molecules that interface between cells and zzso zzso Examples of zzso artificial proteins created from this method will be zzso
