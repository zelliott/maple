zzso are constantly challenged by zzso and thus the maintenance of zzso functionality is essential for the assurance of cellular zzso zzso carry out the vast majority of cellular functions by mostly participating in zzso protein zzso that operate as protein zzso zzso have evolved a complex zzso quality control network for the rescue, when possible, or the degradation of damaged zzso Nevertheless, despite these zzso ensuring mechanisms, new protein zzso and the zzso dilution of zzso damage in zzso cells, the gradual zzso of zzso during aging (or due to zzso results in increasingly damaged zzso zzso zzso protein modifications mostly arise by unbalanced zzso zzso and/or high zzso levels and may cause disruption of zzso as they can alter protein zzso This outcome may then increase zzso instability due to reduced zzso in processes like DNA replication or zzso zzso we present a synopsis of the major zzso zzso protein modifications and of the zzso network deregulation in zzso We propose that zzso of the zzso ensuring mechanisms in zzso cells has zzso effects, whereas considering that zzso of these mechanisms represents a hallmark of advanced tumors, their zzso provides a strategy for the development of zzso zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso zzso modifications in biology and zzso
