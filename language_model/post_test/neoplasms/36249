zzso stem cells zzso are one zzso of adult stem cells and possess a zzso potential and ability to differentiate into various zzso 

Emerging evidence suggests that zzso can zzso toward cancer stem cells zzso due to zzso of intrinsic and zzso zzso leading to zzso The zzso concept has fundamental clinical implications because of its involvement in cell zzso zzso and treatment zzso zzso targeting zzso provides a novel therapeutic strategy for cancer zzso However, the origin of zzso and its molecular connections are not fully zzso Emerging evidence suggests the existence of an zzso between zzso and zzso transition zzso zzso cells, in the context of inflammation and zzso as well as the potential role of zzso 

We suggest that targeting zzso signatures along with zzso zzso and zzso will provide a more effective therapeutic approach for the elimination of zzso To that end, zzso especially its synthetic novel analog zzso have been shown to zzso zzso characteristics along with the deregulation of multiple pathways and zzso leading to the zzso of human tumor growth in zzso suggesting the potential role of zzso as an zzso agent for the zzso of tumor zzso
