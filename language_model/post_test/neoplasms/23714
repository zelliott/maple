We comparatively investigated the zzso zzso rates zzso of overall zzso of the world between 1975 and 1985 to see whether or not any consistent change is in progress in the risk for cancer in general on a world zzso zzso obtained are summarized as zzso 1) the total male population of the world, but not the total female population, experienced a significant rise in zzso for zzso of all sites during the above 10 zzso 2) In the comparison study of geographical subgroups, the above integral cancer risk significantly increased with time in the male population of Canada, zzso zzso European continent zzso zzso and Great Britain, and also in the female populations of both zzso and Great zzso In other geographical zzso the cancer risks for 1985 were also higher than those for 1975, but the differences were not statistically zzso 3) The above increase of cancer risk in general was accounted for by a surplus in weight of the increasing contribution of zzso zzso over the decreasing contribution of zzso type zzso to the integral cancer risk of a zzso 4) Japan was found to be an exceptional case in that the risk for liver cancer (a zzso type zzso increased 3 to 8 fold from 1975 to 1985 in both male and female populations of zzso Evidence was presented to suggest that the above increase of liver cancer zzso could be related to the persistence of social tension following the first oil crisis in zzso In zzso the zzso transition patterns of cancer risk in Japan as well as in other parts of the world support our interpretation that social tension linked to the economic recession plays a crucial role in the production of recent changes of cancer risk in the zzso
