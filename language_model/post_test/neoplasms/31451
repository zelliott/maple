Cancer cells arise from an increasing genetic disarray affecting control over zzso zzso and zzso Multiple mechanisms with a multitude of players are invoked in the genetic distortion which leads to zzso progression in different zzso zzso pathology is in need of a clear, distinctive zzso of zzso samples for assessment of risk and zzso What for, and how should these two fields be zzso zzso which indicate the overall genetic disorder in cancer cells may be zzso in addition to a zzso description, to assess risk of cancer patients, in particular in cases with zzso zzso zzso However, a refinement of risk is at hand when a better evaluation of genetic zzso is zzso The status of genetic malfunctioning may also provide zzso for therapy as zzso In this editorial, the genetic zzso implicated in disturbed regulation of the zzso phase of the cell cycle by the zzso zzso zzso are considered to provide relevant information to assess risk as well as to target zzso
