zzso published risk models in a different time and setting can be a zzso zzso Data in electronic format provide the potential to test the zzso of risk models without zzso chart reviews and data zzso The authors attempted to use readily available electronic data to find appropriate cases and to validate and refine a previously developed risk model for predicting zzso in children with cancer who had fever and zzso 

By applying a largely automated zzso zzso to linked, electronic clinical and administrative data systems, the authors identified and acquired data regarding 157 episodes of fever and zzso in children with cancer admitted to a children's hospital during an zzso period in zzso The authors applied a previously developed and validated risk model for zzso to this 1997 cohort by assessing the odds ratios among risk zzso The model assigns encounters with absolute zzso count of 100 cells or zzso to a low-risk group and encounters with an absolute zzso count of less than 100 zzso to zzso zzso zzso degrees zzso or high-risk zzso or zzso zzso degrees zzso zzso In addition, the authors explored whether the new data would have generated the same zzso zzso and multivariable analyses were performed to determine whether there were additional independent zzso of zzso zzso zzso of admission absolute zzso count and temperature was used to assess whether similar zzso would be zzso 

There were 12 episodes of zzso zzso among the 157 zzso The previously developed model correctly predicted increasing rates of zzso in this 1997 zzso ranging from zzso in the low-risk group (one episode in a child with an infected central line) to zzso in the high-risk zzso The odds ratio for the high-risk versus zzso group was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso comparable to the odds ratio of zzso in the previously published derivation cohort zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso analysis of the new data revealed no independent risk factors for zzso other than admission absolute zzso count and zzso zzso zzso of absolute zzso count and temperature generated risk categories that were somewhat different from those of the original zzso The new data yielded three zzso low risk zzso zzso or zzso zzso degrees C and absolute zzso count zzso intermediate risk zzso zzso or zzso zzso degrees C and absolute zzso count zzso or zzso zzso and high risk zzso zzso degrees zzso 

zzso electronic data provide an efficient means for zzso and model validation and zzso The previously developed zzso model had good but not optimal zzso performance in the new data zzso Admission absolute zzso count and temperature remain significant risk factors for zzso zzso the risk categories, including a much lower zzso for admission absolute zzso count, improved the zzso discrimination, which suggests that zzso models need periodic zzso
