As a part of our efforts to use small organic zzso zzso zzso zzso with improved characteristics for the diagnosis and treatment of different kinds of tumor zzso zzso zzso were zzso This study reports on the in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso lung zzso zzso into zzso mice and the evaluation of their suitability as imaging agents using a single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso aromatic substitution of the zzso zzso zzso gamma camera imaging was performed in zzso zzso mice bearing an zzso tumor using a Toshiba zzso zzso camera in zzso mode equipped with a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in zzso yields of 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and 70 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of tumors induced in zzso mice by the zzso of zzso cell lung zzso zzso cells, showed a tumor zzso of zzso percent injected dose per gram zzso (3 zzso hours zzso a zzso ratio of zzso a zzso ratio of zzso and a zzso ratio of zzso at 24 hours zzso for compound zzso For compound 2' a tumor zzso of zzso zzso (3 zzso hours zzso a zzso zzso ratio of zzso a zzso ratio of zzso and a zzso ratio of zzso at 48 hours zzso was zzso zzso evaluation confirmed the results obtained from zzso 

In zzso evaluation of these zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso revealed that they do not appear suitable as zzso zzso
