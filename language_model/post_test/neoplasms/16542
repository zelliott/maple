To investigate the feasibility and zzso of the combination zzso zzso and zzso 

Patients received zzso 80 zzso on day 1, zzso 1,250 zzso on days 1 and 8, repeated every 3 weeks, and zzso (85 and 145 zzso zzso twice zzso zzso of all three agents, side effects, and zzso response were investigated in patients with solid tumors amenable to therapy with zzso 

In the first cohort of three patients entered at the 85 zzso dose, no zzso zzso were zzso In the next cohort (145 zzso three patients developed a zzso zzso After entry was restricted to patients with low zzso risk, three additional patients enrolled at 145 zzso developed a zzso zzso The dose was then reduced to 85 zzso in all patients still on the study, and three additional patients were entered on this dose zzso In 19 treated patients, eight patients developed nine zzso events (three transient zzso attacks, two cerebrovascular zzso and four deep zzso zzso The most common zzso observed were those previously reported for zzso alone zzso and zzso and for this chemotherapy regimen zzso zzso and zzso No significant zzso interaction among the three drugs was zzso Response rates were similar to those expected in the patient population selected for this zzso Analysis of variables of the zzso cascade and of vessel wall zzso was performed in three patients and showed significant increases in zzso generation and zzso cell zzso in a treatment zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso events, possibly related to the particular regimen tested in this study, discourages further investigation of this zzso
