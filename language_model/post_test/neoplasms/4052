During the past decade molecular biology and molecular zzso have greatly increased our understanding of the basic mechanisms in cancer zzso The essential outcome of these molecular studies is that cancer can be considered as a genetic disease of zzso Both the zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso forms of cancer are caused by genetic accidents that zzso the complex and delicate cellular growth control zzso Thus, at the molecular level, no principal difference exists between zzso and zzso forms of cancer and it can be stated that both at the level of the single cell as well at the level of the individual, cancer is a genetic zzso Whereas in zzso cancer, the risk gene is passed through the zzso to the next generation, in sporadic cancer, a cancer cells passes its abnormal genes to its daughter cells at cell zzso It is therefore not surprising that one of the main priorities in cancer research today is the identification of the culprit genes and characterizing the function of their normal zzso Genes associated with zzso cancer syndromes essentially zzso two classes of genes zzso tumor zzso genes and genes controlling zzso stability zzso repair zzso Although zzso zzso in these zzso genes are associated with significantly increased cancer risk, even up to zzso additional genetic factors and interaction with environmental factors eventually determine if a carrier of a zzso zzso will develop zzso
