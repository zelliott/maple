The zzso of the cells of most solid zzso in zzso preparations vary in size, shape and zzso pattern, both from normal zzso and from each zzso These features have not been explained in terms of conventional concepts of nuclear structure and theories of zzso In recent years, the unfolded zzso have been shown to occupy zzso in the nucleus during zzso providing a relatively uniform density of fine zzso zzso throughout the nucleus in the living zzso This is in contrast to the appearances of zzso zzso existing as coarse zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso as are seen in zzso zzso Additionally, the binding of zzso to nuclear zzso the possible existence of a nuclear zzso the functions of nuclear zzso and the attachments of zzso structures to the outer nuclear membrane are now zzso Studies of genetic instability of cancer cells (many random zzso are present in the zzso which vary from zzso in individual zzso have shown that this phenomenon occurs early in zzso formation, can be present in zzso cells adjacent to zzso and can result in thousands of zzso events per zzso zzso These observations form the basis for the zzso zzso selection theory of zzso which proposes that genetic instability is an essential early part of zzso zzso instability has been used to explain significant zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso among cells of individual zzso This paper proposes that a high zzso of zzso zzso of the genes for factors controlling nuclear zzso in zzso can explain zzso variations of zzso appearance of these zzso when some additional effects of zzso processing are taken into zzso
