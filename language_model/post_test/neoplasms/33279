Solid tumor therapy with zzso greatly depends on the efficiency with which drugs are delivered to tumor zzso The typical characteristics of the tumor physiology promote but also zzso zzso of zzso zzso The leaky tumor zzso allows easy passage of zzso However, the zzso zzso causes zzso blood flow, and together with the zzso zzso fluid pressure, this state results in poor zzso drug levels and failure of zzso zzso of the tumor zzso could overcome these barriers and promote drug zzso zzso the zzso has several zzso The zzso lining is readily accessible and the first to be encountered after systemic zzso Second, zzso cells tend to be more stable than tumor cells and thus less likely to develop resistance to zzso Third, targeting the tumor zzso can have dual zzso zzso manipulation of the zzso can enhance zzso chemotherapy, and zzso subsequent destruction of the zzso can help to kill the zzso In particular, tumor necrosis factor alpha is zzso Its action on solid tumors, both directly through tumor cell killing and destruction of the tumor zzso and indirectly through manipulation of the tumor zzso is zzso zzso the mechanism of zzso and agents with comparable action on solid tumors is an important focus to further develop combination zzso zzso
