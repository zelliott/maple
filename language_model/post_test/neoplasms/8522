The objective of this article was to zzso current knowledge of blood flow and oxygen supply to human tumors, parameters which go hand in hand, and in turn critically determine the cellular zzso zzso of human zzso A compilation of available data on blood flow, oxygen supply, and tissue oxygen distribution in human tumors is zzso Though data on human tumors in zzso are scarce and there may be significant errors associated with the techniques used for zzso experimental evidence is provided for the existence of a compromised and zzso blood supply to many zzso zzso to zzso tumors, zzso areas develop in human zzso which coincide with zzso and energy zzso and with a hostile zzso zzso zzso variations in these relevant parameters have to be expected between different locations within the same zzso at the same location at different times, and between individual tumors of the same grading and zzso
