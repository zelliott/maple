To zzso the clinical zzso of zzso liver zzso among cancer patients, and to determine whether there is any difference between clinical zzso among patients without zzso 

zzso zzso study with 133 patients with zzso liver zzso diagnosed during 13 zzso Patients were divided into two groups: 29 patients with zzso tumors identified during the five years prior to zzso development zzso 1) and 104 patients without zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso biological and zzso findings, zzso and zzso topography, treatment and particularly, clinical course were zzso 

zzso with portal zzso were more common in group 1 zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso Clinical and biological data were similar in both group but zzso zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso liver enlargement zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso which were more common in group zzso In the same group, the mean zzso level was also higher zzso 149 versus 60 zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso topography, as well as zzso in both groups did not differ zzso In group 1, surgical drainage was performed less frequently zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso and mortality rate was higher zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso Nevertheless, no significant differences were observed between hospital stay and zzso Among patients treated with antibiotics only, the mortality rate was higher in group 1 zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso 

In zzso liver zzso in patients with zzso tumor disease a predominance of portal zzso was zzso The presence of cancer among patients with zzso liver zzso did not imply a significantly different clinical zzso however, the clinical course was worse than that observed in cases without zzso
