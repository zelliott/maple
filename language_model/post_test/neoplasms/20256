We analyzed in detail the zzso and zzso activity as well as the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were isolated from zzso patients zzso from patients with tumors and 16 from patients after zzso and 60 strains were isolated from patient's zzso Culture zzso of strains isolated from patients after transplantation were responsible for the highest part of zzso reactions corresponding to an intermediate toxin production zzso zzso 2 and 3) and culture zzso of strains isolated from patients with tumors caused the highest percentage of zzso reactions corresponding to a strong toxin zzso Culture zzso of strains isolated from ears of patients were responsible for the highest percentage of negative zzso reactions zzso With positive zzso reaction size zzso zzso increased also the percentage of zzso as well as the intensity of zzso changes on zzso cells after 1 and 2 zzso We did not observe any relationship between a particular zzso reaction category and the most frequent zzso zzso zzso or zzso strains of the tested zzso
