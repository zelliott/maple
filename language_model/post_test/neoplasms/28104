There is evidence that one critically short zzso may be recognized as DNA damage and, as a consequence, induce a zzso and zzso zzso cell cycle checkpoint to cause zzso Additionally, zzso via a zzso and zzso mechanism can be induced by the zzso or zzso of certain zzso pathways that are involved in zzso Central to this alternative zzso mechanism is the zzso zzso which connects zzso zzso but not DNA damage, to zzso zzso and zzso We find that zzso zzso almost invariably have dysfunctional zzso and zzso and have high levels of zzso but very often express a zzso zzso Furthermore, when normal zzso zzso they show a striking zzso of zzso zzso but not of zzso or its downstream targets zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso rather than zzso is the more important gene in human zzso zzso but do not exclude a zzso role for zzso perhaps in the induction of zzso by activated zzso in zzso Regardless of zzso these results suggest that zzso zzso acts as a barrier to human cancer zzso
