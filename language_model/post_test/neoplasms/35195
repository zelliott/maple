The concept and practice of zzso for human zzso are based on the advances which have been made in detailed biological analysis of host zzso mechanisms against tumors, which have indicated a wide variety of cellular and molecular zzso zzso Among these are various zzso that can affect tumor growth and spread either directly or indirectly through host cellular zzso zzso zzso I zzso a zzso derived from activated zzso is known to induce profound biological effects in a variety of zzso and cells, generally producing a complex of responses associated with zzso It has also been shown to be essentially involved in the initiation of specific as well as zzso immune zzso Thus, although no solid evidence is yet available that zzso can produce any beneficial effects in the management of zzso zzso it seems worth considering the potential zzso of the zzso in tumor zzso In this short paper, some of the functional aspects of zzso are summarized from the viewpoint of its effects on host zzso cellular mechanisms, and the potential zzso as well as the possible problems associated with zzso in the management of zzso are zzso
