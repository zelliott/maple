zzso zzso analysis of zzso using zzso 123 (R zzso and zzso zzso zzso has made it easy to estimate cell zzso zzso zzso only dead cells, whereas R 123 accumulates in the zzso of living cells which remain zzso by zzso Therefore the combination of R 123 and zzso provides a more accurate zzso of cell viability than the conventional methods of dye zzso Cell viability has been estimated by this method in zzso cells treated with zzso in zzso The usefulness of this analysis is suggested for the evaluation of the effect of zzso drugs on tumor zzso
