The clinical efficacy of many zzso agents has been reduced due to the development of drug zzso In this article, we aimed to validate zzso a natural zzso zzso found in zzso as a potential therapeutic to overcome zzso resistance zzso zzso was found to retain its efficacy in zzso zzso zzso cells that zzso zzso zzso zzso which was similar to the efficacy observed in their parental counterparts zzso zzso A zzso zzso revealed that the zzso of zzso activity did not contribute to the zzso effect of zzso zzso caused a zzso zzso arrest by the induction of zzso and the zzso of zzso expression in zzso zzso cells, whereas no significant zzso zzso arrest was exhibited in zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, a zzso treatment with zzso induced zzso cell death in zzso zzso zzso however, zzso induced both zzso and necrosis in zzso zzso cells, as determined with flow zzso zzso More notably, zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso cells but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso is independent of the zzso of zzso 1 from zzso in zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results suggest that the zzso activity of zzso appears to be due to zzso arrest at the zzso zzso phase, with the induction of zzso in zzso zzso zzso In addition, defective zzso might contribute to zzso and zzso cell death in response to zzso in zzso zzso zzso
