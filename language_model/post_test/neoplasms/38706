Human zzso zzso were found to contain transforming growth factor zzso activity capable of stimulating zzso independent growth of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso extracts demonstrated the presence of three populations of zzso activities in 57% of zzso zzso Two activities were similar to those of zzso alpha and zzso beta as judged by their size (Mr approximately equal to 6,000 and approximately equal to 25,000, respectively), biological activity zzso to stimulate zzso independent growth of zzso zzso in the absence or presence of zzso growth factor, respectively), and capacity to competitively inhibit binding of zzso zzso growth factor to zzso zzso and zzso beta to baby zzso kidney zzso zzso In addition a third factor which zzso zzso independent growth of zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso cells was also recovered following zzso zzso zzso of extracts from several zzso positive human zzso zzso of patients with zzso and breast zzso as well as other zzso The latter zzso zzso related transforming growth factor was not present in benign or zzso negative zzso zzso zzso related zzso factor was zzso by zzso reducing agents, heat, and zzso treatment but was stable in zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso was accomplished by zzso of an zzso extract on zzso zzso followed by high performance liquid zzso with zzso zzso to yield a nearly pure protein with apparent molecular weights of 64,000 by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso when run in zzso conditions and zzso when run in reducing zzso zzso zzso related zzso was able to stimulate zzso independent growth of zzso zzso in the absence of other growth zzso It did not competitively inhibit binding of zzso zzso growth factor, zzso zzso or zzso zzso derived growth zzso zzso this factor isolated from human zzso zzso may be distinct from previously described transforming growth zzso zzso these observations indicate that human zzso zzso contain a zzso of transforming growth zzso It is possible that the zzso zzso related transforming growth factors play a role or reflect the zzso growth properties of various zzso
