Vitamin E zzso zzso zzso in cell zzso prevents zzso damage to DNA by scavenging free zzso and reduces zzso zzso No study to our knowledge, however, has examined the association between genetic zzso and response to long-term vitamin E zzso We conducted a zzso association study zzso of common zzso associated with circulating zzso zzso following 3 y of controlled zzso The study population included zzso middle-aged, male smokers in the zzso zzso Cancer Prevention Study cohort who received a trial supplementation of zzso zzso zzso and had zzso serum zzso zzso measured after 3 zzso zzso zzso were zzso for statistical analysis and general linear models adjusted for age, zzso serum total cholesterol, and cancer case zzso zzso with serum response to zzso supplementation achieved zzso significance for 2 single zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and approached zzso significance for one zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso explain zzso of the residual zzso in serum zzso zzso during controlled vitamin E zzso A zzso has identified 3 genetic zzso at different zzso that appear associated with serum zzso after vitamin E supplementation in zzso zzso genetic zzso that influence serum zzso zzso status zzso zzso under supplementation conditions improves our understanding of the biological zzso of these nutritional zzso and their associations with cancer zzso
