Although the zzso provides information about the zzso genetic changes existing in the tissue and zzso pathology, it is the proteins that do the work of the cell and are functionally responsible for almost all disease zzso Moreover, many diseases such as cancer are a manifestation of zzso cellular protein molecular networks and zzso zzso These pathways contain a large and growing collection of drug targets, governing cellular survival, zzso invasion, and cell zzso Thus, the promise of zzso resides in the study of molecules that extend beyond correlation to zzso The clinical utility of reverse phase protein zzso a new technology invented in our laboratory, lies in its ability to generate a functional map of known zzso networks or pathways for an individual patient obtained directly from a biopsy zzso This zzso circuit zzso provides key information that identifies critical zzso or pathways that may serve as drug targets for individualized or zzso therapy through the zzso of zzso states of zzso Using this technique, the entire cellular zzso is immobilized on a zzso with subsequent zzso of the zzso or zzso state of zzso zzso The results of which pathways are zzso zzso can then be correlated with biological and clinical information and serve as both a diagnostic and a therapeutic zzso thus providing a zzso zzso
