Compared with normal cells, tumor cell lines exhibit an unusual plasma membrane zzso of heat shock protein 70 zzso This zzso zzso membrane expression has been found to correlate with an increased sensitivity to zzso zzso by human natural killer zzso cells that zzso adhere to plastic following zzso zzso A human zzso zzso zzso zzso detects zzso zzso on viable tumor cells and blocks the immune response of zzso cells against zzso tumor zzso By zzso scanning zzso analysis, the zzso of this zzso was mapped as the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso Most interestingly, similar to full-length zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to stimulate the zzso and zzso activity of zzso cells at zzso equivalent to full-length zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that an excess of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso cells similar to that of zzso zzso In comparison, other zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso failed to activate zzso zzso
