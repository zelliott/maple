zzso acid zzso is a zzso present zzso zzso involved in diverse cellular processes such as cell migration, proliferation and zzso zzso acts as an zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso via different zzso zzso receptors zzso that trigger a broad range of zzso zzso zzso especially the zzso zzso zzso evidence suggests a crucial role of the zzso in cancer cell zzso and promising studies are zzso to investigate the therapeutic potential of zzso This review zzso current knowledge on how zzso promotes zzso zzso to enhance the migratory and invasive properties of cells, which may ultimately contribute to cancer zzso Furthermore, we provide comprehensive zzso analyses of published zzso of more than 350 normal zzso and more than zzso zzso zzso to define the expression signatures of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso member 1 zzso These analyses demonstrate that zzso is highly expressed in a variety of zzso and zzso whereas zzso is almost exclusively zzso in highly aggressive Ewing's zzso which underscores the potential contribution of zzso in zzso zzso In addition, these analyses show that different cancer entities display distinct expression signatures of zzso that distinguish them from one zzso Finally, we discuss current approaches to specifically target the zzso circuits in experimental cancer zzso
