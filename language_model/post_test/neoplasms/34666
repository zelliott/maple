The goal of radiation therapy is to eradicate tumor stem cells while sparing healthy zzso zzso the first aim must be to delineate tumor from healthy zzso Advanced imaging techniques will enable one to reduce the uncertainty of microscopic extension of zzso Ultimately, advanced functional imaging systems correlated with zzso pathological specimens will allow one to delineate disease extent from normal tissue at the tumor zzso When it is not possible to determine the zzso margin with reasonable zzso the margins must remain generous and zzso avoidance methodology could and should be deployed to spare critical normal zzso Of equal importance to defining the zzso is the need to guarantee that this target is indeed zzso For this purpose, image guidance using a variety of systems including portal images, ultrasound devices, and CT scanners at the time of treatment has been zzso Some zzso methods, portal images for instance, are more amenable for use with rigid structures such as encountered in the zzso whereas others like ultrasound or CT scanners are able to account for zzso setup zzso Several strategies for preventing organ motion from degrading the precision that zzso offers have been zzso In particular, a CT scan at the time of treatment delivery can also be used as the basis to reconstruct the dose received by the zzso zzso reconstruction will allow the dose just delivered to be superimposed on the zzso CT scan and will allow one to compare the reconstructed delivered dose distribution with the planned dose distribution to assess discrepancies between zzso Furthermore, reconstruction of the delivered dose zzso holds the promise of allowing one to accumulate dose delivered to the tumor and normal structures on a fraction per fraction zzso This will ultimately allow for the determination of zzso tumor control probabilities and normal tissue complication zzso
