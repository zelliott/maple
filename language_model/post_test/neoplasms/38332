Since DNA is prone to zzso attack cells have evolved multiple protective strategies to prevent the deleterious effects of DNA zzso Base zzso repair is the major mechanism for repair of DNA base damage by zzso oxygen species but recent evidence indicate that zzso zzso repair zzso that are zzso in human zzso are involved zzso The mechanisms of repair dealing with the direct zzso of DNA will be reviewed taking as zzso the oxidized base zzso The function of the individual repair components as zzso from model mice indicate that the zzso of two gene functions is mostly required to lead to zzso of zzso DNA damage, zzso and cancer zzso The recent identification of human diseases associated with zzso in zzso damage repair show that defects in this zzso may lead to increased cancer but their major zzso role seems to be in neurological zzso
