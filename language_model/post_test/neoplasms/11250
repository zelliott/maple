The value of the zzso zzso test in combination with the clinical zzso probability zzso has not been evaluated in cancer patients with suspected deep vein zzso zzso whereas this group of patients usually accounts for zzso of clinically suspected zzso 

A cohort of zzso consecutive patients with clinically suspected zzso was zzso Patients were judged to be positive or negative for zzso according to the outcomes of serial zzso ultrasound and a zzso follow-up period with imaging test zzso of the symptomatic zzso zzso accuracy zzso of the zzso test according to the zzso score were assessed in patients with and without zzso 

Of the zzso zzso zzso were known to have cancer at zzso A zzso zzso event was diagnosed in zzso of the patients with cancer and in zzso of the patients without zzso Among the cancer patients, zzso were considered to have a low zzso zzso a moderate and zzso a high zzso The negative zzso value zzso of the zzso test was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso among cancer patients with low zzso or zzso zzso In the absence of zzso the corresponding zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The specificity of the zzso test progressively decreased moving from the low to the higher zzso 

In cancer patients with clinically suspected zzso a negative zzso might be useful in excluding the diagnosis within the low or zzso zzso zzso More studies are warranted to confirm these zzso
