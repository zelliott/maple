Members of the beta 1 zzso of zzso contribute to cell zzso zzso organization and signal zzso zzso In some transformed cell lines and tumors, a correlation has been established between the level of expression of the alpha zzso 1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso In other instances, normal and zzso tissue differ in beta 1 zzso expression or zzso zzso The level of expression of beta 1 zzso in tumor cells may affect tumor growth properties in several ways, zzso zzso effects on zzso dependence of zzso zzso direct signaling zzso zzso organization of the zzso zzso and presentation of zzso bound growth zzso zzso effects on the functions of host defense zzso Thus the interplay between zzso expression and tumor behavior is complex and might be viewed as a series of interactive feedback zzso rather than in terms of a straightforward cause and effect zzso
