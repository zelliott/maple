Within the last decade, a substantial amount of attention has been devoted to zzso research on the association between exposure to fallout zzso from the zzso accident and zzso late effects zzso among zzso A majority of the studies completed to date have been of the descriptive type, which only correlate average population exposure with average rate of cancer zzso as a function of calendar zzso Since individual zzso is not performed in descriptive studies, it is unclear whether exposure precedes the development of cancer and a final decision cannot be made regarding the association between radiation exposure and zzso This paper reviews the background epidemiology and outlines an zzso study design that is needed to clarify the unclear association between zzso fallout exposure and childhood zzso We discuss the essential elements of an zzso zzso design such as genetic zzso vital statistics, sample size and power zzso zzso of cases and controls, and zzso dose modeling to establish individual zzso Examples such as zzso zzso medical radiation zzso and zzso characterization of leukemia to minimize exposure and diagnostic zzso are zzso We recommend the zzso methods described in this paper for studying the role of zzso zzso and development of childhood zzso
