Stem cells have been shown to exist in a variety of zzso Recent studies have characterized stem cell gene expression patterns, zzso and potential therapeutic zzso One of the most important properties of stem cells is that of self zzso This raises the possibility that some of the clinical properties of human tumors may be due to transformed stem zzso Similar signaling pathways may regulate self renewal in normal and transformed stem zzso These rare transformed stem cells may drive the process of zzso due to their potential for self zzso There are important ramifications for clinical cancer treatment if the growth of solid tumors is at least partially dependent on a cancer stem cell zzso In the cancer stem cell model, tumor recurrence may be due to the zzso stem cell compartment zzso the zzso If cancer stem cells can be zzso identified and isolated, it should be possible to identify therapies that will selectively target these zzso
