In this paper, we investigated the fluorescent properties of gold zzso zzso with several tens of zzso by ensemble zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso zzso and zzso zzso We observed that zzso zzso by the zzso reduction of zzso acid possessed certain fluorescence, narrow full zzso at zzso (17 zzso and with an increase of particle sizes, the zzso intensity showed a gradual increase while the zzso wavelength remained almost constant (at 610 zzso zzso the zzso of zzso possessed the excellent behavior of zzso under strong light zzso Despite their low quantum yields, zzso exhibited strong native zzso under relatively high zzso zzso The zzso of zzso could be characterized by zzso imaging and zzso at the single particle zzso On the basis of this excellent zzso of zzso and easy zzso of cellular zzso we developed a new method for imaging of cells using zzso as fluorescent zzso The principle of this method is that after cells stained with zzso or zzso zzso are illuminated by strong light, the cellular zzso are zzso and the zzso of zzso on cell membrane or inside cells can be collected for cell zzso On the basis of this principle, we zzso living zzso cells using zzso as fluorescent zzso and obtained good cell images by zzso of cellular zzso Furthermore, zzso were successfully used as targeted zzso for zzso imaging of cancer zzso Our preliminary results demonstrated that zzso possessed excellent behaviors of zzso and were good fluorescent zzso in cell zzso Our cellular imaging method described has potential applications in cancer zzso studies, and zzso
