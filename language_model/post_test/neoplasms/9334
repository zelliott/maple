zzso switching is often used to improve the zzso response in patients with cancer experiencing poor analgesia or adverse zzso When switching between drugs with delayed effect because of zzso or type of delivery, concerns exist about the correct timing of introducing the second drug after stopping the previous zzso The aim of this study was to assess zzso changes of zzso and zzso underlying the clinical events occurring during zzso zzso zzso patients with cancer receiving zzso zzso with uncontrolled pain and/or moderate to severe zzso adverse effects, were switched to oral zzso using an initial fixed ratio of zzso zzso patches were removed and the first of three daily doses of zzso was started zzso Blood samples were obtained at intervals after removing the zzso patch, and at zzso intervals for the first 25 zzso The intensity of pain and the adverse effects were assessed before zzso the day after, and then daily up to dose zzso A successful switch was considered when the intensity of pain and distress score decreased at least of zzso of the zzso value recorded before the switch, within a reasonable period of zzso Complete blood samples were obtained in 16 zzso zzso plasma concentration increased from 2 to 245 zzso and zzso plasma concentration decreased from 15 to 8 zzso 25 hours zzso A successful switch was determined the day after in 7 patients, while 4 patients did not respond favorably zzso zzso zzso Five patients were considered too terminal for an appropriate zzso No differences in plasma concentration pattern of the two zzso were found between patients considered zzso and zzso zzso ratios between zzso at time of stabilization did not significantly change in comparison with the initial conversion ratio zzso Starting zzso soon after removing zzso patches results in a rapid increase of zzso zzso while the zzso of zzso zzso is reached after 25 zzso As a result, the rapid achievement of a clinical effect is obtained avoiding zzso therapeutic holes in patients with a clinical condition, mainly characterized by poor pain control and severe adverse effects, requiring an immediate zzso
