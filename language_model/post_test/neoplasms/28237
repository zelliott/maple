To conduct a comprehensive review of the health services literature to search for evidence that hospital or physician volume or specialty affects the outcome of cancer zzso 

We reviewed the 1988 to 1999 zzso literature that considered the hypothesis that higher volume or specialization equals better outcome in processes or outcomes of cancer zzso 

An extensive, consistent literature that supported a zzso relationship was found for zzso treated with technologically complex surgical procedures, zzso most zzso and lung zzso These studies predominantly measured zzso or 30-day mortality and used the hospital as the unit of zzso For cancer primarily treated with low-risk surgery, there were fewer zzso An association with hospital and surgeon volume in colon cancer varied with the volume zzso For breast cancer, British studies found that physician specialty and volume were associated with improved long-term zzso and the single American report showed an association between hospital volume of initial surgery and better zzso zzso Studies of zzso zzso principally zzso and zzso cancer, were few but consistently showed better long-term outcomes associated with larger hospital volume or specialty zzso Studies in zzso or zzso cancer were zzso Across studies, the absolute benefit from care at high-volume centers exceeds the benefit from zzso zzso 

Although these reports are all retrospective, rely on zzso with dated data, rarely have zzso zzso and may have publication and self-interest zzso most support a positive zzso relationship in initial cancer zzso Given the public fear of cancer, its zzso first zzso and the zzso zzso actual cancer care should and can be zzso measured, zzso and zzso The literature suggests that, for all forms of cancer, efforts to concentrate its initial care would be zzso
