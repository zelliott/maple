zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso a novel zzso analogue in which zzso is zzso attached to the zzso of zzso zzso have been investigated with zzso zzso in zzso the isolated zzso rat liver zzso model, zzso normal rats, zzso rats bearing the HSN zzso zzso zzso nude mice zzso with the human zzso zzso and zzso urine from zzso zzso The administration of zzso zzso results in the formation of small amounts of zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso in combination with zzso a natural zzso zzso zzso suggest competitive binding of zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The data obtained in zzso rats also demonstrated an extremely low zzso of zzso zzso into zzso and zzso the well-known major zzso of zzso zzso A comparison of zzso extracts from rats bearing the HSN zzso zzso treated with zzso or zzso zzso showed the incorporation of zzso into zzso in rats treated with zzso but not in rats treated with zzso zzso zzso the incorporation of zzso into zzso was observed in the liver from rats treated with zzso zzso zzso In a human zzso zzso to nude mice, both the zzso zzso and zzso contents of the zzso were markedly higher than in the corresponding liver, suggesting a zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso The metabolism of zzso zzso was also extremely low in zzso zzso In conclusion, the present study shows the value of zzso for demonstrating for the first time that zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso although very poorly zzso
