Recent large-scale sequencing studies have revealed that cancer zzso contain variable numbers of zzso point zzso distributed across many zzso These zzso zzso most likely include passenger zzso that are not cancer causing and zzso driver zzso in cancer zzso zzso a significant presence of driver zzso in such data sets is of biological zzso Whereas current techniques from zzso are zzso to large data sets composed of zzso zzso samples, recently exemplified with a zzso zzso database, methods for smaller data sets containing individual samples with multiple zzso need to be zzso By constructing distinct models of both the zzso process and selection pressure upon the cancer samples, exact statistical tests to examine this problem are zzso Tests to examine the significance of selection toward zzso nonsense, and zzso site zzso are zzso along with tests assessing variation in selection between functional zzso zzso methods facilitate zzso zzso including levels of selection pressure and minimum numbers of zzso zzso These methods are illustrated with 25 breast zzso screened across the coding sequences of 518 zzso zzso revealing 90 base zzso in 71 zzso zzso selection pressure upon zzso zzso was zzso Furthermore, an estimated minimum of zzso zzso were zzso
