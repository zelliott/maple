Every cellular process is likely to be regulated by zzso zzso and an zzso expression signature of these small zzso zzso is a hallmark of several diseases, including zzso zzso expression profiling by zzso techniques has provided a powerful tool to reveal the involvement of these tiny molecules in tumor development and zzso showing that they are zzso expressed in tumors as compared to normal zzso Moreover, specific zzso signatures have been associated with zzso and clinical features, suggesting a potential role of these molecules as zzso and zzso zzso Focusing then on their biological effects and role in cancer, it has been shown that zzso can function as potential zzso or zzso zzso depending on the cellular context and on the target genes they zzso The possibility to zzso zzso expression either in zzso and in zzso by developing synthetic zzso molecules or zzso zzso have at the same time provided a powerful tool to a deeper comprehension of the molecular mechanisms regulated by these zzso and suggested the intriguing and promising perspective of their possible use in zzso zzso we review our current knowledge about the involvement of zzso in cancer, and their potential as zzso zzso and therapeutic zzso
