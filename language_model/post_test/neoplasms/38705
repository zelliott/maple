Cancer is primarily a zzso genetic disease resulting from the zzso of several zzso zzso in a cell zzso The evolution of highly zzso zzso has been used as a model for the evolution of a cancer zzso The properties of zzso between one set of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso highly zzso zzso were analyzed to differentiate between zzso and zzso models of this zzso In this case and in some other cases where sufficient data are available, it appears that the zzso in the evolution of highly zzso zzso are not zzso indicating that they were not formed in a purely zzso zzso Furthermore, analysis of zzso zzso rates indicates that there is a high rate of zzso in zzso replication such that the evolution of highly zzso zzso could be zzso Other evidence is mentioned suggesting that zzso in general is at least partially zzso although zzso mechanisms are involved that are different from those involved in the evolution of highly zzso zzso
