The role of zzso in cancer has recently zzso both considerable interest and zzso It is becoming clear that some zzso zzso important tumor zzso thereby zzso on their zzso Human zzso for instance, has been shown to zzso zzso in zzso zzso and growing evidence indicates that it also performs this activity in zzso Since zzso of zzso zzso with a decreased zzso zzso function, it is conceivable that zzso zzso could lead to improved tumor zzso There are, however, still many open questions zzso for example, whether zzso zzso those zzso zzso in zzso that are critical for its zzso zzso observations also suggest that zzso zzso of zzso can also take place indirectly through changes in cellular processes zzso zzso function and zzso zzso known to affect zzso It also remains unclear whether depletion in the activity of a single zzso zzso to stabilize and activate zzso substantially or additional changes in other factors (including other zzso are zzso Finally, data from zzso mice demonstrate that sustained depletion of zzso can give rise to zzso instability and that, therefore, zzso acts as a tumor zzso This observation implies that the safety of therapeutic interventions based on zzso zzso need to be zzso Here we review and examine the available data on the regulation of zzso by zzso and on the changes in zzso function in tumor cells, and discuss whether pharmacological zzso of zzso activity constitutes an adequate approach for cancer zzso
