The heightened interest in the development of novel zzso drugs that trigger zzso death in cancer cells stems from the fact that immediately upon execution of the death zzso the corpse is efficiently removed via specific recruitment of zzso zzso This prevents spilling of cellular contents and the associated inflammatory response, a likely scenario during zzso zzso Recent evidence has established that zzso removal of zzso cells is a function of zzso interaction, zzso the zzso for the scavenger zzso of zzso cells zzso specifically expressed on zzso zzso zzso by zzso enhancing this zzso interaction could be an alternate means for removing unwanted zzso Here we present a provocative hypothesis that zzso the need for zzso zzso in cancer zzso According to our model, cancer cells need not die in order to be removed by scavenger cells, but could still be effectively zzso provided the cell surface expression of specific molecules that strongly engage zzso cells is sufficiently zzso In other words, inducing the expression of zzso zzso signals on cancer cells could be a novel approach to zzso zzso these unwanted cells without the zzso effects of zzso zzso
