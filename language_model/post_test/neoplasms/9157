To zzso evaluate the zzso zzso IX zzso zzso expression on zzso cases of tumors and normal zzso from various zzso 

zzso evaluation of the expression of CA IX was performed on 1,125 zzso tumors, 69 benign zzso and zzso normal zzso on tissue zzso sections and 18 zzso zzso zzso and 17 zzso zzso zzso on routine zzso 

There was zzso of CA IX in clear cell zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso Twenty-six zzso of 29 zzso were zzso In contrast, only 5 zzso of 34 zzso were zzso zzso No zzso was seen in zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of the breast, zzso or zzso All normal zzso zzso except one case showed no zzso 

These data demonstrate the diagnostic utility of CA IX in zzso zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso distinguishing zzso zzso from normal zzso zzso in small samples, zzso separating zzso from zzso and zzso identifying zzso zzso from other zzso with clear cell zzso
