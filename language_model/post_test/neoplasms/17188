zzso zzso data are needed on the zzso of cancer in children born after assisted zzso 

We linked data on all children born in Britain between 1992 and 2008 after assisted conception without donor involvement with data from the United Kingdom National zzso of Childhood zzso to determine the number of children in whom cancer developed before 15 years of zzso zzso cancer rates were compared with zzso rates in Britain over the same period, with zzso for potential zzso and zzso factors, including sex, age at diagnosis, birth weight, singleton versus multiple birth, parity, parental age, type of assisted zzso and cause of parental zzso 

The cohort consisted of zzso children born after assisted conception zzso zzso of zzso The average duration of follow-up was zzso zzso Overall, 108 zzso were identified, as compared with zzso expected zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Assisted conception was not associated with an increased risk of zzso zzso zzso central nervous system tumors, or zzso or zzso zzso It was associated with an increased risk of zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso absolute excess risk, zzso cases per 1 million zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso absolute excess risk, zzso cases per 1 million zzso with zzso developing in 6 children and zzso in 10 zzso The excess risk of zzso was associated with low birth zzso 

There was no increase in the overall risk of cancer among British children born after assisted conception during the 17-year study zzso Increased risks of zzso and zzso were zzso but the absolute risks were zzso zzso by Cancer Research UK and zzso
