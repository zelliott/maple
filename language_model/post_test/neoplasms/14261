Cancer and cardiovascular disease remain the two leading causes of death in the United zzso Progress in treatment to reduce morbidity and mortality will include the development of new zzso Recent advances in induced zzso stem cell technology, tissue engineering, and zzso techniques have created a unique opportunity to develop three-dimensional zzso zzso systems that more accurately reflect in zzso human biology when compared with two-dimensional flat systems or animal zzso Our group is working to develop zzso zzso systems using induced zzso stem cell technology that simulates the zzso the cardiac muscle, and the solid zzso and then to combine these systems into an integrated zzso system that simulates zzso cardiac muscle and solid tumor on a single zzso The platform will be initially validated to predict zzso efficacy while minimizing cardiac muscle zzso A critical feature will be blood flow through a human zzso zzso and larger zzso which is necessary to overcome diffusion limitations of nutrients and waste products in realistic zzso cultures, and serves to integrate multiple organ zzso This is a necessary and critical feature of any platform that seeks to simulate integrated human organ zzso The results of our project should produce a new paradigm for efficient and accurate drug and toxicity zzso initially for zzso drugs with minimal cardiac side effects, and a platform technology that can be eventually used to integrate multiple major organ systems of the human zzso
