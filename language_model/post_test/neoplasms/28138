To describe the cancer pattern in a cohort of commercial pilots by follow up through the zzso Cancer zzso 

This is a retrospective cohort study of zzso pilots with emphasis on zzso working for an airline operating on international zzso A zzso file of the cohort was record linked to the Cancer zzso by making use of personal identification zzso zzso numbers of cancer cases were calculated on the basis of number of zzso and zzso of cancer at specific sites for men provided by the Cancer zzso Numbers of separate analyses were made according to different exposure zzso 

The zzso zzso ratio zzso for all zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the total cohort and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso among those operating on international zzso The zzso for zzso melanoma of the skin was zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the total cohort and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in the restricted zzso zzso according to number of zzso and radiation dose showed that zzso zzso were found in the zzso with highest exposure estimates, the zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso was zzso for zzso melanoma among those who had been flying over five time zzso 

The study shows a high occurrence of zzso melanoma among zzso It is open to discussion what role exposure of zzso radiation, numbers of zzso zzso or lifestyle zzso as possible excessive zzso in the zzso of cancer among zzso This calls for further and more powerful zzso The excess of zzso melanoma among those flying over five time zones suggests that the importance of zzso of the zzso rhythm should be taken into consideration in future zzso
