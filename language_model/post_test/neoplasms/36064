zzso zzso zzso a key zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso and zzso zzso is expressed in all cells throughout the body, but a significant percentage of human tumors have lost zzso zzso thereby making zzso a potential therapeutic zzso Here, we have tested an zzso strategy based on the idea that zzso cells can be protected from toxic zzso and zzso zzso by addition of zzso but zzso tumor cells zzso zzso of as little as 10 zzso zzso could entirely protect zzso zzso zzso , but not zzso zzso , zzso cells from toxicity caused by the chemotherapy agents zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso studies showed that zzso protection requires functional zzso zzso zzso of zzso protected both zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells from zzso and zzso consistent with the idea that zzso produced from the zzso reaction competes with zzso and zzso for a rate limiting pool of zzso zzso which is required for the conversion of zzso and zzso bases into zzso zzso zzso can also protect mouse zzso cells from killing by zzso or the drug zzso in an zzso zzso In addition, zzso can protect zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso from zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest that the addition of zzso to zzso chemotherapy may greatly increase the therapeutic index of this class of drugs if used specifically to treat zzso zzso zzso
