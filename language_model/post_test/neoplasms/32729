zzso cells, and the tight junctions between them, form a polarized barrier between zzso and zzso fluid compartments and segregate zzso growth factors from their zzso zzso zzso of this barrier should allow access of growth factors in the zzso fluid to their receptors on the zzso cell zzso as recently demonstrated for zzso and zzso receptors in airway zzso It should also allow zzso growth factors to access the zzso This property may have zzso value for zzso zzso in general, as an elegant response to injury, but may also promote cancer formation in zzso zzso zzso in which the tight junctions have become chronically leaky to growth zzso
