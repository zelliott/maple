The landmark papers published by Judah zzso in the early 1970s on tumor zzso and therapeutic implications promoted the rapid development of a very dynamic field where basic scientists, zzso and pharmaceutical industry joined forces to determine the molecular mechanisms in blood vessel formation and find means to exploit this knowledge in suppressing tumor zzso and zzso A wealth of information has been collected on zzso growth factors, and in 2004 the first specific blood zzso cancer therapy was zzso a zzso zzso against vascular zzso growth factor zzso Now zzso we know that suppression of tumor zzso may be a double-edged sword and that the therapy needs to be further refined and zzso This review describes the hallmarks of tumor vessels, how different zzso growth factors exert their function, and the perspectives for future development of zzso zzso
