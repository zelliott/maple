The primary aim of this study was to find whether any association exists between serum levels of zzso zzso mainly zzso and the most important comprehensive geriatric assessment zzso variables such as functional status, cognitive functions and nutrition in a population of elderly cancer zzso The secondary aims were to find whether any difference existed between: zzso age groups, zzso performance status scores, zzso patients who had lost weight versus those who had zzso zzso elderly patients with advanced cancer were included in the study zzso III zzso and stage IV zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso were significantly higher in elderly than in the other adult cancer zzso Among the zzso variables investigated, the most affected were functional status assessed by zzso cognitive functions by zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was shown to be significantly associated with all the dimensions of zzso zzso poor zzso zzso corresponded to severe zzso As for the relationship of serum zzso with zzso zzso the strongest correlations were between zzso and functional status assessed by both Katz zzso zzso zzso zzso and nutrition zzso Moreover, we observed an association, although not statistically zzso between functional disability zzso and zzso and high zzso levels in individuals with weight zzso zzso levels seem to be independently associated with all zzso variables investigated in the present study in a population of elderly cancer zzso Because the most important zzso zzso in particular functional status, have been observed to be strongly associated with survival, the present study, confirming our previously reported ones, suggests that zzso may be a reliable marker of disease outcome and supports the feasibility of using zzso as a sensitive outcome marker in studies based on novel approaches aiming at zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
