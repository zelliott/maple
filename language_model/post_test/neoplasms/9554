Global survival rate was zzso at 1 zzso zzso at 3 zzso zzso at 5 zzso and zzso at 10 zzso and was similar zzso zzso zzso to that of patients transplanted for other zzso zzso at 1 zzso zzso at 3 zzso zzso at 5 zzso and zzso at 10 zzso zzso of alcohol consumption was observed in 37 patients zzso De zzso cancer occurred in 35 patients after zzso zzso zzso analysis disclosed that male zzso history of smoking, and de zzso zzso were significant survival zzso factors zzso zzso zzso
