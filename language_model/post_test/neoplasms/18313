Despite numerous case reports suggesting the value of zzso zzso zzso in the treatment of zzso only a few clinical trials have been able to support zzso The reason for this could lie in the lack of understanding of the zzso of zzso receptors in the airways and the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In the present study, we compared two different methods of zzso zzso the zzso Control Treatment zzso zzso and the zzso Control Treatment zzso zzso zzso The first method delivers relatively large zzso particles zzso zzso to the zzso tree and zzso In the zzso method, small zzso particles zzso mostly reach the zzso Ten patients with cancer were randomly assigned to either the zzso or zzso inhalation of 5 zzso zzso zzso Patients using the zzso method zzso a zzso dose in zzso minutes, whereas with the zzso method, the inhalation time was zzso zzso The areas under the curve of zzso and zzso were several times higher after zzso than after zzso The proportion of zzso to zzso zzso was, on average, close to one for both zzso From the same amount of zzso in the zzso method, five times more zzso was zzso In both methods, the time to maximum concentration for zzso zzso was zzso minutes, much shorter than expected from zzso zzso or intravenous zzso The study shows that the method of inhalation may have a profound effect on the zzso of zzso It is possible that the lungs metabolize zzso to zzso themselves and in different proportions from those seen after systemic zzso The zzso method was found to be potentially superior to the zzso method in local action in the zzso
