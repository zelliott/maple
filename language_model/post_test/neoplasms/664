Several families of protein zzso orchestrate the complex events that drive the cell cycle, and their activity is frequently zzso in zzso cancer zzso Although several molecules that inhibit cell cycle zzso have been developed and clinically screened as potential zzso agents, none of these has been approved for commercial use and an effective strategy to specifically control zzso cell proliferation has yet to be zzso However, recent genetic and zzso studies have provided information about the requirement for certain cell cycle zzso by specific zzso and specialized tissue zzso Here, we discuss the potential and limitations of established cell cycle zzso as targets in zzso drug discovery as well as novel strategies for the design of new zzso
