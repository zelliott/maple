zzso zzso zzso after zzso to an analogue of zzso was shown to inhibit the activity of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso the rate limiting zzso in de zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which is involved in the zzso cycle and respiratory zzso zzso exhibits strong zzso effects due to growth zzso and due to induction of zzso and zzso zzso is ascribed to the zzso of zzso because cell death can be blocked by restoring zzso zzso metabolism by the addition of zzso It is shown here, however, that also zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso become zzso by zzso whereas the expression level of the zzso enforcing gene zzso zzso Even though zzso growth zzso still allows zzso to induce zzso zzso cell cycle block and cell contact zzso prevent cell death, it strongly suggests that zzso zzso a type of zzso zzso At high zzso zzso zzso DNA double strand breaks by yet to be determined mechanisms that occur hours before necrosis can be zzso This is accompanied by a dramatic decrease of zzso zzso The artificial restoration of zzso by addition of zzso or sufficient provision of an energy source such as zzso prevents zzso necrosis and favors zzso This observation may be of clinical zzso
