The complement system is a powerful innate mechanism involved in protection of the host against zzso It also has a role in the clearance of zzso cells and has been implicated in a range of zzso including zzso and graft zzso The control of complement is zzso through the complement regulatory proteins zzso These are present on most cells and protect normal cells from zzso attack during innate zzso However, in a range of zzso and cancer, these molecules are up or down zzso sometimes zzso and even zzso We will review the expression of zzso in cancer, zzso on zzso and highlight other roles of the zzso and their involvement in zzso zzso We will also provide some data providing a potential mechanism by which soluble zzso can inhibit zzso function and discuss some of the implications of this zzso
