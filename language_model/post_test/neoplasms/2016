An zzso method has been developed to detect zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso specimens of tumors and of normal zzso A rabbit zzso zzso against zzso was used that did not zzso with zzso either under zzso conditions or at the high zzso zzso used in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso layer of normal skin and in zzso of 34 samples of zzso cell zzso but in only one of six breast zzso and none of 15 other zzso It was also detected in four of four samples of zzso cortical zzso and two of two of melanoma, both of which can be associated with zzso and three of three small cell zzso of the zzso zzso detection of zzso could be useful in the diagnosis of tumors of zzso cell origin, particularly in the zzso differentiation of lung zzso where it may be of value in distinguishing between zzso cell and small cell zzso on the one hand and poorly differentiated zzso on the zzso
