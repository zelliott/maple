For selection of patients who will benefit from targeted therapies, identification of zzso zzso of treatment response is zzso zzso of the targeted zzso becomes apparent by protein zzso zzso of this phenomenon is therefore considered a promising zzso zzso To date, however, it is unclear whether routinely collected tissue specimens allow determination of zzso zzso zzso 

To investigate whether routinely collected tissue specimens retain the true zzso states of a zzso zzso we compared protein zzso states between matched zzso samples that were subjected to different zzso times by zzso The influence of zzso fixation and zzso on zzso states was investigated by comparison of matched fresh frozen and zzso zzso surgical specimens as well as small zzso We show that zzso influences protein zzso in a zzso unpredictable zzso zzso fixation and zzso lead to a decrease in zzso protein zzso in larger surgical zzso but not in small zzso 

zzso of protein zzso using routinely collected surgical specimens results in zzso which do not reflect a zzso true states of zzso zzso zzso measurement of zzso zzso requires that tissue collection procedures are tightly controlled, avoiding zzso and zzso zzso
