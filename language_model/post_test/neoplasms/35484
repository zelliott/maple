Patients with zzso advanced cancer continue to be referred late or not at all for hospice or zzso zzso We conducted a retrospective cohort study to determine whether evidence of cancer progression is an independent predictor of short-term mortality in acutely symptomatic cancer zzso 

We reviewed the records of zzso patients who visited the emergency center at a comprehensive cancer center in January zzso Records were reviewed for clinical zzso including symptoms, type and extent of cancer, and whether the patient's cancer was stable or progressing zzso at the time of the emergency center zzso Cox zzso analysis was used to assess survival at 90 and 180 days, after controlling for patient zzso 

Patients who died within 14, 90, or 180 days were more likely to have disease progression than those who did zzso zzso on emergency center presentation and disease progression were independent zzso of death within 90 or 180 days, after controlling for patient age, symptoms, signs, and the presence of zzso The odds ratios for death within 90 and 180 days were zzso and zzso respectively zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Cancer disease progression is a clinical measure of increased risk of short-term mortality in acutely symptomatic cancer zzso Future studies should examine whether the use of this characteristic enhances identification of patients who could benefit from timely referral to hospice or zzso zzso zzso cancer patients presenting to a cancer center emergency room were more likely to die within 14, 90, or 180 days if they had evidence of recent progression of their zzso Among patients with disease zzso zzso died within 90 days and zzso within 180 zzso
