zzso zzso gap junction zzso zzso are regarded as tumor zzso and zzso expression is often down regulated in breast zzso We assessed the effect of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cultures of two breast zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso While zzso zzso decreased proliferation of zzso and zzso cultures of zzso by zzso and zzso respectively, zzso growth was not altered in zzso cultures, but exhibited zzso reduction in zzso zzso zzso truncated zzso did not alter zzso zzso zzso cells formed zzso zzso in zzso cultures, and zzso cells formed stellar zzso However, zzso cells zzso zzso formed smaller sized clusters and zzso expressing zzso cells lost their stellar zzso zzso ability of both zzso and zzso cells was reduced by zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso in zzso cells, zzso human zzso cell line, increased proliferation in both zzso and zzso cultures, and disrupted zzso zzso Although zzso zzso did not affect total levels of zzso zzso and zzso it decreased nuclear levels of zzso in zzso and zzso cultures of zzso cells, and in zzso cultures of zzso zzso zzso associated at the membrane with zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cultures of zzso cells, and only in zzso conditions in zzso zzso This study suggests that zzso exerts tumor zzso effects in a zzso manner where zzso assembly with zzso zzso and zzso may be implicated in reducing growth rate, zzso and, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cultures of zzso cells, and zzso cultures of zzso cells, by zzso zzso away from zzso
