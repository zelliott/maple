zzso zzso zzso is an essential component of the zzso zzso both from a structural and a functional point of zzso The zzso functions as a scaffold for tissue organization and regulates growth factors and zzso availability thus contributing to maintain tissue zzso zzso of cells to zzso is essential to support cell survival, growth, and zzso and the lack of these interactions can trigger a type of cell death named zzso Several studies point out that zzso of zzso composition are often responsible of many pathological conditions such as cancer, of which it has been demonstrated to be occasionally the main zzso zzso does not always represent a zzso zzso among the different array of zzso molecules a set of proteins can zzso affect cell viability and are thought to play an important role in tumor zzso For this reason attention has been focused on these molecules as potential tools or targets for zzso
