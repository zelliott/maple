zzso growth factor zzso factor zzso is a zzso factor considered to be potentially involved in tissue zzso wound healing, zzso zzso and cancer zzso Here we examined zzso the distribution of zzso in human zzso including zzso and inflammatory zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso was clearly detected in the zzso zzso particularly along the basement zzso in zzso and inflammatory zzso but only a little was detected in normal zzso zzso is well known to have a strong affinity for zzso in zzso and from the results of our zzso zzso we considered that zzso was bound to zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and basement zzso zzso was well localized in zzso and inflammatory zzso of human zzso liver and zzso and in apparently normal zzso of zzso adrenal zzso and zzso obtained at zzso In zzso zzso was localized along the basement zzso of cancer cell zzso in the zzso zzso of the cancer cell surface, cancer zzso and zzso invaded by cancer, and the basement zzso of zzso zzso and zzso vessels in inflammatory zzso Since zzso makes some cancer cells more invasive in zzso the zzso of zzso in zzso tissue suggests that the zzso of some cancer cells may be increased by zzso in zzso
