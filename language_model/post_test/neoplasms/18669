A growing number of inconsistencies have accumulated within the genetically deterministic paradigm of the origin of zzso Among them the most important are the zzso nature of cancer zzso and the zzso factors of cancer initiation and zzso zzso aspects of cancer and cancer systems biology represent novel approaches to cancer zzso and zzso in the notion that cancer is characterized by a zzso progressive zzso of multiple molecular zzso The coherent zzso of certain cellular zzso has been theoretically predicted for a long time to have a general role in zzso biological zzso However, it has only recently gained major scientific interest when it was measured on zzso complexes at zzso temperatures and confirmed to have a direct effect over the dynamics of the energy zzso Several theoretical and experimental considerations suggest that cancer might be associated with the absence or impairment of the proper coherent dynamics in certain biological structures, most notably in the zzso We review those models and suggest that impaired zzso might largely contribute to the progressive zzso of the molecular and gene regulatory networks, thus connecting different zzso aspects of zzso
