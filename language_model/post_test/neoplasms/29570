zzso a natural biologically active compound isolated from zzso zzso Hook F root zzso has been shown to possess zzso properties and therefore, is an interesting candidate for the development of novel zzso cancer zzso In this study, we have demonstrated that zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso activity as shown by a decrease in the proliferation of both zzso and cancer cells, blocking of migration as well as of tube formation of zzso cells, and by zzso of cancer cell invasion under hypoxic zzso Moreover, zzso decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso levels under both zzso and zzso and inhibited zzso zzso of nuclear zzso zzso Meanwhile, zzso of nuclear zzso protein levels were accompanied by a reduction in the zzso activity of zzso target zzso including zzso In addition, the zzso effect of zzso on zzso protein was partly due to its suppression of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso regulates zzso at multiple levels that may together or individually contribute to its zzso activity against zzso zzso and zzso
