This paper analyses a recent mathematical model of avascular zzso zzso growth which accounts for both cell cycle dynamics and zzso driven cell zzso The model considers cells to exist in one of two zzso zzso and zzso as well as accounting for necrosis and zzso One particular focus of this paper is the zzso created when zzso and zzso cells have different zzso responses to an zzso zzso zzso Two very different zzso zzso are identified corresponding to those cases where zzso cells move either more quickly or more slowly than zzso cells in response to a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The case where zzso cells move more rapidly leads to the commonly accepted zzso structure of a thin layer of zzso cells surrounding an inner zzso zzso In the case where zzso cells move more slowly than zzso cells the model predicts an interesting structure of a thin layer of zzso cells surrounding an inner core of zzso and zzso zzso The sensitivity of this zzso structure to the cell cycle model parameters is also zzso In particular variations in the zzso size of the zzso and the types of transient zzso are zzso The model reveals interesting transient zzso with sharply delineated regions of zzso and zzso zzso
