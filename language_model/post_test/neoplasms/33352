The cellular zzso state is associated with major cellular processes including zzso zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso is a zzso zzso suggested to play a critical role in protection against zzso zzso An alternative zzso transcript zzso zzso a zzso protein zzso was proposed before, but no data was available on the expression of this zzso We have systematically investigated the expression of zzso transcript zzso in human zzso and transformed cell zzso The transcript zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso zzso emphasizing the general importance of the protein for zzso zzso zzso In addition, we confirmed the previously suggested zzso zzso and identified a new third zzso zzso derived from alternative zzso of the zzso zzso In normal tissue expression of both zzso and zzso was restricted to zzso but additionally we were able to demonstrate transcripts in various cancer cell zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso active, but only zzso can complex the regulatory zzso cluster described for zzso zzso of zzso fusion proteins suggested a zzso and nuclear zzso of both zzso and zzso Our findings provide the first evidence for functions of zzso outside zzso
