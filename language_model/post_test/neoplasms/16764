Patients with solid tumors are often anemic even before they undergo zzso zzso Since the cause of the anemia of cancer is unknown, we examined the possible role of zzso Using a sensitive zzso we determined serum zzso zzso levels in 81 anemic patients with solid zzso For any given degree of zzso the serum concentration of zzso zzso was lower in this group of patients than in a group of control patients with zzso anemia zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the expected inverse linear relation between serum levels of zzso zzso and of zzso was absent in the group with zzso The zzso response was further decreased in patients receiving zzso it was not influenced by the presence or absence of zzso in the treatment zzso The inability of the patients with cancer to produce zzso was not zzso if they had zzso adequate zzso production was zzso We conclude that zzso levels are inappropriately low in anemia associated with cancer, and that zzso zzso may contribute to the development of this form of zzso Treatment of the anemia of cancer with zzso may be of zzso
