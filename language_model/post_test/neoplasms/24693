While zzso a state of having fully duplicated sets of zzso per cell, has been described in normally developing bone zzso zzso or as an zzso response in other cell types, zzso is never detected in normal zzso zzso or zzso can be induced by several signals and it is highly prevalent in different forms of zzso suggesting a role for this cell cycle state in promoting cellular zzso zzso suggested that loss of zzso of zzso genes in stem cells might contribute to genetic instability in progeny cells and to subsequent cancer zzso zzso expression of zzso passenger zzso such as Aurora zzso or zzso is a hallmark of various zzso and zzso induced changes in these regulators can promote zzso or zzso and loss of zzso Our studies described an induction of zzso by a stable form of zzso leading to acquisition of transformation zzso It is intriguing to speculate that in some zzso zzso induced by zzso expression of a zzso regulator represents a primary event that leads to unbalanced expression of a cluster of crucial genes and to cellular zzso
