Any zzso in the zzso cancer zzso curve in oldest age groups may be suggestive of zzso This article introduces a correction method for zzso of cancer cases in the very elderly zzso zzso 

zzso zzso rates for a certain cancer are calculated by summing the zzso rates of that cancer for two lower age groups multiplied by a corresponding zzso from an external reference cancer registry zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the Finnish Cancer zzso a zzso zzso registry with high data zzso In order to examine this new method, Lithuanian Cancer zzso data for the period zzso was chosen as an zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of zzso in both sexes and most of cancer sites in Lithuania demonstrated the presence of zzso in the oldest age groups (over zzso zzso of the corrected zzso rates for 1995 with the original ones showed that without correction for zzso crude rates (and consequently number of new zzso were underestimated by around zzso zzso for the year zzso in Lithuania was approximately zzso Depending on cancer site and sex, the percentage of zzso varied zzso 

In many cancer zzso after correction for zzso in elderly age groups, the estimates of number of new cases and zzso rates zzso With respect to prepare future projections of zzso when the effects of an aging population need to be taken into account, accurate zzso rates in the upper age groups are zzso Without zzso cancer occurrence measures may be substantially underestimated, which may lead to inadequate resource allocations for cancer zzso
