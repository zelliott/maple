To study the zzso power of serum zzso with regard to cancer mortality in a large sample of the Belgian population given the lack of zzso in the results of zzso zzso studies in this zzso 

A prospective zzso study within a zzso sample of the Belgian male and female zzso 

A total of 201 cases randomly selected from all cancer deaths zzso during a zzso mortality follow-up of a large zzso and zzso sample of the total Belgian population aged zzso y were matched for age and gender with zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso analyses using zzso distribution of serum zzso in zzso zzso ratios zzso are adjusted for 10 baseline zzso 

zzso zzso of cancer deaths taking the highest zzso of serum zzso as a zzso in male subjects zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso for trend zzso whereas in female subjects a zzso OR of zzso is zzso In zzso zzso no significant modifications of the zzso are observed for the zzso relation of serum zzso with cancer zzso Besides serum zzso zzso intake and smoking are independent zzso in male zzso 

In this zzso zzso study of a zzso sample from the Belgian population, serum zzso is an independent predictor of cancer mortality in male subjects only, in a country with rather high serum zzso levels with respect to most other European zzso
