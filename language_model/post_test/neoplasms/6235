zzso targets zzso zzso and zzso in the treatment of moderate to severe zzso 

We sought to evaluate the impact of zzso on infections and zzso both theoretical risks of blocking zzso and zzso in patients exposed up to 3 zzso 

Rates of infections and zzso were evaluated in cumulative safety data from zzso zzso patients across 4 zzso 

During the zzso zzso rates of overall infections per 100 zzso were similar among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso groups, with overlapping confidence zzso and remained stable through 3 years in zzso zzso Rates of serious infections during the zzso periods were similar between zzso zzso and zzso zzso groups, yet lower in the zzso group zzso Rates remained stable (90 zzso or decreased zzso zzso over time, and were comparable with those for the US psoriasis population based on a managed care zzso Rates of zzso during the zzso periods were comparable among groups zzso zzso 45 zzso zzso 90 zzso zzso and remained stable over time in zzso zzso Rates of zzso excluding zzso skin cancer, were comparable with rates expected in the general US population based on the zzso zzso and End zzso zzso 

Controlled periods do not extend beyond 12 to 20 zzso Only zzso patients were treated for at least 2 years, to zzso zzso database populations may not fully represent the clinical trial zzso 

The emerging safety profile of zzso remains favorable and does not suggest increased rates of infection or zzso through 3 zzso
