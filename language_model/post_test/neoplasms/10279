zzso motion is a particular concern for a complex treatment zzso such as zzso zzso where couch position, zzso rotation and zzso leaf opening all change with zzso In the present study, we have investigated the impact of tumor motion for zzso zzso which could result in three distinct zzso dose artifacts, namely zzso dose zzso zzso dose zzso and zzso zzso leaf opening zzso zzso zzso zzso and dose zzso effects have been previously zzso while the zzso leaf opening zzso effect is a newly discovered zzso dose zzso zzso zzso is the zzso widening of a delivered dose distribution near the edges of a target volume along the direction of tumor zzso zzso zzso is a series of periodic dose zzso and valleys observed within the target region along the direction of couch motion, due to an zzso interplay between the couch motion and the zzso component of tumor zzso The zzso leaf opening zzso effect is caused by an zzso interplay between the zzso patterns of leaf openings and tumor zzso The characteristics of each dose artifact were investigated individually as functions of target motion zzso and period for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso cases, through computer simulation modeling and experimental zzso The zzso dose profiles generated by the simulation program agreed with the experimental data within zzso and zzso inside the zzso region for the zzso and zzso cases, zzso The dose zzso effect produced a zzso increase up to zzso zzso for zzso target motion zzso ranging from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso dose zzso magnitude of zzso was zzso when the target motion period approached an unusually high value of 10 zzso The zzso leaf opening zzso effect produced dose differences ranging from zzso to zzso inside the zzso zzso This information on the potential zzso dose artifacts will be important in defining the optimal motion zzso strategies for lung zzso
