Clinical trials carried out during the last decade have shown that zzso combinations can be used to improve the treatment of locally advanced zzso in a range of zzso A small number of drugs only, among which platinum zzso are the most frequently used, was selected on the basis of zzso zzso The rationale for these combinations relies on spatial cooperation for the control of zzso and on interaction at the level of the primary zzso Such interaction may take place at the molecular level, with altered DNA repair or modification of the zzso induced by drugs or zzso at the cellular level, notably through zzso cooperation arising from differential sensitivity of the various compartments of the cell cycle to drug or zzso and at the zzso level including zzso increased drug zzso or zzso of zzso or zzso Further improvements aiming at an increased therapeutic index, should come from studies on the mode of action of drugs and on the mechanisms of acute toxicity of drugs and zzso
