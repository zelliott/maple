Suicide gene therapy is an attractive strategy to selectively destroy cancer cells while minimizing unnecessary toxicity to normal zzso Since this idea was first introduced more than two decades ago, numerous studies have been conducted and significant developments have been made to further its application for mainstream cancer zzso Major limitations of the suicide gene therapy strategy that have hindered its clinical application include inefficient directed delivery to cancer cells and the poor zzso zzso capacity of suicide zzso This review is focused on efforts that have been and are currently being pursued to improve the activity of individual suicide zzso towards their respective zzso with particular attention to the application of zzso zzso zzso in suicide cancer gene zzso A number of protein engineering strategies have been employed and our discussion here will center on the use of zzso approaches to create and evaluate zzso zzso zzso with enhanced zzso zzso capacity and increased zzso Several of these studies have yielded clinically important zzso zzso that are relevant for cancer gene therapy applications because their zzso can serve to maximize cancer cell killing while minimizing the zzso dose, thereby limiting zzso side zzso
