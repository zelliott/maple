Each year, the American Cancer Society estimates the number of new cancer cases and deaths expected in the United States in the current year and compiles the most recent data on cancer zzso zzso and survival based on zzso data from the National Cancer Institute, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and the North American Association of Central Cancer zzso and mortality data from the National Center for Health zzso zzso and death rates are standardized by age to the 2000 United States standard million zzso A total of zzso new cancer cases and zzso deaths from cancer are projected to occur in the United States in zzso zzso cancer zzso rates decreased in the most recent time period in both men zzso per year from 2001 to zzso and women zzso per year from 1998 to 2005), largely because of decreases in the three major cancer sites in men zzso zzso and colon and zzso zzso and in two major cancer sites in women zzso and zzso zzso cancer death rates decreased in men by zzso between 1990 and 2005, with decreases in lung zzso prostate zzso and zzso zzso cancer rates accounting for nearly zzso of the total zzso Among women, overall cancer death rates between 1991 and 2005 decreased by zzso with decreases in breast zzso and zzso zzso cancer rates accounting for zzso of the total zzso The reduction in the overall cancer death rates has resulted in the avoidance of about zzso deaths from cancer over the 15-year zzso This report also examines cancer zzso zzso and survival by site, sex, zzso education, geographic area, and calendar zzso Although progress has been made in reducing zzso and mortality rates and improving survival, cancer still accounts for more deaths than heart disease in persons younger than 85 years of zzso Further progress can be accelerated by applying existing cancer control knowledge across all segments of the population and by supporting new discoveries in cancer zzso early zzso and zzso
