The purpose of this article was to examine the risk of cancer mortality across levels of fitness and to examine the zzso relation for zzso zzso in men with zzso and zzso 

We examined the zzso relation for zzso and zzso cancer mortality among zzso men with zzso and zzso men with diabetes zzso zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso from the zzso Center zzso zzso We identified zzso cancer deaths during zzso zzso of zzso The duration of follow-up was zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso 

In men with zzso moderate zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso and high fitness zzso zzso were associated with lower risks of cancer mortality compared with the zzso group in a model adjusted for age, examination year, smoking, alcohol use, zzso zzso zzso previous cancer, and zzso Similarly, for individuals with diabetes, moderate zzso zzso and high fitness zzso zzso were associated with lower risks of cancer mortality compared with the zzso zzso Among all men, being fit was associated with a lower risk of mortality from gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso and lung cancer zzso zzso 

In men with zzso and diabetes, higher levels of zzso fitness were associated with lower risk of cancer zzso particularly as a result of zzso of the gastrointestinal zzso compared with those who had low levels of zzso
