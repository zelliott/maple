The zzso protein is an zzso zzso factor with multiple zzso roles in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and deprivation of zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso gene by zzso or deletion is the most common event in human zzso Loss of zzso function compromises genetic zzso in cells exposed to zzso and prevents normal zzso responses to cancer zzso zzso and pharmacological approaches are being developed with the ultimate goal of restoring or controlling zzso functions in cancer zzso zzso interventions aiming at expressing zzso zzso in cancer cells, either by zzso or zzso transfer, have met limited clinical zzso However, recently, the use of a defective zzso zzso that selectively kills zzso cells has shown promising effects in zzso and clinical zzso zzso methods are under development to either stimulate zzso zzso protein function or induce zzso zzso proteins to resume zzso zzso These methods are based on small chemicals zzso zzso peptides zzso or zzso zzso zzso fragments corresponding to defined zzso zzso In addition, detection of zzso zzso may also serve as a marker for early cancer zzso zzso and zzso In this review, we discuss the mechanisms underlying these approaches and their perspectives for cancer zzso
