zzso is a form of zzso cell death for which key regulators remain zzso We sought a common zzso for the zzso of 12 zzso small zzso We used targeted zzso profiling to discover that depletion of zzso causes zzso of zzso zzso zzso in response to one class of compounds and a zzso strategy to discover that zzso is directly inhibited by a second class of zzso zzso zzso and zzso modulated the zzso of 12 zzso zzso but not of 11 compounds with other lethal zzso In addition, two representative zzso zzso prevented tumor growth in zzso mouse tumor zzso zzso profiling in 177 cancer cell lines revealed that diffuse large B cell zzso and zzso cell zzso are particularly susceptible to zzso zzso Thus, zzso is an essential regulator of zzso cancer cell zzso
