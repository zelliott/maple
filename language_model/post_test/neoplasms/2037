zzso is frequently characterized by enhanced drug zzso resulting from a membrane zzso of 170,000 zzso zzso Analysis of cloned zzso for the human zzso 1 zzso whose product is the zzso indicates that zzso is an zzso zzso system for zzso zzso zzso zzso We have demonstrated that a zzso of a reversing agent, zzso specifically binds to zzso The binding site on zzso seems to be identical with that of zzso agents and other reversing zzso On the other hand, the radioactive zzso zzso calcium channel blocker, zzso zzso zzso zzso in membrane zzso from zzso zzso This zzso is almost completely inhibited by excess zzso zzso that reverse or lower zzso In contrast, the labeling is not significantly inhibited by zzso that do not reverse zzso These results suggest that it may be possible to quickly screen for zzso zzso that reverse zzso resistance by measuring the zzso of zzso zzso labeling of zzso
