To develop a reliable technique to enrich for rare cells in blood suspensions using only negative selection steps including a zzso zzso cell zzso system and by zzso variables normally encountered during such enrichment zzso 

A human breast cancer cell line was cultivated and spiked at a ratio of 1 cancer cell to zzso total zzso in zzso coat or 1 cancer cell to zzso total cells in whole blood zzso The final, zzso process consisted of: a red cell zzso step, zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sorting using a zzso system zzso and a final cell analysis step using either an automated cell counter, zzso and visual counting or a zzso zzso 

The final, zzso process produced a final enrichment of the rare cancer cells of zzso zzso and an average, final recovery of zzso It should be noted that a negative depletion protocol was used zzso no labeling of the rare cancer cells was zzso 

To the zzso knowledge, no examples in the literature exist of a zzso zzso enrichment of cancer cells in human blood using a negative depletion zzso The closest example is a 4 zzso enrichment in which two positive magnetic cell separation steps were used zzso were used in this zzso zzso studies are investigating further modifications of the zzso zzso zzso zzso separation system to increase both the enrichment and recovery zzso However, even at current performance levels, the presented process could significantly improve visual and molecular analysis of rare cells in zzso
