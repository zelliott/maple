Recent zzso in cancer research have led to some major zzso however, the impact on overall zzso death rate remains unacceptable, suggesting that further insight into tumor markers and development of targeted therapies is urgently zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso system represents a family of zzso zzso that are involved in the degradation of basement membrane and the zzso zzso leading to tumor cell invasion and zzso In this review, we have provided an overview of emerging data, from basic research as well as clinical studies, highlighting the evolving role of zzso system in tumor zzso It is currently believed that the expression and zzso of zzso plays an important role in zzso and high zzso levels of zzso and zzso are associated with advanced zzso zzso The zzso zzso of this system, zzso and zzso regulate zzso activity by either direct zzso or affecting cell surface expression and zzso zzso role in zzso is rather zzso on one hand, it zzso zzso leading to zzso of invasion and zzso and on the other it has been reported to facilitate tumor growth and zzso Individual components of zzso system are reported to be zzso expressed in cancer zzso compared to normal zzso and, thus, have the potential to be developed as zzso and/or therapeutic zzso zzso this system represents a highly attractive target that warrants further in-depth zzso Such studies are likely to contribute towards the development of zzso targeted therapies in the near zzso
