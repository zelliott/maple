Many studies, including the zzso zzso in Communities zzso zzso reported a positive association between plasma zzso protein zzso zzso of zzso chronic zzso zzso cancer risk, although it is unclear whether the association is zzso Our aims were to assess the associations of a zzso genetic risk score zzso created from zzso zzso zzso with zzso cancer risk, as well as examine plasma zzso and zzso in relation to common zzso in the ARIC zzso 

Cox zzso hazards models were used to zzso estimate hazard ratios zzso and zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso of total, zzso zzso zzso and breast zzso in relation to: zzso zzso among zzso zzso followed in zzso and zzso zzso plasma zzso among zzso zzso followed in zzso A weighted zzso was comprised of 20 zzso zzso located zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 16 other genes that were identified in zzso association zzso 

After multivariable adjustment, one standard zzso zzso of the zzso was associated with zzso cancer risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but not with any other zzso One unit of zzso plasma zzso was associated with the risk of total, zzso zzso and breast zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso remained zzso although lost statistical significance for all but breast cancer, after excluding subjects with zzso of zzso 

The study corroborates a zzso role of chronic zzso inflammation in zzso zzso
