As the zzso activity of zzso factor 1 zzso is associated with resistance of tumor cells to current zzso therapies, the zzso dynamics of zzso regions has been of great interest as a therapeutic zzso In the present study, we established a unique cancer cell line, which changes color zzso and monitored it during tumor zzso In imaging experiments, zzso cells appeared over the tumor zzso but dramatically decreased in number as blood vessels developed around the zzso The remaining zzso cells at the center of the zzso also disappeared after zzso zzso tumor growth was accelerated and zzso cells zzso in different zzso The distance between zzso cells and the nearest vessels correlated to the diameter of the vessel zzso These results provide a basic knowledge of how to estimate the zzso dynamics of zzso cells using information about the zzso architecture of tumor blood zzso
