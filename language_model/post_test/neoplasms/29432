zzso have significant potential as selective zzso agents for laser based cancer zzso This study investigates the use of single walled carbon zzso zzso as zzso enhancers when excited by near infrared zzso light for tumor cell zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso in zzso water at zzso of 0, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured using a zzso for the wavelength range of zzso Mass zzso zzso were calculated using zzso zzso zzso Cell culture media containing 0, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was laser zzso at zzso wavelength with an zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso of these solutions during laser zzso were measured with a zzso zzso away from the incident laser zzso Cell viability of zzso kidney cancer cells zzso was measured zzso following laser treatment with the previously mentioned laser parameters alone or with zzso Cell viability as a function of zzso position was determined zzso using zzso blue zzso and bright field zzso for samples exposed to heating zzso of 2 and zzso alone or with zzso zzso A Beckman Coulter zzso instrument zzso cell viability of samples treated with varying zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso and zzso and heating zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso indicated inclusion of zzso increased light zzso and zzso across all zzso zzso zzso with laser zzso increased temperature zzso compared to laser heating zzso Greater zzso and higher temperature zzso were observed with increasing zzso zzso No inherent toxicity was observed with zzso zzso A more rapid and substantial viability decline was observed over time in samples exposed to zzso with laser treatment compared with samples experiencing laser heating or zzso treatment zzso zzso heated for zzso with zzso zzso demonstrated increasing viability as the zzso distance from the incident laser beam zzso 

The significant increases in zzso temperature zzso and cell death with inclusion of zzso in laser therapy demonstrate the potential of their use as agents for enhancing zzso tumor zzso
