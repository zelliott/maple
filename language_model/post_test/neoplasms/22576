zzso 1120 is an oral zzso zzso zzso inhibitor that blocks the activity of vascular zzso growth factor zzso and other growth factor zzso We have done a phase I study to evaluate the safety, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Patients with advanced zzso solid tumors were treated with zzso 1120 at oral doses of 150 to 250 zzso twice zzso Drug safety and zzso were zzso as were baseline and zzso levels of circulating zzso bone zzso zzso cells and plasma soluble zzso zzso 2 as potential zzso for zzso zzso zzso patients were treated at zzso 1120 doses of 150 zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso zzso zzso or 250 zzso twice daily zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso grade 3 or 4 zzso of liver zzso occurred in 3 of 12 patients at 200 zzso twice daily and 3 of 6 patients at 250 zzso twice zzso zzso disease was achieved in 16 zzso patients, and median zzso survival was 113 days zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that the maximum plasma concentration and area under the curve for zzso 1120 increased with the dose within the dose range zzso zzso of zzso bone zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso 2 decreased significantly during treatment over all zzso 1120 dose zzso In conclusion, the maximum tolerated dose of zzso 1120 in the current study was determined to be 200 zzso twice daily, and our zzso analysis indicated that this zzso inhibitor is biologically zzso
