To assess the feasibility of administering zzso an zzso analog that is not a zzso for zzso zzso in combination with zzso to identify zzso zzso and to seek preliminary evidence of zzso zzso 

Patients with advanced solid zzso were treated with zzso zzso over an hour followed by zzso zzso over 30 zzso on day 1 every 28 days at the following zzso zzso dose levels zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Plasma and urine sampling were performed to characterize the zzso parameters of zzso in combination with zzso 

Thirty-one patients received 77 courses of zzso at five dose zzso Grade 4 zzso lasting more than 5 days and/or grade 4 zzso were consistently experienced by minimally zzso zzso and heavily zzso zzso patients at doses exceeding zzso and zzso zzso zzso Mean values for the volume of distribution at steady state and clearance of zzso were zzso L and zzso zzso zzso A patient with zzso zzso cell lung cancer experienced a zzso reduction in extent of disease for 6 zzso 

The combination of zzso and zzso produces zzso zzso at lower doses of zzso than single agent zzso The recommended phase II doses of zzso are zzso and zzso zzso every 4 weeks, for zzso and zzso patients, zzso The addition of zzso did not substantially alter the zzso behavior of zzso
