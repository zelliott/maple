zzso data can be used to detect diseases and predict responses to therapies through zzso zzso However, the high zzso and low sample size of such data result in many zzso problems such as reduced prediction accuracy and slow zzso zzso In this paper, we propose a novel family of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso gene expression and comparative zzso zzso zzso Our approaches are based on combining the advantages of using local learning, zzso learning, and ensemble learning, for better prediction zzso To study the performances of our methods, we performed zzso experiments on 17 well-known data sets with diverse zzso We have also performed statistical comparisons with many zzso techniques including the zzso zzso approach and two related but recent methods proposed in zzso Experimental results show that our approaches are faster and achieve generally a better prediction performance over compared zzso
