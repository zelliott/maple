Early long-term treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso delayed disease progression in zzso Human zzso zzso zzso carriers in a zzso trial that lasted from October 1987 to February 1992 zzso The aim of the work reported in this paper was to observe if there was also an effect on survival when the same patients were zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was given 3 zzso zzso zzso 3 times zzso The control group did not receive any zzso The main zzso for this evaluation was death due to any zzso The deadline was August zzso 

zzso were zzso zzso Western zzso zzso zzso group zzso or with generalized zzso zzso group zzso The groups had 79 zzso and 83 zzso zzso 

Mean survival was longer in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso months since infection or zzso zzso zzso months since the start of zzso Survival rates were higher in zzso individuals zzso zzso zzso at 10 years of infection or zzso zzso zzso at 7 years of treatment or zzso It was also confirmed that disease progression is significantly slower in zzso zzso There were zzso zzso zzso long-term survivors in the zzso and control groups, respectively zzso zzso zzso zzso patients had fewer AIDS-related zzso (5 zzso zzso mainly zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso This difference was not statistically zzso but clinically zzso There was no difference in survival if measured since the onset of zzso 

zzso alpha treatment given from the early stages of infection, but not after the appearance of AIDS symptoms, can prolong zzso
