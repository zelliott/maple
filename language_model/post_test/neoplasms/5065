The purpose of this work is zzso zzso to explore biological consequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso errors in intensity modulated zzso zzso of prostate and head and neck zzso zzso to determine levels of planning target volume zzso and normal tissue zzso or overdose flagged with clinically used zzso action limits, and zzso to provide biologically based input for zzso zzso and zzso zzso action zzso 

Ten consecutive prostate zzso cases and ten consecutive head and neck zzso cases were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were introduced for each control point of the plan separately for zzso and zzso leaf zzso zzso were zzso to 2 zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The modified files were imported into the planning system for forward dose zzso The original plan served as the zzso The generalized equivalent uniform dose zzso was used as the biological index for the targets, zzso zzso zzso zzso and spinal zzso Each plan was zzso on a CT scan of a 27 zzso diameter zzso phantom with a contoured zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso chamber and zzso gamma analysis were compared to the reference zzso zzso pass criteria: zzso at least zzso of zzso with a dose zzso of 50% of maximum dose have to pass at 3 zzso and zzso dose to chamber within zzso of the reference zzso 

For prostate cases, differences in zzso and zzso zzso greater than zzso were zzso However, a larger proportion of plans leading to greater than zzso difference in prostate zzso zzso passed the zzso chamber zzso but not zzso gamma zzso A similar trend was found for the zzso zzso For head and neck zzso the zzso pass criteria flagged plans leading to greater than zzso differences in zzso zzso and greater than zzso differences in the maximum dose to zzso If pass criteria were relaxed to zzso for gamma and zzso for zzso chamber zzso plans leading to a zzso difference in zzso zzso and a zzso difference in zzso maximum dose would likely pass zzso zzso A larger proportion of head and neck plans with greater than zzso zzso zzso difference passed zzso gamma zzso compared to zzso chamber zzso 

For low zzso plans, there is a better chance to catch zzso zzso errors with zzso gamma zzso rather than zzso chamber zzso zzso for high zzso plans, there is a better chance to catch zzso zzso errors with zzso chamber zzso rather than with zzso gamma zzso Ion chamber and zzso gamma analysis zzso zzso can detect greater than zzso change in zzso for zzso and critical structures for low zzso treatment zzso For high zzso treatment plans, zzso chamber and zzso gamma analysis can detect greater than zzso change in zzso for zzso and a zzso change in critical structure zzso since either zzso methods passes the zzso zzso For zzso changes less than those listed above, either zzso method has the same proportion of passing zzso
