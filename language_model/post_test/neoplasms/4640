The zzso calcium zzso see zzso zzso zzso was the first zzso identified whose principal zzso zzso is an zzso namely zzso zzso It maintains the near constancy of zzso see zzso that complex organisms require to ensure normal cellular zzso A wealth of information has accumulated over the past two decades about the zzso structure and function, its role in diseases and zzso zzso This review briefly describes the zzso and key features of its structure and function, then discusses the zzso signals modulating its activity, provides an overview of the zzso signaling pathways that it controls, and, finally, briefly describes zzso signaling both in zzso participating in zzso see zzso zzso as well as those that do zzso zzso controlling zzso signaling include various factors affecting the expression of the zzso gene as well as zzso of its trafficking to and from the cell zzso The zzso cell surface zzso in turn, links to various zzso and small molecular weight G proteins to regulate zzso second zzso zzso zzso various protein zzso and zzso factors that are part of the machinery enabling the zzso to zzso the functions of the wide variety of cells in which it is zzso zzso signaling is impacted by its interactions with several binding partners in addition to signaling elements per zzso zzso G zzso including zzso and zzso These latter two proteins act as scaffolds that bind signaling components and other key cellular elements zzso the zzso Thus zzso signaling likely does not take place randomly throughout the cell, but is zzso and organized so as to facilitate the interaction of the zzso with its various signaling zzso
