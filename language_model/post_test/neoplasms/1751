The discovery of the human zzso and subsequent expansion of zzso research combined with emerging technologies such as functional imaging, zzso and sophisticated zzso biology are producing unprecedented changes in today's zzso The expanding knowledge of the molecular basis of cancer has shown that significant differences in gene expression patterns can guide therapy not only for zzso conditions, but also for a variety of diseases including inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative zzso As a result, the fields of zzso and zzso have emerged as potential new testing platforms for the individualized management of zzso An zzso response to a drug is the complex interaction of both genetic and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the drug target itself, disease zzso zzso or drug zzso zzso may all be used as zzso of drug efficacy or zzso In zzso the zzso technology has focused on detecting the predisposition for cancer, predicting of toxic responses to drugs and selecting the best individual and combinations of zzso zzso zzso involves the application of whole zzso technologies zzso gene and protein expression zzso for the prediction of the sensitivity or resistance of an zzso disease to a single or group of zzso zzso zzso and zzso profiling have the ability to generate hundreds of thousands of data points requiring sophisticated and complex information systems necessary for accurate and useful data zzso This technique has generated a wealth of new information in the fields of zzso and solid tumor zzso and prediction of zzso drug and zzso target discovery and zzso drug efficacy zzso
