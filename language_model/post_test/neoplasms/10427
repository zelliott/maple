The zzso cells of zzso organisms form highly organized zzso specialized for the tasks of protection, zzso and zzso all of which require tight regulation of the core processes of cell polarity and tissue zzso zzso of these core processes is a critical feature of zzso zzso Cell polarity and tissue architecture are intimately linked, as proteins controlling cell shape are also responsible for proper zzso and assembly of zzso junctions and three-dimensional tissue zzso The zzso zzso underlying zzso zzso supports tissue architecture and suppresses zzso growth through regulation of cell zzso and zzso of protective signaling zzso Emerging evidence is uncovering the mechanisms by which polarity pathways alter the way zzso cells organize and interact with the tissue zzso to promote zzso growth and invasion during zzso We discuss how cell polarity pathways regulate zzso junctions and highlight the new insights gained by investigating the role played by polarity pathways during the transformation of zzso zzso
