The essence of zzso zzso detection is increasing the zzso zzso for the zzso while decreasing the zzso of the zzso zzso which improve one aspect of zzso detection may have a deleterious effect on zzso For example, thinner slices decrease partial volume averaging zzso for detection of small zzso but also decrease zzso Attempts to increase zzso by lowering the bandwidth may increase the zzso decreasing the degree of zzso Fast spin echo zzso generally offers the best zzso for detection of long zzso zzso However, zzso with short zzso zzso to magnetic zzso zzso are better detected with zzso echo zzso Strategies which decrease background zzso include those based on chemical shift differences zzso zzso techniques like zzso and those based on differences in zzso zzso inversion recovery zzso techniques like STIR and zzso
