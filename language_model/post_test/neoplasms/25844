To determine zzso zzso tolerated dose zzso zzso profile, and potential zzso activity of zzso a novel zzso compound which zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with advanced solid tumors were given zzso zzso over 10 zzso every 21 zzso zzso escalation was based on the modified continual reassessment method zzso with one patient treated at each minimally toxic dose zzso zzso studies were performed in all zzso 

A total of 37 patients (27 zzso 10 zzso median age 59 years, median performance status zzso were treated with 132 courses at nine dose levels, ranging from 50 to 700 zzso The zzso of zzso was 600 zzso with zzso and zzso and cumulative fatigue as the zzso zzso Hematologic toxicity correlated with zzso function and mild zzso zzso dysfunction was observed in multiple zzso Other zzso zzso observed included mild to moderate fatigue, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Three patients expired due to drug-related zzso zzso analysis during the first course of treatment at the 600 zzso dose level demonstrated a mean harmonic zzso maximum plasma concentration zzso clearance zzso area under the curve zzso and apparent volume of distribution at steady state zzso of zzso zzso 137 zzso zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso An average of zzso of the compound was zzso unchanged in the zzso zzso responses were achieved in two patients with advanced pancreatic cancer and in two patients with advanced zzso zzso Minor responses were obtained in six patients with advanced zzso zzso 

The zzso and dose for phase II clinical trials of zzso when administered zzso over 10 zzso every 21 days was 600 zzso zzso is a promising new zzso zzso
