zzso zzso refers to treatment strategies where gene transfer methods are used to generate immune responses against zzso Our growing knowledge of the mechanisms regulating the initiation and maintenance of zzso immune responses has provided the rationale for the design of several genetic zzso zzso zzso cells have been zzso to express immune zzso genes and are then administered as tumor vaccines, in an attempt to overcome tumor cell ignorance by the immune zzso With the description of zzso tumor zzso multiple strategies have been proposed mainly aimed at optimal tumor zzso presentation by zzso cells zzso Among zzso the zzso cells have been recognized as the most powerful cells in this class, and have become the target for introducing tumor zzso genes to initiate zzso immune zzso The detailed knowledge of how the immune system can be activated to specifically recognize tumor zzso and the mechanisms involved in the control of this immune response, provide the basis for modern genetic zzso strategies for cancer zzso
