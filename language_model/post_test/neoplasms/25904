zzso syndrome is a human zzso zzso disorder leading to premature zzso The zzso responsible for this disorder have recently been localized to a gene zzso zzso a protein that possesses DNA zzso and zzso zzso Patients carrying zzso gene zzso exhibit an elevated rate of cancer, accompanied by increased zzso zzso The latter features are also characteristic of the loss of function of zzso a tumor zzso that is very frequently zzso in human zzso Moreover, changes in the activity of zzso have been implicated in the onset of cellular zzso zzso We report here that the zzso protein can form a specific physical interaction with zzso This interaction involves the zzso part of zzso and the extreme zzso zzso of zzso a region that plays an important role in regulating the functional state of zzso A small fraction of zzso can be found in complex with zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to zzso zzso zzso activity and induction of zzso protein zzso These findings support the existence of a zzso between zzso and zzso which may be important for maintaining zzso integrity and for preventing the zzso of aberrations that can give rise to premature zzso and zzso
