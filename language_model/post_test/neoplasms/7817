Starting from the phenomenon that the amount of circulating zzso in patients' zzso did not significantly influence zzso zzso of zzso expressing tumors, we built up an in zzso model to explain this zzso zzso experiments in this model system showed that the zzso specific zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso could not be inhibited in their binding to cell associated zzso if they were zzso with a 20 zzso excess of serum zzso In contrast, the zzso cross zzso zzso could be inhibited in their binding to tumor associated zzso under identical zzso These data combined with western zzso analysis of patients' zzso and affinity constant zzso argue that zzso changes in serum zzso cause a decreased affinity of the zzso specific zzso to serum zzso allowing a preferential binding to tumor associated zzso
