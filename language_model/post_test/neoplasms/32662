The US Public Health Service Panel on zzso has recommended the use of zzso zzso zzso as the best way to estimate outcomes in a zzso zzso We evaluate the importance of this recommendation by assessing whether adjusting for zzso quality of life affects the ultimate resource allocation decision implied by the zzso ratio for interventions aimed at cancer prevention and zzso 

We identified 110 interventions in 39 articles for which both zzso and zzso were zzso zzso were forms of zzso early zzso or treatment of zzso We calculated a zzso correlation to assess the zzso relationship between zzso and zzso In addition, we employed various decision thresholds to assess whether the use of zzso would yield different resource allocation decisions than the use of zzso 

The correlation between zzso and zzso is zzso zzso zzso Assuming a US dollars zzso decision zzso adjustment for quality of life would affect the implied choice in zzso of zzso With a US dollars zzso zzso adjustment for quality of life would affect choice for zzso of zzso 

For interventions aimed at cancer, the outcome measures of zzso and zzso are highly correlated with one zzso Although adjusting for quality of life can make an important difference in the evaluation of alternative approaches to cancer prevention and control, it often does zzso
