A zzso imaging probe for targeting cancer cells has been zzso based on zzso zzso coated gold zzso zzso for the first zzso In this probe, zzso and surface enhanced zzso scattering zzso signals can be generated independently by using different zzso zzso To investigate the targeting performance of the probe, zzso acid zzso is zzso on the outer surfaces of zzso as a targeting zzso and zzso cells were used as model cancer cells because they zzso folate receptors zzso The zzso mechanism was verified by competing experiments with free zzso through both zzso images and zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of the probe was remarkably reduced in comparison with the zzso without the zzso shell as proved by the results of zzso zzso Compared with traditional imaging zzso this new type of zzso has great potential for zzso imaging in living cells, which can be easily realized by using zzso and zzso zzso
