The function of major zzso complex zzso class I zzso is to sample peptides derived from zzso proteins and to present these peptides to zzso T zzso We analyzed zzso human cancer cell lines for expression of the zzso and zzso genes and identified whether defects in these genes were associated with the level of expression of zzso molecules in cancer zzso zzso of zzso was positive in zzso zzso of the cell lines, zzso expression was positive in zzso zzso zzso was positive in zzso zzso and zzso was positive in zzso zzso at the cell zzso In zzso cell lines that expressed zzso the mean zzso intensity zzso was zzso zzso zzso however, in the cell lines that lacked zzso the zzso was zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the expression level of zzso class I molecules is zzso in most cases, with the loss of the zzso gene but without the loss of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso
