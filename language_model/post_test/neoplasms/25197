zzso is a zzso human zzso that zzso tumors through unknown zzso A growing body of evidence suggests that its zzso results from zzso changes, particularly in DNA zzso Changes in gene zzso status, zzso by zzso have been proposed to activate zzso expression or silence tumor zzso zzso leading to long-term changes in the activity of genes controlling cell zzso Mostly zzso and often contradictory, studies have demonstrated that zzso exposure is associated with both zzso and zzso at various genetic zzso in zzso or in zzso This ambiguity has made it difficult to assess whether the changes induced by zzso are zzso involved in the transformation process or are simply a reflection of the altered physiology of rapidly dividing cancer zzso Here, we discuss the evidence supporting changes in DNA zzso as a cause of zzso zzso and highlight the strengths and limitations of these studies, as well as areas where zzso and inconsistencies zzso
