Prevention of human cancer in the future will depend on using the results of zzso and animal studies and strategies to minimize zzso Changes are occurring in the area of animal testing and research that potentially represent significant steps toward reducing our dependence on the traditional zzso zzso as our primary tool for identification of chemical zzso and management of zzso Efforts to prevent cancer would be enhanced by more attention to describing modes of action so that the development of tumors would not be the only basis for predicting zzso zzso These markers might also serve for early detection of cancer at a stage more amenable to zzso What zzso do we want to detect through animal tests in the future? Whether the goal is to identify weak or potent zzso or both, there will still be a need for zzso zzso but hopefully for zzso rather than screening zzso
