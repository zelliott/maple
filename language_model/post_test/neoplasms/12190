With the many processes and zzso targeted by the zzso pathway, it is not surprising to find that aberrations in the system zzso directly or zzso the zzso of many zzso While zzso of a major zzso such as E1 is obviously zzso zzso in zzso or in recognition motifs in zzso that do not affect vital pathways or that affect the involved process only partially may result in a broad array of zzso Likewise, acquired changes in the activity of the system can also evolve into certain zzso The pathological states associated with the zzso system can be classified into two groups: zzso those that result from loss of zzso in a zzso system zzso or in the recognition motif in the target zzso that lead to stabilization of certain zzso and zzso those that result from gain of zzso or accelerated degradation of the protein zzso Studies that employ targeted zzso of genes coding for specific zzso system zzso and zzso in animals can provide a more systematic view into the broad spectrum of zzso that may result from aberrations in zzso zzso Better understanding of the processes and identification of the components involved in the degradation of key regulatory proteins will lead to the development of zzso drugs that will target specifically only the involved zzso
