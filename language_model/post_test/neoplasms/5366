Studies on normal tissue radiation sensitivity have demonstrated profound differences of individual zzso A number of genetic syndromes associated with abnormal radiation sensitivity have been zzso zzso differences have also been detected in persons without known genetic zzso The question arises as to whether tumors originating from normal zzso with abnormal radiation sensitivity share this abnormal sensitivity and as to whether a general correlation between normal tissue sensitivity and tumor tissue sensitivity can be zzso 

Experimental and clinical data derived from own investigations and an extensive review of the literature was used to answer the zzso 

Experimental studies on normal and tumor zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso enhanced radiation sensitivity of zzso normal zzso is also found in zzso zzso Clinical investigations on cervical zzso and breast cancer patients revealed higher local control rates in patients with more pronounced acute side zzso A weak trend towards the same relationship was found in head and neck cancer zzso Case reports on unusually severe acute radiation side effects or unexpected tumor zzso as well as few reports on zzso in zzso zzso zzso patients suggest a correlation between zzso and zzso radiation zzso Studies on zzso and tumor cells from the same patient support this hypothesis in soft tissue zzso patients, but do not so for head and neck cancer zzso zzso cells exhibit a considerably higher variation of radiation sensitivities than normal tissue zzso 

Experimental and clinical data are compatible with the hypothesis that normal tissue radiation sensitivity predicts for tumor tissue zzso However, in view of the larger zzso of tumor cell radiation sensitivity as compared to normal tissue radiation sensitivity, the development of a clinically useful zzso test for tumor sensitivity based on normal cell sensitivity appears to be zzso
