To evaluate zzso yield after zzso in patients undergoing zzso banking before zzso 

A retrospective cohort zzso 

zzso academic medical zzso 

zzso women diagnosed with cancer or zzso disease presenting for zzso cycles, with or without zzso zzso injection zzso for zzso zzso before any therapy were compared with 921 presumably fertile women undergoing zzso for male factor zzso from January 2001 through October zzso 

Standard zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The number of 2 zzso zzso zzso created and suitable for zzso or zzso 

No statistically significant differences were observed between preservation and male factor groups for number of zzso number of zzso or amount of zzso needed to stimulate zzso zzso Peak serum zzso levels were significantly lower for women with zzso fertility zzso 

Women facing chemotherapy as treatment for cancer or systemic zzso disease infrequently undergo fertility zzso If offered this potentially zzso option, these data suggest equivalent zzso yield compared with women with zzso male zzso Our data report no significant complications in subsequent zzso in those who sought fertility preservation, which is zzso and encouraging for these women and their zzso
