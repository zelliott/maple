Response evaluation in solid zzso currently uses zzso imaging techniques to measure changes under zzso Imaging requires a zzso anatomical zzso to be viewed and relies on the measurement of a reduction in zzso size during treatment as the basis for presumed clinical zzso However, with the development of zzso agents, anatomical imaging has became inappropriate as certain zzso would not reduce in zzso zzso studies are therefore necessary and dynamic contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are currently being evaluated for monitoring zzso zzso MR imaging zzso and magnetic resonance zzso zzso are also capable of detecting changes in cell density and zzso content within zzso In this article, we review anatomical and functional criteria currently used for monitoring zzso We review the published data on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This literature review covers the following zzso basic principles of the technique, clinical studies, zzso and zzso limits and perspectives in monitoring zzso zzso criteria such as response evaluation criteria in solid zzso zzso will require adaptation to employ not only new tools but also different complementary techniques such as functional imaging in order to monitor therapeutic effects of conventional and new zzso zzso
