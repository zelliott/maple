A number of zzso tumors interact with the host to cause a syndrome of zzso characterized by extensive loss of zzso tissue and skeletal muscle mass, but with preservation of proteins in visceral zzso Although anorexia is frequently present, the body composition changes in cancer zzso cannot be explained by nutritional deprivation zzso Loss of skeletal muscle mass is a result of depression in protein synthesis and an increase in protein zzso The main zzso zzso that has been found to have increased expression and activity in the skeletal muscle of zzso patients is the zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors produce zzso factors such as zzso factor zzso a 24 zzso zzso zzso which inhibit protein synthesis and stimulate degradation of zzso proteins in skeletal muscle by inducing an increased expression of regulatory components of the zzso zzso zzso While the zzso chains in zzso are required to initiate protein degradation the central zzso core may act as a growth and survival zzso Only zzso tumors are capable of zzso fully zzso zzso and the selectivity of production possibly rests with the acquisition of the necessary zzso zzso rather than expressing the gene for the zzso zzso Loss of zzso tissue is probably the result of an increase in zzso rather than a zzso in zzso A zzso zzso factor zzso identical with the plasma protein zzso zzso is found in the urine of zzso cancer patients and is produced by tumors causing a decrease in carcass zzso zzso causes zzso zzso in zzso tissue through a zzso zzso process by interaction with a zzso Thus, by producing circulating factors certain zzso tumors are able to interfere with host metabolism even without zzso to that particular zzso
