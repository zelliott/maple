A series of zzso zzso complexes zzso zzso have been zzso and characterized zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and B is the zzso zzso base zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The DNA and protein zzso DNA zzso and zzso activity of these complexes were zzso The interactions of complexes zzso with calf zzso DNA were studied by zzso techniques, including zzso zzso and CD zzso The DNA binding constant values of the complexes were found to range from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the binding affinities are in the following order: 3 zzso 6 zzso 2 zzso 5 zzso 1 zzso zzso All the zzso complexes zzso are found to effectively promote the zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA under zzso and zzso zzso zzso data for DNA zzso promoted by 3 and 6 under zzso conditions give observed rate zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, showing a zzso rate acceleration over the zzso reaction of zzso zzso the zzso zzso complexes zzso bind and cleave bovine serum zzso zzso and effectively promote the zzso and zzso dependent deaths of zzso and zzso cancer zzso The zzso of the complexes was further confirmed by zzso zzso zzso levels in cancer cell zzso and content zzso
