Despite great advances in understanding the molecular zzso of cancer and zzso therapeutic strategies against these diseases are still largely zzso zzso acceleration of the discovery of new therapeutic agents against these zzso is of enormous zzso This review is focused on the role of zzso and expanding zzso zzso systems in the search for new drugs and therapeutic targets in cancer and zzso Though the obvious limitations of using a zzso to address human diseases, when used in the early phase and with complementary zzso systems, it can have a tremendous impact in the discovery of new therapeutic zzso In this review, many evidence are provided demonstrating the valuable contribution of zzso in this zzso Additionally, several zzso zzso drug screening approaches based on a readily zzso zzso on zzso technologies increasingly oriented towards genetic and chemical zzso analysis are zzso Altogether, with this review, we intend not only to recognize previous successes and ongoing work in this area, but also to point out new opportunities that may be of interest for zzso as a model zzso and as a powerful system in the discovery of new lead compounds that have the potential to become novel drugs in cancer and zzso
