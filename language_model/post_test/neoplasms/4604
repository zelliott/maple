To describe new techniques for zzso biopsy with use of an zzso magnetic resonance zzso imaging system with integrated zzso zzso guidance zzso 

In 28 patients, biopsy was performed in which the image plane was zzso controlled by the position of a hand-held probe attached to the biopsy zzso An icon integrated into the image was used to guide needle advancement in three planes zzso to the zzso In zzso zzso of spatial accuracy were also zzso 

zzso tissue was retrieved in 25 of 28 zzso The system was most accurate near the zzso with a maximum measured error of zzso zzso within a sphere of radius zzso zzso about the zzso 

zzso biopsy with a zzso zzso technique is safe and zzso Image feedback is near real time, and the procedure is zzso These techniques may be used to perform zzso zzso and to place zzso for zzso zzso
