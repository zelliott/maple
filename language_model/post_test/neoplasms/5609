The distinction between benign zzso zzso cells and well differentiated zzso can be difficult in zzso zzso and especially zzso zzso zzso is an zzso protein that is specifically expressed in cells of zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso were used to identify and distinguish zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso were prepared using the zzso Thin Prep zzso The specimens were comprised of a mix of 45 cases that were diagnosed as zzso suspicious, or zzso by zzso zzso of routine material seen by the zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques were used with a commercially available zzso zzso 

In most cases of zzso tumor cells showed a strong positive zzso reaction product (32 of zzso This included four cases that were not zzso diagnosed as zzso but subsequently proved to be zzso zzso zzso was not observed in five tumors, two of which were not expected to express this zzso One benign case showed cells zzso for zzso although the cells were not zzso by zzso zzso Because this case was a surgical pelvic zzso these cells more likely were zzso zzso than true zzso 

The zzso specific zzso zzso marker zzso reliably zzso zzso zzso cells from zzso and is a useful zzso test to distinguish benign zzso zzso cells from well differentiated zzso cells in fluid zzso
