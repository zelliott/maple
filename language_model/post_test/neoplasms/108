In a mathematical model of the cellular immune response we investigate immune reactions to tumors that are introduced in various zzso The model represents zzso zzso interactions that generate zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this model zzso zzso can induce infinitely large zzso zzso populations because zzso zzso are capable of repeated proliferation and we have omitted zzso In this zzso model small doses of zzso zzso tumors grow infinitely large zzso sneak zzso zzso an immune response of limited zzso Intermediate doses of the same tumor induce larger immune responses and are hence zzso Large doses of the tumor break through, but their progressive growth is accompanied by a strong immune response involving extensive zzso zzso zzso a more zzso tumor is rejected in intermediate doses and breaks through in large zzso zzso small doses however lead to tumor zzso Thus although the model is devoid of explicit regulatory mechanisms that limit the magnitude of its response zzso is such a zzso the immune response to large increasing tumors may either be a stable reaction of limited magnitude zzso known as tolerance or zzso or a strong and ever increasing zzso zzso can evolve because in this model net zzso proliferation requires the presence of a minimum number of helper T cells zzso a proliferation zzso zzso is caused by depletion of helper T cell zzso
