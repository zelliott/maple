Patient response to zzso zzso zzso regimens seems to vary zzso making comparison between regimens zzso To eliminate this zzso zzso we designed a zzso trial and zzso compared the number of zzso mobilized into blood after zzso zzso factor zzso days 1 to 12 plus zzso zzso factor zzso days 7 to 12 zzso zzso with the number of zzso after zzso plus zzso days 3 to 14 zzso zzso in the same zzso 

zzso patients were zzso to receive either regimen G or C first zzso and zzso zzso and underwent two zzso After a zzso period, patients were then crossed over to the alternate regimen zzso and zzso zzso and underwent two additional zzso The zzso zzso content of each collection was zzso In addition, toxicity and charges were zzso 

zzso C zzso zzso 50) resulted in zzso of more zzso cells zzso zzso zzso units zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with regimen G given to the same patients zzso zzso zzso paired zzso test, zzso for all zzso Compared with regimen G, regimen C resulted in better zzso whether it was given first zzso zzso or second zzso zzso The ability to achieve a target collection of zzso or zzso zzso zzso using two zzso was 50% after zzso and zzso after zzso Three of the seven patients in whom zzso was poor after zzso had zzso or zzso zzso zzso with two zzso after zzso In contrast, when regimen G was given second zzso seven out of 10 patients failed to achieve the target zzso cell dose despite adequate collections after zzso Thirty percent of the patients zzso of 29) given regimen C were admitted to the hospital because of zzso fever for a median duration of 4 days zzso 2 to 10 zzso The higher cost of regimen C was balanced by higher zzso cell yield, resulting in equivalent charges based on cost per zzso cell zzso 

We report the first clinical trial that used a zzso design showing that high-dose zzso plus zzso results in zzso of more zzso then zzso plus zzso when tested in the same patient regardless of sequence of administration, although the regimen is associated with greater zzso Patients who fail to achieve adequate zzso after regimen G can be treated with regimen C as an effective salvage regimen, whereas patients who fail regimen C are unlikely to benefit from subsequent treatment with regimen zzso The zzso design allowed detection of significant differences between regimens in a small cohort of patients and should be considered in design of future comparisons of zzso zzso
