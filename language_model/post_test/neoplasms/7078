zzso strain imaging with zzso zzso is a relatively new zzso method to assess zzso zzso To determine the zzso zzso and zzso reliability scores, we evaluated zzso strain zzso of 10 zzso survivors of childhood zzso Ten patients were selected randomly out of a follow-up cohort of childhood cancer zzso All 10 patients underwent a zzso zzso zzso zzso gray scale images were made in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed using software for zzso zzso zzso zzso GE Medical Systems, zzso zzso All zzso studies were analyzed zzso by three observers, separately zzso zzso zzso A custom-made software package was designed for averaging the strain zzso of three consecutive cardiac zzso zzso of peak zzso strain, zzso strain and zzso zzso of the different segments of the left zzso were used for statistical zzso zzso zzso and zzso reliability were expressed as zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso zzso of peak strain, time to peak strain and time to zzso valve closure zzso were generally good to very good in all views and zzso except for in the zzso zzso zzso zzso were rated as very good for almost all zzso except for the zzso peak strain values of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were generally good for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso views, but fair to moderate for the segments of the zzso zzso view zzso We recommend use of the zzso view for zzso peak strain values, and the zzso and zzso zzso views for zzso and zzso peak strain zzso Furthermore, we strongly recommend using the average of three cardiac cycles for peak strain values in clinical zzso
