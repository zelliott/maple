zzso in the zzso genes is known to facilitate zzso zzso zzso a member of zzso zzso factors functions as a tumor zzso and has 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In human cancer cells, we identified an zzso deleted form of zzso zzso translated from a downstream start and 2 short zzso zzso proteins zzso and 101 zzso produced by zzso zzso 

We investigated the expression and role of these zzso zzso Cell zzso study revealed that short zzso zzso proteins were not zzso Though zzso protein expression was detected in the zzso and nucleus, zzso expressing cells did not show a zzso shuttling zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso we observed this shuttling in cells expressing either zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso lost the ability to zzso zzso or suppress zzso zzso gene zzso These zzso did not induce cancer cell death whereas zzso resulted in zzso We found that zzso and zzso suppress the zzso stimulation of zzso promoter in a dose dependent manner, indicating dominant negative zzso These zzso also inhibited zzso induction of zzso 

Loss of function by zzso zzso and the dominant negative activity of zzso zzso may provide a mechanism for enhanced survival of zzso zzso
