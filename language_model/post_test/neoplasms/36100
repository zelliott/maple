To zzso zzso dose rate radiation zzso zzso and consider potential implications for zzso 

A literature search of cellular zzso zzso was zzso Standard oxygen diffusion equations were used to estimate the time taken to replace zzso oxygen zzso zzso rates from conventional and novel methods of zzso zzso were considered, including spot scanning beam delivery, which zzso dose zzso 

The literature findings were that, for X-ray and electron dose rates of around zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso significantly changing the zzso of cells already in low oxygen tension zzso 3 zzso or zzso zzso The time taken to reverse the oxygen depletion of such cells is estimated to be over zzso s at distances of over 100 zzso from a zzso blood zzso In this time window, zzso have a higher hypoxic fraction zzso of reducing zzso zzso so the next application of radiation within the same fraction should be at a time that exceeds these estimates in the case of scanned beams or with zzso zzso zzso 

This study has potential implications for particle therapy, including zzso zzso where dose rate is greatly zzso Conventional zzso probably do not achieve the critical zzso zzso However, specific zzso oxygen depletion experiments using zzso and zzso beams are zzso
