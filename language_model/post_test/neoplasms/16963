This review is an update of a previously published review in the Cochrane Database of zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso pain is a transient zzso of pain that occurs either spontaneously or in relation to a specific predictable or unpredictable trigger despite relative stable and adequately controlled background zzso zzso pain usually related to background pain and is typically of rapid zzso severe in intensity and generally self limiting with a mean duration of 30 zzso zzso pain has traditionally been managed by the administration of supplemental oral analgesia zzso zzso at a dose zzso to the total zzso zzso zzso zzso 

To determine the efficacy of zzso analgesics given by any route, used for the management of breakthrough pain in patients with cancer, and to identify and zzso if data permitted, any adverse effects of this zzso 

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso zzso zzso and trial zzso in January 2005 for the original review, and again on 6 February 2013 for this zzso 

We included zzso controlled trials zzso of zzso used as rescue medication against active or zzso zzso in patients with cancer zzso zzso measures sought were reduction in pain intensity measured by an appropriate scale, adverse effects, attrition, patient satisfaction and quality of zzso We applied no language zzso 

Two review authors independently selected and examined eligible zzso We retrieved full text if any uncertainty about eligibility zzso We screened zzso zzso We conducted quality assessment and data extraction using zzso data zzso We compared drug and zzso dose, zzso route and zzso and recorded details of all outcome measures (if zzso 

The original review included four studies zzso zzso all concerned with the use of oral zzso zzso zzso zzso in the management of breakthrough zzso Two studies examined the zzso of zzso one study compared zzso versus zzso zzso and one study compared zzso versus zzso studies zzso zzso met the inclusion criteria for this zzso All studies reported on the utility of seven different zzso zzso zzso five of which were administered orally and two zzso Eight studies compared the zzso zzso zzso versus zzso four studies compared them with another zzso one study was a comparison of different doses of the same zzso and two were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were an effective treatment for breakthrough zzso When compared with zzso or oral zzso participants gave lower pain intensity and higher pain relief scores for zzso zzso zzso at all time zzso Global assessment scores also zzso zzso zzso zzso One study compared intravenous with the zzso route and both were zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso zzso is an effective treatment in the management of breakthrough zzso The zzso literature for the management of breakthrough pain is relatively zzso Given the importance of this subject, more trials, including head-to-head comparisons of the available zzso zzso zzso are zzso
