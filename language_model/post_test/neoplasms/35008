zzso zzso zzso were used to identify zzso membrane zzso on a new human zzso cell zzso zzso were constructed by fusing zzso mouse myeloma cells with zzso cells from zzso mice zzso by the human zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso that reacted to these zzso tumor cells by an indirect zzso A binding zzso Six cultures produced zzso binding selectively to the zzso tumor cells but not to a human zzso cell zzso These six zzso were zzso three were zzso and three were zzso zzso One zzso zzso 45, reacted with 4 of 7 human zzso cell lines but with only 1 of 11 zzso 1 of 3 zzso 4 of 11 zzso and 0 of 5 zzso zzso The other five zzso had a much broader zzso Using an zzso technique, zzso 45 bound to zzso zzso zzso but not to normal lung and zzso The specificity of zzso 45 for diffuse zzso and the low zzso with zzso and normal adjacent zzso suggest that this zzso may be clinically zzso
