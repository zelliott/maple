We aimed to measure mortality and cancer zzso in a cohort of zzso workers by using blood lead levels to assess zzso 

The cohort comprised male lead zzso zzso were matched to cancer and death zzso zzso death and cancer zzso rates were compared with population rates to obtain standardized mortality ratios zzso and standardized zzso ratios zzso 

There were zzso male subjects with average follow-up time of zzso years, and zzso deaths were zzso There were significant results for overall death zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system deaths zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and deaths from external causes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of zzso subjects had cancer, with an overall zzso of 83 zzso zzso zzso liver cancer zzso of 217 zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso of 240 zzso zzso zzso The latter was zzso greater zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso among those with a blood lead level result above 30 zzso compared with population zzso No other increases in zzso were zzso 

zzso mortality was zzso Although zzso rates of overall cancer were low, further studies and analysis are required to investigate any biologically plausible associations between zzso lead and liver or zzso zzso
