zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso cell surface zzso that is highly expressed on many human tumor zzso zzso zzso members in this class of zzso molecules facilitate tumor metabolism by zzso CO2 venting and zzso pH zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been proposed as a general therapeutic strategy to target zzso The recent characterization of zzso the first CA zzso zzso zzso zzso offered an opportunity to evaluate this strategy with regard to CA zzso zzso Using functional zzso we showed that zzso inhibited zzso CA activity in CA zzso cancer zzso zzso reduced zzso growth in zzso under culture conditions where CA zzso was active zzso alkaline zzso and where its zzso activity was likely zzso zzso restricted zzso zzso These in zzso results argued that the zzso exerted its zzso effect by acting on the zzso process, rather than on zzso binding per zzso zzso when administered in a mouse zzso model of human cancer, zzso exerted a significant delay on tumor zzso These results corroborate the notion that zzso CA is critical for cancer cell physiology and they establish the zzso efficacy of targeting CA zzso using an zzso zzso
