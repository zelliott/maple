zzso transition analysis is a method of modeling change over time in zzso zzso It has been used in the social sciences for many years, but not in nursing zzso 

The purposes of this study were to illustrate the utility of zzso transition analysis for nursing research by presenting a case example (a secondary analysis of data from a previously conducted zzso control trial testing the effectiveness of a tailored zzso intervention to decrease zzso zzso barriers to cancer pain zzso and to understand for whom and in what direction the tailored intervention resulted in change with respect to zzso barriers and pain zzso 

The model was developed by zzso defining a class structure on the basis of zzso barrier patterns, zzso adding demographic zzso and zzso pain zzso and zzso modeling and testing transitions across zzso 

There were two classes of zzso Low zzso and High zzso Older, less educated individuals were more likely to be in the High zzso class at Time zzso zzso in either class did not have different pain outcomes at the end of the zzso Of those individuals that zzso across classes, those who received the intervention were statistically more likely to move in a favorable direction (to the Low zzso zzso Furthermore, there is evidence that some individuals in the control group had zzso zzso 

The results from the example provide useful information about for whom and in what direction the intervention resulted in zzso zzso transition analysis is a valuable procedure for nurse researchers because it collapses large zzso of zzso data into meaningful zzso It is a flexible modeling procedure with extensions allowing further understanding of a change zzso
