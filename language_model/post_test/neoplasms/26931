The study objective was to evaluate the zzso characteristics and distribution of lower limb deep zzso zzso diagnosed by ultrasound among known cancer patients, in order to determine additional criteria that could be used to help select patients with zzso deep zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso 

From January zzso May 2012, standardized report forms zzso were entered into a zzso A total of zzso forms corresponding to cancer patients with suspected zzso zzso disease were selected from which zzso of deep zzso zzso were diagnosed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso distribution of zzso zzso were zzso 

For zzso with cancer, the zzso zzso zzso was: total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bilateral zzso zzso and multiple zzso sites zzso zzso The rate of clinical suspicion of pulmonary embolism was zzso zzso For zzso with zzso zzso zzso were nearly as frequent as zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso veins were almost equally concerned by zzso with respective rates of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso veins were concerned in zzso zzso zzso or floating clots occurred frequently in zzso common zzso external zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso mobile zzso and such unusual locations as zzso or superficial zzso are potentially indicators for selecting patients that may benefit from a cancer zzso because their zzso zzso could be due to zzso
