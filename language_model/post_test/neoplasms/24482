The zzso zzso tumor gene zzso is zzso in human primary leukemia and in a wide variety of solid zzso All of the four zzso zzso are expressed in primary zzso and each is considered to have a different zzso However, the functions of each of the zzso zzso in cancer cells remain zzso The present study demonstrated that zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso changes characterized by a zzso cell shape in zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso was zzso and cell migration and in zzso invasion were enhanced compared to that in mock zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso changes in five (one zzso one zzso two breast and one zzso of eight cancer cell lines zzso No zzso zzso other than the zzso zzso zzso induced the zzso zzso A decrease in zzso 1 and zzso expression and an increase in zzso expression were observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso 1 and zzso or zzso of zzso expression by small interfering zzso restored zzso zzso zzso zzso cells to a zzso that was comparable to that of the parent zzso zzso These results indicated that the zzso zzso zzso exerted its zzso functions through zzso of zzso zzso The present results may provide a novel insight into the signaling zzso of the zzso gene for its zzso zzso
