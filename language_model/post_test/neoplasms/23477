Cancer biologists seem to have overlooked tumor metabolism in their research endeavors over the last zzso of the last century, only to have zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso Science zzso zzso within the first decade of the zzso century, as well as to suggest the importance of other, zzso zzso pathways such as such as fatty acid de zzso synthesis and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso J Cancer zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Nat zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso pathways seem to be just as important as the Warburg effect, if not potentially more so in human zzso The purpose of this review is to highlight the importance of fatty acid metabolism in cancer cells and, where necessary, identify gaps in current knowledge and zzso hypothesis based upon findings in the cellular physiology of zzso diseases and normal zzso
