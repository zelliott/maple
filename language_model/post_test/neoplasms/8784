The optical spatial zzso of tumor zzso fluid zzso are zzso As a concentrated zzso suspension of interacting native zzso the zzso can develop internal ordering under zzso stress that may hinder delivery of zzso agents within zzso A systematic method is presented to characterize the zzso zzso zzso in a model suspension of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso spatial frequency zzso analysis so as to differentiate between jammed and fluid structural features in zzso transmission electron microscope zzso The zzso method addresses one obstacle faced in achieving quantitative zzso to zzso zzso that of detecting these zzso barriers to zzso such as would occur in the zzso space immediately surrounding target zzso
