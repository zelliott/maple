A novel zzso zzso named zzso zzso together with zzso zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso of Angelica zzso The chemical structure of new zzso was characterized by analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Among the isolated compounds, 13, 16, and 18 (each at 20 zzso could significantly promote the gene zzso function of nuclear zzso zzso While zzso 13, 14, and the new structure 1 (each at 20 zzso showed significant reduction in zzso gene zzso activities induced by zzso zzso The findings indicated that these zzso skeleton derivatives might hold beneficial effects on zzso such as cancer and zzso diseases, due to their potential activities on regulating the zzso zzso function of zzso
