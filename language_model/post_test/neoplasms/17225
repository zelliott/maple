During the course of zzso cancer zzso zzso cells undergo dynamic and zzso transitions between multiple zzso states, the extremes of which are defined by the expression of zzso and zzso zzso This plasticity is enabled by underlying shifts in zzso zzso A small cohort of zzso acting zzso factors is widely recognized to effect these shifts by controlling the expression of a constituency of key target zzso These master regulators depend on complex zzso regulatory mechanisms, notably the induction of changes in the modifications of zzso zzso in order to achieve the widespread changes in gene expression observed during zzso transitions zzso These associations indicate that an understanding of the functional interactions between such zzso zzso factors and the zzso of zzso zzso will provide crucial insights into the fundamental mechanisms underlying cancer progression and may, in the longer term, generate new diagnostic and therapeutic zzso for treating high-grade zzso
