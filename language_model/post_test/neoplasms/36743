In this early Phase II study, the authors investigated the efficacy of zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso in 17 patients with zzso solid tumors or solitary zzso in terms of response rates and overall zzso 

zzso patients zzso age, 60 zzso with either zzso drug-resistant tumors or tumors known to be primarily zzso were entered into the zzso After zzso determination of the tumor volume, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was injected into the central part of the tumor under zzso zzso zzso investigations included serial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso zzso into zzso tumors resulted in remarkable zzso The median survival of all patients was 13 months zzso zzso zzso The response rate was zzso (12 zzso A complete zzso was seen in 7 patients zzso and the rate of partial zzso was zzso (5 zzso However, 5 patients zzso did not respond to the zzso In one patient zzso was observed, but no other side effects were zzso Important zzso and zzso changes within the tumor tissue were demonstrated in solitary liver zzso of gastrointestinal zzso excised in zzso zzso In all cases zzso formation of a zzso within the area of central activity, surrounded by a zzso zzso ring and a marginal zzso structure, was zzso 

Lack of persistent systemic or local side effects, as well as noteworthy zzso are properties of this optimal regional treatment zzso with zzso zzso zzso This zzso deserves consideration for further clinical zzso
