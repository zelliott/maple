To study the evolution of zzso damage from past exposure to high zzso of zzso and its health significance, zzso aberrations zzso in zzso were zzso after approximately 20 years in four subjects with past severe zzso and in seven controls studied in the late zzso Increased zzso aberrations were still present up to 30 years after zzso zzso but blood counts were zzso The vital status at the end of 1993 was zzso for 32 subjects with a history of zzso toxicity and for 31 controls studied for CA from 1965 to 1970, who differed significantly for CA zzso Of the 32 zzso subjects, 1 was lost to zzso 20 were still alive, and 11 had died at ages 36 to 83, between 1 and 20 years after the last CA zzso Five deaths were from zzso zzso zzso brain zzso cancer of zzso zzso zzso zzso The decreased subjects had significantly higher rates of zzso aberrations than those alive, and those who died of zzso had the highest rates of these aberrations in the last study before death or diagnosis of zzso Out of the 31 controls, 12 had died from 4 to 23 years after the CA zzso Three deaths were from zzso zzso lung cancer, one brain zzso Even if this is a small sample, the results suggest a higher risk of cancer for the zzso zzso who had persistently high CA rates in zzso
