There is an increased amount of evidence to suggest that viruses play important roles in the development of certain types of human zzso These include the zzso B virus in zzso zzso human zzso in cervical cancer, zzso virus in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and human zzso virus in adult T cell leukemia and zzso cell zzso These pieces of evidence have accumulated from both clinical and basic studies which have shown that these viruses are involved in some stage of the zzso zzso Because of the rapid development of techniques and knowledge of molecular biology, most of the gene structures of these viruses and their products have been zzso These results make it possible to understand more clearly the route of infection and have facilitated the production of vaccines, using zzso zzso A significant decrease in the zzso of these types of zzso is expected through prevention programs conducted throughout the general population against these viruses within 10 to 20 zzso These zzso human zzso also provide us with a good opportunity to understand the basic mechanisms involved in the development of human zzso in zzso In the present paper, these points are stressed in addition to describing the recent progress made in the study on zzso human zzso
