Recent zzso and zzso studies have shown the existence of at least four distinct types of human zzso zzso causing benign skin zzso These viruses show hardly no zzso zzso their zzso differ by their sensitivity to restriction zzso and show little, if any, sequence zzso as detected by molecular zzso using complementary zzso transcribed in zzso Data on the zzso of zzso are still incomplete but indicate that some types of benign skin zzso zzso zzso common zzso flat zzso may be zzso associated with some types of zzso Most interesting is that zzso zzso has been found associated with two types of virus, and that zzso conversion of some zzso has been observed in all the patients infected with one of zzso This suggests that at least a zzso may have a higher zzso potential, as do rabbit zzso zzso and bovine zzso tract zzso Much remains to be known on human zzso and further studies may lead to the characterization of additional types of zzso especially in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whose zzso conversion, although rare, may be zzso Progress in this field has been and remains hampered by the lack of cell culture systems allowing replication of these highly host and tissue specific zzso and by the widely variable virus content of the different human zzso known to be associated with a zzso Further studies are warranted by the possible role of these widespread and zzso viruses in the origin of some zzso in zzso
