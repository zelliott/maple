Recently we have shown the zzso activity of zzso zzso fruit extract zzso on various solid zzso and zzso cell lines as well as primary cultured bone zzso cells isolated from patients with acute and chronic zzso zzso We further studied whether the growth zzso effect of zzso involves basic zzso growth factor zzso in cancer cell lines including breast cancer zzso zzso cancer zzso and prostate cancer zzso We also investigated whether zzso could alter the production of zzso oxide zzso pattern from these cancer cell zzso Growth zzso zzso was zzso by zzso B protein zzso zzso zzso linked zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso the total zzso zzso The amount of NO zzso into culture medium in terms of zzso zzso concentration was measured by the zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso could stimulate total zzso protein level which was zzso zzso NO production was also zzso from these cancer cell lines after treating with zzso Both of the zzso in total zzso and NO levels were correlated with the degree of growth zzso Changes involving cell shrinkage and detachment of cancer cells could readily be zzso Taken together, our results here suggest that growth zzso induced by zzso in these solid zzso cell lines may involve both zzso and NO zzso
