Major zzso complex class I molecules play a central role in the immune response against a variety of cells that have undergone zzso transformation by shaping the zzso repertoire and presenting zzso zzso from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor or zzso cells are present on class I major zzso complex zzso peptides that are derived from zzso zzso or zzso zzso Due to their unique zzso such major zzso zzso complexes are a desirable target for novel approaches in zzso zzso delivery of toxins or other zzso drugs to cells which express specific major zzso zzso complexes that are involved in the immune response against cancer or viral infections would allow for a specific zzso treatment of these zzso It has recently been demonstrated that zzso with the zzso major zzso zzso specificity of zzso can be generated by taking advantage of the selection power of zzso display zzso In addition to their tumor targeting capabilities, zzso that mimic the fine specificity of zzso receptors can serve as valuable research zzso that enable study of human class I zzso zzso complex zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules may prove to be useful tools for studying major zzso complex class I zzso presentation in health and disease as well as for therapeutic purposes in cancer, infectious diseases and zzso zzso
