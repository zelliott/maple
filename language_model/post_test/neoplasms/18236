Men diagnosed with zzso are often referred for zzso banking to preserve their fertility prior to cancer zzso The chances of cancer patients for achieving future zzso will be determined by the zzso quality including the integrity of the zzso material in the frozen zzso The objectives of this study were to compare the zzso quality and DNA integrity in men diagnosed with zzso and systemic zzso before receiving treatment and to identify the optimum zzso protocol for their samples including a remote zzso collection zzso In comparison with fertile donors, patients with zzso zzso had significantly lower zzso zzso while both zzso and systemic zzso patients had significantly lower zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, the zzso defined DNA fragmentation index was significantly higher in patients with zzso and systemic zzso compared with fertile zzso It was noted that the extent of deterioration in zzso quality and DNA integrity seen in cancer patients did not reach the previously defined statistical threshold for impaired zzso zzso zzso with the seminal plasma offers the highest protection against zzso Nevertheless, remote zzso collection can still be used as it yields adequate zzso
