This zzso controlled study evaluates the influence of zzso on the zzso and dosage requirements of zzso in 33 infants and children with cancer (age zzso zzso zzso years, mean zzso zzso compared with 31 patients without cancer (age zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients in the zzso group required a zzso dosage regimen of zzso zzso zzso zzso to attain a mean peak serum zzso concentration zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a mean trough zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients without cancer in the control group required a mean zzso dosage regimen of zzso zzso zzso zzso to attain a mean peak zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a mean trough zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparative analysis of zzso data revealed an increase in zzso clearance zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group as compared with that zzso zzso zzso zzso in the control zzso There were no significant differences with respect to the mean values of volume of distribution between two groups zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso performance of the zzso program indicated that final sets of peak and trough zzso were predicted with minimal bias and accurate precision in both study zzso This study showed that the presence of zzso in infants and children increased zzso clearance resulting in larger dosage zzso
