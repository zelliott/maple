LDL cholesterol zzso zzso was associated with increased cancer risk in type 2 zzso We explored the 1) interaction between low LDL cholesterol and zzso and 2) interaction between zzso of these two risk factors and zzso use for cancer in type 2 zzso 

We analyzed prospective data for zzso Chinese type 2 diabetic patients who remained zzso for zzso treatment and zzso patients in whom zzso treatment was initiated during a median follow-up period of zzso zzso All patients were free of cancer at zzso Biological interactions were estimated using relative excess risk due to interaction zzso attributable proportion due to interaction zzso and zzso index zzso zzso zzso 0, zzso zzso 0, or S zzso 1 indicates biological zzso 

In zzso zzso type 2 diabetic patients, zzso of low LDL cholesterol and zzso increased cancer risk by zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso with significant biological interactions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the whole cohort of zzso type 2 diabetic patients, there was interaction between zzso of statins and zzso of low LDL cholesterol and zzso with increased cancer risk zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with LDL cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso had a zzso risk of cancer compared with zzso users with or without both risk zzso 

In type 2 diabetes, there was interaction between low LDL cholesterol and zzso with increased cancer zzso The latter was attenuated in the presence of zzso zzso
