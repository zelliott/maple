zzso 1 is thought to represent about zzso of the total human zzso and the 85 zzso so far identified may constitute about zzso of the genes present on this zzso The existence of at least 22 zzso sufficiently zzso in Europeans to be useful as genetic markers has allowed the construction of an elementary genetic zzso This permits comparisons with physical and zzso maps and has demonstrated striking zzso between different regions of zzso 1 and mouse zzso 1, 3, and zzso The existence of a map should be of great help in developing a more systematic approach to further mapping zzso A wide range of disease can be attributed to zzso variation on zzso 1 and the zzso with the mouse may be useful in predicting the position of other genes involved in human zzso zzso of this zzso are a common finding in many different types of zzso Loss of material from the short arm and zzso of one or more of the four zzso in this region may play an important role in the later stages of zzso zzso zzso markers of all kinds will be useful in the future for investigating the zzso events which have occurred during the zzso zzso
