zzso zzso binding was examined on eight human cell lines derived from zzso breast and zzso tract zzso zzso and zzso zzso binding was detected in five of these cell zzso In the richest cell line zzso derived from small cell lung zzso zzso zzso bound with a high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso to an apparently homogeneous population of binding site zzso zzso zzso sites per zzso These sites displayed a typical zzso zzso established with several zzso zzso and zzso selective of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso and zzso zzso distinguished zzso and zzso sites, suggesting that the binding sites are associated with a zzso The biological significance and the possible diagnostic implication of the presence of zzso receptors on these cell lines are zzso
