We previously identified zzso zzso arrest and DNA damage protein 34) by screening for genes involved in zzso and/or cellular zzso in zzso rat zzso zzso zzso which exhibit zzso growth and do not zzso In the current study, we found that zzso of zzso cells with a zzso zzso expressing zzso suppressed their zzso Furthermore, we observed that zzso derived from zzso mice zzso zzso did not undergo zzso Whereas the expression of zzso was decreased in zzso zzso zzso its expression was rescued in these cells by zzso expression of zzso by zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso contributes to the regulation of zzso zzso and that it suppresses cellular proliferation through the induction of cellular zzso
