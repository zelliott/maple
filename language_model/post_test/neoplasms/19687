zzso zzso analyses offer a systematic way to investigate protein zzso in disease and, as such, can be a powerful tool for the identification of novel zzso Here, we analyzed zzso data from a transgenic mouse model with zzso zzso of activated zzso zzso which results in severe cardiac zzso We applied statistically filtering and false discovery rate correction methods to identify 52 proteins that were significantly different in the zzso hearts compared to zzso zzso zzso analysis consisted of comparison of these 52 zzso proteins to another zzso zzso of heart failure, three available independent zzso zzso and correlation of their expression with the human plasma and urine zzso Following this filtering strategy, four proteins passed these selection criteria, including zzso heavy chain 7, zzso growth zzso protein 7, zzso zzso and zzso We assessed expression levels of these proteins in mouse plasma by zzso and observed significantly different levels of expression between healthy and failing mice for all four zzso We verified zzso zzso by examining human cardiac zzso tissue by zzso Finally, we assessed protein levels in plasma samples obtained from four unaffected and four heart failure patients and demonstrated that all four proteins increased between twofold and zzso in heart zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are all excellent candidate plasma zzso of heart failure in mouse and zzso
