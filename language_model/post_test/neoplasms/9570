To determine the maximum tolerated dose zzso zzso toxicity zzso and zzso of zzso zzso a zzso 10 zzso in Japanese patients with advanced solid tumors when administered on days 1 and 8 in zzso zzso 

zzso patients had advanced solid tumors that failed to respond to standard therapy or for which no standard therapy was available, and also met the following criteria: prior chemotherapy zzso or zzso 2 regimens, Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group zzso performance status zzso or zzso 1, and acceptable organ zzso The zzso was defined as the highest dose at which no more than one of six patients experienced a zzso during course zzso zzso samples were collected in courses 1 and zzso 

zzso patients were enrolled in the present zzso Three doses zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso was the principal zzso at doses of zzso and zzso zzso In addition, one patient also experienced grade 3 pneumonia with zzso and another patient experienced grade 3 zzso zzso grade 4 zzso and zzso as zzso at zzso zzso zzso the most frequent zzso zzso was improved by administration of additional saline after zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso at which zzso was not observed in a total of nine zzso The zzso profile did not differ from that for the European zzso One patient with zzso zzso cancer achieved partial response, and each of two patients with zzso cell lung cancer had a minor zzso 

When zzso was administered on days 1 and 8 in zzso courses to Japanese patients, the zzso was zzso zzso and was lower than the value of zzso zzso in European zzso However, zzso activity was observed at low zzso zzso was tolerated well at the zzso without grade 3 zzso zzso or zzso up to grade zzso zzso is a promising new zzso zzso inhibitor that requires further investigation in phase II zzso
