We examined trends in the zzso of the 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cervical zzso among human zzso virus zzso patients relative to the general population between 1992 and 2009 in France, focusing on age at zzso diagnosis and on patients with controlled viral load and restored immunity on combination zzso therapy zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso rates were estimated in patients enrolled in the French hospital database on zzso and in the general population in France during 4 calendar periods zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso were calculated for all periods and separately for patients on zzso with zzso counts zzso zzso for at least 2 years and viral load zzso zzso 

Although the zzso of zzso fell significantly across the calendar zzso the risk remained constantly higher in zzso patients than in the general zzso In patients with restored zzso the relative risk remained significantly elevated for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and was similar to that of the general population for NHL zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were diagnosed at a younger age in zzso patients, with a particularly marked difference for NHL zzso years, P zzso zzso 

The zzso of all zzso continued to fall, including cervical cancer, in the zzso period, but the risk remained higher than in the general population in zzso In patients with zzso restored zzso zzso remained significantly more frequent than in the general zzso
