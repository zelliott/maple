A total of 258 zzso were performed in 79 patients with zzso zzso after zzso of peripheral blood stem cells zzso with zzso human zzso zzso factor zzso zzso products were examined for viable zzso cell zzso zzso cell, and zzso cell zzso The number of zzso in zzso differs in zzso of patients with different zzso However, the number of zzso or zzso cells is dependent on age and amount of chemotherapy delivered to patients before collection rather than on the nature of the disease zzso In addition, the actual dose of zzso used to mobilize zzso and the number of zzso in zzso influenced the zzso of zzso cells, although the daily dose of zzso seems to play little role on the number of zzso cells in each individual zzso zzso zzso cell and zzso (or zzso numbers are related zzso and the relation can be described as zzso However, the linear relation varies in different patient groups, and most of the zzso is induced by the highest sets of zzso We conclude that zzso with low doses of zzso alone is feasible and that the probability of collecting a high number of peripheral blood zzso is increased in young patients undergoing zzso early in the course of the zzso Although the relationship between zzso cells and zzso can be described as linear in zzso situations, its relevance may be limited because it is not a universal zzso
