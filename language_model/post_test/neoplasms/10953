zzso is the zzso zzso in the zzso pathway, zzso zzso to zzso zzso depletion by zzso tumors is a common mechanism of immune evasion inducing regulatory T cells and zzso zzso T zzso Because zzso cells cannot zzso zzso it remains unclear how zzso tumor cells overcome the zzso effects of local zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso tumor cells express a novel zzso acid zzso which accounts for zzso of the zzso zzso The induced zzso is zzso distinguished from the zzso expressed zzso zzso System L by increased resistance to zzso of System zzso resistance to zzso by high zzso of most zzso acids tested, and high zzso specificity for zzso Under conditions of low zzso zzso expression of this novel zzso significantly increases zzso entry into zzso tumors relative to zzso zzso through the zzso System L alone, and further decreases zzso levels in the zzso zzso this additional zzso zzso could be a way of pharmacological zzso of zzso tumor zzso These findings highlight the ability of zzso tumor cells to thrive in a zzso zzso by expressing a novel, highly zzso zzso which is resistant to zzso by most other zzso zzso The additional zzso allows tumor cells to strike the ideal balance between supply of zzso essential for their own proliferation and survival, and depleting the zzso milieu of zzso to inhibit T cell zzso
