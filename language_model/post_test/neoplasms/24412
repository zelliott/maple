zzso zzso are currently being considered for the treatment of zzso zzso Based on in zzso studies, it has been speculated that only a few zzso hits to the cell nucleus are considered zzso However, such estimates do not consider the zzso variations in the number of zzso hits, energy zzso or in the cell survival process zzso Using a zzso control probability zzso model for zzso zzso we derive an estimate of the average number of hits to the cell nucleus required to provide a high probability of zzso a zzso cell zzso In simulation studies, our results demonstrate that the average number of hits required to achieve a zzso zzso for zzso zzso cells ranges from 18 to zzso Those cells that have large cell zzso high zzso and zzso emissions occurring primarily in the zzso tended to require more zzso As the clinical zzso of zzso zzso is considered, this type of analysis may be useful in interpreting clinical results and in designing treatment strategies to achieve a zzso therapeutic zzso
