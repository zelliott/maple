Only a few markers have been instrumental in the diagnosis of zzso In contrast, tumor markers play a critical role in the monitoring of zzso The patient's clinical status and response to treatment can be evaluated rapidly using the tumor marker zzso zzso and the tumor marker doubling time zzso This report reviews the interest of determining these kinetic parameters for zzso zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso and CA zzso A rise in tumor markers zzso is a zzso with which benign diseases can be distinguished from zzso disease, and the zzso can be used to assess the efficacy of zzso A decline in the tumor marker concentration zzso is a predictor of possible residual disease if the timing of blood sampling is soon after zzso The discrepancies in results obtained by different groups may be attributable to the zzso of zzso the intrinsic characteristics of each marker zzso zzso zzso molecular zzso and associated zzso individual factors zzso zzso increases and zzso and zzso zzso and methods used to calculate zzso zzso exponential models and timing of blood zzso This kinetic approach could be of interest to zzso patient zzso
