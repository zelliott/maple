The introduction of gene expression profiling has resulted in the production of rich human data sets with potential for deciphering tumor diagnosis, zzso and zzso Here we demonstrate how artificial neural networks zzso can be applied to two completely different zzso platforms zzso and zzso or a combination of both, to build tumor zzso capable of deciphering the identity of most human zzso First, 78 tumors representing eight different types of zzso similar zzso were evaluated with a zzso zzso zzso and correctly classified by a zzso zzso using independent training and test sets, with a mean accuracy of zzso To expand our approach, zzso data derived from six independent performance sites, representing 463 tumors and 21 tumor types, were zzso zzso and zzso An zzso zzso trained on a random fraction of the tumors zzso zzso zzso was zzso accurate in predicting known pathological origin of the remaining fraction of tumors zzso zzso zzso not exposed to the training zzso Finally, a zzso zzso using a combination of both zzso and zzso zzso data from seven performance sites, zzso and scaled from a large and diverse tumor set zzso zzso zzso produced similar results zzso zzso on independent test zzso Further validation of our zzso was achieved by accurately zzso predicting the known primary site of origin for an independent set of zzso zzso zzso zzso 50), zzso from brain, zzso and liver, potentially addressing the zzso zzso problems imposed by unknown primary zzso These zzso and zzso zzso provide a first proof of principle that data derived from multiple platforms and performance sites can be exploited to build zzso tumor zzso
