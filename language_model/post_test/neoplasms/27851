Twenty patients were treated with chemotherapy to mobilize zzso into the zzso zzso blood stem cells were zzso in peripheral blood or zzso products using colony zzso and flow zzso measurement of zzso zzso In four patients where complete sets of serial samples were zzso the appearance of zzso cells preceded the increase in zzso by zzso zzso Peak levels of zzso cells ranged from zzso and coincided with the peak increase in zzso zzso zzso cells contained zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells expressing zzso zzso or zzso represent committed zzso zzso In contrast to bone zzso zzso cells, few mobilized zzso cells expressed zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of zzso greater than 500 zzso zzso at a median of 13 days and zzso greater than 50 zzso zzso at a median of 15 days was observed in patients zzso with mobilized zzso These data indicate that zzso cells mobilized during recovery from chemotherapy are predominantly zzso in zzso and contain few actively zzso cells or cells with zzso zzso
