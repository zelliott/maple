Inspired by the therapeutic potential of the simplified zzso zzso we have developed a chemical strategy for zzso novel zzso zzso zzso through a zzso zzso cascade zzso The origin of zzso has been explained using the zzso zzso We have further evaluated the cell proliferation and zzso zzso activities of these compounds and studied their binding mode with zzso by molecular zzso The results suggested that the zzso scaffold provides a suitable modification site and the introduction of a zzso zzso leads to improvement in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso compound zzso exhibited an zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso studies with zzso showed that the zzso compounds induce zzso and cell cycle S phase arrest in zzso zzso
