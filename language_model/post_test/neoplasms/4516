A deep heating zzso device zzso (a zzso zzso consisting of three independent, zzso loaded horn zzso operating in phase at 300 zzso was zzso The heating characteristics produced by this zzso system were analyzed by means of zzso zzso cards and a modified zzso zzso for Devices and Regulatory Health) elliptical zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were used, simulating high and low zzso zzso zzso and zzso These equivalent zzso were made of zzso zzso The zzso heating pattern analysis showed a central heating of 1/3 of maximum heating at a depth of 10 zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Also more uniform zzso zzso were generated in muscle equivalent material than those in zzso
