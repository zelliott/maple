Genome studies have zzso cancer research in recent years as zzso technologies can now be used to identify sets of genes potentially related with different processes in zzso However, managing all this data and zzso it into useful zzso is still a challenge in the zzso zzso Finding relationships between the molecular and zzso information and the clinical information available, within the medical zzso domain, is currently driving the development of zzso research in zzso The zzso and complexity of the molecular information, the poor adherence to standards, together with the fast evolution of the experimental techniques, pose obvious challenges for the development of integrated molecular zzso In zzso restricted access to medical information together with the gaps in the development of standard zzso are typical limitations in the area of medical zzso The development of research projects combining medical and molecular information together with the current efforts to zzso and integrate databases and zzso are described in this review as a demonstration of the fruitful activity in this zzso
