A zzso based on zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso has been designed and employed for effectively killing drug-resistant zzso zzso This zzso zzso was readily prepared through zzso interaction of zzso and zzso zzso zzso being zzso as zzso It revealed an improved stability in zzso conditions as compared to native zzso Besides, zzso could efficiently load zzso zzso an zzso drug, with drug loading capacity of zzso zzso zzso and liberate the drug with a zzso zzso Cell viability zzso indicated that the zzso displayed lower zzso against zzso cells as compared to native zzso zzso zzso however, revealed more efficient killing effect in the cells than free zzso because the zzso caused a higher amount of zzso accumulated in the zzso The results of this study highlight that the zzso has high potential for killing drug-resistant cancer zzso
