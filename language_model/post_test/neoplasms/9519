Assessing tumor zzso before and during radiation therapy can be a crucial element in decision-making with regard to zzso However, no known zzso test is available at present, which allows for a reliable evaluation of the zzso of a tissue subjected to zzso Among tests being zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is considered to be a promising zzso The purpose of this review is to identify the tests and research paths that have recently been explored for the evaluation of tumor response to treatment after zzso labeling revealed by nuclear zzso The majority of the explored zzso are based on the indirect evaluation of the zzso by cell proliferation or zzso tissue zzso or zzso intrinsic zzso of zzso cells, tumor metabolism and zzso The development of such methods would permit the adoption of a therapeutic regimen with respect to a given zzso of a zzso zzso a given therapeutic strategy could be zzso (by zzso for instance, a zzso of hypoxic zzso or even modified if it proved to be inadequate or when it presents an zzso zzso zzso We present here a critical review of the zzso revealed by nuclear imaging that are developed for zzso zzso
