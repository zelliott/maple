The feasibility of drug monitoring of serum zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso during chronic zzso therapy is not zzso One important factor relevant to drug monitoring is to what extent zzso zzso and zzso serum zzso zzso during stable zzso zzso 

We included zzso patients admitted to a zzso care unit receiving oral zzso zzso zzso zzso or continuous subcutaneous zzso zzso infusions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were obtained at the same time on four consecutive zzso If zzso the patients were followed for another trial zzso zzso variations in serum zzso and ratios were determined by zzso the percent zzso of variation zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The patients' median zzso doses were 90 zzso zzso zzso h and 135 zzso zzso zzso h during oral and zzso administration, zzso zzso fluctuations of serum zzso estimated by median zzso of day-to-day variation were in the oral group for zzso zzso for zzso zzso and for zzso zzso The median zzso of variation were lower in patients receiving continuous zzso zzso infusions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

These findings indicate that serum zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The fluctuations found in our study are not explained by changes in zzso doses, administration of other drugs or by time for collection of blood zzso As expected the day-to-day variation was lower in patients receiving continuous zzso zzso infusions compared with patients receiving oral zzso
