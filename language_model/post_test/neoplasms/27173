In this paper, a mathematical model for chemotherapy that takes tumor zzso interactions into account is considered for a strongly targeted zzso We use a classical model originally formulated by zzso but replace exponential tumor growth with a zzso zzso growth model function depending on a zzso zzso This growth function zzso between a zzso model (in the limit v zzso zzso and an exponential model (in the limit v zzso zzso The dynamics is zzso and zzso and their stability will be investigated depending on the zzso zzso Except for small values of zzso the system has both an zzso stable microscopic zzso equilibrium point and an zzso stable zzso zzso equilibrium zzso The corresponding regions of attraction are separated by the stable zzso of a zzso The optimal control problem of moving an initial condition that lies in the zzso region into the benign region is formulated and the structure of optimal singular controls is zzso
