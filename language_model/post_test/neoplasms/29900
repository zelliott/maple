Some zzso studies have suggested an inverse relation between serum cholesterol concentration and mortality from zzso Two hypotheses that might explain such a relation were zzso To zzso potentially deleterious effects of zzso on cell zzso the zzso content and fluidity of blood zzso cells were measured in healthy male volunteers with a wide range of serum cholesterol concentration zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cholesterol content, and the ratio of cholesterol to zzso were unrelated to serum cholesterol and to low density zzso cholesterol zzso Similar zzso were made on zzso and zzso cells incubated with a range of zzso of low density zzso fluidity was altered only at extremely low zzso suggesting that changes in cell zzso are unlikely to occur at serum cholesterol zzso zzso by dietary or drug treatment of zzso In the same population direct relations were confirmed between low density zzso concentration and plasma zzso of zzso and beta zzso This is compatible with the suggestion that an association between low cholesterol concentration and cancer may be secondary to a relation between low zzso zzso and zzso
