zzso is the cellular counterpart of the first identified viral zzso zzso It forms part of a large family of zzso zzso zzso that have been extensively studied over the last few zzso This has led to the realization that zzso can regulate a number of signaling pathways that impact on the behavior of tumor cells, including zzso survival, migration, invasion, and zzso There are currently four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in clinical development, and although there is a plethora of information on their activity in zzso models their clinical efficacy has been zzso Here we review the current status of the zzso zzso and highlight the difficulties involved in assessing these zzso in the clinical zzso In the future it will be important to combine our knowledge of basic zzso biology with the use of appropriate zzso models to aid the design of clinical zzso Taking this integrated approach will hopefully help to realize the true potential of zzso zzso zzso
