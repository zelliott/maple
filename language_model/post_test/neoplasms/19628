zzso with exactly the same genetic background, behavior, environment, zzso may have differences in cancer risk due to a different number of cells on the way to zzso These differences are estimated zzso by using the zzso zzso expansion zzso For liver cancer the estimated relative risk for persons without intermediate cells at age 40 is less than zzso when compared to the risk of the total population, while the top zzso risk group has a more than zzso risk compared to the zzso The risk of the zzso zzso in risk is more than zzso of the risk of the more than zzso persons without intermediate zzso The number of intermediate zzso cells in the risk groups cannot be calculated from zzso data only because they depend strongly on a zzso zzso But under plausible zzso less than about 1,000 intermediate cells are present at age 40 even in high-risk zzso
