The ability to invade tissue is one of the hallmarks of zzso Cancer cells achieve this through the zzso of zzso degrading zzso cell zzso loss of zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso and active zzso Invasion of tissue by the cancer cells is one of the key components in the zzso zzso zzso cancer cells spread to distant parts of the host and initiate the growth of secondary zzso zzso A better understanding of the complex processes involved in cancer invasion may ultimately lead to treatments being developed which can zzso cancer and prevent zzso In this paper we formulate a novel zzso model of cancer cell invasion of tissue which explicitly incorporates the important biological processes of zzso and zzso zzso This is achieved using zzso zzso terms in a system of partial differential equations where the cells use a so-called zzso zzso to detect their zzso We show that in the limit as zzso the zzso model zzso to a related system of zzso zzso A zzso exploration of this model using zzso simulations shows that it can form the basis for future models incorporating more details of the invasion zzso
