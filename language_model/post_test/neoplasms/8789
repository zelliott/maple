In Japan, zzso cancer zzso data are reported several years behind the latest year of cancer mortality zzso To bridge this zzso we aimed to determine a short-term projection method for cancer zzso 

Data between 1985 and 2007 were obtained from the zzso cancer zzso in four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Three projection models were zzso generalized linear model with age and period (A + P zzso generalized linear model with age, period and their interactions zzso zzso and generalized additive model with age, period and their interactions smoothed by zzso zzso zzso We performed a zzso projection for the years 2000 and 2005, based on the data of zzso and zzso zzso Seven cancer sites zzso liver, zzso zzso female breast, zzso zzso and zzso and all zzso combined were zzso The accuracy of projection was evaluated by whether each observed number fell within the zzso confidence zzso of the projected zzso 

The zzso zzso model accurately projected 8 of 13 cancer zzso combinations, whereas the number of zzso combinations of accurate projection was 2 and 6 for A + P linear and zzso linear models, zzso For liver and zzso zzso the zzso zzso model alone performed accurate zzso the relative differences between projected and observed numbers of cancer zzso ranged between zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso for the other two zzso All three models failed to project sudden increases in prostate cancer between 2000 and zzso 

The zzso zzso model is a candidate method for the projection of cancer zzso in zzso However, we need a continuous validation for prostate zzso
