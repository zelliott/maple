The development of hypoxic zzso within many types of solid tumors zzso a significant stress on cancer cells to which they must respond appropriately in order to survive and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso IX zzso is a component of the complex response of cancer cells to the evolving low oxygen zzso Here, we discuss evidence from in zzso tumor models employing zzso or enhancement of zzso zzso using gene depletion or zzso strategies, respectively, or zzso of its zzso activity, using zzso small molecules or zzso to demonstrate that zzso is a functional zzso of tumor growth and zzso We also discuss the functional contribution of zzso to several specific biological processes critical for cancer zzso including pH regulation and cell survival, zzso migration and invasion, the maintenance of cancer stem cell function, and the acquisition of zzso and zzso zzso The demonstration of zzso as a functional zzso of cancer progression provides a biological rationale for its use as a zzso clinically relevant therapeutic zzso
