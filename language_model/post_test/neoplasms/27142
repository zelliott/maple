The zzso protein family is involved in zzso cell maturation and zzso Some zzso members are zzso during zzso and have been established as tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are highly zzso proteins that have been first described in zzso which is characterized by disturbed zzso maturation and chronic zzso Despite their zzso both zzso proteins are distinct in expression and function through different receptors but zzso as zzso and zzso zzso to promote zzso zzso and zzso are further regulated with tumor progression in zzso zzso In tumor cells, high zzso expression of zzso and zzso may prevent zzso activity, whereas their nuclear zzso and zzso zzso are associated with tumor progression and poor zzso The present review outlines these opposing effects of zzso and zzso in zzso pathways and mechanisms that are known to affect tumor cells zzso tumor environment zzso and tumor cell zzso zzso thereby influencing zzso zzso
