Although cancer progression is primarily driven by the expansion of tumor cells, the tumor zzso and zzso immunity also play important zzso zzso we consider how tumors can become established by escaping immune surveillance and also how cancer cells can be rendered visible to the immune system by standard therapies such as zzso or chemotherapy, either alone or in combination with additional immune zzso Although local zzso results in DNA damage zzso zzso it is also capable of inducing zzso forms of tumor cell death which are associated with a release of immune zzso danger signals zzso zzso such as zzso zzso tumor cells may result from continued exposure to death stimuli and/or an impaired zzso zzso dependent clearance of the dying tumor zzso In such circumstances, mature zzso cells take up tumor zzso and mediate the induction of zzso and innate zzso zzso zzso systemic immune zzso can also lead to a spontaneous zzso of tumors or zzso that are outside the radiation field - an effect which is termed zzso zzso studies have demonstrated that combining zzso with immune stimulation can induce zzso zzso Given that it takes time for immunity to develop following exposure to zzso tumor cells, we propose practical combination therapies that should be considered as a basis for future research and clinical zzso It is essential that radiation zzso become more aware of the importance of the immune system to the success of cancer zzso
