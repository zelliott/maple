It is known that the number of zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso and zzso increase with tumor growth and zzso play a role in the escape of tumor cells from zzso in zzso mice and cancer zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso suppress immune responses in zzso mice have not been completely zzso In the present study, we investigated the function of zzso zzso freshly isolated from zzso mice and zzso zzso differentiated in zzso by zzso Freshly isolated zzso zzso were divided into two groups depending on zzso zzso zzso high zzso and intermediate zzso Freshly isolated zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso from zzso mice reduced production of zzso in zzso T cells, but neither zzso zzso zzso nor zzso zzso isolated from zzso mice zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso differentiated in zzso by zzso inhibited production of zzso in both zzso and zzso T zzso In addition, the differentiated zzso zzso one-third of which were zzso cells, and their culture zzso suppressed zzso responses of T cells zzso by zzso zzso but the differentiated zzso zzso and their culture zzso did zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso are altered to zzso cells in tumor circumstances and that they are differentiated by zzso progressively into zzso cells with further zzso activity against T zzso
