Two zzso methods used to collect zzso stem cells from peripheral blood were compared in eight patients with a variety of zzso The standard zzso collection method was zzso with the zzso zzso or zzso surge zzso The number of zzso cells zzso and zzso the red cell volume, and the number of zzso cells in each collection were assessed as well as the changes in circulating zzso zzso and blood zzso produced by each zzso zzso There was no statistically significant difference found in the number of zzso cells collected with either method, but the number of zzso cells collected with the standard procedure was significantly higher zzso zzso zzso The red cell volume collected with the standard procedure was significantly higher, zzso zzso zzso but corrected for the number of zzso cells the difference was not zzso The zzso zzso zzso produced significantly less zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso procedure used collected fewer zzso cells than the standard zzso however, with less red cell contamination but a comparable number of zzso and zzso in four hour zzso zzso Each collection method resulted in a comparable amount of zzso and zzso but the zzso surge method produced less zzso following the zzso
