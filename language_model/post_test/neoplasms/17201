Stem cells are defined by their zzso capacity and the ability to give rise to all differentiated progeny necessary for one specific zzso These two characteristics are also inherent in cancer stem cells zzso which are thought to be the only zzso within a tumor endowed with zzso zzso zzso combine many features that render cancer one of the leading causes of death in the Western world: zzso tumor zzso and therapy zzso zzso zzso are not a fixed entity, but differentiated tumor cells are able to zzso to a zzso zzso Thus, zzso are not only zzso programmed to fulfill their zzso roles, but are orchestrated by zzso cells residing in their vicinity and forming the zzso zzso Yet, this relationship is not a one-way zzso zzso are able to manipulate zzso cells to their needs, not only in the primary zzso but also in distant zzso and thus prime the foreign soil for their arrival by inducing a zzso zzso The suggested plasticity between the differentiation states of cancer cells and the regulation by zzso cues provides new zzso for novel cancer zzso
