Apart from using zzso zzso as a predictor of diabetes, cardiovascular and chronic kidney disease, some evidence suggests zzso as an indicator of cancer zzso We aimed to study the association between zzso and cancer in a large Swedish cohort with zzso primary zzso 

In a cohort of zzso persons zzso zzso zzso who had a measurement of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso study, zzso Cox zzso hazards zzso was used to investigate categories of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in relation to cancer zzso zzso analyses were conducted by zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

A positive association was found between categories of zzso and overall cancer risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the 2nd, 3rd and 4th categories compared to the zzso zzso analyses showed that for those with zzso zzso zzso the association between zzso and risk of zzso breast and liver cancer became stronger zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and prostate zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso With pancreatic cancer, the association with zzso was weaker for those with elevated zzso levels compared to those with normal zzso No effects of zzso or zzso levels on risk were zzso 

We found evidence of associations between elevated zzso and risk of developing different zzso The strength of this association may vary by zzso levels because zzso can result in zzso stress initiating damaging pathways of zzso
