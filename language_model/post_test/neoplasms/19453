Data from the total of six Japanese Cancer zzso presently reporting to Cancer zzso in Five zzso demonstrate marked variation in relative prevalence of zzso at particular sites, despite the genetic zzso of the Japanese zzso Thus either major differences in registry procedures or local environment must be playing an important role and since the variation is clearly changing with time, the former must be considered zzso Over the last 25 year period, zzso rates for the esophagus have been generally increasing in Japan, except in zzso where they have been persistently zzso zzso cancer rates are on the decrease, although the trend is not so clear in zzso and Hiroshima, while colon and zzso zzso have both demonstrated consistent zzso throughout the period surveyed, with a remarkable correlation between the two sites evident on zzso zzso zzso increases have also been apparent in zzso zzso urinary zzso and prostate zzso in males and in breast, zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso cancer, in contrast, is zzso although a plateau may now have been reached in zzso In the zzso zzso patterns have generally showed zzso followed by a recent reduction, although without correlations among liver, gallbladder and zzso rates at the zzso zzso Common lifestyle factors may to some extent zzso the increases seen in zzso breast, urinary zzso and zzso zzso rates, given the significant relations apparent for these in the latest data across zzso Whether analysis of variation in dietary intake and exposure to other risk factors, for example using data for household zzso may provide clues to explaining the variation apparent across Japan is a question zzso further zzso If so an expanded role for the cancer registry could well be zzso
