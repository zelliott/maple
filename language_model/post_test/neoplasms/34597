Most proteins fold into their native structure through well defined pathways which involve a limited number of transient zzso zzso play a relevant role in the folding process; many diseases of genetic nature are in fact coupled with protein zzso due to formation of stable, inactive intermediate species of the zzso This review deals with a number of diseases associated with protein zzso and briefly describes the zzso responsible, at molecular level, for such zzso It is also considered the zzso zzso molten zzso transition, recently observed for some zzso in which a native protein converts into a stable compact intermediate state able to carry out distinct zzso functions inside the zzso A non-native compact form of zzso zzso for example, appears to have a role in the programmed cell death zzso after that the protein is released from the zzso and non-native forms of the same protein appear involved in some of the disorders attributed to zzso zzso
