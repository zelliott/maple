The aims of this study were zzso to zzso evaluate the clinical benefits of switching from zzso to an alternative zzso using zzso as zzso alternative zzso in patients with cancer, zzso to evaluate the consistency of the clinical decision for the need to switch by comparing two hospital sites, and zzso to evaluate whether there were objective zzso that would help identify zzso zzso who require switching to an alternative zzso and from this to construct a clinical model to predict the need to zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso care patients were zzso recruited from two hospital zzso zzso were patients treated with zzso for more than 4 weeks with good analgesia and minimal side zzso zzso zzso were patients who had either uncontrolled pain or unacceptable side effects on zzso and therefore required an alternative zzso The differentiation between zzso and zzso was made clinically and later confirmed by objective zzso 

In this prospective study zzso zzso had a good response to zzso zzso One patient was lost to follow zzso Twenty-five percent zzso did not respond to zzso These zzso were switched to alternative zzso zzso Furthermore, of 186 patients, 37 achieved a successful outcome when switched to zzso and an additional 4 were well controlled when switched to more than one alternative zzso zzso successful pain control with minimal side effects was achieved in zzso zzso of zzso There were no significant differences in the need to switch between the two hospital zzso 

This study has shown that proactive clinical identification and management of patients that require zzso switching is zzso in different clinical settings and significantly improves pain zzso Further studies are required to develop and test the zzso zzso
