Fluorescence in the zzso zzso spectral region is suitable for in zzso imaging due to its reduced background and high penetration capability compared to visible zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso that zzso with a fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso attachment of the fluorescent dye to the zzso This property makes zzso a valuable tool for zzso zzso The zzso fluorescent zzso zzso a zzso between zzso and zzso zzso was zzso and characterized in this zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion protein were zzso The zzso portion of the protein directs the zzso of the protein to the cell zzso The expression of zzso in the stable cell lines was confirmed by the reaction between zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso examination confirmed that zzso was localized on the cell zzso The signal intensity of the labeled cells was dependent on the zzso zzso In zzso imaging study showed that zzso could be used to zzso zzso tumors expressing zzso However, the background signal was relatively high, which may be a reflection of zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso To address the background issue, zzso zzso that only zzso upon reaction with zzso were zzso and zzso Although the zzso was successfully zzso in zzso imaging with the zzso zzso zzso failed to zzso the zzso expressing zzso possibly due to the reduced reaction zzso Further improvement is needed to apply this system for in zzso zzso
