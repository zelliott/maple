Comprehensive sequencing efforts have revealed the zzso landscapes of common forms of human cancer and zzso 140 driver genes have been identified, but not all of them have been extensively zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA binding protein zzso zzso or zzso zzso in liver cancer 1) is a newly identified zzso located at zzso and it is amplified in many solid zzso zzso studies of zzso in zzso zzso and other tumors strongly suggested that its zzso role in zzso is through unleashed cell zzso zzso transition and zzso of zzso The underlying mechanisms of zzso zzso may disrupt the cell death program via binding the zzso protein zzso or through zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso of zzso target genes zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso is now considered to be a novel independent zzso for zzso prognosis and survival in several solid zzso The accumulated knowledge about its functions will provide a focus to search for targeted treatment in specific zzso of zzso
