The zzso zzso located on zzso zzso zzso and coding for a nuclear zzso zzso zzso acts to zzso or antagonize cell growth, and as such, is a tumor zzso zzso In fact, zzso of zzso tumor zzso gene is a common event in the development of all or most types of human zzso About half of cell cancer cases zzso thus far involve zzso zzso of one zzso zzso combined with the deletion of the second zzso and many of the remaining cases involve a functional zzso of zzso protein through non zzso zzso The importance of zzso as an inherited cancer zzso gene has been demonstrated in zzso zzso In some circumstances, it has been shown that in response to DNA damage, the zzso level in the cell increases considerably and zzso a cell growth arrest late in zzso zzso This cycle arrest allows the altered DNA to be repaired before entry of the cell into S zzso This function of zzso helps to insure the zzso stability of the zzso zzso in zzso eliminate this response and result in enhanced frequency of zzso zzso In other circumstances wild type zzso may act by triggering cell death by zzso The zzso protein exerts its zzso functions through various zzso zzso These include its ability to be a zzso zzso zzso as well as a zzso of zzso The zzso derived from several zzso DNA viruses including zzso large T zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso E6 zzso as well as specific cellular gene products zzso zzso form complexes with the zzso zzso causing its zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
