To conduct a phase I trial of zzso zzso zzso given by continuous infusion in zzso solid tumors expressing zzso 

zzso patients had zzso zzso or pancreatic cancer, which was zzso or zzso despite standard therapy, and were zzso positive by zzso zzso was given by continuous infusion for 10 days, and cycles could be repeated at zzso intervals in the absence of zzso zzso or progressive zzso 

zzso patients, five with zzso zzso nine with zzso zzso two with zzso zzso seven with zzso zzso and one with pancreatic zzso received 4, 8, 12, 18, and 25 zzso zzso The maximum tolerated dose was 25 zzso zzso where one of six patients had zzso toxicity due to zzso vascular leak zzso zzso was observed in 18 zzso of 24 patients, and five zzso received a second zzso zzso plasma levels of zzso were maintained for most of the 10-day infusion time, with median peak levels of up to 153 zzso One patient had a partial zzso zzso responses included zzso of zzso and independence from zzso resolution of masses by zzso zzso zzso and improved pain and range of zzso 

As a single agent by continuous infusion, zzso zzso zzso was well tolerated up to 25 zzso zzso and showed evidence of modest clinical zzso Continuous infusion showed no significant advantage over zzso zzso and further clinical development of zzso is proceeding by zzso dosing in combination with zzso
