- The clinical course of zzso zzso zzso is often complicated by zzso and zzso zzso Current information on these vascular complications derives from very few prospective clinical trials and several retrospective zzso The purpose of this analysis is to report the zzso clinical features and risk factors for zzso in a large number of patients zzso followed in a zzso European zzso 

- The European collaboration on zzso aspirin in zzso zzso zzso study is a zzso project aimed at describing the natural history of zzso Overall, zzso zzso patients zzso zzso median age at recruitment 65 zzso were enrolled in the zzso Five hundred and zzso zzso of these patients are entered into a zzso zzso zzso zzso clinical trial aimed at assessing the efficacy and safety of zzso zzso The remaining zzso zzso are entered into an zzso zzso zzso cohort zzso The mean follow-up duration was zzso years zzso zzso 

- The cumulative zzso rate of cardiovascular events zzso cardiovascular death and zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso persons per zzso zzso was the main cause of zzso Age greater than 65 years and positive history of zzso were the two most important zzso of cardiovascular zzso zzso hypertension and zzso heart failure were other significant risk factors for zzso zzso counts and zzso drugs were not associated with the risk of cardiovascular zzso zzso therapy was the only variable associated with a lower risk of zzso 

- zzso events remain a major cause of mortality and morbidity in zzso but the zzso risk seems to be more related to the patients' characteristics zzso previous zzso cardiovascular risk zzso than to the disease zzso Thus, control of red cell mass and zzso therapy appear to be effective treatments in limiting the risk of zzso
