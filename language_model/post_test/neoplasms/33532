A series of zzso zzso was evaluated in zzso for activity against a panel of human tumor cell lines of breast, zzso or lung zzso Several zzso were found to possess solid tumor selectivity relative to their activity against zzso leukemia zzso cells as well as human zzso zzso The superior compounds in this regard were also found to exhibit excellent activity against primary human tumors in stem cell zzso zzso In addition, many of the compounds tested were found to be selectively zzso to hypoxic relative to zzso zzso colon zzso cells, a property that may be a consequence of the potentially zzso zzso zzso A number of zzso were also found to exhibit potency against zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells comparable to that observed against actively dividing zzso zzso with their favorable activity against zzso cells, further testing of the zzso revealed that generally less drug is required to inhibit zzso synthesis than DNA synthesis in zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that the zzso represent a novel class of zzso agents which warrant further zzso evaluation for their potential clinical usefulness in the treatment of solid zzso
