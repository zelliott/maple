Over the past 20 years, abundant evidence has been collected to suggest that zzso zzso zzso and its receptors play an important role in the development of a variety of zzso In fact, the detection of zzso and the zzso zzso in small cell lung zzso zzso and the demonstration that zzso zzso inhibited proliferation in zzso cell lines, established zzso as the zzso zzso growth zzso All forms of zzso are generated by processing of a zzso acid zzso recent studies indicate that zzso zzso of zzso is not essential for zzso and that peptides derived from zzso 31 to 125 of the zzso are present in normal tissue and in zzso zzso receptors can be divided into four classes, all of which belong to the 7 zzso domain family and bind zzso and/or zzso zzso with affinities in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and its receptors has been demonstrated at both the zzso and protein level in many types of tumors including zzso zzso breast, stomach, zzso and zzso zzso has also been shown to act as a potent zzso for cancer cells of diverse origin both in zzso and in animal models of zzso Other actions of zzso relevant to zzso include effects on zzso zzso cell migration and cell zzso Future prospects for the use of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso for cancer diagnosis and therapy appear zzso
