zzso human zzso zzso has been shown to enhance recovery from zzso and zzso injury after cancer zzso Since zzso for the zzso and signal zzso for zzso is detected in many cell types including some cancer cells, it was theoretically possible that zzso could affect the growth of tumor zzso This study was intended to determine whether zzso stimulates the proliferation of human tumor zzso units zzso taken directly from zzso zzso cells were cultured in soft zzso and continuously exposed to three zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 14 days in the zzso cloning zzso Growth stimulation was noted in two of 66 zzso of zzso zzso including one of 14 zzso zzso cell lung cancer and one of five zzso colon cancer zzso In these two zzso there was no increased stimulation of zzso with escalating zzso of zzso Interestingly, the highest concentration of zzso tested inhibited the growth of 16 specimens zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso Growth zzso demonstrated a zzso relationship zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso appears unlikely to stimulate the growth of the most common solid zzso
