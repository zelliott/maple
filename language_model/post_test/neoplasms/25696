The optimal assessment of cancer pain includes a detailed description of pain characteristics and zzso by both syndrome and likely zzso In the clinical setting, the interpretation of this information is aided by knowledge of the available clinical experiences on these aspects of the zzso Unfortunately, existing data are zzso There have been few large surveys of cancer pain characteristics and zzso and comparative data from patients in different parts of the world are entirely zzso To better define the characteristics of cancer pain syndromes the Task Force on Cancer zzso of the International Association for the Study of zzso zzso conducted a zzso zzso zzso zzso survey of pain specialists and their zzso From a total of 100 clinicians who described themselves as cancer pain practitioners in the zzso membership zzso 51 agreed to participate in the survey and a total of 58 provided zzso These clinicians resided in 24 countries and evaluated a total of 1095 patients with severe cancer pain mostly requiring zzso medication, using a combination of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso scales comprised a pain intensity measure chosen from the brief pain zzso The zzso information included demographic and zzso data, and responses on zzso of pain syndromes and zzso Patients were zzso in terms of demographics and zzso zzso More than zzso had a zzso performance status score zzso or zzso zzso Almost one-quarter of the patients experienced two or more zzso A large majority of the patients zzso had one or more pains caused directly by the zzso zzso of patients had one or more pains caused by cancer zzso The average zzso duration of pain was zzso zzso zzso zzso two-thirds of patients zzso reported that the worst pain intensity during the day prior to the survey was zzso or zzso 7 on a zzso zzso zzso The factors that were zzso associated with higher pain intensity included the presence of breakthrough pain, zzso pain or zzso pain, age younger than 60 years, and lower performance status zzso A zzso model suggested that the presence of breakthrough pain, zzso pain, and lower performance status were the most important zzso of intense zzso zzso that were zzso by the treating zzso to be zzso and due to zzso injury occurred in zzso of the zzso zzso labeled zzso visceral were noted in zzso and pains zzso to have zzso mechanisms occurred in zzso In a broad zzso the major pain syndromes comprised bone or joint zzso zzso of zzso visceral zzso zzso soft tissue zzso zzso and peripheral nerve injuries zzso Twenty-two types of pain syndromes were most zzso Large differences in the diagnosis of breakthrough pain by clinicians of different countries suggest that this phenomenon is either defined or recognized differently across zzso These data zzso in segment of the cancer population experiencing severe pain, in different parts of the world, that cancer pain zzso syndromes and zzso are very zzso zzso of worsening pain can be zzso The data provide a useful context for the interpretation of zzso information acquired in both clinical and research zzso They suggest the need for future studies and the potential usefulness of a written checklist for cancer pain syndromes and zzso
