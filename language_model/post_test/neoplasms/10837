zzso a family of zzso receptors for cell zzso to the zzso zzso zzso play key roles in cell migration, cancer progression and zzso As zzso zzso zzso are transported in zzso and delivered to the cell surface by zzso zzso The final step for zzso delivery, zzso fusion of zzso zzso with the plasma zzso is poorly understood at the molecular zzso The zzso zzso zzso factor attachment protein zzso proteins zzso 1, 2, 3 and 4 are present at the plasma membrane to drive zzso zzso In this study, we examined the roles of zzso 2, 3 and 4 in zzso trafficking of zzso and zzso zzso We showed that zzso 3 and 4 were expressed in zzso cervical zzso cells and zzso pancreatic zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso cells, zzso 3 and 4 zzso with the zzso raft constituent zzso zzso at the leading zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and 4, but not of zzso in zzso cells reduced cell surface expression of zzso and zzso zzso and accumulated the zzso in zzso zzso indicating that zzso and 4 mediate zzso trafficking of zzso and zzso zzso to the cell zzso In addition, zzso of zzso and 4 inhibited cell zzso to zzso suppressed zzso cell migration and triggered zzso zzso these data suggest that zzso and zzso zzso trafficking is important in cancer cell migration and survival, and may be a valuable target for cancer zzso
