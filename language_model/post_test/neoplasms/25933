The authors of this study have previously observed that cancer is rarely reported on the death certificates of patients with Huntington zzso This study was undertaken to investigate whether this disorder is associated with a lower zzso of zzso 

A total of zzso patients with Huntington disease who had survived at least to age 45 years during the period zzso and zzso individuals at risk and at least age 55 years during the same period, were selected from the Danish Huntington Disease zzso The occurrence of cancer was determined from the files of the Danish Cancer zzso and compared with national zzso rates for various categories of zzso 

The overall zzso of cancer was significantly lower among patients with Huntington disease, but not among their healthy zzso The standardized zzso ratio for the Huntington patients was zzso with a zzso confidence zzso of zzso The lower zzso was seen for zzso of all major zzso and zzso except the zzso cavity and the zzso 

The lower zzso of cancer among patients with Huntington disease seems to be related to intrinsic zzso zzso One explanation may be that the modified zzso zzso encountered in Huntington disease protects against cancer by inducing or increasing the rate of naturally occurring programmed cell death in zzso zzso
