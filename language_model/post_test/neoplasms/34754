We sought to determine the zzso features of respiratory zzso virus infection in zzso pediatric patients and to identify the risk factors for severe zzso 

We designed a retrospective study examining the experience with respiratory zzso virus infection in pediatric patients with underlying zzso and zzso stem cell transplant recipients seen between 1997 and zzso Clinical and laboratory data were extracted from patient records, and independent zzso of disease severity were zzso 

zzso patients met the study zzso zzso patients zzso had underlying diagnoses of acute zzso zzso 11 zzso had solid tumors, and 24 zzso were zzso stem cell transplant recipients, had acute zzso zzso or had severe combined zzso zzso zzso patients zzso were zzso 2 years of zzso Overall, 16 patients zzso developed lower respiratory tract zzso The frequency of lower respiratory tract infections was highest in patients with zzso stem cell transplants, acute zzso zzso or severe combined zzso syndrome zzso Independent zzso of lower respiratory tract infections were profound zzso with absolute zzso counts of zzso 100 cells per zzso and age of zzso or zzso 2 zzso Of all patients with lower respiratory tract infections, zzso died as a result of respiratory zzso virus zzso The overall mortality rate was low (5 of 58 zzso zzso All deaths occurred in patients with lower respiratory tract infections who were before or after zzso stem cell transplants or were zzso 2 years of age and receiving treatment for acute zzso zzso zzso was not a predictor of respiratory zzso virus lower respiratory tract infection or zzso 

This study identified profound zzso and young age as independent zzso of respiratory zzso zzso lower respiratory tract infections in zzso zzso No association between zzso and respiratory zzso zzso morbidity or death was zzso These findings can guide interventions for respiratory zzso virus infection in high risk zzso
