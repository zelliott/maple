The measurement of zzso proteins is of high diagnostic value in the follow-up of cancer zzso Most tests ignore that various forms of the protein can zzso especially in zzso zzso and the soluble receptors they zzso We choose zzso as zzso to analyze whether tests recognizing different zzso of the protein give different results in patients' zzso zzso zzso are present in the zzso of patients with zzso zzso however little is known about the existence and possible relevance of circulating soluble zzso zzso Most zzso zzso recognize the first zzso repeat and fail to detect zzso trimmed zzso We developed a novel zzso to determine the concentration of serum zzso with zzso recognizing the second zzso zzso In 59 healthy controls, zzso zzso ranged from 232 to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in 412 patients with zzso were somewhat higher with zzso ranging from 176 to zzso zzso zzso In direct comparison, the zzso protein specific zzso detected lower levels and zzso as compared to the zzso zzso Only zzso with less than zzso circulating zzso zzso of the zzso contained zzso zzso zzso The absence of zzso zzso in the zzso with more than zzso circulating zzso was not due to immune complex zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso did not show such a zzso It will be important to assess whether the presence of high levels of circulating zzso is associated with side effects in patients given zzso
