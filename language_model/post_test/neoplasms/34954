zzso was carried out on various normal and zzso zzso using four zzso zzso in order to evaluate the effect of different fixation treatments on tissue zzso in comparison to the results obtained on frozen zzso All zzso were zzso on frozen material; on zzso embedded material zzso of zzso depended on the type of fixation method applied zzso zzso or absolute zzso and each zzso behaved differently in relation to the zzso zzso Only zzso normal structures were revealed on frozen material whilst on zzso embedded material three of the four zzso reacted also with zzso normal structures zzso central and peripheral nervous system zzso All four zzso zzso regardless of treatment, zzso cells of zzso and zzso zzso but not germ cells or germ cell zzso The zzso of zzso to its specific zzso depends on the zzso zzso therefore, in routine pathology more than one zzso should be available for zzso Furthermore, given the variety of zzso structures stained by the zzso zzso the differential diagnosis of zzso tumors must not be based on zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso by zzso zzso cells seems to parallel that of normal zzso during zzso therefore, this intermediate filament appears to be not only a marker of zzso cells but also of many immature zzso
