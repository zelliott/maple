The review summarizes experimental and preliminary clinical findings relating to the application of zzso in zzso to allow a differential discussion concerning its potential therapeutic use in cancer zzso In zzso experiments show that zzso zzso chemically zzso as well as spontaneous zzso tumors, but is mostly ineffective in controlling the growth of zzso zzso zzso Some human and zzso in zzso cancer cell lines are inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso but the majority of the tested cell lines is resistant to zzso or can be inhibited at pharmacological doses zzso In individual cases zzso was reported to stimulate cell zzso The molecular mechanisms of how zzso affects the proliferation of cancer cells under in zzso and in zzso conditions are mostly unknown and their zzso will require further basic research to determine the therapeutic potential of zzso From a theoretical point of view substitution therapy with zzso might be worthwhile since a progressive decline of zzso zzso zzso is observed parallel to the growth of the primary tumor in breast and prostate zzso The mechanisms involved in this depression are at present poorly understood but do not appear to be identical among species so that similar results in animal experiments are of limited zzso to zzso First clinical experience with zzso in the treatment of cancer patients has been confined to zzso therapies at advanced and terminal stages of zzso and have yielded certain encouraging zzso It is imperative to verify these preliminary data applying zzso protocols and future therapeutic trials of zzso in patients with zzso zzso disease should be zzso Evidence exists that the role of the zzso zzso in zzso may not be confined to zzso since potent zzso zzso of yet unknown chemical structure have been detected which are capable of zzso in zzso cell lines resistant to zzso
