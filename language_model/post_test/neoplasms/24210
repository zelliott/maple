The zzso of zzso is essentially influenced by zzso Based on the oxygen effect a new therapeutic zzso has been developed to protect healthy zzso while hypoxic breathing during zzso 

The effect of hypoxic breathing zzso zzso on the zzso in zzso zzso zzso was studied in 14 zzso zzso zzso was assessed using a zzso zzso zzso 

The median zzso was zzso zzso zzso prior to hypoxic breathing with a great zzso and zzso zzso The relative frequency of zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso was between 0 and zzso During hypoxic breathing we registered no significant changes in the mean, the median or the zzso values zzso 5 zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso zzso can be found chronic zzso with great zzso and zzso zzso zzso The hypoxic breathing zzso zzso shows no significant modifications of the tumor zzso with increased zzso zzso This fact explains the experimental and clinical experience, that the hypoxic breathing (8 to zzso zzso protects the healthy tissue without changes in the zzso of chronic hypoxic tumor zzso
