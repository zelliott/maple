zzso inflammation plays a multifaceted role in zzso zzso evidence from zzso and clinical studies suggests that persistent inflammation functions as a driving force in the journey to zzso The possible mechanisms by which inflammation can contribute to zzso include induction of zzso instability, zzso in zzso events and subsequent inappropriate gene zzso enhanced proliferation of initiated cells, resistance to zzso aggressive tumor zzso invasion through zzso basement membrane and zzso zzso zzso zzso oxygen and nitrogen species cause damage to important cellular components zzso DNA, proteins and zzso which can directly or indirectly contribute to zzso cell zzso zzso elevated zzso or abnormal zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso and zzso oxide, and a distinct network of zzso signaling molecules including upstream zzso and zzso factors facilitate tumor promotion and zzso While inflammation promotes development of cancer, components of the tumor zzso such as tumor cells, zzso cells in surrounding tissue and infiltrated zzso cells generate an zzso inflammatory state by zzso expression or zzso of some zzso zzso Many of zzso zzso especially zzso zzso and zzso turn on the zzso switches mainly controlled by vascular zzso growth factor, thereby inducing inflammatory zzso and tumor zzso zzso This will end up with tumor zzso zzso and zzso Moreover, cellular zzso are emerging as a potential link between inflammation and zzso The present article highlights the role of various zzso zzso in zzso and their promise as potential targets for zzso of zzso zzso
