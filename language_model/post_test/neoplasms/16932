zzso is the result of zzso of specific gene zzso Two classes of specific cancer zzso are zzso namely those affecting zzso and those in which zzso are zzso zzso are thought to regulate normal growth by zzso proteins that inhibit the expression of the zzso This is in line with the observation that tumor cells are often zzso for a zzso in an zzso as this will allow the expression of an zzso In this paper we attempt to calculate the number of zzso involved in the genesis of a zzso zzso zzso These calculations were initially performed using a simplified model for zzso and later applied to more complicated zzso These calculations indicate that usually four zzso in zzso are required for zzso in zzso This is in contradiction to the well-known zzso model of zzso of zzso which predicts about zzso times more de zzso arising zzso cells than are observed in zzso zzso is only observed in zzso zzso Cell proliferation and growth zzso in various zzso differ zzso Therefore the time of zzso and zzso manifestation also varies in the different zzso In zzso that develop in early life zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso activity zzso soon after zzso zzso neural and retinal zzso emerge only early in zzso In contrast, the main development of the female breast occurs after zzso and the earliest breast zzso will become apparent in young zzso The four zzso zzso in zzso required for zzso imply that probably zzso zzso are involved in two zzso It is clear that an inherited zzso in an zzso at a particular locus causes different zzso types depending on the various zzso in which the zzso zzso zzso of zzso results of calculations about the number of zzso neuroendocrine zzso cells that arise in a pancreatic zzso of a patient with inherited zzso with zzso the pathological anatomy of such a patient, suggests that a cell with two or three zzso zzso has a growth advantage over normal zzso This leads to cell proliferation in a zzso zzso until the set of four zzso zzso is zzso The clinically zzso zzso have a zzso mean diameter of about zzso zzso when the first true zzso zzso cell develops, and the pathologist will probably note zzso when the zzso has the size of 1-2 zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
