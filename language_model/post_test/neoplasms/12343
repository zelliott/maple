For decades it has been well known that elevated levels of homocysteine are harmful to humans on the basis of clinical observations derived from classical model diseases, such as inherited zzso zzso This group of diseases includes classical zzso and several other inherited diseases affecting the so-called zzso zzso zzso lies in a zzso checkpoint that zzso zzso reactions with metabolism of zzso zzso zzso since every zzso of zzso derived either from plasma or generated from other folate species must be zzso to liberate the reduced zzso This zzso mechanism operates in every cell and has no alternative in zzso zzso zzso are a group of zzso agents targeting various zzso steps within folate zzso They exert an indirect influence on the rate of zzso of homocysteine from cellular and plasma zzso Recently, it has been zzso that homocysteine may be a marker of the zzso zzso of methotrexate, but studies zzso to this role are only now zzso Here, we explore the genetic disease of folate and homocysteine metabolism and discuss the links between these model disorders with pharmacology and zzso of folate zzso used in the zzso We outline possible ways of how homocysteine may be used as a zzso of zzso zzso
