Modern zzso techniques such as intensity zzso are capable of generating complex dose zzso whose high dose areas tightly conform to the zzso target volume, sparing critical zzso even when they are located in close zzso This potential can only be exploited to its full extent when the accumulated dose actually delivered over the complete treatment course is sufficiently close to the dose zzso on the initial CT scan used for treatment zzso zzso patient repositioning is mandatory, but also other sources of error, zzso changes of the patient's anatomy under therapy, should be taken into zzso At the German Cancer Research Center, we use a combination of a linear accelerator and a CT scanner installed in one room and sharing the same zzso It allows the zzso and correction of zzso variations between planning and treatment zzso In this paper, we describe treatments of zzso zzso and head and neck zzso All patients were immobilized by customized fixation devices and treated in a zzso zzso For each patient, frequent CT scans were taken during the treatment zzso Each scan was compared with the original planning CT using manual checks and automatic rigid matching zzso Depending on the individual case, the adaptation to variations was carried out zzso after several zzso or in real-time between the CT scan and zzso zzso We discuss the techniques for detecting and correcting zzso errors and outline the procedural steps of a zzso zzso radiation treatment zzso
