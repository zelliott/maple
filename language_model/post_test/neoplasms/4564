There are major differences between tumors in children and adults, zzso the zzso of tumor types, the predisposition of certain zzso and zzso zzso sympathetic nervous zzso zzso and soft zzso to develop tumors, problems related to tumor zzso and the zzso behavior of childhood zzso which are usually characterized by high rates of proliferation zzso A large number of new entities, especially in soft tissue tumors, have been published over the past years, including zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso infantile zzso which can mimic zzso intermediate grade zzso tumors, like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor and zzso zzso zzso zzso displaying evidence of zzso zzso finally, the high-grade zzso zzso small cell zzso With modern methods we can gain better insights into the biology of zzso For example, tumors of the Ewing's zzso family have in common a characteristic zzso zzso zzso zzso the Ewing's zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and the zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso is not restricted to tumors of the Ewing's zzso family zzso Ewing's zzso and zzso peripheral zzso zzso however, but occurs in zzso melanoma of the soft tissue and in zzso zzso small cell zzso zzso zzso can be divided into two basic types with different zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso including the solid zzso The prognosis of zzso zzso is poorer than that of classic zzso zzso mainly due to early tumor dissemination in zzso zzso The prognosis of zzso is mainly based on zzso and molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso double minute zzso zzso zzso regions, zzso zzso and DNA zzso are indications for an zzso zzso Despite progress in childhood solid tumor pathology, many questions remain open, including those relating to basic zzso defects in germ cell tumors and the obscure nature of tumor zzso
