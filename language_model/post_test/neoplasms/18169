zzso zzso originating from zzso zzso and dependence on zzso and survival signaling through zzso oxygen species represents a specific vulnerability of zzso cells that can be selectively targeted by zzso zzso This review will present an update on drug discovery, target zzso and mechanisms of action of experimental zzso zzso with a focus on zzso and zzso zzso zzso now in advanced zzso of zzso and clinical zzso Recent research indicates that numerous zzso and tumor zzso genes exert their functions in part through zzso mechanisms amenable to pharmacological intervention by zzso zzso The zzso action of many zzso zzso that involves simultaneous zzso of multiple zzso sensitive targets can overcome cancer cell drug resistance originating from zzso of zzso signaling and rapid zzso some zzso zzso may function according to the concept of synthetic zzso zzso drug zzso is confined to cancer cells that display loss of function zzso in tumor zzso genes or zzso of zzso zzso The impressive number of ongoing clinical trials that examine therapeutic performance of novel zzso drugs in cancer patients demonstrates that zzso chemotherapy has made the crucial transition from bench to zzso
