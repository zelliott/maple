zzso zzso zzso zzso is critical in the predisposition to zzso zzso zzso We recently characterized the zzso zzso breath test zzso with zzso specificity and zzso sensitivity for identification of zzso zzso In the present study, we characterize the relationships among zzso breath zzso zzso formation, plasma zzso formation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

An zzso solution of zzso (6 zzso was orally administered to 23 healthy volunteers and 8 cancer zzso zzso breath zzso zzso and plasma zzso and zzso zzso were determined over 180 minutes using zzso zzso and liquid zzso mass zzso zzso zzso variables were determined using zzso zzso zzso blood zzso cell zzso zzso activity was measured using the zzso zzso 

The zzso identified 19 subjects with normal activity, 11 subjects with partial zzso zzso and 1 subject with profound zzso zzso with zzso zzso activity within the corresponding previously established zzso zzso breath zzso zzso significantly correlated with zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso plasma zzso area under the curve zzso zzso zzso zzso appearance rate zzso zzso zzso and proportion of zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso all Ps zzso zzso 

zzso breath zzso zzso parallel plasma zzso and zzso zzso and are an accurate measure of zzso variation in zzso zzso These zzso data further support the future use of the zzso as a screening test to identify zzso zzso before zzso zzso
