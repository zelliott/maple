This study uses a zzso approach to analyze zzso of expression of genes in zzso zzso data were analyzed with respect to coherent gene expression in a group of genes defined as a zzso in the zzso Encyclopedia of Genes and zzso zzso zzso Our hypothesis is that genes in the same zzso are more likely to be zzso regulated than a randomly selected gene zzso A correlation zzso for each pair of genes in a zzso was estimated based on gene expression in normal or tumor samples, and statistically significant correlation zzso were zzso The zzso indicator was defined as the ratio of the number of gene pairs in the zzso whose correlation zzso are zzso divided by the total number of gene pairs in the zzso We defined all genes that appeared in the zzso pathways as a reference gene zzso Our analysis indicated that the mean zzso indicator of pathways is significantly larger than the mean zzso indicator of random gene sets drawn from the reference gene zzso Thus, the result supports our zzso The significance of each individual zzso of zzso genes was evaluated by comparing its zzso indicator with zzso indicators of 1000 random zzso sets of zzso genes chosen from the reference gene zzso We analyzed three data zzso two zzso zzso and one zzso zzso For each of the three data sets, statistically significant pathways were identified among all zzso zzso Seven of 96 pathways had a significant zzso indicator in normal tissue and 14 of 96 pathways had a significant zzso indicator in tumor tissue in all three data zzso The increase in the number of pathways with significant zzso indicators may reflect the fact that tumor cells have a higher rate of metabolism than normal zzso Five pathways involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso or zzso synthesis were coherent in both normal and tumor zzso demonstrating that these are essential zzso a high level of expression of which is required regardless of cell zzso
