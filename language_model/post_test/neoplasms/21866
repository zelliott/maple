The present study was conducted to determine trends in the quantitative bacterial load patterns of bacterial zzso infections zzso caused by various bacteria in patients receiving care at a comprehensive cancer zzso zzso loads of all consecutive quantitative blood cultures performed during 1998 and 2004 were graded zzso zzso bacteria zzso were responsible for the majority of zzso episodes in both years zzso zzso of zzso zzso in 1998 and 820 of zzso zzso in zzso Compared with zzso infections, a significant proportion of infections caused by zzso bacteria was associated with a high bacterial load zzso (11 vs zzso in 1998 and 10 vs zzso in zzso zzso In 2004, zzso episodes due to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly associated with a zzso compared to zzso due to zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso this was not the case in zzso zzso the zzso commonly associated with zzso due to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso during 1998 were not noted during 2004 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The spectrum of zzso continues to change and its zzso implications in cancer patients needs further zzso
