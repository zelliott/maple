zzso are components that when added to zzso zzso zzso vaccines boost their zzso and thus immune zzso However, there are few zzso that are approved for clinical use resulting in a critical need for the development of safe and effective zzso for use in both zzso and therapeutic zzso The paucity of appropriate zzso is more chronic for the development of therapeutic vaccines for cancer and chronic infectious disease, which need to induce zzso zzso responses via zzso of the vaccine zzso by zzso zzso The zzso zzso represents a unique zzso system that zzso zzso delivery and presentation as well as zzso to provide enhanced and accelerated immune zzso The immune responses generated are of broad specificity to the vaccine zzso and include robust zzso responses of multiple zzso as well as both zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we discuss our understanding of the mechanisms of action by which zzso zzso may facilitate these integrated immune responses and touch on insights gained through its clinical zzso
