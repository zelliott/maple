zzso zzso are important zzso in solid zzso and zzso zzso Their structures are well understood at the atomic level and their key role in the progression of certain zzso makes them valuable targets for zzso zzso Through medicinal chemical approaches, we developed an efficient zzso zzso synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso that opens access to functional diversity within this previously challenging zzso We focused upon the zzso class of chemical zzso which includes zzso an inhibitor we previously zzso We used zzso and zzso zzso to identify small zzso zzso of zzso zzso 1 zzso a zzso protein zzso that is activated when cancer cells are treated with zzso zzso These compounds show a promising zzso profile on zzso Furthermore, these compounds are active against zzso which is a zzso zzso that is frequently activated in human zzso These data suggest that this chemical class may provide a source of therapeutic compounds for a broad range of human zzso
