Increased yield of zzso breaks, following in zzso zzso zzso zzso can be a marker of individual zzso and cancer zzso genes whose role is to respond to DNA zzso zzso or zzso of genes zzso DNA repair pathways may zzso the increased zzso zzso However, genes that facilitate DNA damage recognition, using signal zzso pathways to activate cell cycle arrest and preserve zzso integrity, are perhaps the most important zzso Based on the latter hypothesis, an individual zzso zzso zzso is introduced, which zzso at individual level, the zzso potential to facilitate DNA damage recognition and repair of zzso zzso damage during zzso to zzso zzso Based on this zzso a new methodology for assessment of individual zzso is proposed, which involves zzso zzso by caffeine to obtain the zzso zzso To evaluate the proposed methodology, blood samples from 52 healthy donors were taken for zzso zzso analysis using both the conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the new approach using zzso zzso zzso The two zzso were compared in experiments using samples from 5 hypersensitive patients, 3 zzso 3 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso donors are predicted as zzso zzso or normal, while according to the new approach, individuals can be classified as highly zzso zzso normal, zzso and highly zzso Overall, the new approach provides better individual zzso discrimination and zzso zzso zzso the proposed methodology using zzso values may provide a clinically zzso zzso zzso for individual zzso and predisposition to zzso
