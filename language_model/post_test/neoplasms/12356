Cancer surveillance is essential for assessing patterns of cancer zzso State cancer zzso do not capture all available cases potentially zzso zzso Secondary data may be useful in identifying new cases and zzso the number of cases zzso 

We sought to create 2 distinct data sources from Medicare claims to use in combination with registry data as 3 sources for a zzso analysis to estimate the capture rate and bias in capture of a statewide cancer zzso 

Data from the Virginia cancer registry zzso were merged with Medicare zzso zzso zzso as well as Medicare zzso and physician claims zzso zzso to provide 3 sources to estimate missing zzso A zzso zzso model was used to estimate the number of missing cancer cases for breast, zzso zzso and prostate zzso Models included main effects and zzso Additional analysis looked at the effect of demographic and zzso zzso 

zzso models demonstrated mostly positive dependence between the 3 sources, zzso that zzso models would underestimate missing cases and overestimate capture zzso Using zzso estimates of total number of cancer cases as the zzso capture rates for zzso ranged from 59% zzso to zzso zzso When the zzso of cases found by either Medicare or zzso were used the capture rates ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso Further analysis indicated that capture rates differed by demographic zzso 

We conclude that Medicare claims are useful to supplement a zzso estimate the number of missing cases, and assess bias in zzso
