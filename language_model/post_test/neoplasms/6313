Though tumor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso cascade have been extensively studied for the last 30 years, due to their important zzso roles, the two signaling pathways have been largely considered zzso Recently, the zzso family was found to directly link zzso and zzso revealing the tight connection between loss of tumor zzso function and zzso of zzso zzso These observations demonstrate that zzso known to be directly downstream of zzso targets a set of highly zzso sites in the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulting in suppression of zzso zzso activity and the zzso zzso The loss of zzso function increases zzso activities and promotes the zzso zzso program at multiple levels in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso signature was closely associated with functionality of zzso and zzso in clinical samples, suggesting the pervasive impact of zzso loss on the zzso zzso in human zzso Here, we review recent findings on zzso in light of novel data to zzso the zzso relevance of the zzso network, which encompasses sets of genes and directions of zzso As loss of zzso or zzso of zzso is critical in maintaining cancer stem cell properties and in establishing the zzso program, these observations indicate a mechanism of zzso zzso which connects tumor zzso and zzso signaling zzso supporting a zzso model of human zzso
