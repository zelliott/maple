Large differences in the sex ratio of mortality exist among the studied zzso The sex ratio of zzso total cardiovascular and cancer mortality markedly increased in most countries during recent zzso 

The sex ratio of zzso mortality and its time trends correlated significantly and positively with the sex ratio of mortality and its time trends from total cardiovascular disease and zzso The differences of the sex ratio of mortality and their time trends between populations cannot be explained by genetic zzso They could be attributed to differences in life zzso A different exposure and different reaction to the risk factors of cardiovascular diseases and cancer, zzso saturated fat zzso alcohol intake and smoking habits, between men and women are considered to be the main causes for these differences in the sex ratio of zzso
