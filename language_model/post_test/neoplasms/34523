We have previously established a first whole zzso zzso profile of sporadic Parkinson's disease zzso After extensive brain zzso validation combined with cycles of zzso data analysis and by focusing on the most comparable cases of the zzso we have refined our analysis and established a list of zzso highly zzso priority genes that are considered to form the core of the diseased zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso now under zzso contain more than 100 genes whose association with zzso is known from the zzso Of those, more than 40 genes belong to the highly significantly zzso group identified in our zzso Apart from the complete list of zzso priority zzso we present pathways revealing zzso zzso as well as zzso network zzso The latter include zzso body components or interact with known zzso zzso Biological associations of zzso with cancer, diabetes and inflammation are discussed and interactions of the priority genes with several drugs are zzso Our study illustrates the value of rigorous zzso correlation when zzso zzso data to make optimal use of the zzso zzso or zzso which currently serves as the key diagnostic reference for most human zzso The need for systematic human tissue zzso following the highest possible professional and ethical standard to enable sustainability, becomes zzso
