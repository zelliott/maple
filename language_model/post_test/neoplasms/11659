In a recent survey of organic compounds present in drinking water of zzso cities in The Netherlands, it was found that only a minor fraction zzso of the total organic content could be zzso It appeared that drinking water prepared from zzso surface water contains more organic compounds with zzso and zzso properties than water prepared from zzso The concentration of most of the organic constituents identified was generally below the zzso zzso It is not expected that circumstances will occur, that these compounds will be present in zzso which are acutely toxic for zzso On the other hand it cannot be excluded that certain organic compounds, in particular zzso and zzso may cause chronic toxic effects as a result of life time consumption of such contaminated drinking zzso Therefore an zzso study was started in The Netherlands in which cancer mortality was related to the raw water source used for drinking water and the level of organic zzso zzso results of the zzso study are zzso zzso a limited survey was carried out zzso drinking water of six cities was investigated for the presence of organic zzso zzso The results of this survey led to the decision to extend this investigation to 19 zzso Finally, preliminary results regarding the characterization of the organic zzso compounds, present in drinking water, will be zzso
