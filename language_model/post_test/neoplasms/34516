The creation of a functional blood supply from the normal tissue zzso via the process of zzso is critical for the continued growth and development of solid zzso This importance has led to the concept of targeting the zzso zzso as a therapeutic strategy, and two major types of vascular targeting agents zzso have zzso those that inhibit the zzso zzso zzso agents zzso those that specifically damage the already established zzso zzso agents zzso The zzso zzso also plays a critical role in influencing the response to zzso Generally, the poorer the blood supply the better the heat effect, thus combining zzso with heat would appear to be a logical zzso Numerous zzso studies have now demonstrated the benefits of combining zzso or zzso with heat to improve zzso zzso zzso have also been shown to enhance zzso especially at mild zzso zzso Although some enhancement of normal tissue response has been observed when zzso are given with heat, the effects are always less than those seen in zzso and no increased normal tissue reactions are seen when radiation, zzso and heat are combined, thus a therapeutic benefit zzso These zzso studies clearly encourage clinical trials with these zzso
