Some of the uncertainty regarding the use of zzso blood zzso in transplant settings includes the suspected relative rarity of zzso stem cells zzso in CB and the feasibility of incorporating a cell separation protocol to remove red blood cells, which may result in an unacceptable loss of zzso To address this uncertainty, we isolated a SC fraction by zzso or zzso zzso from CB and peripheral blood zzso which had been mobilized by zzso The zzso of zzso cells zzso zzso cells, zzso units zzso zzso and the output of zzso cells zzso after five weeks in long-term culture zzso zzso were then zzso The mean numbers of these cells per zzso of CB sample before zzso separation were, respectively, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In the recovery phase of zzso these numbers were, respectively, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso per zzso of processed blood at zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso the recovery rates of these cells were, respectively, zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso After zzso separation of zzso the rates were, respectively, zzso zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that CB contains an adequate number of more immature zzso which can be retained after cell separation with zzso or zzso thereby making it feasible to incorporate a cell processing procedure into a CB transplant zzso zzso separation provided a greater enrichment of cells than zzso
