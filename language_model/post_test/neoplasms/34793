Cancer related fatigue zzso is common, zzso and difficult to zzso There have been trials looking at drug interventions to improve zzso but results have been conflicting depending on the population studied and outcome measures zzso No previous reviews of this topic have been exhaustive or have zzso all available zzso 

To assess the efficacy of drugs for the management of zzso 

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso Quarter 2007), zzso zzso to March 2007) and a selection of cancer zzso We searched references of identified articles and contacted authors to obtain zzso zzso 

Trials were included in the review if they 1) assessed drug therapy for the management of zzso compared to zzso usual care or a zzso intervention in 2) zzso controlled trials zzso of 3) adult patients with a clinical diagnosis of zzso 

Two review authors independently assessed trial quality and extracted zzso zzso were performed on different drug classes using continuous variable zzso 

zzso trials met the inclusion zzso Only 27 of these trials involving zzso participants were judged to have used a sufficiently robust measure of fatigue and thus were deemed suitable for detailed zzso The drugs were zzso by class zzso zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed a small but significant improvement in fatigue over zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso showed a small but significant improvement in fatigue (for zzso patients receiving zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso also demonstrated a smaller but significant improvement in fatigue over zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso steroids demonstrated no superiority over zzso in treating zzso There was a very high degree of statistical and clinical zzso in the trials and the reasons for this are zzso It was not possible to determine optimum doses as a result of this zzso 

zzso and zzso (for zzso patients on zzso and zzso trials provide evidence for improvement in zzso at a clinically meaningful zzso There are no data to support the use of zzso or zzso steroids for the treatment of zzso The obvious candidate drug for use in a large scale zzso is zzso to confirm the preliminary results from this zzso
