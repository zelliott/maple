To identify the morbidity and mortality due to infections in a South African zzso zzso unit, and to identify risk factors associated with first zzso episodes in this zzso 

A retrospective cohort study was done in a large regional referral zzso cancer zzso from zzso of all consecutive patients with culture proven zzso zzso zzso patients were studied zzso age zzso zzso in whom a total of 200 episodes of zzso were recorded, of which 83 first zzso zzso 

Of the 200 episodes zzso were caused by zzso organisms, zzso by zzso negative organisms and zzso by zzso zzso zzso associated with high mortality were zzso organisms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso organisms, zzso zzso zzso out of 200 episodes ended in death of the zzso In 59% of patients zzso zzso were in zzso The mean zzso of zzso related zzso was zzso episodes per 1000 zzso zzso zzso percent of first zzso episodes occurred within 50 days after placement of the zzso The generalized zzso equations model revealed that more zzso infections occurred in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso and the use of zzso nutrition were not associated with specific zzso zzso 

Including all zzso episodes in this cohort study a high zzso of zzso infections occurred of which zzso occurred with a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso had a higher zzso than reported in other zzso zzso looking at first zzso episodes a high zzso of zzso infections was observed especially in the presence of a zzso zzso
