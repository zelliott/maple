zzso zzso can cause serious health problems for an increasing number of survivors of childhood zzso The aims of this study were to document plasma zzso of cardiac zzso T zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in a large group of zzso long-term survivors of childhood cancer treated with zzso and to study the relation of the abnormal zzso levels with different risk factors for zzso zzso and conventional zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso survivors of childhood cancer underwent a detailed zzso Blood samples were taken to determine the levels of zzso and zzso 

None of the survivors had abnormal zzso zzso Thirteen percent of the survivors zzso zzso zzso had abnormal zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly related to cumulative zzso dosage zzso zzso zzso Eleven of 31 survivors zzso treated with cumulative zzso dose of 300 zzso or more, had abnormal zzso levels which were significantly related to zzso left zzso internal diameter zzso zzso for body surface area zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso does not contribute to the early detection of late onset zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso were detected in zzso of 122 zzso long-term survivors of childhood zzso zzso of these survivors is essential to answer the question whether zzso is an early marker for late onset zzso zzso
