Cancer has become a global health zzso China still suffers continuous increasing cancer zzso To study the trend of cancer mortality in rural China, this paper established an zzso model to discuss the age effect, period effect and cohort effect on cancer mortality in rural zzso 

The data were collected from the zzso Health zzso zzso from 1990 to zzso zzso data were analyzed by zzso model and zzso zzso zzso 

The age effect on the total cancer mortality represented a V zzso Compared with Group zzso Group zzso showed zzso lower cancer mortality zzso Compared with Group 5-9, Group zzso showed 38 times higher cancer mortality zzso The period effect on the total cancer mortality risk weakened zzso but then zzso It increased by zzso from 1990 to 2010, showing an annual average growth of zzso The cohort effect on the total cancer mortality risk weakened by totally zzso from zzso to zzso Three zzso zzso and three zzso zzso were witnessed during this zzso The zzso cancer mortality varied similarly with the total cancer zzso while benign cancer mortality and other cancer mortality represented different variation zzso 

Although the total cancer mortality risk is increasing at an accelerated rate, cancer mortality risk in recent born year is zzso indicating very important impact of social change on the cancer mortality in rural zzso
