Cancer is zzso in the sense that it is caused by DNA zzso at the cellular zzso On the other hand, the most important risk factors for the common zzso are zzso cigarette smoking, environmental pollution, occupational zzso poor diet, and so zzso These two observations are not in zzso the DNA zzso that lead to cancer are very likely to be caused by environmental zzso It would be valuable to know exactly what genes are altered to cause a specific cancer, because the effects of these zzso might then be zzso before cancer has a chance to zzso A key to identifying these cancer genes may lie with rare families at extremely high risk of a specific zzso Unlike most cancer patients, members of these families may inherit an zzso that zzso increased zzso to zzso In these rare instances, cancer is a genetic disease at the level of the family, as well as at the level of the zzso zzso in these families, genes zzso to cancer can be mapped in the same way as genes for purely genetic diseases like zzso cell zzso zzso fibrosis, and zzso zzso The hypothesis that zzso the mapping of cancer genes in families is that the genes inherited in altered form in these rare families are the same genes that are altered in zzso cells of individuals without a remarkable family history of zzso This hypothesis has proved correct for zzso Genes responsible for other rare zzso have been mapped in families as well: zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso and colon cancer following familial zzso zzso among zzso Genes responsible for common zzso are also being defined by genetic analysis, most notably breast cancer and colon zzso This review summarizes why, how, and what genetic analysis of families can reveal about human zzso
