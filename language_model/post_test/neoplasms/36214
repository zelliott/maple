zzso zzso models have emerged as powerful tools for the zzso of cancer zzso ideally, these models should incorporate zzso imaging data indicative of therapeutic zzso The purpose of this study was to develop a zzso zzso framework in order to simulate the therapeutic effects of zzso agents based upon clinical molecular imaging zzso The model was applied to zzso zzso zzso zzso data of cellular proliferation and zzso from a phase I clinical trial of zzso an zzso that zzso the vascular zzso growth factor zzso When using zzso PET data in combination with zzso dose response zzso simulated follow-up zzso data yielded good qualitative agreement with zzso zzso zzso zzso the quantitative agreement with follow-up zzso and proliferation PET data required tuning of the maximum vascular growth fraction zzso and the zzso cell cycle time to zzso zzso zzso was found to be the most sensitive model zzso zzso zzso zzso Assuming availability of zzso zzso zzso levels, we show how zzso dose levels can potentially be zzso to improve levels of zzso zzso while maintaining zzso response, both of which are critically important in the context of combination zzso Our results suggest that, upon further zzso the application of zzso zzso models may afford opportunities to zzso dosing regimens and combination therapies in a zzso zzso
