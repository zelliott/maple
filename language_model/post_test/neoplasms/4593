Construction is one of the most dangerous industries in the zzso However, there has been little literature on occupational epidemiology in this zzso A study of the mortality experience over a zzso period among construction workers in the UK was carried zzso 

This was based on zzso death certificates of members of the Building and Civil Engineering Holiday and Benefit Scheme, who had died during 1975 to 1987 aged zzso zzso zzso mortality ratio zzso and mortality odds ratio techniques were zzso 

zzso elevated zzso were found for deaths from all zzso including cancer of the lung and stomach, and for accidental zzso zzso were demonstrated between several job categories and an increased risk of cancer zzso Occupational zzso to hazardous substances may have contributed to the elevated cancer zzso although the study findings should be interpreted with zzso zzso supervision of safety procedures, together with a high proportion of young and inexperienced workers, may be associated with the high number of accidental zzso 

The results support the hypothesis that working in the construction industry is associated with a high risk for accidental death and probably also for zzso diseases including zzso zzso and stomach zzso Further zzso studies among construction workers are needed to support policies aimed at improving occupational health, including the prevention of zzso
