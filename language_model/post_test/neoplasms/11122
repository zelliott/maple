It is not known whether improvements in cancer survival over recent decades have benefited children from different geographic locations zzso This is the first study to produce national survival estimates for childhood cancer in Australia by zzso of residence and zzso socioeconomic zzso 

The study zzso zzso data from the Australian zzso Cancer zzso for children diagnosed with cancer from 1996 zzso who were at risk of mortality between January 2001 and December 2006 zzso zzso zzso zzso was specified according to the Australian Standard zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas an index of area disadvantage was obtained from census zzso zzso relative survival estimates were produced by the period method for all zzso and the most common diagnostic groups, with corresponding zzso adjusted mortality hazard ratios calculated using zzso zzso 

Overall, children with cancer from zzso remote areas had a significantly lower survival rate than their counterparts in major cities zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Survival was also lower for children with leukemia living in inner regional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or outer regional areas zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was weak evidence zzso zzso zzso of a trend toward poorer survival by greater area disadvantage for all childhood zzso 

Some variation in prognosis by place of residence was present for children with cancer in Australia, particularly among leukemia zzso 

zzso clinical or zzso factors that contribute to these survival differentials need to be zzso
