This paper discusses a new computer code to estimate the efficacy of zzso electron sources in cancer zzso zzso electron zzso accompanies the zzso of many zzso already commonly used in nuclear medicine, for zzso zzso and zzso The range of these electrons is in general zzso therefore, the toxicity of the source depends on the site of zzso relative to the genetic material of the zzso zzso track structure methods have been used which enable the study of energy deposition from zzso sources down to the zzso zzso A figure for the minimum energy required per single strand break is obtained by fitting our energy deposition calculations for zzso zzso in a model of the DNA to experimental data on break lengths from zzso labeled zzso zzso This method is used to investigate the efficiency of double strand break production by other zzso sources which have potential value for zzso The high zzso of zzso sources depends critically on the distance between the source and target zzso The application of zzso zzso for therapy may zzso a carrier zzso that can append the source to the zzso Many DNA zzso agents are known in the field of chemotherapy, some of which could be carrier molecules for zzso zzso the zzso zzso precursors are under scrutiny in this zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in zzso by high energy, zzso X ray and zzso beams is also zzso
