Plasma zzso of the zzso zzso zzso increase during acute zzso stress, but the role of zzso in the zzso of stress remains largely zzso Whether zzso mediates zzso changes in zzso tone is zzso zzso and its more stable zzso Big zzso were measured in plasma obtained at several zzso time points from 95 consecutive elderly patients zzso age 70 zzso 1 zzso zzso to receive either zzso or zzso zzso care while undergoing major surgical zzso In the zzso period, there were no significant changes in plasma zzso zzso but Big zzso zzso increased considerably zzso zzso zzso There were no significant differences in mean zzso or Big zzso levels in zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were significantly higher in patients with a history of hypertension zzso zzso zzso and in those requiring treatment for zzso hypertension zzso zzso zzso Patients with cancer and those undergoing abdominal surgery had significantly higher Big zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso zzso These data support the hypothesis that Big zzso is a more sensitive measure of zzso system zzso after major zzso zzso conditions and location and type of surgery influence zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso response seems to be significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso precursor Big zzso is a more sensitive measure of the zzso system zzso in response to surgical stress than zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to mild zzso zzso occurs independently of the zzso zzso
