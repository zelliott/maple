This phase I trial examined the safety, zzso and zzso of zzso an zzso selective, zzso inhibitor of Aurora A zzso Patients with advanced solid tumors received increasing doses of zzso in zzso cycles until zzso toxicity zzso was seen in zzso of 3-6 patients in a zzso For the zzso and zzso zzso treatment was administered once daily on days 1 to 5 and 8 to zzso Patients in later zzso zzso 35, 45, 55, 60, 70, and 80 zzso were treated four times daily on days 1 to 14, with the largest dose at bedtime zzso to mitigate zzso effects possibly associated with peak plasma zzso Patients zzso zzso zzso received a median of 1 cycle zzso zzso zzso of zzso was first noted in the zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso zzso 1) were seen at zzso 80 zzso Grade 2 oral zzso zzso zzso 1), predicted to be a zzso effect, was observed only at zzso 80 zzso zzso exposure levels were roughly linear with zzso terminal zzso was 30 to 40 zzso zzso analyses of skin and tumor zzso zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso provided evidence of Aurora A zzso zzso dosing for 10 to 14 days in zzso cycles was zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso analyses in zzso cells of both skin and tumor provided proof of mechanism for Aurora A zzso zzso A more zzso selective, second-generation Aurora A zzso zzso zzso is in clinical zzso
