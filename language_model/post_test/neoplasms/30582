Certain zzso zzso of zzso exposure circumstances, zzso and personal or cultural habits, zzso zzso living conditions, and physical agents have been zzso associated with zzso in zzso Most however are not considered potentially zzso and the proportion of zzso eventually identified to cause cancer is projected to be relatively zzso Current methods to identify zzso potential of chemicals rely largely on short-term in zzso and in zzso tests, zzso & long-term in zzso zzso molecular mechanisms, zzso zzso and zzso Thus, the scientific and public health communities must continue to zzso available means and zzso strive to develop newer methods and tools to more easily, quickly, cheaply, and reliably identify zzso in the human zzso Since adequate human studies are typically zzso the most useful method for identifying potential human zzso continues to be long-term zzso zzso Agents identified as causing zzso in humans have been shown to cause cancer in animals, and this knowledge, together with similarities in mechanisms of zzso across species, led to the scientific logic and public health strategy that chemicals shown clearly to be zzso in animals should be considered as being likely and anticipated to present cancer risks to zzso The quest of hazard identification efforts is cancer zzso largely by reducing or eliminating zzso to chemicals that cause cancer and other zzso
