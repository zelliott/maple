zzso is the functional zzso of a cell, at a given condition, resulting from an intricate interplay of various regulatory zzso The study of these dynamic zzso processes and their capabilities help to identify the fundamental properties of living zzso zzso deregulation is an emerging hallmark of cancer zzso This deregulation results in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso an exploitative zzso advantage for the tumor cells which leads to a distinct benefit in survival and lays the basis for zzso zzso zzso can be considered as a zzso zzso in which source zzso of high value are being processed through a well established interconnected zzso conversion system, strictly obeying zzso principles, generating useful zzso and finally resulting in the release of zzso Based on this basic principle of an zzso balance, various models have been developed to interrogate metabolism zzso its underlying functional zzso However, only a few modeling approaches have proved zzso feasible in zzso the zzso nature of cancer at a systems zzso Besides this, statistical approaches have been set up to identify zzso pathways being more relevant for specific types of tumor zzso In this review, we are briefly introducing the basic statistical approaches followed by the major modeling zzso We have put an emphasis on the methods and their applications that have been used to a greater extent in understanding the zzso zzso of zzso
