Broader clinical acceptance of zzso therapy is currently hindered by zzso poor depth zzso and zzso predisposition towards establishment of an zzso environment during the zzso zzso depth efficacy is being sought by exploiting the zzso tissue transparency window and by zzso using zzso zzso zzso Here, we use zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and targeted to zzso receptors or zzso zzso to achieve deep tissue zzso 

Human tumor lines, positive or negative for zzso expression were used, as well as zzso zzso cells and bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors on cancer cells and tumor zzso was evaluated in zzso and frozen zzso zzso zzso effects on tumor blood flow were followed using in zzso scanning after intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso efficacy on the laser pulse duration was zzso zzso of targeting to vascular zzso receptors was compared to that of zzso zzso or no zzso 

zzso zzso stained for zzso receptors even in tumors from zzso zzso negative cell lines, and zzso targeted zzso led to tumor vascular zzso zzso the pulse from zzso to zzso led to loss of the zzso efficacy especially at greater zzso zzso targeted to zzso receptors was much more effective than zzso zzso or zzso targeted to zzso zzso 

The use of zzso to target zzso receptors expressed on tumor vessels is an excellent approach to zzso with few zzso and some long term zzso
