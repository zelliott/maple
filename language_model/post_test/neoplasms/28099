zzso zzso that might serve as potential targets for adoptive zzso therapy have been defined in different tumor entities, especially in zzso zzso To generate conditions to induce primary zzso responses against different zzso melanoma peptides and to allow further expansion of zzso T cells for adoptive transfer, zzso T cells from healthy donors were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were generated in zzso from zzso with zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso and transforming growth zzso After zzso weekly stimulation cycles with zzso zzso we were able to induce a strong zzso zzso response in zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a frequency of up to zzso zzso T zzso Additional zzso expansion with zzso zzso zzso together with zzso gave rise to zzso expansion of zzso zzso that maintained zzso specificity and were able to efficiently lyse zzso melanoma zzso To enrich zzso T cells in zzso we used a recently established technology for analysis and sorting of live cells according to zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that zzso T cells can be zzso by magnetic separation according to zzso zzso These cells revealed a very potent zzso zzso response, even at low zzso ratios, against zzso and zzso target zzso Altogether, our study demonstrated that we have developed an efficient method for generating large numbers of zzso T cells in zzso that may be used for adoptive zzso transfer in tumor zzso
