Previous research demonstrated a relationship between zzso of whole blood, or large numbers of red cell zzso and later recurrence of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso It is possible that the zzso of whole blood may represent a surrogate marker for advanced or more aggressive clinical zzso The relationship of clinical or zzso tumor stage, blood zzso status, and disease outcome was studied in zzso Patients receiving no zzso or small numbers of red cells (less than or equal to 3 zzso had zzso better recurrence and survival experiences than patients receiving similar amounts of blood that included at least 1 unit of whole blood, regardless of the patient's clinical or zzso tumor zzso In zzso zzso stage was an independent predictor of outcome, and zzso status was not a surrogate marker for zzso The effects on recurrence of stage and zzso appear to be zzso These results are consistent with but do not prove the hypothesis that the zzso of large amounts of stored plasma and cellular debris zzso the host defenses against cancer, regardless of the underlying zzso and clinical aggressiveness of the zzso
