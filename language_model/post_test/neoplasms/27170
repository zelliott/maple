In this paper we study the delayed zzso model, as a typical model of tumor growth, with a term describing external interference that can reflect a treatment, zzso zzso We mainly consider two types of delayed models, the one with the delay introduced in the per capita growth rate (we call it the single delayed zzso and the other with the delay introduced in the net growth rate (the double delayed zzso We focus on stability and possible stability switches with increasing delay for the positive steady zzso Moreover, we study a zzso zzso including stability of arising periodic solutions for a constant zzso The zzso results are extended by zzso simulations for a zzso treatment zzso
