zzso are powerful candidates for molecular imaging applications due to a number of attractive features, including rapid blood clearance and tumor zzso We carried out zzso relationship zzso studies with the zzso binding zzso zzso which is a promising candidate for application in tumor imaging with zzso The aim was to improve its in zzso stability and target zzso We investigated the effect of zzso stabilization of the presumed zzso zzso stem region on binding affinity and resistance against zzso zzso To achieve zzso zzso stem stabilization melting experiments with model zzso duplexes consisting of unmodified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were initially carried zzso Extremely high melting temperatures have been found for an zzso zzso zzso derivatives with zzso and zzso modifications within the zzso stem have subsequently been zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso exhibited significant stem stabilization and markedly improved plasma stability while maintaining its binding affinity to the zzso In addition, higher tumor zzso and longer blood retention was found in zzso nude zzso Thus, our strategy to introduce zzso modifications after the selection procedure is likely to be generally zzso to improve the in zzso stability of zzso without compromising their binding zzso
