zzso zzso and zzso zzso have shown interesting activity in a wide range of solid zzso A phase I study was conducted in order to determine the maximum tolerated dose zzso and zzso toxicity zzso of their combination in patients with zzso solid zzso 

zzso zzso patients with zzso confirmed zzso zzso were zzso The patients' median age was 64 years, 21 were zzso and 27 had a WHO performance status of zzso zzso was administered on days 1 and 8, as a zzso intravenous infusion, at escalated doses ranging from 50 to 70 zzso zzso was administered orally for 14 consecutive days, at escalated doses ranging from 1,200 to zzso zzso Treatment was repeated every 3 zzso
