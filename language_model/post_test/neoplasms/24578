The UK urgent cancer referral guidance was introduced between zzso There is a dearth of literature relating to the effectiveness in detecting cancer of urgent suspected cancer referrals and general zzso compliance with the zzso 

This paper aims to determine the diagnostic yield from urgent referrals for suspected zzso zzso zzso and prostate cancer, and the proportion of patients with cancer who were urgently zzso Secondary aims are to determine the association of these findings with age, ethnicity, sex and marital status, and to determine the proportions of patients who fulfilled the urgent referral zzso 

zzso notes analysis of all urgent referrals and all cancer zzso 

One hospital trust in zzso 

Data regarding all urgent referrals and all cancer diagnoses were obtained from one hospital trust over a zzso zzso Data analysis was undertaken to zzso diagnostic yields and their association with zzso factors, trends over time and zzso of the zzso 

The percentages of urgent referrals diagnosed with cancer were zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso and prostate zzso The percentages of patients with cancer referred urgently were zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso and prostate zzso Patients who were urgently referred without cancer were younger than those with cancer for all but zzso There were no significant differences by sex, marital status or zzso For patients with cancer there were no differences for any zzso factors in whether or not they were referred zzso 

The zzso power of the referral guidance as a marker for cancer is low, resulting in significant numbers of patients being urgently referred without zzso A large majority of patients not diagnosed with cancer through the urgent referral route did zzso the criteria for urgent zzso suggesting that with more widespread use of the guidance the diagnostic yields will be zzso This has implications for patients, on hospital diagnostic systems, and for patients presenting through other zzso
