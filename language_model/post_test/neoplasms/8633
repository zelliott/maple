The tissue specific expression shown by intermediate filament zzso their ease of extraction and their zzso has led to the use intermediate filament zzso in diagnostic pathology, particularly zzso to zzso intermediate filaments because of the zzso involvement of zzso in zzso We review the principles of zzso zzso expression and detail 100 of the best-known zzso zzso to zzso which are currently in zzso in many circumstances zzso can now be reliably used as in zzso markers of zzso zzso We also suggest a database scheme for better dissemination of information on available zzso zzso to zzso in the zzso
