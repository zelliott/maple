In cancer therapy, the number of drugs targeting cells with characteristic molecular aberrations is continuously zzso However, application of these new drugs still is limited to a few tumor zzso The aim of this study was to test the concept of routinely identifying all possible cancer patients who might eventually benefit from targeted zzso zzso all zzso tumors routinely submitted to our Institute of zzso over a period of 4 months were brought into a tissue zzso zzso Using zzso zzso methods, tumors were analyzed for zzso zzso and zzso status as examples for potential therapeutic target zzso In positive cases, target zzso was excluded by analyzing all available large zzso Outside of tumor entities for which targeted drugs are already approved, the study revealed six tumors with zzso distributed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and seven tumors with homogeneous zzso amplification zzso zzso breast, zzso and zzso and zzso of unknown zzso A total of 151 tumors showed zzso zzso but none of seven zzso cases showed zzso zzso We zzso report on a zzso patient with zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer who is successfully treated by zzso zzso This study demonstrates that tissue zzso based screening for therapeutic target genes in tumors outside established indications represents a feasible approach suitable for routine zzso The successful treatment of one patient with zzso zzso positive zzso zzso cancer argues for the clinical utility of this approach at least in carefully selected, homogeneous zzso
