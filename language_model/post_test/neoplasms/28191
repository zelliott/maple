A key event in the regulation of zzso gene expression is the zzso modification of zzso zzso which converts regions of zzso into zzso active or inactive zzso The most well studied zzso modification of zzso is the zzso of zzso groups on zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso tail zzso zzso advances have been made in the past few years toward the identification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Currently, there are over a dozen cloned zzso zzso and at least eight cloned human zzso zzso Interestingly, many zzso zzso can function as zzso zzso and, often, they are present in zzso zzso More intriguing, at least some zzso zzso are associated with zzso zzso In addition, several studies have pointed to the possible involvement of zzso zzso in human zzso The availability of the cloned zzso zzso genes has provided swift progress in the understanding of the mechanisms of zzso their role in transcription, and their possible role in health and zzso
