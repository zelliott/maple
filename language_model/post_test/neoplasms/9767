Two zzso zzso have been produced that react with zzso present on human white zzso These zzso differ from other zzso zzso of similar specificity in that the zzso they recognize are resistant to conventional zzso and embedding zzso These zzso can therefore be used in zzso zzso of zzso tissue zzso We assessed the practical usefulness of this technique in the zzso diagnosis of human zzso zzso by zzso a wide range of routine surgical biopsy specimens of normal and zzso tissue zzso from five zzso using an indirect zzso zzso In all 40 cases of zzso lymphoma, positive labeling of zzso cells was obtained with one or both zzso In contrast, no zzso of zzso cells was observed in 60 samples of zzso zzso We conclude that many of the difficulties encountered by zzso in distinguishing between zzso and zzso zzso may be overcome by zzso labeling with zzso zzso such as the ones we have zzso
