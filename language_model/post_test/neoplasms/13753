zzso research in zzso diseases, particularly focused on the study and understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in cellular zzso is opening new possibilities for the development of new and more efficient strategies for diagnosis and zzso The generation and practical application of the results derived from molecular genetic studies in cancer, has evolved in parallel with the development of technological tools that allow us to get a global vision of diverse cellular zzso both in the normal and pathological zzso This combination of basic research and technological application, has created zzso that allow us to analyze the three principal levels of zzso zzso the Genome zzso archive of the genetic zzso the zzso zzso expression of the genetic zzso and finally, the zzso zzso functional aspect of the genetic zzso The vast amount of information obtained due to these zzso has begun to modify our fundamental vision about zzso diseases, and together with the traditional zzso tools, they hold the promise of changing the ways we zzso zzso diagnose and treat zzso In this review, we present some of this methods for global genetic analysis, involving the three levels of genetic zzso the zzso with the Human Genome Project, comparative zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso with zzso analysis of Gene zzso and DNA zzso and the zzso with zzso protein zzso and zzso In each case, together with a brief description of the method, we also present the impact of every one of them on the study and management of zzso zzso
