Several zzso studies have shown an association between the season in which certain zzso are diagnosed and survival, with diagnosis in summer and autumn being associated with better zzso In this study, we have added resolution to the analysis of zzso in cancer survival by considering mortality within several zzso time periods following diagnosis, thereby zzso the separate contributions of mechanisms operating in the short term and in the longer zzso We found evidence of zzso acting on mortality within 2 distinct periods following zzso Diagnosis in the summer was associated with substantially decreased mortality within the first month of diagnosis compared with winter in men with prostate cancer, those of both sexes with zzso or lung cancer, and most zzso amongst women with breast cancer zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso for monthly variations in general mortality greatly attenuated the seasonal effects on short-term zzso At long-term follow-up zzso zzso there was a consistent shift in the zzso pattern, with autumn diagnosis alone being associated with decreased zzso both in female breast cancer cases and in lung cancer cases of both zzso We conclude that the higher survival observed amongst patients diagnosed in summer and autumn is predominantly a short-term phenomenon that is largely attributable to generally higher mortality in zzso However, the distinct mortality reduction observed in the long term amongst those diagnosed in the autumn, especially amongst breast cancer patients, may indicate the presence of a seasonally variable protective zzso
