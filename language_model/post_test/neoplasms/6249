zzso is an integral membrane protein essential for protein zzso onto the zzso and is a zzso protein capable of acting as a zzso zzso and a zzso transport zzso Further studies showed that zzso is the sole zzso that has a unique dual function in zzso formation and selective zzso Its zzso transcripts are zzso zzso there is, however, no data on the expression profiles of zzso at the protein level due to a lack of zzso suitable for zzso zzso thus hindering studies on its zzso In the present study, we generated one zzso that could be used in zzso and zzso and investigated zzso expression in normal and zzso human zzso In contrast to the ubiquitous expression of its zzso zzso there is no zzso protein expression in normal human zzso including liver, zzso zzso zzso brain, zzso breast, zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso was dramatically zzso in some zzso Presented here are the first data on the expression profiles of zzso at the protein level, which will further our understanding of its zzso
