Patients with zzso zzso are diagnosed increasingly with benign adrenal tumors, as well as zzso zzso We aimed to demonstrate the natural course of adrenal zzso in terms of mass size and hormonal status in zzso and zzso zzso We also compared the characteristics and behavior of adrenal zzso with adrenal zzso In our registry of adrenal tumors zzso zzso zzso we zzso evaluated 29 zzso subjects zzso and age, zzso and follow-up duration matched 110 zzso subjects zzso with adrenal zzso Median follow-up was 24 zzso We also included 16 subjects with adrenal zzso zzso 3 and zzso zzso zzso size was zzso with CT or zzso at 6th and 12th months and annually in subsequent zzso zzso assessment was repeated at the 6th month after the initial visit and annually in subsequent zzso zzso tumor size, mean increase in tumor size, and number of subjects who showed mass enlargement or developed zzso zzso zzso were comparable zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso adrenal tumors were older zzso zzso zzso had larger tumors at presentation zzso zzso zzso and showed mass enlargement during a shorter follow-up duration zzso zzso zzso Oncology subjects with adrenal zzso featured similar baseline and follow-up parameters in terms of mass enlargement and development of zzso zzso zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso adrenal tumors were characterized with large, rapidly growing tumors of older zzso Conservative approach can be suggested to zzso subjects for adrenal zzso unless clinical and zzso suspicion of adrenal zzso is zzso
