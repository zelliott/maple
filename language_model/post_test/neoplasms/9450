The tumor zzso gene zzso is frequently zzso in human zzso More than zzso of all zzso are zzso zzso that have been extensively analyzed in various zzso and human cell zzso The International Agency for Research on Cancer zzso zzso database zzso compiles all genetic variations that have been reported in zzso Here, we present recent database developments that include new zzso on the functional properties of zzso zzso and we perform a systematic analysis of the database to determine the functional properties that contribute to the occurrence of zzso zzso in different cancer types and to the zzso of zzso This analysis showed that loss of zzso capacity is a key factor for the selection of zzso zzso and that difference in zzso zzso is closely related to zzso substitution rates along zzso coding zzso An interesting new finding is that in patients with an inherited zzso zzso the age at onset of tumors was related to the functional severity of the zzso zzso with total loss of zzso activity being associated with earlier cancer onset compared to zzso that retain partial zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of the most common zzso show a capacity to exert zzso effect zzso over zzso zzso compared to only zzso of the less frequent zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may play a role in shaping zzso zzso These results provide new insights into the factors that shape zzso patterns and influence zzso zzso which may have clinical zzso
