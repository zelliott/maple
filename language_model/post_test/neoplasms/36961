The purpose of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso zzso images obtained with zzso a zzso coincidence gamma camera zzso equipped with zzso zzso zzso and parallel slit zzso and zzso a dedicated zzso zzso zzso zzso in a series of 28 patients with known or suspected zzso zzso patients with known or suspected zzso underwent zzso zzso PET imaging zzso zzso zzso after injection of approximately 10 zzso of zzso zzso zzso images were then acquired for 30 zzso over the regions of interest using a zzso gamma camera zzso zzso The images were reconstructed in the normal mode, using zzso zzso and zzso coincidence zzso zzso PET imaging found 45 zzso ranging in size from 1 zzso to 7 zzso in 28 zzso zzso zzso imaging detected zzso zzso of these zzso Among the ten zzso not seen with zzso zzso imaging, eight were less than zzso zzso in size, and two were located centrally within the abdomen suffering from marked zzso zzso The zzso were classified into three zzso zzso zzso liver zzso and zzso abdominal zzso zzso zzso imaging identified zzso of zzso above zzso zzso in the zzso group and zzso of those below zzso zzso for an overall total of zzso zzso zzso imaging identified zzso of zzso above zzso zzso in the liver and zzso of zzso below zzso zzso for an overall total of zzso zzso zzso imaging identified zzso of zzso above zzso zzso in the zzso abdominal zzso There were no zzso below zzso zzso in this zzso zzso coincidence imaging using a zzso gamma camera detected zzso of zzso greater than zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso imaging can be used clinically in zzso diagnostic situations to differentiate benign from zzso zzso
