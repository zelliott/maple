I discuss the idea of using surrogate zzso in the context of clinical trials to compare two or more treatments or interventions in respect to some zzso zzso typically a disease zzso In order that treatment comparison based on a surrogate response variable have a meaningful implication for the corresponding true zzso treatment comparison, a rather restrictive criterion is proposed for use of the adjective zzso Specifically, I propose that a surrogate for a true zzso yield a valid test of the zzso hypothesis of no association between treatment and the true zzso This criterion essentially requires the surrogate variable to zzso any relationship between the treatment and the true zzso a notion that can be zzso by requiring the true zzso rate at any follow-up time to be independent of treatment, given the preceding history of the surrogate zzso I then discuss this operational criterion in the examples of the accompanying papers and in the setting of trials aimed at the primary and secondary prevention of zzso
