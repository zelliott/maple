To provide sufficient numbers of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso for repetitive use after high-dose chemotherapy, we investigated the ability of zzso growth factor combinations to expand the number of zzso zzso ex zzso zzso plus zzso zzso factor zzso mobilized zzso cells from 18 patients with zzso solid tumors or zzso zzso were cultured for up to 28 days in a liquid culture zzso The effects of zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stem cell factor zzso zzso zzso leukemia zzso factor zzso and zzso as well as 36 combinations of these factors were zzso A combination of five zzso growth factors, including zzso EPO, zzso zzso and zzso was identified as the optimal combination of growth factors for both the expansion of total zzso cells as well as the expansion of zzso zzso zzso zzso peaked at days 12 to 14, with a median zzso increase zzso zzso to zzso of total zzso zzso zzso Expanded zzso cells generated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The number of zzso colonies increased zzso zzso zzso to zzso as compared with zzso zzso Moreover, the absolute number of early zzso zzso cells zzso zzso as well as the number of zzso zzso within expanded cells increased zzso zzso was shown to zzso with the zzso zzso whereas the addition of zzso significantly decreased the number of total zzso zzso zzso zzso expansion of zzso zzso cells zzso cell number, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso plasma supplemented with the same zzso combination resulted in an equivalent expansion of zzso cells as compared with the zzso zzso In zzso our data indicate that chemotherapy plus zzso zzso from cancer patients can be effectively expanded ex zzso Moreover, our data suggest the feasibility of large-scale expansion of zzso starting from small numbers of zzso zzso zzso The number of cells expanded ex zzso might be sufficient for repetitive use after high-dose chemotherapy and might be candidate cells for therapeutic gene zzso
