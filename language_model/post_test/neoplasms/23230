Iron is fundamental for sustaining life for living organisms, and the iron metabolism is finely regulated at different zzso In cancer cells, deregulation of the iron metabolism zzso zzso stress and drives tumor progression and zzso however, the molecular mechanisms of iron zzso are not fully zzso Here we found that iron zzso as well as zzso promoted zzso zzso zzso A central zzso of zzso zzso zzso is the zzso factor zzso and the zzso element in the zzso promoter is confirmed zzso This is in agreement with the data from in zzso studies that have demonstrated the presence of zzso cells at the chronic hypoxic regions of zzso zzso zzso we found two essential molecules for iron zzso zzso cluster scaffold protein zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso are a direct target of zzso zzso of zzso decreases the zzso of zzso by zzso the expression of zzso In addition, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso works as an iron sensor and is involved in the maintenance of iron zzso by sustaining the zzso expression level to stimulate cell proliferation and promote cell survival in the hypoxic region within zzso
