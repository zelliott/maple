zzso zzso represent some of the most promising molecular targeted zzso However, understanding mechanisms by which tumors evade elimination by the immune system of the host presents a significant challenge for developing effective cancer zzso The interaction of cancer cells with the host is a complex process that is distributed across a variety of time and length zzso The time scales range from the dynamics of protein zzso zzso zzso to the dynamics of disease progression zzso zzso The length scales span the farthest reaches of the human body zzso zzso down to the range of molecular interactions zzso zzso Limited ranges of time and length scales are used zzso to observe and zzso changes in physiology due to zzso zzso knowledge obtained from the limited scales observed zzso to predict patient response is an essential prerequisite for the rational design of cancer zzso that improve clinical zzso In studying zzso systems, engineers use systems analysis and design to identify important components in a complex system and to test conceptual understanding of the integrated system behavior using zzso The objective of this review is to zzso interactions between the tumor and zzso immunity from a zzso zzso zzso and its role in zzso zzso zzso zzso is used illustrate the different time and length scale that zzso cancer zzso An underlying theme in this review is the potential role that simulation can play in translating knowledge across zzso
