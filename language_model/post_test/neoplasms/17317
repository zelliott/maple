As more clinically relevant cancer genes are identified, comprehensive diagnostic approaches are needed to match patients to therapies, raising the challenge of zzso and zzso validation of zzso that interrogate millions of bases of cancer zzso altered by multiple zzso Here we describe a test based on zzso parallel DNA sequencing to characterize base zzso short insertions and deletions zzso copy number zzso and selected zzso across zzso zzso genes from routine zzso and zzso zzso clinical zzso We implemented a practical validation strategy with reference samples of pooled cell lines that model key zzso of zzso including zzso zzso frequency, zzso length and zzso of copy zzso Test sensitivity achieved was zzso across zzso types, with high specificity zzso zzso value zzso We confirmed accuracy using zzso zzso cancer specimens characterized by established zzso Application of the test to zzso clinical cases revealed clinically zzso zzso in zzso of tumors, three times the number of zzso zzso detected by current diagnostic zzso
