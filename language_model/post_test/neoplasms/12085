zzso is a zzso useful zzso but little is known about the nature of its individual zzso in regard to their zzso capacity and their in zzso zzso zzso was separated by high performance liquid zzso zzso into four major zzso These were labeled and the distribution studied in zzso rats at 2 and 24 zzso In zzso zzso purity was also zzso Of the nine zzso systems zzso zzso A zzso with a mobile phase of zzso ammonium zzso in methanol gave the best separation of the zzso These zzso were copper free and retained their zzso activity and zzso An in zzso competitive binding study of zzso with either zzso serum zzso zzso or zzso acid zzso showed the labeled zzso to be a strong zzso The zzso distribution in zzso rats showed significantly higher concentration in tumors at 2 zzso for zzso zzso and B2 as compared to the zzso zzso The other zzso A1 and zzso gave lower tumor zzso than the zzso zzso The zzso ratios for zzso and B2 were not significantly different from the zzso mixture, suggesting that the concentration of the zzso in the tumor was related to blood zzso zzso ratios of greater than zzso at 2 zzso were achieved for zzso zzso and the zzso ratios of greater than zzso were achieved at 24 zzso for all zzso From these data it appears that the major components zzso and B2 are the most useful for diagnostic tumor zzso
