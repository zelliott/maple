Green synthesis of zzso zzso zzso was achieved by a simple biological procedure using the reducing power of zzso seed zzso This method is capable of producing zzso in a size range of about zzso zzso under ambient zzso The zzso zzso can be separated easily from the zzso zzso by a high-speed zzso These zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso scanning electron zzso zzso zzso transform infrared zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso and zzso analysis by X-ray zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were obtained without zzso zzso zzso spectrum confirms the presence of various functional groups in the plant zzso which may possibly influence the reduction process and stabilization of zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso against human zzso cells zzso It was found that zzso are able to inhibit the cell growth by zzso zzso In addition, combination of zzso and zzso shows better zzso effect than individual zzso
