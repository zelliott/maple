zzso molecules presenting peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso are attractive targets for zzso zzso of zzso However, detection of such zzso is hampered by zzso and limitations in the sensitivity of mass zzso Here, we used T cells from zzso donors as tools to detect zzso peptides from two zzso differentiation zzso zzso and the previously zzso cancer target zzso A zzso platform for zzso discovery was designed using zzso cells zzso with full-length transcripts of zzso and zzso to allow presentation of all naturally processed peptides from a zzso zzso on foreign zzso zzso T cells were directly detected using panels of color-coded zzso zzso containing zzso predicted by a computer zzso zzso zzso T cells were generated against 37 out of 50 peptides predicted to bind zzso Among these, 36 zzso were previously zzso The zzso T cells were exquisitely zzso and zzso and responded strongly to zzso zzso cells with zzso expression of zzso or zzso These results indicate that the repertoire of zzso presented on zzso class I has been underestimated and that a wealth of zzso can be targeted by T cells when using zzso zzso zzso
