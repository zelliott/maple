The conventional paradigm of drug development used for zzso zzso agents may not represent the most effective method of assessing the safety and biological activity of zzso targeted agents, given that the latter may offer improved therapeutic zzso with less toxic effects on normal zzso 

With the number of novel zzso in zzso entering the investigative arena, there is a need to zzso the drug development process by allowing for optimal selection of agents with the greatest likelihood of having clinical benefit over those of lower potential zzso 

The high zzso techniques now available in zzso zzso and zzso profiling should allow for more effective zzso investigation with the identification of zzso or indicators of treatment response, leading to increased clinical efficacy with appropriate patient zzso 

With this in mind, current investigation should be directed at zzso novel zzso in order to accelerate the drug development and approval process with targeted zzso in zzso
