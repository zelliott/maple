The zzso of most zzso diminishes the treatment effectiveness of many zzso zzso Thus, treatments that hold the most promise are ones that block multiple signaling pathways essential to cancer zzso One of the most promising proteins in that regard is zzso whose zzso activity influences multiple cancer survival mechanisms, including growth, zzso zzso zzso and stress zzso With the continued research using zzso zzso specific zzso alone or coupled with developing zzso DNA repair zzso it will now be possible to further delineate the role of zzso zzso repair and zzso zzso Previously, use of zzso or over expression approaches, while valuable, do not give a clear picture of the two major functions of zzso since both techniques severely alter the cellular zzso Additionally, use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso now makes it possible to study how zzso of zzso zzso signaling can affect multiple tumor pathways and can zzso the effectiveness of existing cancer zzso Because zzso is an upstream zzso of zzso as well as other molecules that relate to zzso and the tumor zzso it is also being studied as a possible treatment for zzso zzso zzso and diabetic zzso This paper reviews all of zzso functions, while heavily focusing on its zzso zzso It also discusses zzso altered expression in many zzso and the therapeutic potential of selective zzso of zzso regulation, which is the subject of intense zzso zzso
