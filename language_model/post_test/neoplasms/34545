Cancer zzso is a complex, dynamic process that begins with dissemination of cells from the primary tumor and culminates in the formation of clinically zzso overt zzso at one or more zzso secondary zzso Evidence from in zzso video zzso as well as zzso and zzso studies suggest that cancer cell dissemination is an early event in tumor progression and that cells may persist in a potentially dormant state for a prolonged zzso Similarly, the mechanisms by which these zzso cells initiate growth and complete the process of zzso colonization remain largely zzso zzso signal zzso pathways regulating this final step of zzso is therefore critical for successful clinical zzso While genetic zzso or zzso changes may be required for a cell or group of cells to separate and survive distant from the primary zzso the zzso within secondary zzso plays a substantial role in influencing whether zzso cells survive and zzso Our work is focused on using zzso zzso proteins to gain insight into why the majority of zzso cells, which should be fully zzso do not zzso immediately at secondary zzso The zzso goal of this work is to identify targets for zzso zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso
