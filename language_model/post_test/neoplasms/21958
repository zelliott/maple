The observed growth of cancer zzso in certain regions has been usually linked to frequent consumption of zzso zzso Such food often contains zzso substances as zzso aromatic zzso zzso and/or zzso aromatic zzso zzso occurring during food preparation, which induce DNA damage in zzso These substances are mainly formed during zzso or zzso of meat and they can be removed from the body in a zzso zzso process of zzso zzso 1 and phase zzso If they are not zzso they form DNA zzso The effectiveness of zzso depends on the activity of zzso zzso by zzso zzso A diet containing plenty of fruits and vegetables, due to the presence of biologically active zzso can zzso activity of detoxifying zzso Such a diet can decrease the extent of DNA zzso breaks and zzso damage, supporting the body's zzso system in sufficient removal of DNA zzso The zzso zzso content in such a diet also enhances the DNA protection by increasing the scavenging of radical zzso species that occurs during zzso zzso The lack of balance between the amount of zzso and zzso food leads to the zzso of zzso damage, initiating DNA instability and inducing cancer zzso Such damage is often used as a zzso of cancer risk in zzso zzso Moreover, in in zzso studies, the amount of the DNA damage is used as indicator of the protective ability of zzso plant extracts and/or individual zzso The zzso of certain zzso zzso in European Mediterranean countries is lower than in Central and Northern European zzso there is simultaneously variation in the habitual diet in these zzso This suggests that some features of routine nutrition in the Mediterranean countries may be responsible for this preventing zzso However, inconsistency in the zzso data, zzso the meat and fruit and vegetable intake with cancer risk, suggests that another strategy for evaluation dietary influence on cancer risk should be zzso This article argues that it is not the consumption of a single food product or an individual component of diet, but rather a proper ratio of vegetable to meat consumption that is responsible for cancer zzso This hypothesis is tested comparing the association between certain zzso cancer zzso zzso & zzso breast and prostate zzso registered in 2002, with the ratio between consumption of these two groups of food products in the Mediterranean region and in Central and Northern European region over the last three zzso The results clearly showed that both the ratio between vegetables and meat consumption as well as the ratio between the amount of energy from vegetables and from animal products can be used successfully to evaluate the dietary pattern related to cancer zzso
