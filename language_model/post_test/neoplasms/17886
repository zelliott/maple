To determine zzso membrane zzso zzso expression in normal zzso and in zzso benign and zzso zzso and subsequently to define its sensitivity and specificity in zzso zzso zzso 

Multiple tissue zzso sections were stained with a zzso zzso to zzso zzso was positive in zzso cases zzso with various zzso patterns including zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso Of zzso various zzso types, 154 expressed zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In those zzso the zzso pattern was always zzso All zzso benign zzso were negative for zzso The sensitivity and specificity of zzso in distinguishing zzso from any other type of zzso is zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, its sensitivity and specificity in zzso zzso from zzso cancer is zzso and zzso zzso 

Despite its expression by zzso of various types of zzso zzso is still considered to be fairly sensitive and highly specific for zzso
