To address the need for minimally invasive treatment of zzso tumors, zzso zzso implants have been developed to release a variety of zzso agents for the zzso therapy of zzso These zzso also termed zzso zzso were designed to provide optimal drug release zzso to improve drug delivery efficiency and zzso efficacy when treating zzso zzso Modeling of drug transport properties in different tissue environments has provided theoretical insights on rational implant design, and several imaging techniques have been established to monitor the local drug zzso surrounding these implants both ex zzso and in zzso zzso zzso efficacy and drug distribution studies in a rabbit liver tumor model have shown that these implants can restrict tumor growth in small animal tumors zzso zzso 1 zzso In the future, new approaches, such as three-dimensional zzso drug distribution modeling and the use of multiple zzso zzso will be used to extend the efficacy of these implants in treating larger tumors more similar to intractable human zzso
