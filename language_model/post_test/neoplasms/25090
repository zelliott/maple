Cancer is a disease of zzso sequence zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso refers in part to the mechanisms by which zzso affect various zzso zzso such as gene zzso zzso are proteins around which the DNA wraps itself to form zzso zzso relevant form of the human zzso zzso are modified extensively by zzso modifications that alter zzso structure and serve to recruit to or exclude protein complexes from zzso zzso in zzso modifications occur frequently in cancer including changes in their levels and distribution at gene zzso gene coding regions, repetitive DNA zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso modifications may have adverse effects on expression of nearby genes but so far have not been shown to have clinical zzso Cancer cells also exhibit zzso in global levels of specific zzso zzso generating an additional layer of zzso zzso at the cellular level in tumor zzso Unlike zzso changes, the cellular zzso zzso can be used to define previously zzso zzso of cancer patients with distinct clinical zzso In general, increased prevalence of cells with lower global levels of zzso modifications is zzso of poorer clinical outcome such as increased risk of tumor recurrence and/or decreased survival zzso zzso utility of zzso modifications has been demonstrated independently for multiple zzso including those of zzso zzso zzso breast, zzso and zzso suggesting a fundamental association between global zzso modification levels and tumor zzso regardless of cancer tissue of zzso Cellular levels of zzso modifications may also predict response to certain zzso agents, serving as zzso zzso that could inform clinical decisions on choice and course of zzso The challenge before us is to understand how global levels of zzso modifications are established and maintained and what their zzso links are to the cancer clinical zzso
