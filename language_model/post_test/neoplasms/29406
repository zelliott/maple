zzso are zzso zzso that comprise a unique branch of the zzso They are zzso zzso to the unusual placement of an essential zzso zzso zzso have now been identified in diverse zzso In humans and other zzso four genes zzso zzso zzso are widely expressed at the message level, although data on protein expression is more zzso Soon after the zzso were identified, zzso in genes zzso zzso and zzso were determined to cause the human disease familial zzso hypertension (also known as zzso II, or Gordon's zzso For this reason, a major focus of investigation has been to dissect the role of zzso zzso in zzso regulation of zzso zzso More recently, a different zzso in zzso was identified as the cause of zzso sensory and zzso zzso type II, an zzso zzso disease of peripheral sensory zzso Thus the zzso represent an important family of potential targets for the treatment of human disease, and further zzso of their zzso actions outside of the kidney and brain is zzso In this review, we describe the gene structure and mechanisms regulating expression and activity of the zzso zzso we outline zzso and targets of zzso as well as effects of zzso on cellular zzso both in the kidney and zzso Next, consequences of these effects on integrated zzso function are zzso Finally, we discuss the known and putative zzso relevance of the zzso
