The fields of zzso and zzso began with an initial paradigm that a targeting zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso had the potential of selectively imaging and delivering a therapeutic dose of radiation to tumor zzso A second paradigm was developed in which injection of the targeting zzso was separated from injection of a short-lived zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This strategy has improved zzso delivery to tumors in animal models, enhanced zzso imaging in man, and therapeutic trials are in an early zzso We proposed a third paradigm to achieve zzso zzso at tumor sites by inducing tumor cells to zzso a membrane expressed zzso with a high affinity for infused zzso zzso The use of gene transfer technology to induce expression of high affinity membrane receptors can enhance the specificity of zzso zzso while the use of zzso with the ability to deliver radiation damage across several cell diameters will compensate for less than perfect zzso zzso This approach was termed zzso zzso zzso zzso Using this strategy, induction of high levels of zzso releasing zzso zzso or human zzso zzso zzso 2 expression and selective tumor zzso of zzso peptides was zzso The advantages of the genetic zzso approach are zzso zzso expression of a zzso zzso is not zzso zzso tumor cells are altered to express a new target zzso or increased quantities of an existing zzso at levels that may significantly improve tumor targeting of zzso zzso compared with normal zzso zzso gene transfer can be achieved by zzso or regional injection of gene zzso zzso it is feasible to target zzso zzso to receptors zzso on tumor cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso so that the virus will be targeted specifically to the desired zzso and zzso it is possible to zzso the zzso gene and a therapeutic zzso such as zzso zzso for molecular zzso therapy to produce an enhanced therapeutic zzso
