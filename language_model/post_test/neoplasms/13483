The past 25 years have seen unparalleled advances in our understanding of the molecular basis of zzso As a result, novel molecular targets have been identified that provide great potential for the development of new cancer zzso and zzso Four key features of cancer cells distinguish them from their normal zzso loss of zzso regulation, loss of control over invasion and zzso failure of zzso mechanisms, and bypass of zzso This review examines our understanding of the bypass of zzso and the process of zzso during zzso In addition, the realistic opportunities for zzso in cancer zzso and the challenges faced in clinical trial design for zzso zzso are zzso
