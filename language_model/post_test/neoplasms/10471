The zzso Italy accident in 1976 caused the contamination of a large population by zzso zzso zzso long-term effects have been examined through mortality and cancer zzso zzso We have updated the cancer zzso study which now covers the period zzso 

The study population includes subjects resident at the time of the accident in three contaminated zones with decreasing zzso soil levels zzso A, very high; zone B, high; zone zzso zzso and in a surrounding zzso reference zzso zzso zzso and zzso rate ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso were calculated by using zzso zzso for subjects aged zzso zzso 

All cancer zzso did not differ from expectations in any of the contaminated zzso An excess of zzso and zzso tissue zzso was observed in zones A (four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and B (29 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with the findings of the concurrent mortality zzso An increased risk of breast cancer was detected in zone A females after 15 years since the accident (five cases, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No cases of soft tissue zzso occurred in the most exposed zones (A and B, zzso zzso No cancer cases were observed among subjects diagnosed with zzso early after the zzso 

The extension of the zzso cancer zzso study confirmed an excess risk of zzso and zzso tissue zzso in the most exposed zzso No clear pattern by time since the accident and zones was evident partly because of the low number of zzso The elevated risk of breast cancer in zone A females after 15 years since the accident deserves further and thorough zzso The follow-up is continuing in order to cover the long time period (even zzso usually zzso from exposure to zzso chemicals and disease zzso
