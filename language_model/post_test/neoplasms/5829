A zzso Carlo simulation is incorporated into a risk assessment for zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso modeling coupled with the zzso zzso model to derive human zzso risk zzso The zzso Carlo technique incorporates zzso zzso zzso to produce a statistically derived range of risk estimates which zzso specific uncertainties associated with zzso risk assessment zzso Both inhalation and zzso exposure routes are zzso zzso exposure scenarios were consistent with those used by the Environmental Protection Agency zzso in their zzso risk zzso Mean values of zzso parameters were gathered from the literature for both mice zzso zzso subjects) and for zzso zzso zzso value zzso were assumed using existing data on zzso Mouse cancer zzso data were correlated to total zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso as determined by a mouse zzso zzso These internal dose metrics were used in a zzso zzso model analysis to determine dose metric values corresponding to zzso lifetime excess cancer zzso Using a human zzso model, these zzso doses were then zzso to equivalent human zzso zzso and zzso The zzso Carlo zzso with varying mouse and human zzso parameters produced a range of human exposure zzso producing a zzso zzso
