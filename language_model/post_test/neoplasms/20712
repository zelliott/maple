Cancer prevention has been the stated goal of molecular cancer epidemiology for the past 17 zzso In this review, progress toward that goal is evaluated by using as examples well-studied environmental zzso tobacco smoke, zzso aromatic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B zzso their roles in zzso breast, and liver zzso and zzso The contributions of molecular epidemiology discussed here include providing evidence that environmental agents pose zzso risks, helping establish the zzso roles of environmental factors in cancer, identifying zzso interactions and populations at greatest risk, and developing new intervention zzso zzso zzso and other data indicate that assessment of zzso risks should address both the range of risk across the population and the risk to zzso who may be at high risk because of genetic or acquired zzso including young zzso However, for the most part, research results have not yet been effectively translated into risk assessments and preventive health zzso An infrastructure linking scientists, policy makers, and other constituencies is needed to facilitate this zzso To extend our knowledge, the second generation of molecular zzso research should include zzso collaborative studies incorporating validated zzso and automated zzso An incentive to make the necessary investment is the recognition that prevention of only zzso of cancer in the United States would result in zzso fewer new cases diagnosed each year and an annual savings of zzso billion in direct costs zzso
