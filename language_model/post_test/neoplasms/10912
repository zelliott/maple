Several chemotherapy agents induce zzso that is painful for some patients, but not for zzso We assumed that these differences might be attributable to varying patterns of pain zzso 

The aim of the present study was to evaluate pain zzso in such zzso 

zzso patients with zzso zzso were tested for detection thresholds zzso warm, and zzso in both the zzso and foot, as well as for heat pain zzso mechanical zzso zzso zzso and zzso pain zzso zzso also known as the diffuse noxious zzso zzso zzso which were tested in the upper zzso 

Positive correlations were found between clinical pain levels and both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for all zzso In addition, higher zzso was associated with less efficient zzso zzso zzso The group of patients with painful zzso zzso showed a significantly higher warm detection threshold in the foot zzso higher zzso zzso and less efficient zzso zzso in comparison to the group with zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso is associated with a zzso zzso pattern, which may be primary to the development of zzso The higher warm sensory thresholds in the painful zzso group suggest that the severity of zzso may be another factor in determining its zzso
