The association between the zzso zzso single zzso zzso zzso and cancer risk has been studied by many researchers, but the results remain zzso To further explore this association, we performed a zzso 

A computerized search of zzso and zzso database for publications on the zzso zzso zzso and cancer risk was performed and the zzso data were analyzed in a zzso zzso ratios zzso with zzso confidence intervals zzso were estimated to assess the zzso zzso analysis, test of zzso cumulative zzso and assessment of bias were performed in our zzso 

A significant association between the zzso zzso zzso and cancer zzso was revealed by the results of the zzso of the 25 zzso studies zzso versus zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso dominant zzso + zzso versus zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso + zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso additive zzso + zzso versus zzso + zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, increased cancer risk in all genetic models was found after zzso of the zzso data by cancer type, ethnicity and source of zzso 

In all genetic models, the association between the zzso zzso zzso and cancer risk was zzso This zzso suggests that the zzso zzso zzso may be a risk factor for zzso Further functional studies between this zzso and cancer risk are zzso
