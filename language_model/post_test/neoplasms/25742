Using a newly developed zzso technique called zzso zzso island amplification, we have identified several DNA fragments that are zzso zzso in a colon cancer cell zzso One of the fragments, termed zzso mapped to human zzso zzso where frequent loss of zzso is detected in various human zzso By characterizing the zzso sequence around this area, we identified a gene zzso a zzso calcium channel, zzso as a target for zzso in human zzso By reverse zzso we detected expression of zzso in normal colon and bone zzso but expression was absent in the five tumor cell lines in which zzso was zzso After treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso the expression of zzso was restored in all five cell zzso zzso zzso mapping of the zzso zzso island by zzso revealed that zzso of a region zzso zzso upstream of the translation initiation site closely correlated with the zzso of zzso This region contained the zzso start site, as determined by zzso rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also examined in various human primary tumors and was detected in 17 of 49 zzso zzso zzso 4 of 16 zzso gastric zzso and 3 of 23 zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso zzso of zzso may play a role in cancer development by modulating calcium zzso which potentially affects cell proliferation and zzso
