Human high-grade zzso zzso are rapidly progressing zzso brain tumors of unknown zzso and there are no effective treatment zzso zzso The recent discovery of zzso zzso has opened new doors for specific zzso treatments using passive and active zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso expression zzso has aided in the discovery of numerous new tumor zzso These specific tumor zzso are located on zzso X and are expressed predominantly in the zzso among normal zzso and hence termed zzso zzso zzso We found that the vast majority of zzso patients zzso a zzso for an immune regulatory zzso zzso 13 zzso which differs from the normal tissue zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed solely in the zzso and its gene is localized to zzso X, which mirror the expression pattern and zzso zzso of zzso There is little evidence for frequent gross structural abnormalities on zzso X in zzso Although the mechanism that causes X zzso zzso to be zzso expressed in tumors is not fully zzso evidence is beginning to point toward the DNA zzso zzso that occurs in tumor cells as being implicit in this process and perhaps in the zzso process as zzso zzso further study of the phenomenon of zzso may bring the dual benefit of better understanding zzso and providing new molecular tools for better management of zzso Also, we propose that the X zzso may in fact be an important player in zzso zzso
