Identification of driver zzso among numerous zzso zzso remains a critical challenge to the zzso of the underlying mechanisms of zzso Because driver zzso by definition are associated with a greater number of cancer zzso compared to other zzso we hypothesized that driver zzso could more easily be identified once the zzso correlations are detected across tumor zzso 

In this study, we describe a novel network analysis to identify the driver zzso through zzso both cancer zzso and zzso Our method successfully identified a significant zzso change correlation in all six solid tumor types and revealed core zzso that contain both significantly enriched zzso zzso and zzso expression changes specific to tumor zzso Moreover, we found that the majority of these core zzso contained well known cancer driver zzso and that their zzso genes tended to occur at hub genes with central regulatory zzso In these zzso zzso the majority were zzso specific and exhibited a closer relationship within the same cancer type rather than across cancer zzso The remaining zzso genes that exist in multiple cancer types led to two cancer type zzso one cluster consisted of three neural derived or related cancer types, and the other cluster consisted of two zzso cancer zzso 

Our approach can successfully identify the candidate drivers from the core zzso Comprehensive network analysis on the core zzso potentially provides critical insights into zzso cancer development in different zzso
