Ever since its introduction in 1952, zzso has consisted of a combination of the zzso zzso and a zzso drug, zzso in the ratio of zzso Its main limitations are the relatively short duration of action and an apparent ceiling effect due to zzso We therefore developed a zzso zzso with sustained release properties zzso zzso zzso patients with advanced cancer with zzso pain, treated with regular doses of zzso zzso took part in an open phase 1 type zzso study comparing zzso zzso and zzso zzso The patients spent at least 4 days in the zzso After evaluation during 12 h with zzso zzso zzso dosing zzso a loading phase lasting for 36 h with zzso zzso given zzso h zzso dose of zzso zzso per 24 h divided by zzso and zzso reduction of the dose of zzso zzso a similar evaluation period of 12 h was performed when on treatment with zzso zzso zzso zzso of data from the two observation periods showed the zzso Average relative zzso zzso zzso zzso Only 2 patients were zzso before 12 h when on zzso zzso zzso of action mean zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference between zzso zzso and zzso zzso periods concerning zzso with no zzso zzso were zzso The only significant difference was dry mouth being more severe during the tablet zzso Vital signs were unaffected by zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso can be given every 12 h to cancer patients with chronic pain with satisfactory zzso effect, a very modest change in zzso profile and no significant effects on vital signs when substituting zzso zzso for zzso zzso in equal daily zzso
