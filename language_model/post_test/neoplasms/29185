zzso interference zzso has become the method of choice for researchers wishing to target specific genes for zzso and has provided immense potential as therapeutic zzso This narrative review article aimed to understand potential benefits and limitations of zzso technique for clinical application and in zzso studies through reading the articles published during the recent 3 zzso 

zzso database was searched by using zzso or zzso and zzso zzso with limits of dates zzso in the last 3 zzso language zzso and article type zzso zzso for obtaining articles on in zzso studies on the use of zzso zzso zzso of clinical trials on zzso registered at the zzso were zzso 

The only three clinical studies published so far and many in zzso studies in animals showed that the zzso technique is safe and effective in treatment of zzso of many zzso and various other diseases including viral infection, zzso zzso and some zzso diseases with considerable benefits such as high zzso many possible routes of administration and possibility of zzso multiple genes at the same zzso zzso and uncertainty include efficiency of cellular zzso specific guidance to the target tissue or cell, long-term safety, sustained efficacy and rapid clearance from the zzso 

zzso technique will become an important and potent weapon for fighting against various zzso zzso technique has benefits and limitations in its potential clinical zzso zzso the obstacles is still a formidable zzso
