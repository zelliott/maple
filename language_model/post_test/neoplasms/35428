The purpose of the current study was to determine the maximum tolerated dose, zzso zzso zzso profile, and recommended Phase II dose of oral administration of zzso a novel zzso formed by the combination of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso 

zzso patients had advanced solid tumors, adequate organ function, and had not received zzso therapy in the preceding 4 zzso zzso was administered orally once daily for 14 days, followed by a zzso rest, repeated every 3 zzso The initial dose of zzso administered was 100 zzso The first 2 patients treated at that dose experienced substantial toxicity and, therefore, lower dose levels of zzso were subsequently zzso 

Fourteen patients were zzso all patients were zzso for toxicity assessment and 12 were zzso for zzso The initial dose explored was 100 zzso based on a zzso monkey zzso However, the first 2 patients experienced bone zzso suppression of Grade 3 or 4 in course zzso The protocol was amended to study the next cohort of patients at 50 zzso At this dose level no Grade 3 or 4 zzso were observed in course zzso In the subsequent dose level zzso zzso 3 of 6 patients experienced Grade 3 or 4 zzso as zzso zzso Three additional patients for a total of 6 were enrolled at 50 zzso without occurrence of zzso zzso Thus, 50 zzso was declared the maximum tolerated dose for this zzso 

The zzso study showed that 50 zzso was a tolerable dose of the novel zzso zzso in combination with an inhibitor of its zzso zzso zzso and this is the recommended Phase II zzso zzso of this daily dose in zzso for which zzso have failed is zzso
