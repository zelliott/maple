Increased dosage of cellular zzso resulting from amplification of DNA is a frequent genetic zzso of tumor zzso Certain types of human tumors carry a specific amplified cellular zzso at zzso of up to 50 to zzso Human zzso has been zzso for a contribution of amplification to zzso and evidence is emerging that amplification may be an early event involved in a zzso form of this zzso It is unclear at which stage amplification plays a role in other zzso zzso of cellular zzso is a good predictor for clinical outcome in some human zzso and is a paradigm for the application of zzso research in a clinical zzso
