zzso immunity and serum regulatory factors were studied in an in zzso system involving a spontaneously zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice were zzso with zzso zzso zzso virus and their zzso cells were tested for zzso in zzso zzso tests with extracts of zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice were tested for their effect on this zzso At the optimal zzso tumor extracts induced significant reactions with cells from zzso mice zzso and from mice with zzso tumors zzso cells from normal mice and from mice with zzso chemically induced tumors were zzso zzso from zzso mice specifically blocked the zzso of zzso zzso At the time of zzso tumor development, this blocking activity disappeared and the serum became zzso zzso the zzso serum neutralized the blocking factor in zzso zzso The blocking or zzso factors were zzso no zzso occurred with similar factors related to the chemically induced zzso zzso cells were not significantly affected by exposure to blocking and zzso zzso The development of cellular immune zzso and serum factors detected in zzso corresponded to the cycle of tumor progression and zzso observed in zzso
