Over the past 10 years evidence has been accumulating that zzso agents induce zzso in cancer cells and that abnormalities in zzso signaling pathways often occur in cancer cells and are associated with drug zzso The implication is that factors regulating the zzso process play a critical role in zzso sensitivity to chemotherapy, and hence may be rational molecular targets for novel zzso zzso zzso zzso signals make cancer cells zzso more susceptible to zzso defects in the zzso occur subsequent to cancer zzso Important emerging questions are the pattern of zzso in the zzso zzso in a particular zzso zzso and the best strategy to exploit them and induce selective zzso cell zzso Here, we review recent progress in this zzso
