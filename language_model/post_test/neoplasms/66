Many human cells and cell lines possess a specific zzso that binds zzso zzso zzso zzso with an affinity of about zzso zzso Bound zzso is not zzso is slowly zzso and retains its zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso responsible for zzso binding is located within the first 35 zzso zzso zzso in the growth factor zzso zzso however, is not zzso for by other proteins that contain the growth factor domain (including zzso growth zzso zzso that produce zzso zzso the zzso form, which subsequently binds to the zzso zzso cells, in fact, have their receptors completely saturated with zzso It is proposed that zzso interaction plays a direct role in zzso and pathological processes that require cell zzso
