A model system employing a modified nylon zzso is described for the separation of rare cells zzso into either a zzso cell line or normal bone zzso A zzso to zzso enrichment and recovery of the rare cell population was zzso starting from an initial level of zzso to zzso of the total zzso The rare cell population was identified by zzso with zzso zzso which zzso into the DNA, and renders cells highly zzso zzso and recovery of cells was totally dependent on the use of a panel of zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso The nylon zzso zzso with an zzso zzso traps the cells coated with zzso zzso and these can be released simply by gentle manipulation of the zzso The zzso employed has been shown to not specifically trap committed bone zzso zzso as determined by zzso zzso and zzso zzso The use of this technique should simplify the isolation of rare zzso cells zzso to bone zzso
