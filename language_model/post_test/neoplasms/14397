Ras zzso particularly their active zzso forms zzso were thought zzso zzso to the absence of apparent zzso pockets in their crystal zzso Only recently, such pockets have been found in the crystal structures representing a novel zzso zzso We have conducted an in zzso zzso screen targeting a pocket in the crystal structure of zzso and obtained zzso which, along with its analogue zzso zzso binding of zzso to zzso They inhibit the growth of zzso zzso cells, which are accompanied by zzso of not only zzso but also zzso zzso and zzso indicating the blockade of interaction with multiple zzso Moreover, they exhibit zzso activity on a zzso of human colon zzso carrying zzso The nuclear magnetic resonance structure of a complex of the compound with zzso confirms its zzso into the surface zzso Thus, these compounds may serve as a novel scaffold for the development of Ras zzso with higher potency and zzso
