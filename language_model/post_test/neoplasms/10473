zzso with zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso repeated at zzso to zzso zzso are performed for prevention or early detection of cancer in patients with DNA mismatch repair gene zzso causing Lynch zzso The long-term effectiveness of surveillance was evaluated in Lynch syndrome family members tested approximately 10 years zzso 

Cancer zzso and survival were determined after an zzso follow-up in 242 zzso and zzso zzso zzso These participants in 57 Lynch syndrome families with 14 different zzso were at 50% zzso The median age was 36 years zzso 18 to 72 zzso in zzso carriers and 42 years zzso 18 to 72 zzso in zzso participants, and none had had cancer of the Lynch syndrome zzso

zzso compliance in surveillance for zzso and zzso exceeded zzso in Lynch zzso All zzso deaths were not prevented as a result of noncompliance or missed zzso Still, after 10 years of zzso no significant increase in mortality had occurred compared with zzso zzso
