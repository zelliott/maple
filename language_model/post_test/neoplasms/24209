Recent efforts to treat zzso using gene transfer have met with varying degrees of zzso In this paper, we report the results of studies using two zzso zzso zzso to examine the efficacy of combination gene transfer to cause tumor zzso in zzso One of these zzso encodes the zzso zzso class I zzso zzso zzso which zzso an immune response that stimulates tumor zzso The second zzso encodes the human zzso zzso dependent zzso inhibitor zzso This gene product arrests cell cycle progression and prevents proliferation of tumor zzso Both zzso were tested in a zzso model in zzso for zzso zzso As previously zzso a significant reduction of tumor size was observed with each zzso Combination treatment, in which both zzso were zzso resulted in a trend toward a reduced tumor growth greater than with either zzso zzso In order to characterize the mechanism of tumor regression, zzso T zzso zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso were zzso Mice treated with zzso showed specific zzso activity against the zzso zzso demonstrating that the immune response against the zzso gene product involved in tumor zzso was zzso by expression of the zzso gene which affects cell cycle zzso
