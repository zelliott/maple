Experimental observations of pronounced zzso incorporation near the zzso of cancer tissue occurring three days after therapeutic treatment with a zzso cell killing rate of 50% have led to the conclusion that zzso reaction is one of the most likely causes of the known increase in resistance found with repeated cancer therapy zzso zzso incorporation especially diminishes the zzso diffusion zzso and therefore zzso the zzso diffusion field around the zzso so that proliferation and sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso and radiation will decrease to a very high zzso The given solution of the zzso diffusion field equation permits a quantitative presentation of zzso and therapeutic results about zzso incorporation within a zzso distance of R approximately 30 zzso So it has been calculated that, in stationary cases, a transition to the conditions obtained with Cancer zzso zzso zzso will increase the volume of zzso tissue being accessible to a therapeutic process by a factor of more than zzso zzso from theoretical aspects, the CMT Concept therefore seems to be one of the most promising possibilities to overcome the zzso resistance of zzso zzso Finally, the paper gives a discussion about an actual possibility for reducing the developing resistance in case of repeated therapeutic treatment based on experimental circumstances; zzso the zzso of zzso zzso for instance, by giving a high dosage of zzso in the zzso between therapeutic zzso
