Development and growth of all organisms involves the faithful reproduction of cells and requires that the zzso be accurately zzso and equally zzso between two cellular zzso In human cells, faithful segregation of the zzso is accomplished by an elaborate zzso machine, the zzso zzso It is not difficult to envision how defects in components of this complex machine molecules that control its organization and function and regulators that temporally couple zzso operation to other cell cycle events could lead to zzso zzso Recent evidence indicates that the persistent zzso of zzso result in gains and losses of zzso and may be an important cause of zzso This form of zzso instability may contribute to tumor development and progression by zzso loss of zzso zzso and the zzso expression of zzso tumor zzso zzso and by favoring zzso of zzso that harbor zzso In this review, we will discuss zzso defects that cause zzso zzso examine components and regulatory mechanisms of the zzso machine implicated in cancer, and explore mechanisms by which zzso zzso could lead to zzso
