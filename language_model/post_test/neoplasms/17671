An important aspect of heavy charged particle zzso is its ability to zzso dose to the target zzso Current techniques generally employ beam delivery schemes which use range modulated beams in which the Bragg peak is spread out over a range of zzso The range zzso is constant over the entire beam cross zzso This paper examines the potential gain from the use of variable range zzso over the beam cross section which can be achieved through beam zzso An zzso technique has been developed to calculate a gain factor, related to integral dose, for a number of different charged particle zzso The dependence of the gain factor on tumor depth, diameter, and size has been zzso These zzso results have been compared with computer calculations of treatment plans simulating beam scanning and fixed zzso delivery techniques for actual clinical zzso The rationale for beam zzso and its potential impact on tumor control is zzso
