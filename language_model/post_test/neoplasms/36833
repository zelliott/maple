zzso have the potential to be powerful tools for selective cell killing, but their lack of clinical success against solid tumors indicates a need to better understand factors which limit zzso transport in three-dimensional zzso In this work, a previously developed model which related zzso toxicity to cellular trafficking in a single cell was coupled with a term accounting for zzso transport of zzso in a solid tumor zzso This created a mathematical model which is capable of simulating the biological response of zzso tumor zzso zzso to zzso zzso The model was used to predict the zzso of protein synthesis zzso in zzso treated with zzso zzso zzso as a function of zzso concentration and toxin zzso zzso cells were grown as zzso and treated with zzso constructed from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the toxins zzso or zzso and the average protein synthesis zzso and growth rates were zzso With no fitted zzso the mathematical model zzso predicted the experimental zzso zzso were generally less effective against zzso than zzso cells at equivalent zzso for zzso at high zzso this decrease in efficacy was attributed primarily to zzso zzso distribution in zzso whereas for zzso the decrease was caused primarily by a large barrier to penetration of the zzso into the zzso The zzso verified model was used to define the conditions which lead to large penetration zzso In general, transport barriers in zzso become more important as zzso become more effective against cells grown as zzso The proposed model is unique in its ability to predict toxicity in zzso directly, and is an important step toward understanding zzso effect on tumors in zzso
