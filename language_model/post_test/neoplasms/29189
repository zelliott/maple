to investigate the zzso imaging and therapeutic capabilities of zzso zzso composed of a zzso iron oxide zzso core and a gold shell zzso 

the zzso properties of zzso were examined both in an zzso gel phantom and in zzso by evaluating zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and by measuring zzso zzso zzso temperature changes zzso by zzso In addition, the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso after intravenous injection in mice bearing zzso tumors were evaluated in the presence and absence of an external zzso 

: In zzso zzso containing zzso a significant contrast enhancement in zzso zzso was observed and a linear increase in temperature was observed with increasing concentration and laser output power when zzso with zzso light centered at an zzso zzso In zzso zzso delineated zzso and magnetic resonance temperature imaging of the same tumors revealed significant temperature zzso when zzso injected with zzso (1 zzso 10 zzso and zzso with zzso light zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for saline + zzso zzso studies in mice zzso injected with zzso zzso 10 zzso had an approximately zzso increase in zzso delivered into tumors in the presence of an external magnet compared with tumors without the zzso 

zzso to its ability to mediate efficient zzso zzso of cancer cells under zzso guidance, as well as the ability to be directed to solid tumors with an external magnetic field zzso zzso zzso is a promising zzso zzso
