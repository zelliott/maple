Major surgery zzso the cellular immune zzso In order to stimulate the zzso system during the zzso period, we have studied the clinical and biological zzso and the zzso and zzso effects of a zzso treatment using progressive doses of zzso zzso from the third zzso day zzso until the tenth zzso day zzso 

zzso patients undergoing a major surgical procedure for advanced cancer were zzso The clinical and biological parameters evaluated were the body temperature and the blood cell zzso zzso effects were evaluated by counting the total number of zzso zzso subsets, natural killer cells zzso and by analysis of the zzso activity, and zzso killer cell zzso zzso 

zzso was the most toxic effect of zzso but the overall toxicity was minor, even at the highest dose zzso In the early zzso period there was a significant decrease in total zzso and in most zzso subset counts when compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities significantly increased from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso decrease in zzso activity was noted that was not significant when compared to zzso values, whereas a significant decrease in zzso activity did occur on zzso despite the zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso Since we found a zzso effect on some zzso subsets, there was not a clear zzso effect on zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso alpha zzso administration is a safe treatment in advanced cancer patients that may allow a zzso preservation of zzso activity and a destruction of potential circulating zzso zzso Further studies are ongoing on zzso zzso in advanced cancer zzso
