To zzso evaluate the zzso and toxicity profile of zzso in relation to patient age in adults zzso or zzso 55 years zzso 

zzso was administered at 175 zzso for 3 hours to 153 patients, 46 of whom were zzso or zzso 75 years of zzso zzso and toxicity assessments were zzso Data were analyzed by cohort zzso 1, age 55 to 64 years; cohort 2, age 65 to 74 years; cohort 3, age zzso or zzso 75 zzso 

zzso concentration versus time zzso and zzso clearance zzso data were available for 122 patients zzso 1, 46 zzso cohort 2, 44 zzso cohort 3, 32 zzso Mean zzso zzso increased across zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso hour, zzso zzso zzso zzso hour, and zzso zzso zzso zzso hour for zzso 1, 2, and 3, zzso There was a corresponding significant zzso zzso zzso age-related decrease in mean zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso zzso zzso cohort 2, zzso zzso zzso cohort 3, zzso zzso zzso Patients in cohort 3 experienced significantly lower absolute zzso count zzso than did younger groups zzso zzso zzso There was also a significant increase in percentage of patients with zzso or zzso grade 3 zzso across age zzso zzso 1, zzso cohort 2, zzso cohort 3, zzso P zzso zzso However, the increased exposure of patients to zzso and increased zzso were not reflected in adverse clinical zzso such as hospitalization for toxicity zzso zzso zzso receiving intravenous antibiotics zzso zzso zzso or experiencing a temperature more than 38 degrees C zzso zzso zzso 

Although zzso zzso decreases with increasing patient age, there is great zzso zzso Cooperative group studies to evaluate the effect of aging on zzso are zzso
