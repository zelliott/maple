zzso delivery of zzso drugs remains one of the most prevailing problems in cancer zzso While conventional means of zzso invariably leave different degrees of zzso on healthy zzso in recent times, intelligent chemical designs have been exploited to reduce the zzso In particular, the strategies involving zzso zzso with surface assembled zzso as therapeutic carrier have raised affirmative zzso zzso is designed in such a way that the therapeutic molecules are released zzso at target site as the complementary zzso chains zzso over the heat generated by the zzso under the zzso of low frequency electromagnetic zzso In spite of the preliminary zzso zzso comprehension of the entire process especially on the zzso of zzso interactions between zzso zzso phenomena of zzso chains and zzso organization of in zzso transport processes remains zzso Here, we propose an integrated zzso zzso model to interpret the efficacy of drug delivery in the aforementioned zzso The basic physics of heat generation by zzso zzso in presence of external electromagnetic field has been coupled with transient biological heat transfer model and the statistical mechanics based zzso zzso zzso zzso we have introduced a set of zzso appropriate transport processes to mimic the in zzso drug delivery zzso The subsequent zzso diffusion and zzso of the various species involved in the process over time was simulated assuming a porous media model of the zzso As a result, the model predictions exhibit excellent zzso with available experimental zzso To delineate a broader spectrum of a zzso zzso we have investigated the effects of different zzso parameters such as zzso field strength, zzso size, diffusion zzso porous media parameters and different zzso sequences on temperature rise and zzso drug zzso The proposed model, thus, provides a generic framework for the betterment of zzso zzso drug delivery, which is expected to impart significant impact on cancer zzso
