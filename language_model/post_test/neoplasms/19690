To compare the zzso clinical outcomes of patients undergoing cancer surgery in the zzso zzso Cancer Hospital before and after zzso of the zzso zzso 

We zzso observed zzso patients during two zzso the first between April and May 2010 zzso zzso zzso comprised patients undergoing conventional conducts zzso 1) and the second from September to October 2010 zzso zzso zzso formed by patients undergoing a new protocol of zzso established by zzso zzso zzso The variables examined were length of zzso zzso zzso of diet in the zzso period, zzso volume and length of zzso 

When comparing the two zzso in Phase 2 there was a decrease of approximately 50% in the time of zzso zzso zzso zzso hours vs zzso zzso hours, p zzso ), a reduction of approximately zzso of the volume of intravenous zzso in the immediate zzso period zzso zzso zzso in the first zzso day zzso zzso and zzso at second PO zzso zzso zzso with an overall reduction of zzso zzso zzso There was no difference in length of zzso hospital stay between the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso days, p zzso zzso However, in patients whose time of zzso zzso was up to 5 hours, hospitalization time decreased by one day zzso zzso vs zzso zzso days, p zzso zzso 

The adoption of zzso measures is feasible and safe in cancer zzso After zzso of the zzso zzso there was reduction of intravenous zzso volume and, when the zzso zzso was reduced, hospitalization time was zzso
