Several studies have shown that patients' zzso for the development of zzso following chemotherapy are robust zzso of that zzso side effect, and some studies have shown that interventions designed to influence zzso can affect patients' reports of zzso In this randomized, zzso Community Clinical Oncology Program trial, we investigated the effect of an expectancy manipulation designed to reduce zzso expectancy on zzso zzso in zzso patients scheduled to receive chemotherapy zzso Patients in the intervention arm received general zzso educational material plus specific information about the efficacy of zzso specifically designed to diminish zzso zzso Patients in the control arm received only the general zzso educational zzso zzso expectancy was assessed both prior to and following the educational zzso We observed a significant reduction in zzso expectancy in the intervention group zzso as compared to the control group zzso In the intervention group, patients' expectations of zzso assessed prior to the intervention correlated significantly with average zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso expectancy assessed following the intervention did not zzso zzso Although the expectancy manipulation reduced patients' reported expectations for the development of zzso the occurrence of zzso was not zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expectancy compared to zzso expectancy was less zzso of subsequent zzso zzso for these findings include the possibility that the expectancy manipulation was not strong enough, and the possibility that changing zzso zzso does not change occurrence of zzso
