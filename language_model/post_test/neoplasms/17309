The treatment of zzso tumors is dependent upon the delivery of zzso through the blood by means of the zzso zzso in the zzso of normal and zzso zzso have been zzso but it is not fully understood how these differences affect transport and the zzso of existing mathematical models has been questioned at the zzso due to the complex zzso of blood and fluid exchange with the zzso In addition to determining an appropriate set of governing equations it is necessary to specify appropriate model parameters based on zzso zzso To this end, a two stage sensitivity analysis is described which makes it possible to determine the set of parameters most important to the zzso zzso In the first stage, the fluid flow equations are examined and a sensitivity analysis is used to evaluate the importance of 11 different model zzso Of these, only four substantially influence the zzso zzso flow providing a zzso set that could be zzso using red blood cell zzso data from the zzso The second stage also zzso a sensitivity analysis to evaluate the importance of 14 model parameters on zzso zzso Of these, six exhibit high sensitivity and are integrated into the model zzso using a response surface methodology and experimental zzso and zzso zzso data from the literature zzso zzso in J zzso Cancer zzso zzso zzso The model exhibits good agreement with the experimental results for both the mean zzso concentration and the penetration depth as a function of time for zzso zzso over a wide range of molecular zzso
