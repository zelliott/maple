Due to their ballistic precision, zzso induction by zzso could be a strategy to specifically eliminate zzso zzso To characterize the cellular and molecular effects of these zzso we performed zzso and zzso experiments by exposing different cell lines zzso zzso zzso to increasing doses of zzso and examining them with zzso zzso and electron spin resonance zzso zzso with a dose of 10 zzso of a zzso zzso zzso beam altered cell structures such as zzso caused DNA double strand breaks, and significantly increased zzso levels of zzso zzso are active oxygen species zzso This modified the zzso of zzso cells, activated the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and resulted in cycle arrest at the zzso zzso The number of zzso cells within the zzso cell population did not significantly increase with respect to the zzso The effects of zzso with 20 zzso were zzso as well as zzso similar, but exposure to 40 zzso caused massive zzso Similar experiments with photons demonstrated that they induce zzso in a significantly lower number of cells and in a temporally delayed zzso These data advance our knowledge on the cellular and molecular effects of zzso zzso and could be useful for improving current zzso zzso
