A plethora of data has been used to condemn and defend the role of silicone and its association with zzso zzso In the ongoing attempt to enhance our knowledge, we have chosen to identify tissue silicon levels zzso zzso zzso in capsules that form around zzso zzso devices, which consist of a metal dome zzso by zzso We have compared these levels with previously established silicon levels in zzso breast zzso distant tissue sites in these same zzso women, and zzso zzso zzso from various geographic locations in the United zzso All specimens were harvested by a zzso zzso technique, not zzso zzso frozen, and shipped to an independent zzso laboratory for zzso zzso coupled plasma atomic zzso zzso was employed to obtain the tissue silicon zzso zzso demonstrated silicon values ranging from zzso in 9 patients to as high as 41 zzso These values fell in between our zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso tissue silicon levels (18 to zzso zzso Although the sample size is small and the power of statistical analysis is low, there was no correlation between the patient's silicon level and age, type of cancer, type of zzso agent, radiation therapy, or length of time the zzso were in zzso Although zzso levels of silicon identified around zzso devices were higher than expected, it is impossible to make any conclusions about these levels and the role of a potential zzso zzso What we have zzso however, is that silicone breast implants may not be the only medical device that can elevate tissue silicon zzso Our data seem to suggest that there may be a progression of measurable tissue silicon levels based on the amount of environmental or zzso silicon exposure a person has had at a particular time in his or her zzso It is our belief that as we identify these tissue silicon levels, they will serve as a baseline and reference for further scientific zzso
