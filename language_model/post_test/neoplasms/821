The aim of the study was to investigate the association between lifetime consumption of alcoholic beverages and cancer zzso 

Data were collected in a zzso zzso study, conducted in Montreal in the mid-1980s, designed to assess the associations between hundreds of zzso and occupational zzso and multiple cancer sites in zzso We present results for 13 cancer sites: zzso zzso zzso zzso stomach zzso zzso zzso colon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso kidney zzso zzso zzso Hodgkin's zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in comparison to population controls zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso were estimated for the associations between lifetime consumption of total alcoholic zzso beer, wine, and/or zzso altogether and zzso and each cancer site, while carefully adjusting for smoking and other zzso using zzso zzso zzso 

For several zzso zzso stomach, zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso there was evidence of increased risk among alcohol consumers compared with zzso and occasional zzso For most sites, it was beer and to a lesser extent spirits consumption that drove the excess zzso
