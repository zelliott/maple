zzso is a zzso zzso that has been implicated as an important zzso of tumor zzso and has been investigated for use as a zzso for advanced disease and as a potential therapeutic target in the regulation of cancer zzso The zzso DNA sequence is highly zzso and the protein contains several important functional zzso including zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso High levels of zzso expression correlate with tumor invasion, progression or zzso in multiple zzso Studies demonstrate that zzso mediates the molecular mechanisms which determine zzso spread, such as prevention of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell migration, evasion of zzso cells and zzso zzso regulation of zzso is complex and involves multiple zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The current state of knowledge of zzso biology suggests that it is an attractive target for therapeutic zzso of zzso zzso
