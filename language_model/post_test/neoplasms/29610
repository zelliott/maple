zzso zzso and zzso zzso have demonstrated zzso and zzso effects alone and in combination with each zzso This study evaluated the safety, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso therapy consisted of zzso at 10 zzso every 14 days and zzso 5 zzso daily which escalated to 10 zzso zzso zzso 75 zzso daily was added to the phase II dose recommended phase II dose zzso of zzso and zzso zzso toxicity zzso was assessed in cycle zzso 

Forty-eight patients with advanced solid zzso were zzso for zzso and zzso No zzso were observed in the zzso dose zzso Two zzso zzso 3 zzso and grade 3 zzso were observed with the addition of zzso 75 zzso zzso zzso zzso doses were adjusted and were better zzso Four patients had a partial zzso Median zzso survival zzso for the zzso therapy was zzso months zzso to zzso zzso and zzso months zzso to zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso exposure of zzso was significantly higher in combination with zzso zzso zzso 161 zzso zzso compared to when given alone zzso zzso 156 zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

The zzso for the zzso therapy is zzso 10 zzso every 14 days and zzso 10 zzso daily, and the zzso for the zzso therapy is zzso 5 zzso every 14 days, zzso 5 zzso and zzso 75 zzso zzso zzso disease stability was demonstrated in tumors known to respond to zzso zzso and potentially resistant to zzso zzso
