zzso cell types and zzso mechanisms of human spontaneous zzso zzso zzso were studied in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso from cancer patients and controls were used as zzso cells either zzso or after zzso by zzso techniques or affinity zzso The possible zzso dependency of the reactions was studied by incorporation of specific zzso fragments of rabbit zzso zzso zzso in the incubation zzso Twelve different target cell lines of either high or low sensitivity to zzso and with or without easily zzso zzso zzso were zzso Most of the target cells were cell lines derived from transitional cell zzso of the urinary zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso target cell combinations were zzso Although zzso and zzso target cells differed significantly in zzso to zzso the zzso zzso was displayed by zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to the incubation zzso resulted in strong zzso of zzso regardless of the type of target cells used and in zzso as well as in zzso zzso target cell zzso However, in some combinations no zzso was seen and zzso was usually not complete, suggesting that both zzso zzso zzso and zzso mechanisms were involved in the zzso zzso The results of the zzso zzso were compared with those obtained with zzso of the same zzso and target cells in an zzso zzso zzso While similar results were obtained with zzso target cells, with zzso targets and in some zzso combinations the two zzso systems registered zzso cell interactions which differed with regard to zzso zzso cell type, and zzso zzso
