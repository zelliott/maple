The marine habitat has produced a significant number of very potent zzso agents that have the potential to inhibit the growth of human tumor cells in zzso and, in a number of cases, in both in zzso zzso models and in zzso Although many agents have entered clinical trials in cancer, to date, only zzso zzso zzso zzso (a synthetic zzso based on the structure of zzso B), and the zzso 10 zzso zzso E zzso or zzso as a warhead, have been approved for use in humans zzso In this review, we show the compounds derived from marine sources that are currently in clinical trials against zzso We have included brief discussions of the approved agents, where they are in trials to extend their initial approved activity (a common practice once an agent is approved), and have also included an extensive discussion of the use of zzso derivatives as warheads, plus an area that has rarely been covered, the use of zzso agents to zzso the pain from zzso in humans, and to act as an zzso in zzso zzso
