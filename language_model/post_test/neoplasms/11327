To determine the risk of subsequent zzso other than breast, zzso and skin, and to identify factors that influence the risk among survivors of childhood zzso 

zzso zzso zzso history was determined in zzso participants zzso zzso or zzso 5 years zzso diagnosed from 1970 to 1986 at age zzso 21 zzso of the Childhood Cancer zzso Study to calculate standardized zzso ratios zzso using zzso zzso and End zzso zzso 

In 71 individuals, 71 zzso were diagnosed at a median age of 27 years and a median elapsed time of 15 years in the zzso system zzso head and neck area zzso gastrointestinal tract zzso and other sites zzso zzso patients zzso had received zzso and 42 zzso developed a second zzso zzso in a previous zzso zzso zzso was significantly elevated following all childhood diagnoses except zzso zzso and was highest following zzso zzso zzso zzso and soft tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso had a zzso increased risk of zzso cell zzso survivors of Hodgkin's zzso had a zzso increased risk of gastrointestinal zzso zzso elevated risk of head and neck zzso occurred in survivors of soft tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and leukemia zzso zzso zzso 

Young survivors of childhood zzso are at increased risk of developing subsequent zzso typical of later adulthood, zzso the importance of long-term follow-up and zzso zzso zzso of the cohort is ongoing to determine lifetime risk and delineate individual characteristics that contribute to zzso
