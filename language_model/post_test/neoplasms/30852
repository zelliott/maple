In zzso studies have demonstrated that a brief exposure of peripherally collected zzso cells to high-dose human zzso zzso will generate a population of zzso zzso killer zzso zzso These cells have similar zzso against natural killer cells and resistant and sensitive target cells as compared with the standard zzso cells incubated for zzso days with zzso zzso the authors conducted a pilot study to investigate the activity of zzso zzso cells in patients with advanced zzso 

zzso patients were enrolled in a pilot study, and zzso zzso cell treatment was administered two times per week for 4 weeks, followed by similar cycles if patients remained free of disease progression and unacceptable toxic zzso 

zzso effects consisted mainly of fever, zzso zzso and zzso but were zzso and zzso Most cycles were administered on an zzso zzso There were six partial responses zzso occurring in two of three patients with zzso cell zzso two of four with zzso zzso one of seven with zzso cell lung zzso and one of one with zzso zzso Two minimal responses were seen in one case each of melanoma and zzso of zzso Nine other patients had disease stabilization for 16 weeks, and two additional patients had disease zzso zzso of peripheral zzso cells showed increases in zzso and zzso populations with no in zzso zzso being administered after treatment with zzso zzso zzso 

The relative ease in generating zzso zzso cells and the associated mild toxic effects enable prolonged stimulation of the zzso cells of the patients against sensitive tumor targets, with a response rate comparable to those of high-dose zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso it may be a theoretically ideal zzso for patients with zzso cell zzso melanoma, and zzso and other zzso patients after bone zzso zzso The initial high response rate in patients with late-stage zzso cell zzso and zzso zzso indicates the need for additional zzso
