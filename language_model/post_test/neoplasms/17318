zzso zzso therapy can target and kill widespread zzso cells thereby inducing durable clinical responses in melanoma and selected other zzso However, many commonly targeted tumor zzso are also expressed by healthy zzso and T cells do not distinguish between benign and zzso zzso if both express the target zzso zzso toxicity from T zzso destruction of normal tissue has limited the development and adoption of this otherwise promising type of cancer zzso A review of the unique biology of zzso therapy and of recent clinical experience zzso a reassessment of target zzso that traditionally have been viewed from the perspective of weaker zzso zzso It is important that target zzso chosen for adoptive zzso therapy are expressed by tumors and not by essential healthy zzso The risk of adverse zzso events can be further zzso by generating zzso receptors using strategies that reduce the chance of zzso against zzso in unintended zzso In general, a zzso approach to target selection and thoughtful zzso and clinical studies are pivotal to the ongoing advancement of these promising zzso
