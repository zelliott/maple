zzso zzso zzso are a key component of the tumor zzso and orchestrate various aspects of zzso Diversity and plasticity are hallmarks of cells of the zzso zzso In response to distinct signals zzso undergo zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso which represent extremes of a zzso in a spectrum of zzso zzso zzso adaptation is a key component of zzso plasticity and zzso instrumental to their function in zzso immunity and zzso Generally, zzso acquire an zzso zzso that plays important roles in many aspects of tumor growth and zzso There is now evidence that also zzso can be driven towards distinct zzso in response to zzso zzso The identification of mechanisms and molecules associated with zzso and zzso plasticity and polarized zzso provides a basis for new diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
