zzso zzso DNA content analysis, employing fluorescent zzso that bind zzso to DNA, is widely used by researchers and clinicians to monitor cell growth zzso and to detect abnormalities in nuclear DNA content in tumor zzso zzso precision is critical because small differences in DNA content may be zzso plastic spheres and cell zzso are used for instrument zzso and zzso zzso techniques must provide a zzso stained sample representative of the cells or tissue under zzso zzso gating may facilitate cell selection within zzso zzso zzso of light zzso surface or zzso zzso zzso zzso structure, and/or DNA synthesis may provide additional useful information about zzso cell zzso
