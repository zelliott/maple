The focus of cancer research is on zzso zzso with most clinical trials involving targeted zzso zzso numbers of DNA zzso and tumor resistance events, in each of the zzso cells of a human individual, form a striking contrast to the low, and also very narrow, cancer zzso window zzso zzso A detailed consideration of these quantitative observations seems to question the present zzso while suggesting that a systemic regulatory network mechanism is a stronger zzso for overt cancer disease, as compared with zzso gene zzso If we shall ever achieve major improvements in survival, we must gain understanding of this systemic network, rather than targeting therapy to a limited set of molecules or zzso This may give us new opportunities for development of highly potent therapeutic zzso
