This study enrolled patients to dosing combinations of zzso and zzso The primary objective was to estimate the toxicity zzso of the combination and establish recommended phase II zzso 

Sixty patients were treated on 12 of 16 possible dosing zzso zzso was the most common drug-related zzso and zzso toxicity zzso zzso four of 10 zzso zzso grade 3 zzso abnormalities were also zzso Other frequent drug-related zzso included zzso zzso (both zzso and anemia zzso Two zzso dose combinations were zzso 200 zzso of zzso zzso of zzso and 160 zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso were noted in patients with zzso breast cancer resistant to zzso zzso zzso lung cancer, and tumor types without identified zzso in the zzso zzso 

The combination of zzso and zzso was tolerable and demonstrated zzso activity in multiple tumor types, zzso further zzso
