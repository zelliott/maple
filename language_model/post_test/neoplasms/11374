A possible way to avoid zzso side effects of platinum zzso drugs is to employ light to cause zzso changes in nontoxic platinum zzso that release active zzso zzso This strategy could be used in the treatment of localized zzso accessible to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We report here that nontoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes inhibit the growth of human zzso cancer cells upon zzso with light, and are zzso to zzso Their rate of zzso closely parallels that of DNA zzso indicating that the zzso products interact directly, and zzso with zzso zzso results in a dramatic shrinking of the cancer cells, loss of zzso packing of nuclear material, and eventual disintegration of their zzso indicating a different mechanism of action from zzso
