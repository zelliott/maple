The zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso whose expression and activity are correlated with advanced zzso and poor prognosis in a variety of human zzso Nine additional zzso with zzso to zzso have been identified and collectively are referred to as zzso family zzso zzso Together, zzso represent the largest family of zzso zzso zzso and interact directly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso steroid zzso signal zzso and zzso of transcription, and molecules involved in cell zzso and zzso These interactions lead to a diverse array of biological functions including zzso cell growth, zzso cell shape, zzso migration, zzso and zzso Studies investigating zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso suggest that this may be a rare event and that zzso zzso is zzso zzso Thus, the role of zzso in the development and progression of human cancer remains zzso Recently, it was suggested that increased zzso protein levels and, more importantly, zzso zzso zzso activity are linked to cancer progression and zzso disease by zzso the action of other signaling zzso This accumulating body of evidence indicates that zzso may represent a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of solid zzso This review discusses the role of zzso in solid tumors and the recent therapeutic advances aimed at targeting this family of zzso zzso in zzso
