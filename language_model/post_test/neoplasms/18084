zzso zzso has been zzso and evaluated as a potential zzso for tumor zzso The compound was zzso by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso and was characterized on the basis of zzso nuclear magnetic zzso and mass zzso zzso compound was found stable for about 24 hour under zzso conditions with a more than zzso zzso zzso A blood kinetic study of this complex showed a zzso pattern as well as quick zzso from the blood zzso The zzso zzso and zzso was found to be 45 zzso zzso minutes and zzso hours zzso zzso minutes, zzso Imaging and zzso studies were performed in mice bearing zzso zzso tumor zzso tumors in the right zzso The EAT tumors in the mice were readily visible in the zzso and showed major zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso studies revealed a high zzso at the tumor zzso zzso ratios were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso at 1 and 4 hours, zzso The zzso binding of the zzso by an established human tumor cell line zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso The preliminary studies of the zzso are encouraging to carrying out further in zzso experiments for targeted tumor zzso
