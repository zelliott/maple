zzso of pain is common among ambulatory patients with advanced zzso Available pain assessment tools are complex and not easy to use in ambulatory care zzso 

The authors developed and assessed the zzso and zzso properties of a simple, brief zzso pain diary for ambulatory care assessing 3 zzso current pain intensity on rising and zzso number of daily rescue doses, and weekly impact of pain on quality of zzso zzso European Organization for Research and Treatment zzso Quality of Life zzso zzso were administered once zzso for validation zzso zzso were 98 adult zzso ambulatory patients with advanced zzso who were on zzso free of apparent cognitive zzso and recruited through 2 zzso clinics in Quebec City, zzso zzso 

In the first 3 weeks, zzso or zzso of patients completed all requested diary zzso Internal zzso of the zzso scale assessing pain impact on quality of life were zzso over the study zzso zzso intensity predicted both increased use of rescue doses and negative pain impact on quality of zzso This latter scale was also responsive to decreases in pain intensity over zzso zzso As hypothesized, pain intensity, rescue doses, and pain impact on quality of life correlated with zzso scale zzso zzso intensity correlated most strongly with the zzso pain and global quality of life scales zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

This diary is simple, very brief, acceptable to patients, and appears to be zzso It can thus likely be used to monitor pain management for advanced cancer zzso
