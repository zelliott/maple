The patient population consists of zzso veterans with complaints of zzso who were evaluated by zzso swallowing studies at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, East Orange, NJ, between November 1988 and March zzso 

zzso dysfunction was diagnosed zzso as the appearance of a shelf in the zzso column of zzso at the level of the zzso zzso It was identified in 10 of 177 zzso patients with neurological disorders, in 7 of 142 zzso patients with head and neck or zzso tumors, and in 11 of 124 zzso patients with other medical zzso
