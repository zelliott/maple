The zzso of zzso in different cell types within tumors has not been well zzso and its role in tumor growth is zzso In this study, zzso expression and its contribution to tumor growth are evaluated using genetic zzso and adoptive transfer in genetically deficient zzso zzso was detected in tumors in zzso at levels up to zzso higher than those in cell culture and predominantly in host zzso zzso but not in tumor zzso zzso transfer into genetically deficient mice revealed that host zzso function did not alter tumor growth, demonstrating that zzso alone does not affect tumor zzso
