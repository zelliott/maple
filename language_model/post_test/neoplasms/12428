zzso of gene structure or expression are commonly found in zzso where they are used as zzso zzso predicting the likely severity of disease or chances of response to zzso An odds ratio zzso of zzso indicates that a zzso presence is correlated with better zzso An OR of zzso is also often taken to mean that the gene concerned has a protective effect in the mechanism of zzso I show that this is not necessarily zzso Modeling of the genes involved in the causation of cancer as a network of weak, zzso elements shows that zzso genes zzso genes whose zzso is zzso in driving zzso can nevertheless appear as zzso markers in later stage zzso This implies that results suggesting that well-known zzso have an OR of zzso are quite zzso and that predicting a zzso role from an apparently protective zzso value is not zzso I identify zzso and zzso as candidates for genes with an apparently protective role through this zzso
