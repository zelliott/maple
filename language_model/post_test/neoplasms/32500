zzso the zzso cells that line tumor zzso blood vessels is a new zzso strategy that has gained widespread support from biologists and zzso Here we highlight different approaches currently being used to target tumor zzso and discuss new avenues for intervention that have been opened through the recent identification of tumor zzso markers zzso 

The ability of zzso to prolong survival in a Phase III clinical trial of human zzso cancer has established the zzso of the zzso zzso However, realization of the full potential of a vascular targeting strategy may require the exploitation of molecules which are highly restricted in expression to tumor zzso Here we explore the potential of zzso as new targets for cancer zzso Current knowledge of these markers and their relation to other family members in the context of tumor zzso is zzso In particular, we highlight those molecules which, by virtue of their structure, zzso location and expression pattern, appear to hold promise as targets for future drug zzso The identification of zzso as the anthrax toxin zzso and the successful targeting of this zzso in zzso tumor models make this zzso a particularly attractive candidate for future vascular targeting zzso 

zzso advances in cellular zzso and zzso enabled the identification of several markers zzso expressed on human tumor zzso Studies of these zzso are expected to aid in our understanding of zzso and could lead to the development of new imaging and diagnostic agents for zzso
