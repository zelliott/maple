Patients with advanced cancer frequently experience clinically significant zzso which is often exacerbated by zzso zzso zzso with the anemia of chronic disease, studies have documented serum zzso levels that are inappropriately low for the degree of anemia in cancer zzso zzso chemotherapy zzso zzso which may not fully recover between treatment zzso zzso human zzso zzso has been used safely and effectively to treat anemia in AIDS patients receiving zzso zzso and in patients with chronic zzso zzso 

This study was designed to evaluate the clinical role of zzso in reducing symptomatic anemia in patients with advanced cancer who were receiving zzso chemotherapy zzso zzso 

We studied 153 anemic cancer patients receiving zzso combination chemotherapy in a prospective zzso zzso zzso zzso The patients were randomly assigned to receive either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso three times a week for a maximum of 12 weeks or until the zzso level increased to zzso If the zzso reached this target level before 12 weeks, the zzso dose could be reduced to maintain the zzso at that level for the duration of the zzso Response to zzso therapy was assessed by measuring changes in zzso level, zzso requirements, and quality of zzso zzso assessment was based on patients' responses to questionnaires before and after the courses of zzso 

The increase in zzso in the zzso group compared with zzso in the zzso group was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso as measured by percentage point of change from baseline to final zzso by an increase in zzso level of six percentage points or more unrelated to zzso and by a rise in zzso level to 38% or more unrelated to zzso There was a trend toward the reduction in mean units of blood zzso per patient during months 2 and 3 of therapy combined in zzso patients compared with zzso patients zzso U versus zzso zzso P zzso zzso In addition, zzso patients experienced a statistically significant improvement in energy level and ability to perform daily activities zzso zzso or zzso zzso The two treatment groups showed no statistically significant differences in toxic effects except for increased zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso is safe and effective for reversing anemia related to advanced cancer or to chemotherapy for zzso
