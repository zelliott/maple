zzso zzso zzso consists of an increase of the temperature of magnetic zzso zzso zzso due to the interaction of their magnetic moments with an alternating magnetic zzso In zzso experiments using this method usually use a few zzso zzso inserted in the animal body to monitor the heat zzso As a consequence, only a few points of the zzso temperature distribution can be monitored by this invasive zzso It is the purpose of this work to show that zzso infrared zzso is able to zzso in real time, magnetic zzso zzso as well as monitor the harmful zzso zzso currents in a zzso model with a subcutaneous zzso This surface temperature measurement method has the potential to give information about the zzso zzso 

The zzso magnetic zzso experiments were performed at zzso in zzso field zzso conditions in healthy mice and zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso A soft zzso zzso magnetic zzso consisting of zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid were used in the experiments, which were extensively zzso by several techniques zzso electron zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso vibrating sample zzso zzso The zzso of the alternating magnetic fields was obtained from zzso using an zzso field probe at similar experimental zzso The temperature zzso were obtained from an infrared zzso camera and a zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic zzso experiments revealed surface temperature increase as high as zzso in healthy and zzso in zzso zzso animals when injecting zzso zzso of magnetic zzso zzso of magnetic zzso in contrast to around zzso (for zzso and zzso (for zzso animals in experiments without the zzso due to zzso zzso currents at the animal zzso The zzso temperature zzso were found to agree with the zzso zzso within a zzso error, and were associated with the skin zzso angle of dependence in the experimental zzso On the other hand, a zzso magnetic zzso zzso revealed surface temperature increases as high as zzso close to the injection site, while above zzso no significant temperature increase was zzso zzso the zzso temperature, monitored by a zzso zzso was found to be almost the same as the zzso camera surface temperature after achieving an equilibrium temperature zzso From the observed zzso at the animal surface, using an zzso heat zzso model, taking into account surface zzso we estimate a magnetic heating power of zzso and a specific loss power zzso of zzso for a field of the order of only zzso at the injection site zzso 

The results indicate that infrared zzso may be a promising tool for both early cancer detection and for zzso treatment (at least for subcutaneous zzso since the method permits access to information about the zzso temperature during a real-time magnetic zzso as well as to estimate the in zzso zzso zzso
