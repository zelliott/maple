Both zzso and zzso regulate zzso but these proteins play different roles in this zzso To clarify the difference, we performed a zzso 2 hybrid zzso screen using the zzso zzso domain as zzso zzso was found to specifically bind to zzso but not zzso in zzso and in zzso Further investigation revealed that zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso is essential for its interaction with zzso and for zzso zzso zzso was zzso faster by a zzso zzso when zzso was zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso and degradation of zzso and contributed to zzso zzso in cancer zzso zzso of zzso in cancer cells inhibited activity of the zzso pathway, enhanced the activity of the zzso pathway, and promoted cancer cell growth in zzso and in zzso This function was zzso dependent, and either human zzso zzso E6 protein or zzso against zzso was able to block the contribution caused by zzso zzso In this study, we discovered a new zzso interacting zzso zzso and provided evidence to support its zzso tumor zzso zzso
