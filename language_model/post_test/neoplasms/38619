A zzso producing zzso zzso zzso directed to zzso zzso has been established from zzso cells of a mouse zzso with zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso M zzso was selected from five clones showing different zzso with zzso The zzso zzso was highly specific to zzso and lacked zzso with other zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso was found to bind to zzso zzso at their zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso A zzso sandwich zzso method for zzso zzso in serum was established by using the zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso concentration in the zzso from 20 normal individuals was zzso zzso If the zzso value was set at zzso zzso zzso + 2 zzso zzso zzso only 1 of 20 healthy controls had an elevated zzso value in the serum, whereas zzso from 9 of 12 zzso zzso 4 of 10 zzso pancreatic cancer, 16 of 40 zzso stomach cancer, and 6 of 10 zzso lung cancer patients had elevated zzso zzso zzso from 3 of 8 zzso patients and 7 of 10 liver zzso patients were estimated to be positive but zzso from 16 patients with benign disease had zzso levels lower than the zzso zzso A larger amount of the zzso was found in liver zzso from zzso zzso compared to the normal zzso The zzso was also detected in the medium of various human cancer cells and zzso However, the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and cancer tissue seemed to be associated with zzso or zzso because most of the zzso activity was zzso in the void volume fraction on zzso liquid zzso with a gel zzso zzso
