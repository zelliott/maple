Patients with zzso zzso have reduced and later access to zzso care services zzso than do those with solid zzso It is unclear whether these patients develop a high symptom burden at the end of life that requires special zzso care zzso The purposes of this retrospective study were to determine whether symptoms are less severe in patients with zzso than in those with solid zzso on zzso and whether symptom severity is associated with early zzso 

We studied the records of consecutive patients with zzso and solid zzso at their first zzso care consultation zzso We collected information about zzso cancer type, date of zzso and the zzso from zzso to death zzso We reviewed the charts for the Edmonton zzso Assessment System zzso and presence of zzso 

We included 250 patients zzso with each type of zzso Median pain and zzso were 4 zzso and 7 zzso among zzso compared to 5 zzso zzso and 5 zzso zzso among patients with solid zzso zzso zzso was detected in 51 of 125 zzso zzso versus 20 of 125 zzso solid zzso Median zzso was 13 days for zzso versus 46 days for solid zzso There was no correlation between zzso and pain zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso 

Hematologic patients had increased zzso and zzso and later zzso The overall symptom severity was similar in both groups of patients and did not correlate with early zzso Future prospective studies are needed to better define zzso patterns in this zzso
