zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to avidly interact with proteins involved in blood zzso and complement zzso zzso with zzso were therefore used to assess the shielding properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with various zzso chain lengths on zzso containing zzso zzso The zzso of zzso from zzso containing zzso was studied using an in zzso zzso which involved the transfer of zzso into zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso containing zzso was monitored by zzso interactions with blood zzso zzso The percent zzso of zzso activity of zzso zzso was dependent on the zzso zzso zzso zzso which transferred out slowly from zzso zzso was able to abolish zzso of zzso activity of zzso zzso at 15 zzso This level of zzso was also able to extend the mean residence time of zzso zzso from zzso h to 14 zzso However, zzso with shorter zzso chains such as zzso were rapidly transferred out from zzso zzso which resulted in a zzso decrease in zzso activity zzso and zzso of administered zzso zzso were removed from the blood within 15 zzso after zzso Thus, zzso zzso the zzso of zzso from zzso containing zzso thereby providing additional control of zzso release rates from membrane zzso These results suggest that membrane zzso can be selectively regulated by surface grafted zzso coupled to zzso of an appropriate zzso chain zzso
