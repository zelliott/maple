To evaluate zzso zzso statistic and the input variable squared prediction error zzso for detecting large respiratory zzso tumor displacement prediction errors without directly measuring the zzso zzso 

zzso and external marker positions from a database of 188 zzso zzso zzso liver, and zzso treatment zzso were zzso The first ten zzso of tumor position in each fraction were used to create zzso models of tumor displacement using external surrogates as zzso the models were used to predict tumor position from subsequent external marker zzso A partial least squares zzso model with four scores was developed for each fraction to determine zzso and zzso confidence limits based on the first ten zzso in a zzso The zzso and zzso statistics were then calculated for every set of external marker zzso zzso between model error and both zzso and zzso were zzso zzso operating characteristic analysis was applied to evaluate sensitivities and zzso of zzso and zzso for predicting real-time tumor zzso errors zzso zzso over a range of zzso and zzso confidence zzso 

zzso and specificity of detecting errors zzso zzso varied with confidence limit zzso At zzso sensitivity, zzso specificity was zzso zzso higher than either zzso or zzso zzso The mean time to alarm for zzso at zzso sensitivity was zzso zzso but varied with a standard zzso of zzso zzso zzso did not differ significantly by tumor zzso 

The results of this study establish the feasibility of respiratory zzso online monitoring of real-time zzso tumor motion model accuracy for zzso liver, and zzso zzso The zzso and zzso statistics were able to indicate whether zzso model errors exceeded 3 zzso with high zzso zzso improvements in specificity were achieved by combining zzso and zzso zzso
