Both experimental and zzso studies suggest that patients with zzso and other chronic inflammatory diseases are more prone to develop zzso The aim of the present investigation is to find some typical differences between the content of zzso zzso acid zzso and the activity of zzso zzso zzso in zzso from children with zzso diseases and juvenile chronic arthritis zzso Our results show zzso lower zzso activity in the zzso from children with cancer compared with the zzso from children with zzso zzso levels zzso and zzso higher than in children with zzso were observed in the zzso from children with blood and solid zzso zzso The relation zzso is about fivefold higher in children with zzso A negative correlation zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso exists between zzso and zzso in zzso from children with zzso No such correlation was established in the group of children with zzso We suppose that such differentiation disappears in the beginning of zzso process during prolonged therapy of zzso zzso From our findings zzso and zzso appear to be putative markers of zzso disease with potential usefulness not only in zzso but also in other conditions associated with an increased risk of zzso zzso
