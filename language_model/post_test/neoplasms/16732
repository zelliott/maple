A simple, sensitive, and specific zzso method for zzso and zzso activities has been established by means of an zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso directed to zzso zzso zzso activity was determined by zzso the amount of reaction product, zzso with the zzso zzso For the zzso of zzso activity, zzso zzso immobilized on a zzso zzso plate was incubated with bovine milk zzso in zzso buffer zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso incubation conditions for the zzso were zzso zzso activity was also zzso by the zzso method by using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso and the zzso zzso towards the zzso were zzso By this method, zzso zzso of reaction product could be zzso The zzso method has several advantages as zzso 1, the method is zzso 2, separation of the reaction product is not zzso 3, zzso and identification of the reaction product were done zzso 4, naturally occurring zzso are available (especially for zzso 5, many samples can be zzso in one zzso 6, sensitivity is very zzso The present method was applied for the detection of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso of the zzso levels were observed in the zzso from cancer zzso The formation of zzso was confirmed by employing the zzso method for bands of zzso after incubation of the bands with serum and zzso on an zzso zzso
