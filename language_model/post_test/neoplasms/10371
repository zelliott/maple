zzso is a complex process that relies on a variety of growth factors and signaling pathways to stimulate zzso cell responses and establish functional blood zzso Signaling through the vascular zzso growth factor zzso receptors is an important zzso of zzso a hallmark of tumor growth and zzso zzso of signaling through zzso has been clinically validated with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Our goal was to discover an orally available, selective zzso zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso was identified as a potent and selective inhibitor of zzso While zzso shares some structure features with zzso unlike zzso it lacks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso and closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Kit zzso zzso it has no significant activity zzso zzso against zzso and zzso At zzso levels, it zzso zzso zzso of zzso in a whole cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso oral dosing of zzso to nude mice bearing human zzso zzso and zzso tumors resulted in up to zzso tumor growth zzso zzso after termination of zzso zzso of zzso zzso tumor growth delay was significantly prolonged up to 4 zzso zzso efficacy correlated well with the observed dose zzso (on a zzso zzso necessary to inhibit zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, the compound inhibited spontaneous zzso formation in the zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is a well zzso orally available, highly selective zzso inhibitor that may have therapeutic benefit in human zzso
