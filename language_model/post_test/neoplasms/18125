All cells possess zzso zzso zzso zzso across the plasma zzso These zzso zzso arise from the combined activity of numerous zzso channels, pumps and gap junction zzso zzso data from molecular physiology now reveal that the role of changes in membrane zzso controls, and is in turn controlled by, progression through the cell zzso We review recent functional data on the regulation of zzso by zzso signals, and the function of membrane zzso and specific zzso sodium and zzso zzso channels in the proliferation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Its unique properties place this powerful, zzso but still zzso signaling system at the center of the coordinated cellular interactions required for complex pattern zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso channel expression and function is increasingly observed to be not only a useful marker but likely a functional element in zzso New advances in zzso and the development of in zzso zzso techniques suggest exciting opportunities for molecular medicine, zzso and zzso approaches to human zzso
