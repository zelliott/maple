The mortality of patients with solid tumors is mostly due to zzso that relies on the interplay between migration and zzso The zzso or zzso hypothesis zzso that migration and proliferation zzso excludes each zzso We evaluated this hypothesis on 35 cell lines (12 zzso 13 melanoma and 10 lung zzso on both the individual cell and population zzso Following zzso zzso migration, proliferation and zzso were zzso We found a significantly higher migration in zzso cells compared to melanoma and lung cancer while tumor types did not differ in mean proliferation or duration of zzso zzso we found in melanoma and lung cancer a significant positive correlation between mean proliferation and zzso Furthermore, zzso melanoma and lung cancer cells displayed slower zzso In contrast, in zzso there were no such zzso Interestingly, negative correlation was found between zzso and migration in zzso zzso zzso was higher in melanoma cells with high zzso We demonstrate that the cancer cells studied do not defer proliferation for zzso Of note, tumor cells from various organ systems may differently regulate migration and zzso Furthermore, our data is in line with the observation of zzso that highly zzso tumors are often highly zzso
