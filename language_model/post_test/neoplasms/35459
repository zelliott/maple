zzso zzso is the first and inevitable stage of formation of a zzso zzso This stage is also the core of many other zzso zzso The present work proposes the first minimal model that combines zzso with zzso zzso where the latter is regarded as a zzso activated zzso zzso This dysfunction is specified as the transitions of the fluid of cells from a fluid, zzso state to a solid, zzso state, and zzso The key part of the model is a zzso zzso equation zzso where the zzso rate is generalized to the one in the well-known zzso physical theory of the zzso phase zzso A rigorous analysis of the stability and qualitative aspects of the model, where possible, are presented in zzso This is related to the zzso homogeneous case, zzso when the above zzso is reduced to a zzso ordinary differential zzso The mentioned zzso zzso is treated as a prevention of the zzso zzso of the cell cycle implemented with the threshold mechanism that employs the critical concentration of the cellular fluid and the zzso zzso The continuous tumor zzso is described by a zzso zzso zzso There are no sharp boundaries zzso no concentration jumps zzso between the zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso No presumption on the shape of a tumor is zzso To estimate a tumor in specific zzso the model provides the zzso tumor zzso volume, and boundary that also points out the tumor shape and zzso The above features are indispensable in the quantitative development of zzso drugs or therapies and strategies to prevent zzso zzso in cancer and other zzso zzso The work proposes an zzso method for solving the aforementioned zzso A few topics for future research are zzso
