The development of zzso resistance zzso to chemotherapy remains a major challenge in the treatment of zzso Resistance exists against every effective zzso drug and can develop by multiple zzso These mechanisms can act individually or zzso leading to zzso in which the cell becomes resistant to a variety of structurally and mechanistically unrelated drugs in addition to the drug initially zzso Although extensive work has been done to characterize zzso mechanisms in zzso the translation of this knowledge to the clinic has not been zzso zzso identifying genes and mechanisms critical to the development of zzso in zzso and establishing a reliable method for analyzing highly zzso genes from small amounts of tissue is fundamental to achieving any significant enhancement in our understanding of zzso mechanisms and could lead to treatments designed to circumvent zzso In this study, we use a previously established database that allows the identification of lead compounds in the early stages of drug discovery that are not zzso cassette (ABC) zzso zzso We believe this can serve as a model for zzso the accuracy and sensitivity of current methods used to analyze the expression profiles of ABC zzso We found two platforms to be superior methods for the analysis of expression profiles of highly zzso gene zzso This study also led to an improved database by revealing previously unidentified zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso that contribute to zzso
