Success of selective drug therapies depends on the drug's depot time in the target to zzso Depot time is currently being zzso using zzso beads or zzso for selective internal radiation zzso The purpose of this study was to establish a model for investigating the depot time of particles injected into tumors in relation to tumor zzso and particle zzso 

An animal model with two different zzso tumors zzso Carcinoma 256 zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso The tumors were implanted into the hind leg of zzso zzso When the tumors reached zzso zzso zzso particles of zzso and zzso were zzso injected into the zzso large particles zzso zzso in 10 zzso and 10 zzso tumors and small particles zzso zzso zzso in 4 zzso and 16 zzso tumors with the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso into 8 zzso zzso zzso activity was measured with a gamma camera at 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, activity in the zzso liver, zzso zzso and zzso zzso was measured at 48 h zzso zzso were adjusted for zzso times and then zzso 

zzso of the injected particles is zzso characterized by a fast zzso At 10 zzso zzso zzso activity decreases to zzso of the initially injected zzso This is followed by a slow decline at 48 h zzso in which zzso activity decreases to at least zzso of the initially injected zzso Slow decline is independent of particle size and zzso whereas fast leakage depends on zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the zzso of the small zzso zzso zzso accumulated mainly in the zzso smaller zzso in the zzso 

zzso stay time, zzso and stability can be easily monitored as shown in this animal zzso The zzso zzso can be reduced, using larger particles and zzso zzso retention is independent of zzso and particle size and appears to be sufficient for zzso
