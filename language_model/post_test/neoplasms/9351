We performed error analysis of tumor blood flow zzso measurement using dynamic zzso data and zzso zzso analysis, based on computer zzso For analysis, we generated a zzso concentration of the contrast agent in the volume of interest zzso from the zzso input function zzso consisting of zzso functions using an zzso approximation to the tissue zzso model under various plasma flow zzso mean zzso transit time zzso zzso area product zzso and zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso analyses based on truncated singular value decomposition with a fixed threshold value zzso with an zzso threshold value zzso and with the threshold value determined by generalized cross validation zzso were used to estimate zzso values from the simulated zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso First, we investigated the relationship between the optimal threshold value and zzso in zzso and then derived the equation describing the relationship between the threshold value and zzso for zzso Second, we investigated the zzso of the estimated zzso values on zzso zzso the total duration for data acquisition and the shape of zzso Although zzso with a threshold value of zzso zzso with the threshold value determined by the equation derived in this study and zzso could estimate the zzso values in a similar manner, the standard zzso of the estimates was the smallest and largest for zzso and zzso zzso zzso did not largely affect the estimates, while zzso did in all zzso zzso the total duration significantly improved the variations in the estimates in all zzso zzso was most sensitive to the shape of zzso especially when the total duration was zzso In conclusion, this study will be useful for understanding the reliability and limitation of zzso zzso analysis when applied to zzso measurement using an zzso contrast zzso
