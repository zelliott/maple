The zzso zzso gene product is a tumor zzso that is zzso or zzso in many types of human zzso Although zzso is known to be an upstream negative regulator of zzso protein zzso zzso we propose here that zzso also functions as a downstream zzso of zzso that plays a positive role in survival of zzso human tumor cells, including zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso We show that zzso is zzso zzso at zzso in zzso tumor cells, and that zzso zzso zzso specifically at zzso within the zzso domain of the zzso We also show that zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso tumor cells by zzso the zzso zzso zzso activity, and that zzso zzso is compromised by zzso zzso of zzso at zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso interference induced zzso in zzso tumor zzso Thus, our findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso of zzso is necessary for survival of zzso human tumor cells, and raises the possibility that this zzso zzso can be a molecular target for cancer therapy aimed at inducing zzso of zzso tumor cells, such as zzso zzso
