Stress is a term that has become synonymous with modern zzso This review aims to appraise the evidence linking stress with disease with particular reference to the major causes of morbidity and mortality in the Western World, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and zzso Changes in immune parameters in stressful situations were reviewed as a possible zzso mechanism for such zzso
