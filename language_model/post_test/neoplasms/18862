zzso ratings, if zzso may provide an alternative approach to evaluating patient quality of life zzso at the end of zzso 

To examine agreement between terminally ill cancer patients' zzso zzso and proxy assessment of patient zzso by their family caregiver zzso and zzso care physicians zzso at two time zzso 

Patients admitted to an acute zzso care unit and their zzso and zzso completed the McGill Quality of Life zzso zzso at Days 3 and 6 after zzso Response bias and response precision were examined at the individual and group zzso Furthermore, we examined patient factors affecting agreement and responsiveness of proxy zzso scores to changes in patients' zzso between Days 3 and zzso 

zzso and clinically significant mean differences were detected between the patient and both proxy groups' reports of zzso on Day 3, with the magnitude of the differences decreasing somewhat by Day zzso zzso underestimated patients' zzso compared with patients' zzso Response precision based on zzso correlation values and proportion of approximate agreement was poor to fair at both time zzso zzso was better for patients with greater physical burden and more cognitive zzso zzso responsiveness to change from Day 3 to Day 6 was low, and proxies were not able to detect minimally important changes in zzso 

The findings suggest that moderate agreement between patient and proxy ratings of zzso develops over time but that precision at the individual level, which is more clinically relevant, is less zzso New strategies for improving proxy reliability are zzso
