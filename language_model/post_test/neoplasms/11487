The development and progression of tumor cells is controlled by their interactions with neighboring host cells and a variety of zzso factors including zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factors and zzso zzso zzso proteins are a prerequisite for growth and migration of many types of zzso Their interactions with zzso and other cell surface receptors induce zzso signaling that regulates the zzso zzso and gene zzso The basement membrane protein zzso is a notable cell zzso zzso which promotes cellular zzso and migration much more efficiently than other zzso zzso There is accumulating evidence that zzso is involved in tumor growth and zzso With special reference to zzso this article reviews the regulatory mechanisms of cellular zzso and migration by zzso molecules and their significance in tumor zzso
