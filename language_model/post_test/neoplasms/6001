zzso resistance zzso is responsible for a decrease in sensitivity of tumor cells tumor cells to zzso naturally occurring zzso zzso This resistance is correlated with expression and activity of a membrane zzso zzso zzso functioning as a zzso zzso It has been well described in in zzso zzso however, the clinical detection and implications are not yet zzso Multiple detection zzso have been developed based on the discovery of the zzso gene family and the corresponding zzso Southern, zzso or Western zzso analysis, zzso zzso protection or zzso zzso zzso detection or functionality tests by flow zzso have been used zzso However, by use of these techniques on clinical material, both normal and zzso contradictory results have zzso The sensitivity and specificity of a certain technique are always limited by unavoidable zzso for example, skill of the zzso Moreover, the complexity of the development of resistance against zzso agents zzso zzso such as the diversity of tumor zzso the simultaneous presence of other resistance mechanisms, and the low expression level, make zzso detection zzso and can lead to contradictory zzso Previous treatment influencing the zzso profile and inappropriate timing of the test make a possible correlation between zzso expression and zzso resistance difficult to establish and can lead to zzso zzso In this review, the need for proper criteria is zzso No single detection technique provides the ideal test to detect zzso zzso testing could give more zzso although small sample size limit this zzso zzso of a standard zzso with better definition of a zzso is essential before clinical trials are zzso
