zzso is a complement regulatory protein known to prevent the membrane attack complex zzso from zzso To investigate the role of zzso molecules in human T cell zzso in response to zzso zzso gene zzso via small interfering zzso zzso was carried zzso zzso T cell zzso in response to both zzso zzso cells zzso loaded with tumor zzso and beads coated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The findings demonstrated that decreased zzso expression on T cells significantly enhanced zzso and proliferation of zzso T cells and zzso T cells while the expansion of zzso zzso regulatory T cells zzso was not affected, and zzso zzso zzso of T cell zzso requires the binding of zzso with its zzso on zzso cells zzso The data support that zzso zzso zzso zzso of human T zzso in a zzso zzso
