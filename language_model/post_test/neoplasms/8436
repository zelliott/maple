There are three active zzso genes in man and at least two in zzso and zzso The zzso zzso and zzso genes have 16 coding zzso which span 40 and 20 zzso zzso zzso is larger and extends over greater than 46 zzso Human zzso maps to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso is present in many zzso while zzso and zzso expression is zzso A- and zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso of 68 and 74 zzso which contain three zzso regions zzso zzso and 2 are in the zzso terminal half, zzso comprises the presumed zzso binding site, and zzso represents the zzso terminal zzso zzso All three genes can be artificially activated by zzso provided zzso is zzso However, only zzso occurs naturally in truncated versions, such as zzso and zzso in the acutely transforming zzso zzso and zzso zzso transformation can also be affected by point zzso suggesting that this mechanism may activate zzso as an zzso in zzso
