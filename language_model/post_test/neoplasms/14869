zzso active zzso therapy has led to a dramatic improvement in the prognosis of patients diagnosed with zzso and zzso This includes a significant decline in the rates of AIDS-related zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso Unfortunately, rates of zzso zzso are on the rise, and now exceed the rates of AIDS-related zzso in patients with zzso Treating zzso zzso in patients who are on highly active zzso therapy is an open and complicated clinical zzso 

Newer targeted therapies are now available to treat zzso which were historically zzso to traditional zzso zzso zzso active zzso therapy agents are notorious for causing zzso zzso The zzso of targeted zzso with highly active zzso therapy could well impede the efficacy or increase the toxicity of these targeted zzso Unfortunately little is known about possible zzso interactions because zzso patients are typically excluded from clinical zzso 

We highlight what is known about how and why highly active zzso therapy agents can affect drug zzso We then present the clinical and pharmacological data for nine recently approved targeted therapies - zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We conclude with considerations on how to use these new agents to treat zzso zzso and discuss a future research agenda to better understand and predict potential highly active zzso zzso therapy zzso
