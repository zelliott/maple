Studies of global protein expression in human tumors have led to the identification of various zzso zzso potentially useful as diagnostic zzso Many changes in gene expression recorded between benign and zzso human tumors are due to zzso zzso not detected by analyses of zzso zzso analyses have also yielded information about tumor zzso and the degree of zzso between primary tumors and their zzso zzso from our own studies have shown a similar pattern of changes in protein expression in different zzso tumors, such as decreases in zzso and zzso expression and increases in zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso and heat shock protein zzso Such information has been used to create artificial learning models for tumor zzso The artificial learning approach has potential to improve tumor diagnosis and cancer treatment zzso
