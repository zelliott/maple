BACKGROUND IN zzso zzso increases the risk of certain zzso known, or thought, to have an underlying infectious zzso the impact on the risk of cancer in children is less zzso 

Here, we report results of an zzso study at four pediatric zzso centers in South Africa in which children diagnosed with cancer are tested routinely for zzso zzso ratios zzso for the prevalence of various zzso were calculated (with adjustment for age, sex, and zzso for the children infected with zzso using all children with cancer and zzso conditions, but not infected with zzso as a comparison zzso 

Of zzso children with cancer, 38 were zzso infected (for 12 the zzso status was zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso (all 10 cases were zzso zzso P zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso infected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No other cancer type was significantly associated with zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Only zzso zzso and zzso zzso were significantly associated with zzso infection although results for zzso NHL were zzso zzso we did not identify an association between infection with zzso and zzso zzso for which an underlying infectious zzso has been zzso
