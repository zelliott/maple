zzso zzso studies based on a given number of cases and k times as many controls are zzso We obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for there to exist a zzso solution for k with a desired level of a zzso We derive the maximum power of the zzso test, which may be less than one, when the number of cases is zzso We provide an approximate formula for the minimum number of cases required for a specified zzso There exists a zzso solution zzso is, convergence of an zzso zzso for k if the number of cases given is greater than this minimum number and no such a solution zzso We also show that the incremental gain in relative efficiency of the test with respect to k is diminished as k gets zzso
