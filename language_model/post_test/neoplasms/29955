Human zzso cells contain, zzso filaments formed by zzso related to zzso zzso zzso which are expressed in different combinations in different zzso Using zzso proteins from human zzso and zzso we have zzso by two-dimensional gel zzso and zzso experiments, the zzso zzso patterns of diverse primary and zzso zzso and have compared them with those of corresponding normal zzso zzso and cultured zzso Five groups of zzso zzso patterns can be zzso zzso zzso typical of simple zzso zzso zzso 7, 8, 18, zzso are zzso in various combinations, by many zzso for example those of gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso typical of zzso zzso zzso 1, 5, 6, 10, 11, zzso are found, in various combinations, in zzso cell zzso of skin and zzso zzso Complex patterns showing zzso zzso 7, 8, 18, 19, and one basic component zzso 5 or 6) are detected in certain zzso of the respiratory tract and the zzso zzso Complex patterns containing zzso widespread in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as components zzso 8 and 19 occur in diverse zzso cell zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso with or without additional small amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of unusually high complexity can be found in some rare tumors as is shown for a zzso zzso No significant qualitative changes of expression of zzso were found when primary tumors and zzso were zzso When compared with zzso patterns of normal zzso zzso of the first type usually display a high degree of zzso to the tissue of zzso Other zzso do not express some of the zzso present in the tissue of their origin and, vice versa, certain components which are minor or apparently absent in normal tissue are major zzso in the corresponding zzso These differences may be explained by cell type selection during zzso but changes of expression during tumor development cannot be zzso zzso The possibility of cell type zzso within a given tumor is also zzso zzso complex patterns of zzso zzso have been noted in certain cultured human zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso Detroit zzso zzso and can also be observed in cell zzso The possible value of analyses of zzso patterns, by gel zzso or specific zzso zzso in distinguishing different zzso by zzso criteria is zzso
