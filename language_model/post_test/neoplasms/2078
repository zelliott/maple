Based on the zzso of sequential zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso and the superior zzso activity of zzso zzso compared with zzso in zzso models, we carried out a phase I trial of zzso and zzso zzso dose, 400 zzso per zzso both given as zzso zzso infusions daily zzso 5 days, every 28 zzso The zzso dose was escalated from zzso to zzso zzso per zzso In all, 92 zzso courses were given to 34 patients, half of whom were heavily zzso with radiation or zzso zzso and zzso were the zzso zzso but were not different in heavily or minimally zzso zzso there were five episodes of moderate to severe zzso zzso fatigue, and zzso were mild zzso Plasma zzso elimination was zzso with a mean zzso alpha of zzso h and a zzso beta of zzso zzso The area under the plasma zzso concentration versus time curve increased zzso with dose, suggesting zzso zzso Total plasma zzso clearance zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso Renal clearance accounted for approximately zzso of total zzso indicating zzso as the major route of zzso zzso was highly zzso zzso Thus, zzso can be given with zzso zzso zzso on a daily zzso zzso zzso schedule at the 12 zzso per day dose level, which was the recommended dose of zzso as a single agent for phase II studies using the zzso zzso zzso
