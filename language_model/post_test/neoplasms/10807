zzso drug delivery system zzso is one of the most concerned research fields in cancer treatment because it can bind selectively and react with the target diseased sites at the cellular or zzso level, making distribution and release of drugs in a controlled manner, thus enhance therapeutic effects and reduce toxic and zzso on normal zzso zzso zzso zzso is a kind of newly developed zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso three-dimensional structure and zzso zzso ability make it used as drug carrier, gene delivery system and imaging zzso Various targeting zzso which have high affinity to specific zzso zzso or cells in human body, can be linked to surface functional groups of zzso And drugs and theoretical gene are carried by zzso or chemical zzso Finally, zzso targeting drug delivery system can carry drugs and theoretical gene to diseased sites and then release them for targeted zzso The zzso zzso have small size, zzso zzso and retention effect zzso low toxicity and so zzso The research progress of zzso modified by different zzso in targeting drug delivery system is zzso and research direction of the zzso targeting delivery system in the future is also zzso
