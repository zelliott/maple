For application in zzso intensity modulated zzso electron and zzso beams were mixed to create dose zzso that zzso zzso a steep dose zzso at larger zzso similar to pure electron beams, zzso flat beam profiles and sharp and zzso beam zzso as in zzso beams, and zzso a zzso skin dose that is lower than for pure electron zzso To determine the required electron and zzso beam zzso profiles, an inverse treatment planning zzso was zzso Mixed beams were realized at a zzso racetrack zzso zzso Medical zzso zzso and evaluated by the dose zzso measured in a water zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso was used in a zzso mode to shape overlapping electron beam zzso and the dynamic zzso zzso mode was used to realize the intensity modulated zzso beam zzso Examples of mixed beams were generated at electron energies of up to 40 zzso The intensity modulated electron beam component consists of two overlapping concentric fields with zzso field sizes, yielding zzso fairly zzso overall beam zzso The matched intensity modulated zzso beam component has high zzso zzso at the field edges to sharpen this zzso The combination of the electron and the zzso beams yields dose zzso with the characteristics zzso mentioned zzso
