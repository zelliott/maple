zzso DNA zzso break zzso repair can be tested by using zzso gel zzso zzso in zzso zzso However, previous studies have reported that this zzso is impaired by the spontaneous DNA breakage in this zzso We investigated the mechanisms of this fragmentation with the principal aim of eliminating it in order to improve the zzso of zzso DNA zzso 

zzso from cancer cell cultures or zzso zzso were zzso in zzso zzso The cell plugs were then zzso incubated to allow them to repair, and evaluated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso was evaluated through chemical zzso zzso 

We confirmed that spontaneous DNA fragmentation was associated with the process of zzso regardless of whether cells were zzso or zzso This DNA fragmentation was also correlated to zzso zzso in a fraction of the cells zzso in zzso while zzso cell fraction could rejoin DNA fragments as was measured by zzso decrease and zzso zzso We were able to eliminate interference of zzso by applying specific zzso zzso and improve the zzso of DNA repair, and zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso DNA repair by zzso may be improved by the use of zzso zzso The ability to simultaneously determine DNA repair and zzso which are involved in cell fate, provides new insights for using the zzso methodology as functional zzso
