Between 1978 and 1983, zzso patients with zzso acute zzso zzso zzso were entered into the Medical Research Council zzso 8th zzso zzso All received the same induction therapy consisting of zzso zzso and zzso (1 + zzso The zzso who entered complete zzso were zzso to consolidation with two or six further courses of zzso Adults under the age of 55 were zzso for central nervous system zzso prophylaxis with zzso zzso and zzso Finally, those still in zzso after 1 year of zzso and zzso zzso maintenance were zzso to receive either late zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or continued zzso The median survival for the whole group was 12 zzso the median duration of first zzso was 15 months, with zzso survival at 5 years estimated at zzso The factors most strongly associated with poor survival were performance status and age at zzso but even among those over 60 years of age, half went into zzso Six courses of zzso consolidation gave a small advantage over two courses in reducing the number of late relapses but no significant survival zzso Late zzso showed a marginally significant advantage over continued AT zzso The zzso of zzso zzso was low and unaffected by zzso The second zzso rate varied from zzso when the first zzso was shorter than 6 months to zzso when it had continued for more than 2 zzso 40 patients received zzso zzso bone-marrow transplants in first zzso There was a high zzso death rate, particularly among patients over 30 years of zzso Thus, initially at least, the transplanted group had shorter survival than a comparable group of zzso zzso Treatment specifications remained unchanged throughout the trial but those enrolled in the later half of the trial had a better zzso zzso zzso zzso
