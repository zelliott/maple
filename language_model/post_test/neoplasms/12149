Many terminally ill patients enroll in a hospice late in their illness, and recent data indicate decreasing lengths of hospice enrollment, yet we know little about the impact of hospice enrollment length on surviving zzso This is the first study the authors know of that examines the association between hospice enrollment length and subsequent major depressive disorder among surviving zzso 

The authors conducted a prospective cohort study with 174 primary family zzso of zzso enrolled hospice patients with cancer between October 1999 and September zzso Using data from zzso interviews at the time of enrollment and zzso months after the patient's death, they estimated with zzso zzso the adjusted risk of major depressive disorder with the zzso Clinical zzso for the zzso axis I zzso based on the number of days of hospice care before zzso 

zzso of patients enrolled with hospice for 3 or fewer days were significantly more likely to have major depressive disorder at the follow-up interview than zzso of those with longer hospice enrollment zzso versus zzso respectively), adjusted for baseline major depressive disorder and other potential zzso 

The findings identify a target group for whom zzso services might be most zzso The authors also suggest that earlier hospice enrollment may help reduce the risk of major depressive disorder during the first zzso months of zzso which raises concerns about recent trends toward decreasing lengths of hospice enrollment before zzso
