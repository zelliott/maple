zzso has been the second metal to show activity against zzso tumors in humans soon after the establishment of platinum drugs in routine clinical zzso It has the unique property of zzso tumor growth as a simple zzso mainly because of its close resemblance to zzso zzso Even though its inability to shift between the zzso and a zzso zzso state zzso that zzso behaves as an iron analogue in every respect, it strongly interferes with cellular acquisition of iron from blood by competitive interaction with zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso also seems to affect zzso availability of iron already taken up via this pathway, probably due to its zzso activity on zzso zzso Apart from the consequences of iron zzso zzso exerts zzso effects by direct interaction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in reduced zzso pools and zzso of DNA zzso Both the abundance of zzso receptors and zzso of zzso zzso render tumors susceptible to zzso zzso However, some experimental findings raise the question whether these effects resulting from the zzso properties of zzso are solely responsible for its zzso activity or whether additional mechanisms are involved, such as zzso effects which result from its capability of zzso zzso zzso The limitations experienced with zzso nitrate and zzso zzso which call for a prolonged exposure to low zzso zzso levels in blood in order to adequately exploit the affinity of zzso to tumor zzso and to avoid severe toxic effects, may be overcome by oral zzso complexes such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso which are currently being evaluated in clinical trials and show promise to initiate a revival of zzso in the clinical zzso These two zzso drugs, albeit differing in their complex stability, have both been developed with the intention of providing zzso in a form which allows sufficient zzso zzso but without altering its zzso zzso zzso complexes based on other rationales are scarce and, with regard to the well-known zzso potential of this metal, noticeably zzso With the recent approval of zzso zzso for the zzso treatment of acute zzso zzso the clinical revival of zzso compounds, which have been the mainstay of zzso therapy before the age of modern cancer chemotherapy, has already zzso Currently, strong efforts are being made to explore the activity spectrum in other (less rare) zzso and to gain a deeper insight into the mode of zzso Although this development is currently focusing on zzso zzso it should be suited to stimulate investigations into the therapeutic potential of other zzso compounds as zzso
