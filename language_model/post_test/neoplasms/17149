The cells present in zzso fluid zzso are currently used for prenatal diagnosis of fetal anomalies but are also a potential source of cells for cell zzso To better characterize putative zzso cell populations present in zzso we used culture conditions that support zzso to determine if these promoted the generation of stable cell lines from zzso cells zzso zzso isolated from zzso mouse were cultured on zzso zzso zzso zzso layers in human embryonic germ cell derivation zzso The cultures grew zzso zzso colonies that could be zzso from single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction of established cell lines revealed that they belonged to the zzso zzso zzso expressing high levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the whole zzso expression profile of the AFC lines zzso shows significant correlation between zzso profiles of zzso and zzso zzso an zzso cell zzso In zzso differentiation of zzso results in the generation of cells expressing zzso and zzso zzso while intramuscular injection of zzso into zzso mice produced zzso tumors with primitive zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso contains cells that efficiently produce zzso zzso These zzso zzso lines do not spontaneously differentiate into zzso cells but are zzso stable and have the capacity for extensive zzso The lack of requirement for zzso factors to turn zzso zzso cells into stable cell lines capable of massive expansion together with the known ability of zzso to contribute to embryonic tissue suggests that this cell type may be a candidate for banking for cell zzso
