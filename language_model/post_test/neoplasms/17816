Treatment of cancer is increasingly effective but associated with short and long term side zzso zzso side effects, including oral zzso zzso zzso remain a major source of illness despite the use of a variety of agents to treat zzso 

To assess the effectiveness of interventions for treating oral zzso or its associated pain in patients with cancer receiving chemotherapy or zzso or zzso 

zzso searches of Cochrane zzso Health Group's Trials zzso Cochrane zzso zzso and zzso Care Group's Trials zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso lists from relevant articles were searched and the authors of eligible trials were contacted to identify trials and obtain additional zzso Date of the most recent searches June zzso CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2006, zzso zzso 

All zzso controlled trials comparing agents prescribed to treat oral zzso in people receiving chemotherapy or zzso or zzso Outcomes were oral zzso time to heal zzso oral pain, duration of pain control, zzso systemic infection, amount of zzso length of zzso cost and quality of zzso 

Data were independently zzso in zzso by two review zzso Authors were contacted for details of zzso zzso and zzso Quality assessment was carried out on these three zzso The Cochrane zzso Health Group statistical guidelines were followed and risk ratio zzso values calculated using fixed effect zzso 

Twenty-six trials involving zzso patients satisfied the inclusion zzso Four agents, each in single trials, were found to be effective for improving zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso stimulating factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso human zzso extract zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Three of these trials were rated as at moderate risk of bias and one as at high risk of zzso The following agents were not found to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso solution, zzso zzso and aluminum hydroxide zzso Six trials compared the time to heal and zzso was found to heal more quickly with two zzso zzso zzso stimulating factor when compared to zzso zzso with mean difference zzso days zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso compared to zzso with mean difference zzso days zzso zzso zzso to zzso Three trials compared patient controlled analgesia zzso to the continuous infusion method for controlling zzso There was no evidence of a difference, however, less zzso was used per hour for zzso and the duration of pain was zzso One trial demonstrated that zzso based analgesia zzso reduced pain compared with zzso however, more zzso was used with zzso 

There is weak and unreliable evidence that zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulating factor, zzso or human zzso extract improve or eradicate zzso There is no evidence that patient controlled analgesia zzso is better than continuous infusion method for controlling pain, however, less zzso was used per hour, and duration of pain was zzso for zzso Further, well zzso zzso trials assessing the effectiveness of zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulating factor, zzso human zzso zzso other interventions investigated in this review and new interventions for treating zzso are zzso
