zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a membrane zzso which functions as a zzso cell zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is classified as a member of the zzso gene zzso since it contains the characteristic zzso zzso domain zzso Using zzso with zzso zzso zzso expression has been demonstrated in a relatively limited spectrum of normal human zzso and zzso zzso The zzso expression pattern of zzso can be useful in the differential diagnosis of certain zzso including zzso and various types of zzso zzso zzso Although the biological role of zzso in normal tissue and zzso zzso remains zzso zzso has been suggested to play an important role in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expression can promote zzso progression in human melanoma, possibly through enhanced interaction between melanoma cells and zzso zzso In contrast, zzso may act as a zzso zzso in breast zzso zzso expression is frequently lost in breast zzso and zzso of zzso in breast zzso cells results in a more cohesive cell growth and the formation of smaller zzso in nude zzso During zzso and zzso zzso expressed by the intermediate zzso in the zzso site binds to its putative zzso in zzso smooth muscle cells and limits zzso invasion in the zzso In conclusion, zzso is a recently identified novel cell zzso zzso and its biological functions and role as a diagnostic marker in pathology are now being zzso Identification of the zzso for zzso and the development of experimental models that can account for the complex interactions between zzso cells and their zzso are needed to investigate further the functions of this zzso in biology and in pathological zzso
