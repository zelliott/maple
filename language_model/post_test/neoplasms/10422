zzso are used to simultaneously determine the expressions of thousands of zzso An important application of zzso is in the zzso of samples into classes of interest zzso either healthy cells or zzso zzso zzso partial least squares zzso has often been used for this zzso In this paper, we describe an improvement to zzso that uses zzso probability density functions and the zzso rule to zzso samples whilst keeping the option of not zzso the sample if this cannot be done with sufficient zzso With this approach, those samples outside the boundaries of the known classes or from the ambiguity region between classes are rejected and only samples with a high probability of being correctly classified are indeed zzso The optimal model is found by simultaneously minimizing the zzso and rejection zzso The method zzso with reject zzso was tested with two zzso For the human zzso zzso the accuracy zzso by zzso zzso was improved from zzso to zzso when compared to zzso without reject zzso For the breast cancer zzso zzso with reject option was able to reject zzso of the test samples that did not belong to any of the zzso zzso These samples would have been zzso if the reject option had not been zzso
