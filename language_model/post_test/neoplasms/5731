The expression of the zzso gene product has been examined in normal mast cells, mast cell zzso and zzso cell precursors obtained from patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sections or zzso fixed with zzso zzso were studied by zzso methods, using a zzso zzso against the zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso mast cells showed a positive zzso for zzso gene product, but zzso zzso cell precursors from zzso patients lacked zzso gene product by zzso and flow zzso methods, even in cells having mast cell zzso together with or without zzso zzso zzso cell zzso was, however, expressed in normal and zzso mast cells and zzso cell precursors containing mast cell zzso In addition, cells of zzso lineage lacked zzso gene zzso These findings indicate that the zzso gene product may play an important role in the development and function of mast cell but not of cell of zzso and zzso zzso
