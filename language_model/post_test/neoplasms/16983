The concept of zzso medicine for cancer is not zzso It arguably began with the attempts by zzso and zzso to produce a viable cellular zzso zzso in the 1970s, and continues to this zzso While zzso zzso soon fell out of zzso due to their high failure rate, other cellular zzso fared better and although they have not entered widespread clinical practice, they have proved to be very useful research zzso For instance, the zzso zzso zzso was developed in the early 1990s and is highly zzso It has proved useful for evaluating new drugs and combinations, and in recent years has been used to understand the molecular basis of drug resistance and sensitivity to zzso zzso Recent developments allow unparalleled zzso and zzso of zzso providing a plethora of targets for the development of new cancer zzso However, validation of such targets and new agents to permit translation to the clinic remains zzso There has been one major disappointment in that cell lines, though useful, do not often reflect the zzso of their parent zzso with sufficient zzso to be zzso Low passage cell lines - either in culture or zzso are being used to overcome some of these issues, but have several problems of their zzso zzso cell culture remains useful, but large zzso are likely to receive zzso treatment before removal and that limits the zzso types that can be zzso The development of new treatments remains difficult and prediction of the clinical efficacy of new treatments from zzso data is as hard as zzso One lesson has certainly been that one cannot buck the biology - and that understanding the zzso alone is not sufficient to guarantee zzso Nowhere has this been more evident than in the development of zzso zzso Despite zzso of zzso by many zzso types, only those with zzso zzso zzso and an inability to circumvent zzso blockade have proved susceptible to zzso The challenge is how to use advanced molecular understanding with limited cellular zzso information to improve both drug development and the design of companion zzso to guide their zzso This has the capacity to remove much of the zzso from the process and should improve success zzso
