zzso zzso zzso is the practice of prescribing zzso therapy for zzso after zzso commonly used in surgical patients who are at high risk for zzso zzso While guidelines recommend zzso criteria are vague due to a paucity of zzso The criteria can be further informed by zzso zzso This study sought to determine the zzso zzso threshold for the zzso of zzso compared to zzso zzso 

A decision tree was used to compare zzso for zzso after discharge to zzso of zzso prophylaxis with base case assumptions based on an abdominal zzso zzso without complications in an otherwise healthy zzso zzso to pay was set at zzso life year zzso zzso analyses were performed to assess uncertainty within the model, with particular interest in the threshold for zzso based on zzso zzso 

zzso was the dominant strategy when zzso probability exceeds zzso Given a willingness to pay threshold of zzso zzso was the preferred strategy when zzso zzso exceeded zzso and zzso when using brand name or generic medication costs, zzso 

zzso should be recommended whenever zzso zzso exceeds zzso When zzso estimated zzso risk is zzso patient preferences about zzso and medication costs should be zzso
