This paper, for the first time, demonstrates that exposure of cells to the zzso zzso zzso block zzso zzso zzso results in a substantial decrease in zzso levels selectively in zzso zzso zzso expressing high levels of functional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bovine brain zzso zzso cells zzso are highly responsive to zzso treatment, while cells with low levels of zzso expression zzso zzso zzso human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso zzso are much less responsive to such zzso zzso studies suggest that zzso acts as a zzso and zzso zzso effects of zzso in zzso zzso The ability of zzso to inhibit zzso and sensitize zzso cells appears to be a result of zzso zzso Because many mechanisms of drug resistance are energy dependent, a successful strategy for treating zzso cancer could be based on selective energy depletion in zzso zzso zzso the finding of the zzso effects of zzso zzso in combination with its zzso effects is of considerable theoretical and practical zzso
