We zzso 99 courses of zzso after the use of zzso drugs or zzso drugs plus zzso zzso to mobilize peripheral blood stem cells zzso in 68 patients with zzso or solid zzso Mean yields of zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso were significantly higher than those with zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso The optimal timing of collection was different between these two zzso the mean number of days to a peak level of circulating zzso after zzso zzso was less than that after zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso The zzso level on the day of peak zzso was significantly higher in zzso zzso than that in zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso level was not different zzso 132 vs 125 zzso zzso zzso patient age was not a major adverse factor for zzso zzso zzso recovery of both zzso and zzso was critical for achieving a high zzso yield in these two zzso Following zzso zzso the rate of zzso zzso zzso showed a significant correlation with the infused dose of zzso whether they were collected with zzso or zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso can expand the zzso pool and that zzso yield after zzso zzso may predict zzso zzso zzso after zzso as well as zzso zzso
