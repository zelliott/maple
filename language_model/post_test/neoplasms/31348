The most zzso mechanism of zzso resistance zzso involves zzso zzso a zzso protein acting as an zzso drug zzso zzso The recognition of zzso and other zzso zzso as transport zzso for zzso provided the necessary tool for the clinical assessment of zzso function in patients with zzso Many clinical studies from different institutions and trials including a variety of zzso indicate that both tumor zzso and clearance of zzso are correlated with zzso expression and may be used for the zzso assessment of zzso zzso Although both parameters may predict tumor response to chemotherapy, the extraction of zzso rate zzso appeared to provide a more direct index of zzso function as compared to zzso zzso ratio allowing to trace a continuous spectrum of drug transport zzso zzso studies reported the use of zzso imaging agents to monitor the modulating ability of zzso zzso Although the results support the feasibility of this approach, the zzso of zzso zzso induced by the zzso certainly constitutes a challenge in the development of a simple functional test suitable in clinical zzso The extension of the acquired imaging methodology to tumors with redundant intrinsic resistant mechanisms such as lung cancer requires further investigations on the relative contribution and clinical relevance of each zzso Due to the zzso nature of the phenomenon, the development of new zzso with zzso specificity for other known drug zzso would hopefully help to dissect the complex array of cellular mechanisms contributing to treatment zzso
