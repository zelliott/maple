We have previously described the generation of zzso zzso zzso zzso designed for cancer gene therapy using zzso gene zzso The unique zzso structure with a promoter physically separated from the zzso allows generation of stable virus producer cells irrespective of the toxic zzso The mechanism of synthesis of DNA from zzso zzso dictates that infection leads to the zzso of functional expression zzso in the target zzso 

To improve zzso zzso a zzso zzso was inserted upstream of the zzso repeat zzso the zzso zzso virus zzso regulatory element and an zzso attachment site upstream of the zzso were zzso In addition, a bacterial origin of replication was deleted and a functional internal zzso signal zzso zzso targeting was attempted by introducing zzso zzso promoters such as the zzso region of mouse zzso zzso virus or the promoter of the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso All modifications were zzso in detail with respect to virus production and zzso Finally, the zzso was armed with the zzso zzso gene and zzso cells were zzso for zzso zzso 

zzso modifications of the zzso resulted in a zzso improvement of more than zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with targeted cellular promoters was zzso When equipped with the zzso zzso stable producer cells could be successfully established and high zzso virus infection resulted in rigorous target cell zzso 

The zzso zzso in its zzso form is an attractive tool for cancer gene therapy zzso
