The OSHA standard for zzso oven emissions, which went into effect in January 1977, sets a permissible exposure limit to zzso oven emissions of 150 zzso zzso fraction of total particulate matter zzso Review of the zzso evidence for the standard indicates an excess relative risk for lung cancer as high as zzso in zzso zzso oven workers with 15 years of exposure or zzso There is also evidence for a consistent zzso relationship in lung cancer mortality when duration and location of employment at the zzso ovens are zzso zzso models fitted to these same data indicate that, while excess risks may still occur under the OSHA standard, the predicted levels of increased relative risk would be about zzso if a linear zzso model is assumed and zzso if a zzso model is zzso Lung cancer mortality data for other zzso suggest the predicted excess risk has probably been somewhat zzso but lack of information on important zzso factors limits further zzso zzso
