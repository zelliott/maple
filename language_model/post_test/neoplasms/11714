Of the known zzso agents zzso ultraviolet and zzso zzso and zzso chemicals appear to be of major importance in the induction of human zzso The known chemical zzso include a wide range of zzso Their common feature is that their ultimate forms are zzso zzso in most cases, these zzso arise through metabolism in zzso zzso by chemicals is a zzso zzso The first stage, zzso occurs rapidly and appears to be zzso The available data indicate that initiation generally results from one or more zzso of cellular zzso zzso reactions of zzso derivatives of zzso with DNA are the major cause of these zzso The second stage, promotion, occurs over a longer period of zzso zzso is a complex process, for which the early stages are largely zzso The critical events appear to be zzso Complete zzso have both initiating and promoting activities, but the ratios of these two activities for various chemicals may differ zzso This knowledge of the mechanisms of zzso by chemicals provides a useful basis for approaches to the prevention of human zzso
