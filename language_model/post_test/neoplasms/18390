Blood salvage allows for collection and processing of surgical blood loss with the eventual zzso of washed red blood cells zzso back to the zzso The use of blood salvage in patients undergoing surgery for zzso is zzso zzso exists as to the risk of potential cancer dissemination resulting from the zzso of the processed blood, but no data are available to confirm this zzso Recent studies have demonstrated that filtering the salvaged blood using a zzso filter zzso significantly decreases the number of cancer cells in the recovered zzso zzso in a variety of cancer zzso 

Patients on the zzso zzso service as part of the bloodless surgery program at Englewood Hospital and Medical Center from April 1998 to April 2007 were zzso Three patients that had zzso of cell salvage blood (all zzso were performed after zzso with a zzso were studied further with emphasis placed on long-term zzso 

Two of the three patients did not show any evidence of zzso after zzso The only patient that developed evidence of zzso progression had known liver zzso at the time of her initial diagnosis and therefore had zzso dissemination before her index zzso 

In this series of patients undergoing surgery for zzso on the zzso zzso service, blood salvage with zzso was not definitively associated with zzso zzso Further large controlled studies are needed to demonstrate the clinical safety of the use of blood salvage in this zzso
