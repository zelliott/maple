The feasibility of using zzso for gene therapy has been under close scrutiny recently, as it has become clear that significant toxicity can result from the strong immune response created by intravenous administration of large doses of first generation zzso zzso This suggests that other zzso could be more useful for treatment of zzso and zzso disease, where widespread zzso is often necessary for effective gene replacement, and the viability of target cells is zzso However, promising recent results in human cancer trials have confirmed that zzso can be very useful in zzso For cancer treatment, the unparalleled zzso efficacy of zzso in dividing and dormant cells is a major zzso As the goal in cancer gene therapy is to kill infected zzso cells, long-term zzso expression is not zzso In addition, the immune response generated against infected cells could be useful for zzso zzso zzso zzso more than 670 cancer patients have been treated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with very manageable adverse effects and no unexpected severe or lethal zzso Currently, the most promising approaches are based on zzso agents that allow efficient zzso penetration because of their capacity for zzso zzso In addition to zzso control, it is becoming clear that targeting is necessary for efficient zzso zzso and less infection of normal zzso zzso results are anticipated when the first selectively replicating targeted zzso go to clinical zzso In conclusion, intense gene therapy and zzso research have suggested that while other zzso could be more useful for treatment of zzso disease, zzso are highly promising and safe agents for zzso as suggested in a number of early phase clinical zzso
