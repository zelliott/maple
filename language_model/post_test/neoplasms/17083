The present study aimed to estimate the health benefits of selective taxation of healthy and zzso food commodities in relation to zzso and zzso zzso 

The potential health effects of a selective taxation scenario were estimated as changes in the burden of disease, measured by zzso life years, from health outcomes affected by the changes in food zzso The change in burden of a disease was calculated as the change in zzso of the disease due to a modified exposure level, using the potential impact zzso Estimates of relative risk for the associations between various foods and relevant diseases were found through a literature search and used in the calculation of potential impact zzso 

The study was based in Denmark, zzso the health effects of a Danish selective taxation zzso 

The potential health effects of selective taxation were zzso for the adult Danish zzso 

zzso the rate of value-added tax on fruit and vegetables and increasing the tax on fats would result in moderate reductions in the burden of disease from zzso zzso stroke, and zzso lung and breast cancer zzso % zzso The largest effect could be obtained through increased intake of fruit and vegetables zzso zzso 

zzso selective taxation to healthy and zzso foods can moderately reduce the burden of disease in the Danish zzso
