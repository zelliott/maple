zzso of zzso and zzso from underlying cause of death zzso the burden of these zzso The aims of this study were to estimate the true frequency of zzso and zzso among zzso workers in Great Britain zzso and to identify factors associated with the risk of death with these zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was established in 1971 to monitor long-term health outcomes among workers covered by regulations to control zzso at zzso zzso and zzso cases were defined by multiple cause of death, and were zzso by identifying zzso workers on the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mortality ratios zzso were zzso the risks of zzso and zzso were modeled with zzso zzso zzso Deaths to the end of 2005 were zzso 

There were zzso deaths between 1971 and 2005 among the zzso zzso zzso 477 zzso and zzso zzso cases were zzso The zzso for all causes was zzso for zzso zzso and for zzso zzso In multiply adjusted analysis, age, sex, job, and birth cohort were significantly associated with zzso and zzso For zzso year of first exposure, and for zzso zzso were also statistically zzso 

The zzso workers experienced high mortality from all causes, zzso and zzso There was some evidence that the risk of zzso and zzso was lower in later birth zzso and among those first zzso exposed to zzso more zzso Due to the long zzso of both diseases, further follow-up is required to confirm these zzso
