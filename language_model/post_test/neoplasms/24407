The progress in the understanding of cancer progression and early detection has been slow and frustrating due to the complex zzso nature and zzso of the cancer zzso To date, no effective treatment is available for advanced zzso which remain a major cause of morbidity and zzso Clearly, there is urgent need to unravel novel zzso for early zzso Most of the functional information of the zzso genes resides in the zzso The later is an exceptionally complex biological system involving several proteins that function through zzso modifications and dynamic zzso zzso with zzso These protein complexes can be regulated by signals emanating from cancer cells, their surrounding tissue zzso and/or from the zzso Some proteins are zzso and/or zzso into the zzso milieu and may represent valuable serum zzso for diagnosis zzso It is estimated that the cancer zzso may include over zzso million proteins as a result of zzso processing and zzso Such complexity clearly highlights the need for zzso resolution zzso technology for robust quantitative protein zzso and data zzso This review is to update the current research efforts in high-resolution zzso technology for discovery and monitoring cancer zzso
