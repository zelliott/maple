zzso risk models can lead to powerful methods for detecting the association of a disease with a zzso region of zzso In zzso studies of unrelated individuals, however, the zzso status of some subjects may not be discernible without ambiguity from available zzso zzso zzso A score test for detecting zzso association using zzso data has been developed in the context of generalized linear models for analysis of data from zzso and retrospective zzso In this article, we develop a test for association using zzso data from cohort and zzso zzso studies where subjects are zzso followed until disease zzso or zzso (end of zzso zzso Assuming a zzso hazard model for the zzso effects, we derive an induced hazard function of the disease given the zzso data, and hence propose a test statistic based on the associated partial zzso The proposed test procedure can account for differential follow-up of subjects, can adjust for possibly zzso environmental zzso and can make efficient use of valuable zzso information that is available on zzso We provide an zzso for computing the test statistic using readily available statistical zzso zzso simulated data in the context of two zzso regions zzso and zzso we evaluate the zzso of the proposed test for small sample sizes and study its power in the presence and absence of missing zzso zzso
