zzso and zzso sources cause zzso induced DNA damage in living organisms by a variety of zzso The resulting DNA zzso are zzso and, unless zzso lead to a variety of zzso and consequently to genetic instability, which is a hallmark of zzso zzso induced DNA damage is repaired in living cells by different pathways that involve a large number of zzso zzso and accumulated DNA zzso may lead to disease processes including zzso zzso also occur in DNA repair zzso zzso the DNA repair zzso A majority of cancer cell lines have zzso zzso in their DNA repair zzso In addition, zzso in these genes constitute a risk factor for zzso In general, defects in DNA repair are associated with zzso Numerous DNA repair zzso exist that possess different, but sometimes overlapping zzso zzso for removal of zzso induced DNA zzso In addition to the role of DNA repair in zzso recent evidence suggests that some types of tumors possess increased DNA repair capacity that may lead to therapy zzso DNA repair pathways are drug targets to develop DNA repair zzso to increase the efficacy of cancer zzso zzso induced DNA zzso and DNA repair proteins may serve as potential zzso for early zzso cancer risk assessment, prognosis and for monitoring zzso Taken together, a large body of accumulated evidence suggests that zzso induced DNA damage and its repair are important factors in the development of human zzso Thus this field deserves more research to contribute to the development of cancer zzso DNA repair zzso and treatment approaches to better understand and fight zzso
