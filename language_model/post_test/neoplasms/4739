Natural killer zzso cells are considered to be critical players in zzso zzso However, zzso are able to develop mechanisms to escape zzso cell attack or to induce defective zzso zzso Current zzso zzso cancer zzso is aimed at overcoming zzso cell paralysis through several potential approaches, including zzso zzso zzso cells, expanding zzso zzso cells, usage of stable zzso zzso cell lines and genetically zzso fresh zzso cells or zzso cell zzso The stable zzso zzso cell line approach is more practical for quality-control and large-scale zzso Additionally, genetically zzso zzso cell lines by increasing their expression of zzso and engineering zzso tumor zzso receptors could improve their specificity and zzso In this review, zzso cells in tumor zzso are discussed, and a list of therapeutic zzso cell lines currently undergoing zzso and clinical trials of several kinds of tumors are zzso
