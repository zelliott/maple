The recent success in the derivation of differentiated cell types from stem cells has raised prospects for the application of zzso cell zzso In particular, embryonic stem cells are attractive sources for cell zzso due to their zzso and rapid zzso These cells, however, also possess zzso properties, which raises serious safety concerns and makes zzso testing zzso Our goal was to establish a highly sensitive animal model for testing the zzso potential of stem-cell zzso 

zzso nude mice received cell zzso of zzso zzso cells containing defined numbers of mouse embryonic stem zzso We either injected 1 million viable cells into the kidney zzso or mixed 2 million cells with zzso for zzso zzso To analyze the possible impact of an intact immune response on tumor development, we also transplanted the cells into zzso zzso Animals were sacrificed when the tumors became zzso zzso and were analyzed in zzso 

The nude mouse model zzso allowed detection of 20 zzso cells, and even as few as 2 zzso cells were found to form zzso Interestingly, the administration of cell zzso at two different application sites resulted in different growth zzso and tumor zzso The highest level of sensitivity zzso detection of 20 zzso zzso zzso was achieved by zzso injection of cells mixed with zzso The influence of the immune system on zzso development was demonstrated by a higher tumor rate of transplants in zzso nude mice compared with zzso zzso 

We have established a reliable animal model for routine assessment of the zzso profile of zzso cell zzso This model will facilitate the generation of zzso zzso cell zzso and will help to integrate standardized safety systems into the application of zzso zzso for clinical zzso
