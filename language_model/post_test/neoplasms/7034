Our objective was to build a zzso zzso model for the time course of zzso in cancer patients following zzso treatment with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso crossover trial was performed with 35 adult patients who received 175 zzso zzso as either 15 zzso zzso zzso or 3 h zzso intravenous zzso zzso zzso were measured by zzso zzso VI was used for population zzso 

The zzso effect on zzso was described by four zzso models predicated on known properties of zzso that used zzso zzso in the central, deep peripheral or an zzso compartment as forcing zzso zzso zzso was estimated to release zzso of the dose directly into the deep peripheral compartment zzso All models provided reasonable fitting of zzso zzso The model with the best zzso performance assumed that this dose fraction was released into zzso of the zzso which included the site of zzso The zzso zzso rate constant was zzso zzso per hour zzso zzso zzso The relative exposure at the site of toxicity was zzso zzso zzso times zzso zzso zzso larger for zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso was zzso days for zzso cells, zzso days for zzso cells, and zzso days for zzso Total drug exposure in blood explained half of the zzso in zzso to baseline zzso count zzso 

The relative exposure of zzso zzso at the site of toxicity was twice as large for zzso zzso compared to zzso The proposed zzso models explained the extent and time course of zzso jointly for both zzso
