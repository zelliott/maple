The zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in controlling cell growth by zzso multiple zzso and zzso zzso The components of this zzso are gene families with a high level of structural and functional zzso and are expressed in an overlapping fashion in most zzso and cell zzso Using classical transgenic technology as well as zzso in zzso cells, a series of mouse models have been developed to study the in zzso function of individual components of this zzso in both normal zzso and tumor zzso These models have proven to be useful to define specific as well as redundant roles among members of these cell cycle regulatory gene zzso This zzso is zzso in the vast majority of human tumors by genetic and zzso zzso that target at least some of its key members such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso As a consequence, some of these molecules are currently being considered as targets for cancer therapy, and several novel zzso such as zzso zzso are under development as potential zzso zzso
