Previously, we found that cancer patients using a zzso based zzso intravenous infusion system zzso to regulate their own zzso infusion rates achieved more relief from oral zzso pain than similar patients using zzso by zzso zzso In this study, we employed the zzso system to compare efficacy and zzso zzso of 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in bone zzso transplant zzso patients zzso the drugs to relieve pain from oral zzso Patients using zzso by zzso obtained more pain relief than patients regulating their own zzso infusions during the first 4 days of continuous zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso did not differ between the 2 study zzso In contrast to patients using zzso for zzso days, those receiving zzso by zzso required unexpectedly high plasma zzso of the drug to obtain equivalent pain zzso Our results indicate that either the relative zzso of these 2 zzso zzso differ from previous estimates or zzso tolerance developed to zzso but not to zzso We conclude that zzso has similar efficacy in control of prolonged pain in zzso patients, but the utility of zzso in long-term pain management may be limited by relatively rapid tolerance zzso
