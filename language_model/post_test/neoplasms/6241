zzso zzso is a zzso protein with regulatory functions in inflammation and zzso The type 1 repeats zzso zzso of zzso have been shown to interact with a wide range of proteins that result in the zzso and zzso properties of zzso To ascertain possible functions and evaluate potential therapeutic effects of zzso in inflammatory zzso disease, we conducted clinical, zzso and zzso analyses on a mouse model of induced zzso We used zzso zzso sodium zzso to induce colitis in zzso zzso mice for 7 zzso zzso mice were injected with either saline or one form of zzso derived zzso zzso containing either zzso the three type 1 repeats of the zzso zzso zzso the second type 1 repeat zzso or zzso zzso with the zzso sequence zzso Total zzso isolated from the mice zzso were processed and zzso to mouse zzso zzso data were validated by real-time zzso and zzso zzso and disease zzso reveal that the mice treated with the zzso show different patterns of zzso zzso and that zzso treatment was the most effective in decreasing inflammation in zzso zzso zzso profiling revealed zzso expressed zzso zzso with the zzso mice showing the least zzso from the zzso zzso In conclusion, this study shows that zzso treatment is effective in attenuating the inflammatory response to zzso zzso In addition, the zzso work unveils novel genetic data that suggest beneficial application of the zzso zzso in inflammatory zzso zzso
