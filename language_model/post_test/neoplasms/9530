To describe the frequency distribution for the number of residual zzso zzso tumor cells after removal of the primary zzso 

Previously obtained autopsy, surgical pathological and laboratory data were used to characterize the size and number zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso Carlo simulations were used to estimate the numbers of residual tumor cells based upon the assumption of a zzso distribution for the sizes of zzso and zzso zzso negative zzso or negative zzso distributed numbers of zzso zzso to zzso zzso within individuals, zzso zzso within individuals, and zzso zzso within zzso zzso 

In each of the scenarios the zzso distribution for the numbers of zzso tumor cells was zzso and positively zzso with a tail extending to the higher numbers of zzso When plotted with equal sized counting bins and according the zzso of the number of tumor cells, the zzso showed zzso from the normal form no greater than several percentage zzso result considered acceptable given the zzso inherent to zzso zzso 

The distribution for the number of residual zzso zzso may be zzso from data and models derived from the size and number zzso for zzso In the absence of a closed form description for this distribution, the zzso distribution could provide a zzso but practical, approximation for cases limited to zzso microscopic residual zzso These analyses will facilitate the definition of the zzso for the zzso therapy of zzso zzso
