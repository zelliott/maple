A major challenge in cancer treatment is the development of therapies that target cancer cells with little or no toxicity to normal zzso and zzso zzso in DNA double strand break zzso repair in cancer cells include both elevated and reduced levels of key repair proteins and changes in the relative contributions of the various zzso repair zzso These differences can result in increased sensitivity to zzso agents and increased zzso zzso The development of agents that selectively inhibit the zzso repair pathways that cancer cells are more dependent upon will facilitate the design of therapeutic strategies that exploit the differences in zzso repair between normal and cancer zzso Here, we discuss the pathways of zzso repair, zzso in zzso repair in cancer, zzso of zzso repair and future directions for cancer therapies that target zzso zzso
