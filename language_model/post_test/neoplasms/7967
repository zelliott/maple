The former Oxford health region, England, zzso 

zzso of zzso people with zzso syndrome and cohort of zzso people with other conditions for zzso 

As expected, the rate ratio for zzso was substantially elevated in people with zzso zzso it was zzso higher zzso confidence intervals zzso to zzso than the rate in the comparison zzso For other zzso combined, excluding zzso the rate ratio was not significantly elevated zzso zzso to zzso The risk of zzso cancer was increased zzso zzso to zzso although this was based on only three cases in the cohort of subjects with zzso zzso zzso elevated risks were found for zzso disease zzso zzso to zzso acquired zzso zzso zzso zzso other zzso disorders, and type 1 diabetes zzso zzso zzso to zzso A decreased risk was found for asthma zzso zzso to zzso 

Our data add to the body of information on the risks of zzso in people with zzso zzso The finding on asthma needs to be confirmed or zzso by other zzso
