The Human Genome Project has led to a multitude of new potential screening targets on the level of human zzso The aim of this systematic review is to critically zzso the evidence from health economic evaluations of genetic screening in the zzso 

Based on an extensive zzso search, an appropriate zzso for a systematic database search was zzso zzso health economic evaluations were identified and zzso using published quality zzso 

zzso screening for eight conditions has been found to be investigated by health economic zzso zzso breast and zzso cancer, familial zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso familial zzso zzso zzso zzso diabetes zzso and zzso zzso zzso range from dominated to zzso zzso genetic screening may be considered cost-effective with limited quality of evidence only for three zzso The methodology of the studies was of varying zzso zzso was primarily influenced by zzso zzso genetic test costs, mortality risk, effectiveness of treatment, age at zzso and discount zzso 

Health economic evidence on genetic screening is zzso Only few conditions have properly been zzso Based on the existing evidence, zzso decision makers should consider the introduction of selective genetic screening for zzso and zzso As genetic test costs are zzso the existing evaluations may warrant zzso Especially in the case of zzso zzso genetic population screening may be about to turn from a dominated to a cost-effective or even zzso zzso
