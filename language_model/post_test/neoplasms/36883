Two zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso transport and zzso has been shown to zzso inhibit the repair of radiation damage in cancer cells by reducing the flow of zzso zzso Since zzso derivatives zzso inhibit certain zzso of the respiratory zzso resulting in an increase in the zzso usage and zzso zzso could possibly enhance the zzso zzso effects of zzso in cancer zzso The purpose of the present work was to verify this zzso 

Two human tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso and a zzso tumor cell line zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso in zzso were zzso A commercially available preparation of zzso zzso zzso was used in the present zzso zzso incubated with zzso zzso zzso for zzso h before zzso were exposed to zzso zzso of zzso gamma rays and maintained under liquid holding conditions for zzso h to facilitate zzso zzso zzso zzso added at the time of zzso was present during the liquid zzso zzso zzso damage zzso zzso and cell death zzso zzso were analyzed as parameters of radiation zzso zzso of these zzso on zzso usage and zzso were also studied by measuring the zzso consumption and zzso production using zzso zzso 

The zzso consumption and zzso production of zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso were twofold higher than in the zzso cells zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso (10 zzso enhanced the rate of zzso zzso consumption and zzso zzso in these cells by zzso to zzso which was reduced by zzso to zzso in the presence of 5 zzso zzso In zzso growing zzso and EAT cells, presence of zzso (5 zzso zzso with zzso for 4 hours after zzso increased the zzso zzso formation and cell death by nearly zzso whereas no significant effects could be observed in zzso zzso In EAT cells, radiation was also observed to induce zzso death, which was significantly increased in the presence of the combination zzso + zzso The combination zzso + zzso enhanced the radiation damage in all three cell systems by zzso Furthermore, the zzso effects of the combination zzso + zzso were higher at pH zzso as compared to pH zzso zzso In the plateau phase, presence of zzso alone did not significantly influence the radiation response of either zzso or of zzso cells, whereas in combination with zzso zzso enhanced the radiation damage in both these cell lines by zzso to zzso Furthermore, in zzso cells, the effects of zzso were observed to be zzso to a very great extent, while that of the combination were mostly zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso effects of zzso in cancer cells, possibly by further reducing the energy supply leading to an irreversible zzso of DNA repair, and increased zzso damage and cell zzso Since both these compounds have been used in clinical practice, further studies to investigate their use in improving zzso of tumors are zzso
