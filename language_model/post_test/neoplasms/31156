This review deals with biological and pathological aspects of various zzso of the zzso molecules zzso and zzso They are generated by different molecular zzso zzso and zzso zzso by alternative zzso of zzso zzso de zzso zzso by alternative zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region, and the zzso zzso by exchange of single chains of the zzso zzso In contrast to the zzso zzso the distribution of zzso and de zzso zzso is restricted to embryonic zzso they subsequently reappear in zzso zzso in zzso processes and in zzso zzso The expression of these so-called zzso zzso is zzso by growth factors zzso zzso The association of the zzso zzso with zzso activity and newly formed vessels identifies this zzso zzso as a marker of cellular activity in the process of zzso and as a suitable agent for the evaluation of zzso zzso zzso results suggest a correlation between the amount of zzso and de zzso zzso in zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso with regard to their zzso and propensity for zzso zzso The current nomenclature of the zzso zzso family is zzso The zzso chain constitution of basement zzso switches from embryonic or zzso active to adult terminally differentiated zzso zzso of the zzso beta 2 zzso zzso and depends on the tissue zzso The zzso between the loss of basement zzso (multiple basement membrane zzso in zzso and the recently reported increased zzso chain synthesis in these zzso may be explained by abundant zzso chain deposition outside the basement membrane in the zzso invasion front, possibly associated with enhanced zzso of budding zzso zzso
