zzso zzso a zzso of about 30 zzso is zzso in tumor zzso as well as some human cancer cell lines, but it has been suggested to be a tumor zzso To zzso roles of zzso zzso in tumor zzso we here examined distribution of zzso in three types of human cancer zzso by zzso The results showed that zzso was zzso in the zzso as well as the zzso surrounding tumor cells in the human cancer zzso zzso and zzso muscle zzso zzso as an activated zzso marker were often zzso in zzso zzso zzso In zzso analysis indicated that transforming growth factor zzso might be an important zzso of zzso in normal human zzso zzso strongly zzso the expression of zzso and zzso that of zzso in normal zzso zzso significantly zzso the proliferation and migration of zzso The zzso expression of zzso and zzso was blocked by a zzso signal inhibitor but neither the stimulation of cell growth nor zzso These results imply that zzso activates normal zzso by zzso and independent zzso These findings also suggest that zzso and zzso zzso or zzso contribute to the zzso zzso and zzso tissue formation in human cancer zzso contributing to tumor zzso
