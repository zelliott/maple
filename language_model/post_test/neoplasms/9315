zzso data may be a suitable source studying associations between drugs and zzso However, linkage between cancer registry and claims data including zzso information is not always zzso We examined the accuracy of zzso definitions of incident zzso and their date of zzso 

Four zzso definitions were developed to identify incident zzso lymphoma, zzso zzso stomach, and breast zzso We identified a cohort of subjects aged zzso zzso from Pennsylvania Medicare and drug benefit program data linked with the state cancer zzso We calculated sensitivity, zzso and positive zzso values of the zzso definitions using registry as the gold zzso We further assessed the agreement between diagnosis dates from two data zzso 

All definitions had very high specificity zzso while sensitivity varied between zzso and zzso Test characteristics did not vary systematically by age zzso The date of first diagnosis according to Medicare data tended to be later than the date recorded in the registry data except for breast zzso The differences in dates of first diagnosis were within 14 days for zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso due to outcome zzso of our zzso definition of cancer was minimal in our example of a cohort zzso 

zzso data can identify incident zzso zzso and solid tumors with very high specificity with sufficient agreement in the date of first zzso The impact of bias due to outcome zzso and thus the usefulness of zzso cancer definitions as cancer outcome markers in zzso studies need to be assessed for each study zzso
