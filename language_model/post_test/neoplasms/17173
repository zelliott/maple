zzso zzso often results in the development and progression of zzso zzso is zzso expressed in most human and zzso zzso but zzso in many cancer zzso This differential zzso expression can be zzso for targeted cancer gene zzso Multiple copies of the zzso complementary target sequence were inserted into the zzso of zzso zzso zzso either for different reporter genes or for the therapeutic gene zzso With these zzso we analyzed the zzso gene expression in cancer cells and normal zzso Moreover, we investigated zzso zzso expression in an zzso zzso zzso mouse model using a zzso carrier system for in zzso zzso We showed low and high levels of zzso in cancer cells and normal cells, respectively, leading to a differential gene expression of the reporters and the therapeutic zzso According to the zzso levels, the zzso reporter gene expression was silenced in the mouse lungs but not in zzso zzso Thus, we zzso the differential zzso expression in healthy and zzso zzso to zzso the lung by specifically targeting the tumor in an in zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso The use of an zzso therapeutic zzso may present a promising approach for cancer gene zzso
