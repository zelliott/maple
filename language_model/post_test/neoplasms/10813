Despite the popular use of vitamin supplements and several prospective cohort studies investigating their effect on cancer zzso and cardiovascular disease zzso scientific data supporting their benefits remain zzso zzso results may be partly explained by the fact that use of supplements is an inconsistent behavior in zzso We examined whether vitamin supplement use patterns affect cancer and zzso risk in a zzso cohort study in zzso 

A total of zzso men and zzso women in the Japan Public Health zzso Prospective Study zzso who answered questions about vitamin supplement use in the first survey from zzso and the second survey from zzso were zzso into four groups zzso use, past use, recent use, and consistent zzso and followed to the end of 2006 for cancer and 2005 for zzso zzso hazard ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso were used to describe the relative risks of cancer and zzso associated with vitamin supplement zzso 

During zzso zzso cancer and 1858 zzso cases were zzso zzso adjusted analysis revealed no association of any pattern of vitamin supplement use with the risk of cancer and zzso in zzso In women, consistent use was associated with lower risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas past zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and recent use zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with higher risk of zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the first prospective cohort study to examine simultaneously the associations between vitamin supplement use patterns and risk of cancer and zzso This prospective cohort study demonstrated that vitamin supplement use has little effect on the risk of cancer or zzso in zzso In women, however, consistent vitamin supplement use might reduce the risk of zzso zzso risk of cancer associated with past and recent use of vitamin supplements in women may be partly explained by zzso diseases or zzso background, but we could not totally control for this in our zzso
