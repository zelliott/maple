A critical review of some of our current views on how chemicals induced cancer is zzso zzso is placed on zzso zzso rather than on agents and on the many steps that lie between initial exposure to a zzso and the appearance of zzso zzso The nature of some of the early steps in zzso is outlined including the early appearance during initiation of cells resistant to some of the zzso effect of zzso This property is considered to be important in the development of cancer in at least one model of zzso The essential characteristic of promotion, differential stimulation of proliferation of initiated cells, is discussed along with at least three possible mechanisms for such differential effects of promoting zzso The zzso hypothesis for cancer development is supported by observations of identifiable zzso and biological properties of different cell populations at some zzso The implications of this for cancer diagnosis, prevention and control are briefly zzso
