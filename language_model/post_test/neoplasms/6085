To discuss the clinical development of new zzso of old zzso agents and highlight the value of adopting this zzso 

Several drugs are currently in clinical development with high potential in improving clinical outcomes compared with their older zzso We emphasize on the results of four of these agents, each belonging to a known group of zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso Each has shown promising results that have the potential in addressing some limitations that have been observed with the zzso zzso zzso 

Improvement in drug development strategies and the appreciation of the mechanisms of action and resistance of the zzso agents currently available in the clinic open the door for developing agents that have the potential of improving clinical outcomes with better safety zzso It is important to adopt innovative clinical trials designs zzso molecular markers in early clinical development in order to identify the zzso of patients who would derive the zzso benefit of these novel zzso
