zzso of the DNA damage responsive protein zzso zzso is a critical step for cellular survival in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso targets of zzso regulating zzso remain to be fully zzso We have recently reported that zzso zzso the zzso zzso Snail on zzso zzso We aimed to further study the functional significance of zzso Snail zzso in response to zzso 

We zzso zzso zzso the zzso 100 to zzso zzso or to zzso acid zzso substitution of Snail into various cell zzso We assessed colony formation, zzso focus formation and the invasion index in the cells treated with or without zzso 

We found that zzso of the zzso zzso Snail in zzso cells significantly increased zzso Meanwhile the expression of zzso a zzso zzso resulted in enhanced zzso Interestingly, zzso could rescue the zzso zzso in zzso zzso We also found that expression of zzso increased zzso focus formation and compromised zzso of invasion in response to zzso independent of cell zzso 

zzso Snail zzso 100 zzso in response to zzso plays an important part in the regulation of zzso
