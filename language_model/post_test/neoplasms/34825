Although access to cancer care is known to influence patient zzso to the zzso knowledge, little is known regarding geographic access to cancer care, and how it may vary by population zzso This study estimated travel time to specialized cancer care settings for the zzso zzso population and calculated per capita zzso zzso 

The closest travel times were estimated using a network analysis of the road distance weighted by travel speeds from the population or geographic zzso of every zzso area in the zzso zzso to that of the nearest cancer care setting under zzso National Cancer Institute zzso Cancer Centers, academic medical centers, and zzso Alaska and Hawaii were excluded because travel in these states is often not zzso zzso and geographic characteristics including zzso income, education, and region were derived from zzso Census 2000 data and from zzso commuting area zzso zzso supply per 100,000 residents in Hospital zzso zzso zzso was estimated by zzso 

Travel times of zzso hour were estimated for zzso of the population to the nearest zzso Cancer Center, zzso to the nearest zzso care, and zzso to any specialized cancer zzso Native Americans, zzso zzso and residents in the South had the longest travel times to the nearest zzso Cancer Center compared with the overall zzso population zzso zzso range zzso in zzso 155 zzso 173 zzso and zzso zzso vs 78 zzso zzso Travel burdens persisted for Native Americans and zzso populations across all 3 cancer care zzso For all population zzso travel times markedly increased as the degree of cancer care specialization zzso The median zzso supply for zzso was zzso per 100,000 zzso 

There are population groups with limited access to the most specialized cancer care zzso
