We describe a mathematical model of cell growth and death and explain how it can be used to integrate data from classic tissue culture experiments on zzso agents and thus aid the identification of their mechanism of zzso Experimental data relating to zzso and zzso changes in growth rate, cell cycle distribution, plus zzso and zzso zzso are zzso in terms of zzso to kinetic parameters that describe the rates at which cells transit between zzso zzso The mathematical model is zzso in the sense that the kinetic parameters are calculated from the experimental data directly, without any fitting zzso Since the kinetic parameters are much more directly related to potential molecular targets than are the zzso measured zzso this approach can provide a more zzso picture of the mechanism of action of the zzso agent under zzso We demonstrate the potential value of our model by applying it to data from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This agent is a zzso zzso zzso for which at least three potential mechanisms of zzso activity have been zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso it is a zzso zzso of zzso and zzso it is a zzso zzso to zzso zzso Each mechanism can induce a separate, but zzso pattern of cellular responses, making the interpretation of tissue culture data very zzso Here we study the zzso and zzso effects of zzso on the zzso cell line, and develop a zzso mathematical model to interpret the zzso Application of the model to the data suggests that zzso increases the rate at which cells became zzso state but, rather surprisingly, actually zzso the rate of cell zzso As a control, we also apply the model to data describing the zzso and zzso effects of zzso since its mechanism of action is better zzso
