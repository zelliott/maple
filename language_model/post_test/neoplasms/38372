By virtue of their zzso degrading zzso activity, zzso are potentially zzso For the application of these zzso as zzso however, they have to overcome several obstacles whose interplay is not yet fully zzso zzso with a basic zzso are not only able to interact with the zzso zzso cellular membrane but they are also zzso selective for tumor zzso After the zzso zzso into the cell and release into the zzso from the zzso where they have to resist the attack by zzso they face the zzso zzso zzso Only if they are able to evade the tight binding to the inhibitor (or if enough zzso molecules enter the cell to neutralize the inhibitor zzso they are able to attack their target zzso for which a sufficient zzso activity is zzso Each of these steps can turn into an insurmountable hurdle zzso the zzso potential of these zzso In the present review I will zzso the status quo of the knowledge on the mechanisms and their zzso as well as to develop strategies to overcome possible zzso
