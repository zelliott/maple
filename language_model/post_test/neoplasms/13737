Recently, a series of shared molecular pathways have emerged that have in common a significant role in the zzso and progression of both zzso and zzso zzso stress and the cellular damage that results from it have been implicated in a wide variety of disease processes including zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced by cigarette smoking and increased dietary fat intake are implicated in the zzso of both zzso It has been hypothesized that zzso may begin when an injury or infection zzso or zzso a single zzso smooth muscle cell in the zzso of a zzso clone similar to the most widely held theory of zzso Cell proliferation regulatory pathways including genes involved in the zzso checkpoint zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A, D, zzso and zzso zzso have been associated with plaque zzso zzso and zzso after zzso as well as in cancer zzso zzso in cell zzso molecules zzso zzso have been linked to plaque formation and zzso as well as to tumor invasion and zzso zzso expression of zzso associated with zzso has been implicated in zzso plaque expansion and zzso and in the invasion and zzso of zzso zzso factor zzso interactions zzso zzso have been associated with early zzso zzso as well as cancer development and zzso Nuclear zzso factors such as zzso have been associated with progression of both zzso zzso zzso have recently been linked to plaque expansion and zzso of zzso zzso as well as local and zzso tumor zzso Common disease treatments, such as the use of growth factor zzso and radiation treatment, established zzso treatments, were recently introduced into zzso therapeutic strategies to prevent zzso after zzso and zzso In conclusion, a series of molecular pathways of disease development and progression common to zzso and cancer support that the world's two most common diseases are far more closely aligned than previously believed and that emerging zzso and zzso therapeutic strategies may ultimately be zzso in both zzso
