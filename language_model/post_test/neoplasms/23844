Of the semiconductor metals, only zzso has been extensively studied as a human zzso and systemic zzso Recent studies have zzso however, that zzso zzso and zzso are capable of producing marked zzso in cellular gene zzso After acute in zzso administration zzso and zzso have been shown to produce decreases in the activity of some zzso zzso dependent on zzso zzso therefore these metals would be capable of interfering with the metabolism of organic zzso zzso is essential for the activity of the zzso zzso zzso which zzso the active zzso generated by zzso zzso zzso zzso produces toxicity in a number of organ zzso zzso produces lung and circulatory system zzso Overall, available data suggest that these metals or zzso are capable of biologically altering several cellular defense mechanisms involved in the zzso process and that further studies are needed to determine the associated zzso
