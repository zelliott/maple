The ability of zzso cells to develop resistance to zzso drugs poses a major obstacle to the ultimate success of cancer zzso While some mechanisms of resistance allow cells to survive exposure to a single agent, the phenomenon of zzso resistance zzso zzso upon cells the ability to withstand exposure to lethal doses of many structurally unrelated zzso zzso zzso has been strongly linked to the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso which appears to play a role in drug zzso However, several lines of evidence suggest that other mechanisms of resistance are involved in zzso zzso similarities observed in a human breast cancer cell line after the acquisition of zzso and in zzso rat zzso zzso zzso indicate that changes in regulation of phase I and phase II zzso zzso may also play a role in zzso An zzso pattern of zzso has been characterized and related to altered zzso zzso Improvement in current cancer chemotherapy may be achieved by interfering with the regulation and expression of mechanisms of zzso
