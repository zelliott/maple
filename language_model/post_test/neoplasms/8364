An optimal treatment temperature choice is based on a compromise between the higher values desirable for best zzso effects between heat and drugs and the lower values required to avoid drug zzso and tissue zzso zzso uniformity throughout the limb under treatment favors approaching the highest temperature compatible with the above zzso Several modifications have been introduced in the methodology during our experience consisting of more than 100 zzso The induction of true zzso temperatures zzso degrees zzso is achieved both heating the zzso and directly heating the limb by means of a warm-water circulation blanket, thus insuring an optimal zzso flow to the superficial zzso Devices in the zzso circuit have also been adopted to obtain a fast and accurate zzso temperature zzso The following results can be zzso zzso a short delay time is required to reach the therapeutic temperature zzso zzso the zzso temperature is maintained at a value close to 40 zzso zzso degrees C during the whole zzso phase of the zzso zzso the various districts of the limb are maintained at substantially homogeneous zzso zzso
