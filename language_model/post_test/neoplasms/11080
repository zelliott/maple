The zzso effects of zzso an active ingredient isolated from soft coral zzso zzso on zzso cells were investigated in this zzso In the zzso zzso for cell zzso increasing zzso of zzso decreased zzso cell zzso When a concentration of zzso zzso of zzso was applied, the zzso cells viability was reduced to a level of zzso of the control zzso The wound healing function decreased as the concentration of zzso zzso The results in this study indicated that treatment with zzso for 6 h significantly induced both early and late zzso of zzso cells, observed by flow zzso measurement and microscopic fluorescent zzso A comparative zzso analysis was conducted to investigate the effects of zzso on zzso cells at the molecular level by comparison between the protein profiling zzso on a zzso zzso of zzso cells treated with zzso and that of zzso cells without the zzso A total of 28 differential proteins (12 zzso and 16 zzso in zzso cells treated with zzso have been identified by zzso zzso Some of the differential proteins are associated with cell zzso zzso protein zzso protein zzso and energy zzso The results of this study provided clues for the investigation of zzso mechanisms of the zzso effects of zzso on zzso cells and could be valuable information for drug development and progression monitoring of oral zzso cell zzso zzso
