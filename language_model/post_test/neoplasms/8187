Few data on cancer mortality have been published for Mexico over the last few zzso It is therefore of interest to conduct a systematic and updated analysis of cancer mortality in this zzso 

zzso zzso zzso mortality rates, at all ages and truncated at age zzso years, from major zzso and all zzso combined were zzso on the basis of certified deaths derived from the World Health Organization database for the period zzso 

zzso rates for all zzso showed an upward trend in men of all ages (from zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso and in middle-aged men (from zzso to zzso zzso This reflects the rise until the early 1990s in lung cancer mortality (from zzso in zzso to zzso in zzso and prostate cancer (from zzso to zzso zzso In women, overall mortality rates showed an increase between the early 1970s zzso and the late 1990s zzso Total cancer mortality rates remained low, however, compared with other American countries zzso zzso men and zzso women in 1999 in the United zzso zzso rates were stable zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso although they were much higher than overall rates, reflecting zzso high rates for zzso zzso zzso cancer mortality in middle-aged women zzso in zzso 

Total cancer mortality in Mexico has remained comparably low on a worldwide scale, and the upward trends in mortality rates for lung and other zzso zzso have tended to level off over the last zzso However, steady rises have been observed for other major zzso including prostate and zzso zzso cancer remains a major health problem in zzso
