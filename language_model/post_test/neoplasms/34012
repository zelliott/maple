To evaluate the feasibility of reduced intensity stem cell transplantation zzso with bone zzso from a matched unrelated donor zzso we zzso investigated 20 patients with zzso disorders who received zzso in the Tokyo zzso consortium from January 2000 to October zzso The zzso regimens were zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso To enhance zzso zzso zzso zzso and 4 or 8 zzso total body zzso zzso were added to these regimens in nine and 11 patients, zzso zzso prophylaxis was zzso with or without zzso In all, 19 achieved primary zzso Three developed graft failure (one primary, two zzso and five died of zzso mortality within 100 days of zzso Seven of the 19 patients who achieved initial zzso developed grade zzso acute zzso and seven of 13 patients who survived zzso days developed chronic zzso At a median follow-up of zzso months, estimated zzso overall survival was zzso Compared with a zzso regimen, an zzso regimen was associated with a high risk of graft failure (30 vs zzso zzso This study supports the feasibility of zzso from zzso however, zzso zzso remain significant in its application to zzso
