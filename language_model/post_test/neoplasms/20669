Malignancies are among the most common causes of death in zzso The present study was undertaken to evaluate and compare bone zzso aspiration and unilateral biopsy to detect bone zzso zzso in pediatric patients, using bilateral biopsy as the gold zzso 

During a zzso period, 63 consecutive newly diagnosed children with confirmed zzso diseases other than leukemia were evaluated for bone zzso zzso or zzso zzso were obtained from both right and left zzso zzso zzso whereas aspiration was performed only at the right zzso zzso to the zzso biopsy was considered as the unilateral biopsy result, whereas the bilateral biopsy result was as zzso positively was accepted if one or both of the zzso samples were qualified as positive, while a negative result was considered only if both sides were zzso The bilateral biopsy was considered the gold standard, and sensitivity, zzso positive and negative zzso value, and false positive and negative rates were zzso for the unilateral biopsy and aspiration zzso 

We identified bone zzso zzso in 11 zzso zzso The sensitivity was the only significant difference zzso zzso observed between unilateral biopsy and zzso Finally, of the 63 patients, unilateral biopsy was reported as inadequate in one patient zzso while aspiration was inadequate in two zzso 

zzso biopsy was better than bone zzso zzso However, because bilateral biopsy is the gold standard, we recommend using this and bone zzso aspiration simultaneously to evaluate a pediatric patient with any zzso potentially zzso bone zzso
