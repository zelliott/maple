zzso of the DNA damage checkpoint zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso arrest and proper DNA zzso However, zzso is also essential for zzso cell division in the absence of zzso zzso Here, we investigate the zzso potential of a zzso zzso independent of chemotherapy, and explore a possible cellular context underlying sensitivity to zzso zzso We show that zzso a potent and selective zzso inhibitor of zzso is zzso across a broad panel of tumor cell lines and zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso DNA damage occurs without added chemotherapy or radiation in zzso cells and relies on active DNA zzso At tolerated doses, zzso treatment leads to zzso tumor growth zzso or zzso To begin addressing potential response markers for zzso zzso we focused on zzso a zzso functionally related to zzso zzso of zzso lowers the zzso of zzso by zzso but has no effect on the zzso response to other zzso zzso In addition, zzso of zzso increases markers of DNA damage, zzso and zzso induced by zzso In a post hoc analysis of zzso cell lines treated with zzso we found that expression of zzso was below average in zzso of the 33 most sensitive cell zzso Our findings provide rationale for zzso zzso as a potent zzso therapy independent of a zzso partner and suggest that low zzso expression could serve as an enrichment zzso for zzso zzso
