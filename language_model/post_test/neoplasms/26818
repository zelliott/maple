The zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene has been extensively studied for associations with zzso however, results from replication studies have been zzso The aim of this investigation was to determine links with risk of cancer by zzso 

We searched zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso databases, covering all zzso studies until March, zzso zzso analyses were performed using the zzso zzso zzso 

A total of 11 zzso studies met our inclusion criteria, including zzso cases and zzso zzso The results indicated that the zzso zzso gene zzso had no association with cancer risk overall zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso However, in the zzso analysis by ethnicity, a decrease of cancer risk was found in Asian populations zzso zzso zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

This zzso suggested that the zzso zzso of zzso gene is associated with risk of cancer among Asian, but not in Caucasian zzso
