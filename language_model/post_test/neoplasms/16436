Heat shock protein 27 zzso belongs to the group of proteins called molecular zzso protecting normal and zzso cells against many zzso such as zzso several commonly used zzso as well as other zzso zzso Our study was designed to determine whether heat shock and drugs like zzso zzso and zzso have an effect on the expression of heat shock protein 27 in zzso cells such zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and also in normal human skin zzso zzso cultured in two-dimensional zzso and three-dimensional zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso expression is zzso and zzso specific and depends on the culture model as zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell cultured in zzso model appeared to be more resistant to zzso or zzso effects of the applied drugs than cells cultured in zzso zzso Only zzso cells cultured in zzso culture model appeared to be more susceptible and reacted to drugs and heat treatment with increased zzso zzso
