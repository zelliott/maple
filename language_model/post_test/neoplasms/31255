Since the first identification of zzso cells by zzso and zzso in 1973, progress in understanding their biology has included the development of novel methods of cell culture, recognition of critical aspects of migration and zzso and appreciation of their major role as zzso cells zzso and how this activity is regulated by zzso and expression of accessory zzso zzso cells are the major zzso involved in the initiation of the immune response and the development of zzso There is considerable evidence that they can acquire zzso in the peripheral zzso and process, zzso and present it to T cells in secondary zzso zzso A number of studies show that, in zzso or in zzso zzso zzso cells can directly sensitize T cells and stimulate the development of zzso immune responses, including both protective and therapeutic zzso zzso In this paper, several important aspects of zzso cell biology are discussed and a number of studies confirming the role of these professional zzso in zzso immunity are zzso
