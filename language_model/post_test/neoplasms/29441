zzso zzso and long-term cancer risks with zzso therapies is a concern, and led to a recent black box zzso This zzso requested by the European zzso Agency, aimed at better assessing short-term risks by using zzso techniques based on individual patient data from all zzso zzso controlled trials zzso of zzso zzso and zzso 

All 74 zzso of zzso zzso of at least 4 weeks duration were provided to independent investigators, including case narratives for events occurring between trial start until 30 days after planned end of treatment and indicating a possible zzso Relative risks were estimated using zzso zzso exponential zzso 

One hundred thirty zzso of zzso individuals zzso to zzso therapy were diagnosed with cancer, compared to 48 zzso of zzso individuals zzso to zzso The relative risks associated with all zzso were zzso zzso zzso for zzso excluding zzso skin cancer zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso There were indications of differences in the relative risks for the three zzso drugs, but also of differences across the cancer rates in the three zzso arms for zzso zzso and zzso 

Despite a reassuring overall short-term risk, we could neither zzso nor verify that individual zzso therapies affect the short-term clinical emergence of zzso Despite representing the best available evidence, statistical precision, and differences in baseline cancer risk and reporting detail between trials of zzso zzso and zzso hampered distinction of zzso from trial effects, illustrating the challenges in zzso using zzso zzso zzso risk assessment requires zzso zzso
