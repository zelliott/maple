zzso is a member of the inhibitor of zzso protein family and has an essential role in zzso zzso is zzso in a large variety of human zzso and represents an attractive target for cancer zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso human tumors in particular exhibit high levels of zzso The zzso protein forms zzso through a zzso region that is critical for zzso zzso and biological functions of the zzso We identified small molecules that target a specific cavity adjacent to the zzso zzso zzso zzso a lead compound identified in the screen, can bind to the zzso protein at the intended target zzso Moreover, zzso alters zzso formation, causing zzso arrest and cell death, and zzso tumor growth in zzso and in zzso Cell death occurs in zzso stage following zzso arrest and is not a consequence of general zzso Thus, the study zzso a novel therapeutic target site in the zzso protein and provides a promising strategy to develop a new class of therapeutic small molecules for the treatment of human zzso
