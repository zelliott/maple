We previously reported that zzso zzso by donor zzso T cell 1 zzso cells was the most important factor in promoting zzso (an zzso zzso the zzso zzso rejection in zzso In this study, we show that the ability of the host to respond to zzso zzso is critical for promoting acute tumor zzso while host production of zzso is not zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells divide rapidly in secondary zzso zzso indicating no zzso in rate of cell zzso However, zzso zzso cells accumulate to significantly greater numbers in the tumor than deficient zzso zzso zzso injected with zzso zzso zzso had more T cells within the tumor at day 4, had higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had greater numbers of zzso and zzso cells within the zzso and had massive regions of tumor cell zzso as compared with zzso knockout zzso zzso zzso NO has a zzso effect on zzso growth in zzso and NO is important for tumor zzso by day zzso These observations are compatible with a model in which the donor zzso zzso zzso expand rapidly in the host, migrate to the tumor site, and induce the zzso of a number of zzso that in turn recruit host cells that then attack the zzso
