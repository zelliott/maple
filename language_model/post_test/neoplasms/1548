To assess whether publicly zzso adult cancer trials satisfy the uncertainty principle, which states that physicians should enroll a patient in a trial only if they are substantially uncertain which of the treatments in the trial is most appropriate for the zzso This principle is violated if trials systematically zzso either the experimental or the standard zzso 

zzso cohort study of completed cancer trials, with zzso as the unit of zzso 

Two cooperative research groups in the United zzso 

93 phase III zzso trials zzso zzso that completed recruitment of patients between 1981 and zzso 

Whether the zzso zzso the experimental treatment, the standard treatment, or neither zzso effect size zzso of the experimental treatment compared with outcome of the standard zzso for each zzso 

Three zzso zzso zzso the standard treatment, 70 zzso found no significant difference between treatments, and 30 zzso zzso the experimental zzso The average effect size was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso reflecting a slight advantage for the experimental zzso 

In cooperative group trials in adults with cancer, there is a measurable average improvement in disease control associated with assignment to the experimental rather than the standard zzso However, the zzso of outcomes and the small magnitude of the advantage suggest that, as a group, these trials satisfy the uncertainty zzso
