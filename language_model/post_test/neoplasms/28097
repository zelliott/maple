zzso zzso cell zzso function has been described previously in cancer patients and zzso zzso It can be an important factor in the escape of tumors from immune system zzso However, the mechanism and clinical significance of this phenomenon remain zzso Here, 93 patients with breast, head and neck, and lung cancer were zzso The function of peripheral blood and tumor draining zzso zzso zzso was equally impaired in cancer patients, consistent with a systemic rather than a local effect of tumor on zzso The number of zzso was dramatically reduced in the peripheral blood of cancer zzso This decrease was associated with the zzso of cells lacking markers of mature zzso zzso The presence of these immature cells was closely associated with the stage and duration of the zzso zzso removal of tumor resulted in partial reversal of the observed zzso The presence of immature cells in the peripheral blood of cancer patients was closely associated with an increased plasma level of vascular zzso growth factor but not zzso 6, zzso zzso zzso factor, zzso zzso factor, zzso 10, or transforming growth zzso and was decreased in lung cancer patients receiving therapy with zzso zzso growth factor zzso These data indicate that defective DC function in cancer patients is the result of decreased numbers of competent zzso and the zzso of immature zzso This effect may have significant clinical zzso
