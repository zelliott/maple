zzso cells that are found in solid tumors are resistant to zzso drugs and radiation zzso Thus, for effective zzso chemotherapy, it is important to identify drugs with selective toxicity towards hypoxic zzso The recent development of new drugs that are toxic only when activated in the hypoxic cell opens a new era of cancer zzso Recently, we evaluated the zzso toxicity of four differently zzso zzso zzso zzso in human cancer zzso These compounds were zzso by the Beirut zzso The various zzso were found to exert potent hypoxic zzso activities against human colon cancer cells zzso and to possess a zzso fold greater zzso under zzso compared to zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso ratio zzso ratio between drug concentration in air and in zzso to give zzso cell zzso of these compounds was found to depend on the nature of the zzso on the zzso zzso zzso Because of their differential hypoxic zzso these drugs could provide useful therapeutic agents against solid zzso zzso we are investigating the selective zzso of zzso for hypoxic cells in tumors in zzso and their ability to zzso zzso tumor cell zzso We will also study their in zzso zzso activity and their mechanism of action at the molecular zzso The deciphering of the mechanism of action of zzso may allow us to ultimately recommend their use as therapeutic agents against human zzso
