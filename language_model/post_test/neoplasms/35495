zzso a synthetic zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso vascular zzso cell proliferation and migration along with induction of zzso in zzso zzso Here we report on the in zzso characterization of zzso zzso and use of the artificial zzso gene for gene therapy zzso zzso growth of human zzso zzso zzso in zzso mice was inhibited by zzso when treated with zzso zzso zzso analysis of the tumors showed an approximate zzso reduction of zzso density, suggesting that zzso zzso is the cause of the zzso zzso Furthermore, there was a significant correlation between the gene expression patterns of 16 zzso factors after treatment with both zzso and synthetic zzso To validate the zzso of the zzso gene for gene therapy, stable zzso of zzso zzso melanoma cells expressing zzso zzso were zzso zzso of these cells inhibited zzso cell proliferation in zzso Furthermore, after subcutaneous injection of these cells in zzso mice, an extensive delay in tumor growth was zzso These data show that the artificial zzso gene can be used to produce a zzso protein with similar activity as its synthetic counterpart and that the gene can be applied in gene therapy approaches for cancer zzso
