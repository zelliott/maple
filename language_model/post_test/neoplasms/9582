To increase the chance for a zzso cancer must be detected as early as zzso This can be achieved with zzso diagnostic zzso For a further increase of the diagnostic accuracy of these methods we introduced the zzso cell analysis, zzso cells on the slide have to be zzso to enable successive analysis of identical cells in different zzso For practical reasons the zzso step must be zzso 

For a fully automatic acquisition of successive cell images we use a passive zzso that is zzso to the material, zzso to the cells, followed by a comparison of the scenes, zzso the cell zzso of two such obtained images from different zzso In case that no zzso match can be found the search is extended to the surrounding zzso A set of zzso scenes from seven specimens have been subject to our zzso The automatically zzso and acquired images from a second stain have been manually compared to the images from a first zzso 

An overall zzso rate of zzso is zzso zzso of the images could not be zzso and are lost for the following diagnostic process, while the critical case of erroneously matched images was observed in only zzso of zzso 

We could show that it is possible to automatically acquire images of successive zzso of identical cells on zzso zzso The method presented achieves acceptable zzso zzso Wrong image acquisitions are very rare and can mostly be ascribed to images with single cells, zzso without scene zzso
