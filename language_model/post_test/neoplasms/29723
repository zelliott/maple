We have adapted an zzso zzso flow zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the simultaneous measurement of three independent zzso and cell zzso This has been accomplished by the addition of a third zzso tube and the development of a new electronic cell volume zzso flow zzso zzso are first analyzed as they pass through the 100 U zzso zzso and are then excited approximately 15 zzso later by the 365 zzso mercury are beam reflected by a 400 zzso zzso zzso Independent blue, green and red signals can be associated by a delay circuit to the zzso signal from the same zzso We have developed this system as an aid in the analysis of tumor cell and zzso zzso and zzso The choice of stain combinations to be used is extremely flexible and permits the analysis of a wide range of zzso activities in conjunction with zzso and zzso zzso Data presented indicates the value of this approach in identifying the presence of zzso zzso activity in both tumor and inflammatory cells within a zzso zzso as well as the quantitative expression of a number of markers of zzso zzso Although the described techniques have been developed on a mercury arc zzso they can be used equally well with cell zzso
