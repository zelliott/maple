An investigation of zzso deaths occurring among zzso patients surviving at least five years after the diagnosis of childhood cancer in Britain before 1971 has been zzso Of the zzso with sufficient information the numbers of deaths attributable to the following causes were: zzso zzso 550 zzso a second primary zzso 61 zzso a medical condition related to treatment of the zzso 49 zzso an traumatic death unrelated to the zzso or its treatment, 34 zzso finally, any other cause unrelated to the zzso or its treatment, 44 zzso Less than zzso of five year survivors of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or a soft tissue zzso died of zzso zzso during the next 15 years, while more than zzso of five year survivors of Hodgkin's disease, zzso zzso and Ewing's zzso died of zzso zzso during the corresponding zzso Almost 50% of five year survivors of acute zzso zzso died of zzso disease during the corresponding 15 years, a large proportion of deaths being due to central nervous system zzso in an era before central nervous system prophylaxis was routinely zzso zzso of the mortality observed with that expected from mortality rates in the general population indicated three times the expected number of deaths from zzso zzso Five times the expected number of deaths from cardiovascular causes were observed, these were predominantly zzso zzso and cerebrovascular zzso There was no evidence of an excess in the number of zzso observed, but there were three times the expected number of deaths from accidents observed after central nervous system zzso Two groups of patients were identified whose deaths were potentially zzso Seven patients with zzso and zzso presented with zzso crises during periods of stress not adequately covered by zzso zzso In the other group were children who received zzso and later developed problems related to radiation zzso We emphasize that our investigation relates to patients diagnosed with childhood cancer before zzso The pattern of mortality that will emerge after recent treatment regimens, in which chemotherapy is being used more zzso is likely to be different from that observed in our zzso
