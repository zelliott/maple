zzso specific signal zzso zzso are being developed as zzso agents against an array of molecular targets, with the promise of increased selectivity and lower toxicity than classic zzso chemotherapy zzso zzso and its zzso are a promising class of novel zzso that specifically inhibit signaling from the zzso zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso is a key zzso in multiple zzso signaling pathways and plays a central role in modulating proliferation and zzso in normal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and is approved for clinical use as an zzso following kidney zzso zzso of zzso signaling has been implicated in zzso and promising zzso studies in several tumor types suggest that the zzso and zzso properties of zzso may be useful in cancer zzso These studies have led to several clinical trials evaluating the safety and efficacy of zzso zzso in cancer zzso The goal of this article is to review the mechanism of action of zzso as an zzso agent, and to review the clinical experience with zzso and zzso zzso as zzso and zzso therapeutic zzso
