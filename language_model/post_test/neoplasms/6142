According to the International Conference on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bridging studies can be applied to support pediatric drug zzso However, for zzso studies in infants and children the sampling schedule needs to be zzso to minimize the number of blood samples per zzso 

The aim of this study was to describe how clinical trial simulations zzso based on adult data were used to select an appropriate zzso schedule for a future pediatric population zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso model for zzso zzso was developed using data from a phase I study in zzso This model was used for zzso to select the most appropriate zzso schedule that met zzso acceptance zzso This sampling schedule was applied in a pediatric clinical phase zzso zzso zzso zzso modeling was used for zzso modeling and zzso 

An appropriate sampling schedule requiring only three blood samples per patient was selected and successfully applied in a pediatric study with a zzso standard dose of zzso zzso A zzso analysis was performed to determine individual zzso parameters in the pediatric study zzso 

A zzso evaluation of selected sampling schedules by simulation from adult data provides a useful tool for efficient planning of pediatric zzso
