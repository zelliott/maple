The effect of zzso zzso of zzso fluorescent zzso zzso zzso probe zzso has been previously reported and used for tumor zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso can be detected zzso in zzso at the cellular zzso A zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was performed in zzso animals injected with zzso In zzso zzso of tumor cells in zzso tissue layers (up to 160 zzso showed a strong zzso zzso effect in zzso zzso This observation was zzso by flow zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of zzso zzso Both zzso zzso total) and zzso zzso total) populations contained zzso zzso The zzso cells were confirmed to be host mouse cells by the absence of rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cells zzso had seven times higher zzso intensity than the majority of zzso or zzso cells zzso and 55 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso and zzso Our results indicate that: 1) zzso zzso can be zzso in zzso at the cellular level using zzso zzso 2) zzso cells of zzso origin participate most actively in zzso and degradation of zzso zzso zzso
