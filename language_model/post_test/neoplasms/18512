A series of novel zzso have been zzso and their interactions with zzso zzso have been measured by zzso zzso Energy Transfer zzso melting and Fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso A few of these compounds exhibit stabilization of zzso that is comparable to other benchmark zzso zzso with fair to excellent zzso zzso duplex selectivity and significant zzso towards zzso zzso The nature of the zzso zzso along with side chain length zzso the zzso stabilization ability of the zzso In addition, we demonstrate that there is a strong correlation between the ability of the compounds to stabilize the same zzso sequence in zzso and zzso conditions and a strong correlation between the ability of the compounds to stabilize different zzso sequences in zzso or zzso zzso
