The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso amplified or zzso in various human zzso tumors, and is associated with tumor aggressiveness and therapy zzso zzso zzso provides a survival advantage for cells in the tumor zzso In the current study, we assessed the potential of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in treatment of zzso expressing zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso survival, proliferation zzso and in zzso tumor growth were used to assess this zzso 

We show that zzso zzso zzso are sensitive to zzso treatment and are zzso to zzso by zzso zzso In zzso zzso a correlation between zzso and expression of the zzso marker zzso is observed, suggesting a role for zzso in zzso expressing zzso This observation was substantiated in cell lines, showing high zzso expressing cells to be more sensitive to zzso addition as reflected by decreased proliferation and zzso zzso high zzso expressing cells display a lower zzso zzso 

The zzso high expressing cells and tumors investigated in this study are highly dependent on zzso for growth and zzso zzso of zzso may therefore provide a novel treatment opportunity for zzso zzso zzso
