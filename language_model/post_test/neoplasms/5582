zzso are key structures in zzso zzso In this study we examined the effect of zzso essential fatty acids on the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the formation of zzso in zzso negative human breast, colon and lung cancer cells and melanoma zzso zzso zzso revealed that cells cultured with gamma zzso acid zzso showed increased zzso zzso together with an increase in the formation of zzso zzso Western zzso studies of cellular proteins demonstrated that, following culture with fatty zzso zzso expression was zzso with the greatest increase seen after zzso zzso Other fatty acids increased zzso zzso but to a lesser zzso It is concluded that zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso in human cancer cells, particularly in cells without zzso
