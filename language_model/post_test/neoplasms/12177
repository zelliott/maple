The zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso bacterial species are compared step by zzso An zzso for the existence of these individual steps is considered in connection with the development of zzso The transformations of zzso cells occur in particular in the type IV zzso system, zzso involving the simultaneous transmission of DNA and protein from bacterial cells to zzso zzso Thus, zzso cells facilitate the indefinite growth of tissue cells and additionally produce growth factors, triggering further bacterial zzso The higher numbers of bacteria then produce more zzso and the cycle repeats as long as the host zzso The main limiting factor is the frequency of bacterial infection, while the secondary zzso factors are the levels of transforming growth factors and factors triggering bacteria zzso 

zzso processes are probably responsible for the tumor induction by the three different bacterial zzso however, the critical points for zzso are zzso The early zzso or limitation of zzso zzso or zzso zzso can prevent zzso stomach cancer and zzso cell zzso The crown zzso formation by zzso zzso can only be avoided by prevention of the transforming activity of a single bacterial zzso Questions arise as to what is common in the three zzso and the nature of the zzso step in the three different zzso The frequency of transformation is the zzso step, but the zzso of the zzso complex is common in the three zzso
