To evaluate the cancer risk in southern European men with, or at risk of, zzso zzso 

An analysis of zzso data to assess zzso rare zzso 

Data from a cohort of zzso zzso and from two zzso zzso zzso zzso were combined and zzso The number of cancer cases observed was compared with the expected number, obtained from cancer zzso rates among men in the general zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso and their zzso confidence intervals zzso were zzso 

A total of zzso zzso of observation were accumulated among zzso men, and zzso zzso among zzso zzso Among zzso men, statistically significant increased zzso were seen for Hodgkin's disease zzso zzso zzso zzso liver cancer zzso zzso zzso and cancer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An excess of lung cancer was seen among intravenous drug users zzso but not among homosexual zzso When the risk of all zzso zzso was considered, zzso men had a nearly twofold excess zzso zzso zzso A risk of similar magnitude emerged among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso largely attributable to lung cancer and zzso 

These findings confirm that zzso infection increases the risk of zzso whereas they suggest that the risk of zzso zzso may also be enhanced by zzso zzso The observation of an elevated risk of lung cancer in both zzso and zzso zzso points to personal zzso unrelated to zzso zzso
