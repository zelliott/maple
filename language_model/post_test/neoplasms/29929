zzso of T cell growth factor zzso of zzso media from zzso zzso cultures of peripheral zzso cells zzso were compared among patients with cancer, patients with zzso disease and normal zzso In nine out of 10 cases of cancer with zzso (including extensive zzso to surrounding zzso the activities were much lower than normal zzso whereas in four out of five cases of cancer without zzso the activities were almost the same as those of normal zzso The low activities of zzso from patients with zzso cancer were not due to the older age of patients, nor did it seem to be attributed to the zzso state of zzso When we examined the activity using zzso zzso instead of the whole zzso the activities in patients with zzso cancer rose up to almost the normal zzso In normal persons the decline of the activities after 3 days of culture were not observed after the removal of adherent zzso Our data indicate that the adherent cells have a zzso effect on zzso production in both normal persons and cancer patients, but that the effect may be exaggerated in patients with zzso zzso
