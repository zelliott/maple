zzso zzso are a new class of negative regulators that repress gene expression by pairing with their target zzso zzso zzso There are hundreds of zzso coded in the human zzso and thousands of target zzso participating in a wide variety of zzso processes such as development and cell zzso It is therefore not surprising that several recent reports involved zzso zzso in the complex mechanism of human zzso and proposed them as new key regulators to correct the unbalanced expression of zzso and zzso zzso genes exhibited in cancer zzso This review zzso most of the recent patents related to the use of zzso signatures in cancer diagnosis and zzso the detection and profiling of zzso from zzso samples and the identification of zzso and zzso zzso genes targeted by zzso as well as new cancer therapies based on zzso zzso
