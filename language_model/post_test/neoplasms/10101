The plant derived zzso zzso zzso was investigated for its zzso properties in 12 human zzso cell lines and in primary cultures of zzso cells from zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to assess zzso and DNA zzso analysis to evaluate gene zzso zzso mean zzso in the cell line panel was zzso zzso compared with zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and solid zzso zzso zzso Among patient solid zzso samples, those from breast cancer were the most sensitive and essentially as sensitive as zzso zzso zzso activity showed highest correlations to zzso II and zzso targeting zzso In the cell lines zzso activity was essentially unaffected by established mechanisms of drug zzso A number of genes were identified as associated with zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso shows interesting in zzso zzso properties and its further evaluation as an zzso drug seems zzso
