zzso labeling of zzso zzso depends on a number of key factors, mostly related to the characteristics of the zzso itself and to the manner of its incorporation into the zzso Such factors include the physical zzso the zzso or particle energy of the zzso and its selective deposition of energy in zzso the method of labeling used zzso binding or zzso and the effect that the chemical changes inherent in the labeling process may have on the properties of the protein or of its zzso The major biological factor in determining the zzso of choice for labeling is the projected use of the labeled zzso When the intended use is zzso then what is required is zzso density for achieving the high resolution needed for imaging, whereas therapeutic use requires zzso with high energy deposition at the target sites, zzso beta or alpha zzso A further consideration is to be given to the mode of administration of the zzso zzso zzso determination of the zzso parameters of zzso models of zzso of the labeled zzso zzso and/or its fragments may also assist in selecting which zzso may be best to use for zzso a given zzso zzso intended for either tumor diagnosis, prognosis and/or zzso
