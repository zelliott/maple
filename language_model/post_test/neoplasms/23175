zzso zzso known to have potential therapeutic benefits on particular cancer types as zzso may also function as zzso zzso with promising therapeutic value for diverse zzso This recently recognized biological activity was attributed to their capacity to zzso the function of various zzso as biological targets in zzso Although the zzso activity on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is important in determining the zzso potential of compounds for zzso drug design and development, to date, there are no successful zzso of this zzso Moreover, there are only a few studies about the effects of zzso derivatives on zzso zzso and various zzso In this study, four novel zzso compounds, zzso zzso and their zzso zzso were zzso and evaluated for their biological zzso Here, among the compounds zzso one of them was identified with strong zzso zzso zzso and two with dual activity for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results revealed that zzso derivatives may be employed as potential zzso to prevent zzso drug resistance and identified as prospective zzso agents with dual activity on both zzso zzso and zzso zzso
