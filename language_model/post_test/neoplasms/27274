zzso cells zzso such as zzso cells zzso are the key component of many cancer zzso zzso However, zzso comprise a rare population of clinically zzso cells and are compromised in function in zzso zzso Clinical trials therefore rely upon DC generated ex zzso The authors hypothesized that systemic administration of zzso zzso factor zzso plus zzso zzso might lead to the differentiation of DC from their precursors and enhance their number and function in zzso as it does in zzso zzso with advanced zzso were treated in this phase I, multiple zzso zzso trial combining zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso A cycle consisted of 14 days of zzso therapy and 14 days of observation zzso zzso or alternating zzso treatment and observation periods zzso zzso zzso were followed clinically to determine a zzso tolerated dose zzso and complimentary in zzso studies were performed to determine a biologically active dose zzso zzso subjects received treatment on this zzso zzso Treatment was well tolerated and generally characterized by Grade 1 and 2 zzso related zzso The zzso was determined to be zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Treatment in cohort D zzso zzso zzso plus zzso zzso zzso was well tolerated and resulted in a zzso zzso zzso plus zzso provides a mechanism for increasing the number and function of zzso in cancer zzso Future clinical applications of this strategy are numerous and include the potential as a strong vaccine zzso
