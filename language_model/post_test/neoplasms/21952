The effect of dietary zzso in the form of zzso zzso was investigated on zzso zzso zzso cancer in F1 generation female Sprague zzso rats from parents who had undergone lifetime exposure to variable levels of dietary zzso In comparison to zzso dietary groups, lifetime exposure of F1 rats to 40 and 1000 zzso diets of zzso reduced tumor zzso but did not significantly affect tumor zzso tumor size, or tumor zzso A significantly lower tumor zzso was, however, observed in rats fed the zzso zzso diet compared to the zzso zzso zzso An evaluation of a zzso relationship pointed towards a zzso effect, with a trend showing lower tumor zzso lower tumor zzso and lower tumor size in rats fed 1000 zzso diet zzso compared to 40 zzso diet zzso however, the data failed to achieve statistical zzso zzso tumor type significantly differed according to the administered zzso diet variety and zzso zzso Our data and that of others provide conflicting evidence for zzso effects of soy zzso on zzso zzso tumor zzso We suggest zzso of zzso experimental approaches for establishing low zzso relationships for soy and its zzso to aid in risk zzso
