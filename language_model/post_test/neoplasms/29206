The nature of the zzso relationship has a profound influence on risk zzso Several arguments have been proffered as to why all zzso relationships for both cancer and zzso zzso should be assumed to be linear at low zzso We focused on three arguments that have been put forth for zzso First, the general zzso argument proposes that if an agent enhances an already existing zzso process, then even small zzso increase disease zzso in a linear zzso This only holds if it is related to a specific mode of action that has zzso zzso that would not be expected for most zzso zzso Second, the zzso in the zzso argument states that variations in sensitivity among members of the target population tend to zzso out and zzso the zzso curve, but this actually only tends to zzso not zzso the zzso zzso Third, it has been argued that a review of zzso evidence shows linear or zzso effects at low zzso in humans, despite zzso zzso in the experimental dose range in animal testing for similar zzso It is more likely that this is attributable to exposure measurement error rather than a true zzso zzso Assuming that every chemical is toxic at high zzso and linear at low zzso does not zzso to modern-day scientific knowledge of zzso There is no compelling evidence-based justification for a general zzso zzso rather, zzso zzso arguments are zzso
