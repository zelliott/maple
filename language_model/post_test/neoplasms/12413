Cancer is rare before age 20 zzso We aimed to use the European database of childhood and adolescent cancer cases, within the zzso Childhood Cancer Information System project, to estimate patterns and trends of zzso and survival within zzso 

zzso high-quality data from 63 European zzso cancer zzso consisted of zzso zzso in children and zzso in adolescents diagnosed in zzso zzso rates and survival were compared by region zzso vs zzso period, and zzso zzso 

In the 1990s, zzso zzso rates were 140 per million for children zzso zzso and 157 per million for ages zzso zzso Over the three decades, overall zzso increased by zzso per year zzso in children zzso for most zzso zzso and by zzso zzso in adolescents zzso years; notable increases were recorded for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso survival for children in the 1990s was zzso in the east and zzso in the west, with differences between regions for virtually all zzso zzso zzso survival was much the same in zzso Survival has improved dramatically since the 1970s in children and zzso more so in the west than in the zzso 

Our results are clear evidence of an increase of cancer zzso in childhood and adolescence during the past decades, and of an acceleration of this zzso zzso and zzso patterns suggest areas for further study into causes of these zzso as well as providing an indicator of progress of zzso policy in zzso
