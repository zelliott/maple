Cellular zzso of solid tumors can be divided into compartments based upon their degree of zzso and their rate of zzso Based upon these considerations, combinations of drugs and other therapeutic zzso can be devised with the potential to eradicate the zzso zzso populations of tumor stem cells present in solid zzso zzso of combinations of drugs or other treatment zzso based upon these concepts makes the inclusion of an agent or agents with the capacity to eliminate hypoxic stem cells mandatory to achieve zzso The zzso zzso agent, zzso C, would appear to be the most zzso agent presently available for this purpose, and it is proposed that this zzso be considered as an addition to therapeutic regimens designed for the treatment of solid zzso To employ this agent in a manner that zzso its toxicity to normal cellular zzso it is necessary to consider that the mechanism by which zzso C exerts its zzso to zzso cells is different from that by which it kills hypoxic zzso zzso C can undergo zzso reduction in the presence of oxygen zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by molecular oxygen can lead to the generation of zzso radical and other toxic zzso species, such as hydrogen zzso and zzso zzso Such zzso reduction and zzso of zzso C by zzso cells may result in the generation of levels of toxic oxygen species that surpass the zzso capacity of cellular scavenging systems, and thereby may be responsible for the toxicity of this zzso to zzso cells in tumors and normal zzso whereas the zzso of zzso C to hypoxic cells may involve the zzso reduction and generation of the zzso zzso zzso species shown in Figure zzso These considerations dictate that to maximize the differential toxicity of an agent such as zzso C to hypoxic cells requires that it be given in relatively low doses, perhaps by constant infusion to maximize its potential for diffusion into zzso masses to reach hypoxic stem zzso
