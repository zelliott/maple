Studies have shown that the immune system can recognize zzso under conditions zzso cell zzso in which the zzso might elaborate zzso zzso danger zzso zzso acid zzso is an zzso danger signal recently identified to be released from dying zzso Prior work has shown that zzso activates immune zzso of both the innate and zzso immune system, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, it was unclear whether zzso could enhance zzso zzso which was examined in this zzso When added to dying tumor cells or with whole protein zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso blocked growth of tumor in subsequent tumor challenge experiments, which depended on zzso but not zzso T zzso zzso derived from zzso animals enhanced tumor growth, suggesting it had little role in the zzso zzso zzso did not signal for zzso expansion or altered zzso zzso zzso zzso with the lack of zzso expansion, when applied to zzso cells, zzso suppressed zzso growth factors but zzso B zzso zzso zzso the nature of zzso danger signals released from dying cells may aid in a better understanding of mechanisms of immune recognition of zzso
