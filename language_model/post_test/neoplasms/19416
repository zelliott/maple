Cancer diseases are the focus of intense research due to their frequent zzso It is known from the literature that serum proteins are changed in the case of zzso zzso Changes of zzso zzso transport efficiency, and binding characteristics can be determined by electron spin resonance zzso zzso The present study zzso the zzso function of zzso with an zzso method using zzso zzso spin probe as reporter zzso and ethanol as modifier of zzso zzso Native and frozen plasma of healthy donors zzso zzso patients with zzso diseases zzso zzso and patients with benign conditions zzso zzso were zzso The global specificity was zzso and the sensitivity zzso In zzso samples of 27 donors, a zzso process could be detected up to 30 months before clinical zzso To zzso different entities of zzso diseases from the zzso zzso zzso neural networks were zzso For 48 female donors with breast cancer, the recognition specificity was zzso Other zzso entities zzso zzso 18 zzso 12 zzso were zzso with zzso between zzso and zzso Should these specificity values be reproduced in larger studies, the described method could be used as a new specific zzso marker for the early detection of zzso zzso Since transmission of cancer via blood zzso cannot be excluded as yet, the described zzso method could also be used as a quality test for plasma zzso
