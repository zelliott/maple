zzso modeling techniques play a relevant role in drug design providing detailed information at zzso level on the zzso zzso zzso and electronic properties of biological systems involved in zzso zzso zzso and supporting commonly used experimental zzso These information are often not accessible to the experimental techniques taken zzso but are of crucial importance for drug zzso Due to the enormous increase of the computer power in the last decades, quantum mechanical zzso or zzso methods have become often used to address biological issues of pharmaceutical zzso providing relevant information for drug zzso Due to their complexity and their size, biological systems are often investigated by means of a mixed zzso zzso approach, which treats at an accurate zzso level a limited chemically relevant portion of the system and at the molecular mechanics zzso level the remaining of the zzso and its zzso This method provides a good compromise between zzso cost and zzso allowing to characterize the properties of the biological system and the zzso energy landscape of the process in study with the accuracy of a zzso zzso In this review, after a brief introduction of zzso and zzso methods, we will discuss few representative examples, taken from our work, of the application of these methods in the study of zzso of pharmaceutical interest, of zzso zzso drugs targeting the DNA as well as of neurodegenerative zzso The information obtained from these studies may provide the basis for a rationale zzso drug design of new and more efficient zzso or zzso
