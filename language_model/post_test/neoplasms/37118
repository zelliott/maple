The dose intensity zzso and the maximum tolerated dose zzso of zzso agents is assumed to be a critical factor for achieving optimal therapeutic zzso Each of these factors may be influenced by the schedule of drug administration, specifically zzso or zzso zzso 

To review the literature for selected zzso drugs to analyze the relative zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso administration zzso 

Clinical reports of zzso and zzso delivery of zzso drugs in the categories of zzso zzso zzso zzso plant zzso and platinum zzso were collected focusing on phase I studies establishing the zzso per cycle and the zzso zzso schedules were defined as continuous zzso administration for more than 24 hours or, in some instances, daily zzso dosing for one hour for 3 to 5 zzso zzso schedules were defined as administration over minutes up to 24 hours and also included daily dosing in some zzso 

For zzso the zzso schedule generally decreases the zzso and zzso relative to zzso administration but for zzso the zzso and zzso both zzso For zzso agents and the platinum zzso the zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso delivery are generally zzso but zzso administration results in a slightly increased zzso for zzso and for zzso the zzso is increased depending upon the duration of the zzso For the antibiotics and the plant zzso the zzso and zzso of zzso administration is variable related to the specific agent and the infusion duration and may be increased, decreased or comparable to the zzso of zzso zzso 

The zzso and zzso for most zzso agents administered by zzso versus zzso schedules is unpredictable and variable and is influenced by the infusion duration and the zzso between treatment cycles (for example three versus four week zzso The zzso and zzso increase substantially with zzso delivery for zzso zzso and zzso (the latter in leukemia zzso and decrease substantially for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso For most other agents and in all four drug categories, the zzso and zzso are relatively comparable although for zzso and zzso the duration of infusion determines whether the zzso and zzso increases, decreases or stays the same relative to zzso zzso The use of zzso may substantially change the zzso and zzso especially for zzso administration since dose limiting toxicity is zzso for many zzso
