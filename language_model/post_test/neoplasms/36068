The aim of the study is to explore the safety of zzso T zzso zzso infusion by zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso virus zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso among advanced cancer zzso 

A total of 27 cancer patients with tumor tissue expression zzso and/or zzso level of zzso were subsequently divided into cohort A and B resulted from the ex zzso expansion number of zzso generated from zzso of specific zzso zzso with zzso T zzso Based on the variations of infused number of specific zzso derived from different yields of individualized patients who had experienced various zzso treatments, we compared the patients of low number of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso cohort A, 6 zzso with those of higher number (above 8 zzso zzso zzso cohort B, 21 zzso to testify the possible adverse reactions caused by amount of infused zzso This study resembled a phase I study aiming for setting up clinical trial of adoptive cellular therapy that zzso comes from conventional zzso zzso 

The results showed that one case from the each cohort had experienced moderate fever, and four cases with fatigue were seen in cohort zzso The symptoms were transient without serious adverse zzso For the consideration of clinical response 2 partial zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 minor zzso and 9 stable disease (40 zzso zzso were observed in 25 patients eligible for zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso were lowered in six zzso During a median follow-up of zzso months, we could not observe severe or chronic adverse reactions related to zzso zzso Meanwhile, the variation of number of zzso infused in this setting did not alter the status of peripheral zzso zzso 

These preliminary data suggest that the zzso zzso is zzso and showed no severe adverse reactions in cancer zzso
