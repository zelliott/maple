zzso is a new zzso for PET imaging of alpha v zzso a zzso involved in a variety of zzso processes including zzso and zzso Our aim was to study the zzso of zzso in zzso 

zzso patients with various tumors zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso breast cancer zzso zzso zzso or head and neck cancer zzso zzso zzso were zzso After injection of zzso zzso of zzso 3 consecutive zzso scans from the zzso to the pelvis were acquired at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso Blood samples zzso zzso 4) for zzso analysis were taken 10, 30, and 120 zzso after zzso The zzso zzso program was used to estimate the absorbed radiation zzso 

zzso zzso liquid zzso of serum revealed that more than zzso of zzso was intact up to 120 zzso after zzso zzso showed rapid clearance from the blood pool and primarily zzso zzso zzso activity in lung and muscle tissue was low zzso injected dose per liter at 71 zzso after injection, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The calculated effective dose was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the highest absorbed radiation dose was in the zzso wall zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso demonstrates high zzso stability, a favorable zzso and a low radiation zzso zzso this zzso can safely be used for zzso imaging of molecular processes involving the alpha v zzso zzso and for the planning and monitoring of therapeutic approaches targeting alpha v zzso
