To investigate whether patients with zzso have an increased risk of zzso prior to and/or around the time of the zzso diagnosis, as suggested by previous zzso 

A total of zzso zzso patients were included in the zzso Ten zzso and zzso controls were selected randomly for each patient from the Danish Central zzso zzso Information on zzso was obtained through the Danish Cancer zzso zzso of zzso before zzso diagnosis among patients and before zzso diagnosis of their matched case among controls zzso zzso was compared by calculation of prevalence odds ratios zzso 

Twenty-six patients were diagnosed with cancer before zzso while zzso controls were diagnosed with cancer before the reference date zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among specific zzso a significantly increased prevalence was found for zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on two patients, who developed zzso cancer zzso years before zzso The overall prevalence of zzso diagnosed zzso years before zzso was not significantly increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but zzso skin cancer occurred with an increased prevalence within this time zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We did not find clear evidence of an increased prevalence of preceding cancer in our zzso zzso indicating that shared risk factors are of minor importance for the excess of zzso that occur in zzso patients after the zzso zzso Furthermore, our current and previously reported zzso analyses do not substantiate that serious zzso play a significant role in the zzso events that trigger development of zzso
