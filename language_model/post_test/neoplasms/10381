The tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso that can initiate zzso through the zzso of their death zzso The ability of TRAIL to selectively induce zzso of transformed or tumor cells but not normal cells promotes the development of zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that the TRAIL zzso can effectively induce cancer cell zzso zzso and ongoing zzso I and II clinical trials using TRAIL are showing clinically promising outcomes without significant zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can all be induced by zzso and/or radiation, which can sensitize cancer cells to zzso Thus, understanding the regulation of the TRAIL zzso zzso can help develop more selective zzso agents for the treatment of human zzso
