The relation between zzso zzso structures and their activity as zzso may be defined and explored by zzso novel head groups zzso linked to zzso zzso zzso zzso that is suitably stable as a precursor for chemical zzso was obtained in high yield from zzso zzso zzso consisting of the various combinations of zzso zzso with zzso zzso were used to zzso mice and subsequently determine zzso and zzso cell immune zzso zzso of 45 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso to an zzso zzso significantly enhanced the zzso T cell response to zzso but diminished the zzso zzso in peripheral zzso zzso consisting of all three zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso zzso resulted in approximately additive zzso T cell responses and also an zzso response not significantly different from the zzso zzso zzso zzso played a role to further enhance the zzso T cell response where the optimum content was zzso zzso zzso giving best protection against solid tumor growth corresponded to the zzso zzso composition that gave highest immune activity in zzso zzso
