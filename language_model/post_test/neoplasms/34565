DNA vaccination has suddenly become a zzso strategy for inducing zzso The molecular precision offered by zzso vaccines, together with the facility to include additional genes to direct and amplify zzso has always been zzso However, the apparent failure to translate operational success in zzso models to the clinic, for reasons that are now rather obvious, reduced initial zzso Recently, novel delivery systems, especially zzso have overcome this zzso zzso Here, we assess the development, current performance and potential of DNA vaccines for the treatment of zzso
