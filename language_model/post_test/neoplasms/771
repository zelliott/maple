Recently, there have been significant advances in our knowledge of stem cells found in zzso that can develop solid zzso In particular, novel stem cell markers have been identified for the first time identifying zzso zzso a required characteristic of a stem zzso The zzso of cancer stem cells has been zzso Current dogma states that they are rare, but novel research has suggested that this may not be the zzso Here, we review the latest literature on stem cells, particularly cancer stem cells within solid zzso We discuss current thinking on how stem cells develop into cancer stem cells and how they protect themselves from doing so and do they express unique markers that can be used to detect stem zzso We attempt to put into perspective these latest advances in stem cell biology and their potential for cancer zzso
