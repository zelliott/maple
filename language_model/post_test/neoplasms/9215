Although the request for zzso is widespread in emergency departments zzso the causes of zzso and their relationship with zzso levels in patients with diagnostic values are zzso 

In this retrospective investigation, the study population consisted of all patients who visited our large urban zzso in the year 2012, for whom a zzso test was requested for excluding or diagnosing zzso zzso zzso Only patients with zzso values zzso were included, regardless of their zzso clinical probability for zzso 

The final study population consisted of zzso zzso A significant positive correlation was found between age and zzso zzso was the most frequent diagnosis zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso heart failure zzso trauma zzso and cancer zzso zzso was higher in patients with zzso than in those with other diagnoses zzso vs zzso zzso The frequency of zzso gradually increased from patients with values zzso to those with zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso As compared with zzso values zzso the zzso zzso for zzso was zzso for values zzso 

These results show that zzso lacks specificity for diagnosing zzso especially in elderly patients admitted to the zzso with significant zzso In older patients, elevated values zzso are more frequently associated with zzso so the use of higher zzso may be zzso
