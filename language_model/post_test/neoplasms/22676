zzso zzso growth factor and its zzso including zzso and zzso are involved in zzso under zzso and zzso zzso Recently, zzso cells were reported to contribute to the zzso growth of zzso zzso However, the role of zzso signaling in solid tumor growth in zzso tissue has not been zzso To investigate how zzso signaling is involved in the proliferation of solid tumors, we implanted tumor cells into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Growth of zzso and zzso but not Lewis lung zzso cell in zzso tissue was significantly decreased in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso tumors was remarkably reduced in zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso lineage cells into zzso and zzso tumors was clearly suppressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were also reduced in zzso zzso zzso However, in the border area of zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso lineage cell were basically similar between zzso and zzso zzso zzso In bone zzso zzso transplantation experiments, tumor zzso zzso of zzso lineage cells, and tumor growth were significantly suppressed in zzso zzso mice implanted with zzso zzso zzso cells compared with those implanted with zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso signaling is involved in the function of zzso cell, such as the migration of zzso into zzso zzso and significantly contributes to zzso and tumor zzso
