zzso model approaches have been proposed for the analysis of the age zzso of specific types of zzso These models represented the age increases in zzso as the result of a compound hazard function where individual level risks were described by the zzso hazard function and where the population level hazard rate is a continuous mixture of the zzso zzso These zzso assumed that the mixing function, which described differences in risk due to different exposure zzso was constant after the age at which the model was first zzso In this paper we show how the mixing distribution can be allowed to change with time reflecting changing zzso The model is fitted to zzso lung cancer mortality data where for recent male zzso there appear to be changing patterns of exposure possibly related to recent declines in male zzso The implications for future lung cancer mortality trends in the United States are zzso
