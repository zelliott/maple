In this article we consider the factors responsible for the unique nature of the zzso zzso of solid tumors and we discuss the role of zzso of tumor blood vessel zzso We examine the role of zzso zzso zzso growth zzso a factor controlling zzso of zzso plasma protein zzso and the formation of a zzso zzso We discuss how this barrier could be destroyed by zzso bound on the surface of zzso cells zzso through the zzso and how these zzso are responsible for the zzso of zzso that destroy basement zzso The process called zzso which gives rise to zzso tumor zzso will also be zzso zzso of the blood vessel structure leading to zzso of the zzso and zzso of plasma proteins and of blood cells will be zzso Finally, we review some of the strategies that might exploit this knowledge about the nature of the zzso zzso for designing novel zzso zzso
