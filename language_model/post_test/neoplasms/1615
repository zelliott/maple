With completion of the human zzso zzso it is now possible to study the expression of the entire human gene complement of approximately zzso zzso To accomplish this goal, zzso have become the leading methodology for the analysis of global gene zzso zzso in technology have increased the sensitivity of zzso to the point where it is feasible to study gene expression in a small number of cells and even at the single cell zzso A summary of developments in the area of expression profiling in single cells will be zzso and the rationale for these types of studies will be zzso In addition, from a zzso point of view, some zzso challenges of expression analysis of single cells will be zzso
