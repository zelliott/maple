Universal screening for chronic zzso B virus zzso infection before chemotherapy has been zzso We evaluated the zzso of zzso screening before chemotherapy given for zzso solid tumors zzso 

A zzso model was used to compare the zzso of universal screening conducted per professional guidelines versus no screening in hypothetical patient zzso beginning zzso chemotherapy for early breast cancer or zzso chemotherapy for advanced zzso lung zzso Survival times were zzso using zzso zzso zzso were derived from published studies and costs estimated from the perspective of the Australian health care zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity analyses were performed, including with the application of an alternative zzso screening zzso 

Using an incremental zzso ratio threshold of $50,000 zzso zzso per zzso zzso saved, universal zzso screening was not cost-effective for zzso patients zzso zzso probability of being zzso zzso patients zzso zzso or pooled zzso patients zzso zzso zzso analyses found that screening approached zzso among zzso patients with the highest reported rates of zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso with chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso effectiveness was also significantly influenced by zzso population zzso An alternative screening strategy using zzso B surface zzso testing only produced the most economically favorable results, with zzso zzso zzso for zzso patients and zzso zzso for the pooled zzso 

Universal zzso screening conducted per current guidelines is not cost-effective in patients with zzso zzso may be economically favorable in selected patient zzso and/or with zzso of the screening zzso
