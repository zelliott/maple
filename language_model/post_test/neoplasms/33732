According to the findings that long, thin, and durable zzso have a high zzso potency after zzso and zzso administration, the zzso shape of a particle represents a zzso zzso this physical phenomenon is a special cause of zzso It zzso a biological process which can lead to cancer by several as yet unknown zzso However, the properties of the material the zzso are made of determine the zzso potency of a zzso in a secondary way although they do not seem to be responsible for the true zzso zzso For example, these properties determine the degree of zzso and zzso The persistence of zzso in the tissue is a very important property with regard to their zzso effect because the formation of a zzso takes many years or some zzso It can be assumed that a zzso has to remain by the zzso or zzso tissue until the induction of zzso cells zzso If this hypothesis is correct, there could be a zzso threshold zzso for zzso whose length and diameter would otherwise indicate a high zzso zzso There are indications that other zzso properties apart from zzso diameter and durability are important for zzso zzso however, at present, they cannot be included in a definition of zzso zzso It is proposed to zzso all natural and man-made mineral zzso with an aspect ratio of greater than zzso as zzso when they are longer than 3 zzso thinner than 1 zzso (or can split into such fine zzso and when they can persist in the tissue for more than 3 zzso
