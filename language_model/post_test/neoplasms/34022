zzso that kill the host cell during their replication cycle have attracted much interest for the specific killing of tumor cells and this zzso zzso is being evaluated in clinical zzso The rationale for using zzso zzso viruses is that viral replication in infected tumor cells will permit in zzso viral zzso and spread of viral infection throughout the tumor mass thus overcoming the delivery problems of gene zzso zzso understanding of the life cycle of viruses has evidenced multiple interactions between viral and cellular gene products, which have evolved to maximize the ability of viruses to zzso and multiply within zzso zzso in zzso interactions between normal and tumor cells have emerged that have led to the design of a number of genetically engineered viral zzso that selectively kill tumor cells while sparing normal zzso These viruses have undergone further modifications to carry adjunct therapy genes to increase their zzso zzso Since these viruses kill cells by zzso mechanisms differing from standard zzso therapies, there is an opportunity that synergistic interactions with other therapies might be found with the use of combination zzso In this review, we focus on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that have been examined in zzso and clinical cancer models and their use in combination with zzso zzso and gene zzso
