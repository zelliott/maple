Review of the literature of the past 40 years on zzso and its toxicity shows that no direct link between this aromatic zzso acid and zzso has been well zzso Ten years ago, studies of zzso toxicity in mice suggested the formation of an zzso zzso product presumably derived from zzso by way of the liver zzso zzso zzso Another study showed an increased frequency of zzso following long-term treatment with zzso acid, a zzso zzso occurring in the absence of zzso zzso zzso Recently, studies on zzso zzso zzso I) have indicated that the primary zzso zzso in these diseases is a zzso of liver and zzso zzso This results in an zzso of natural zzso derivatives of zzso acid such as zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of these compounds by zzso is demonstrated by the presence of the zzso acid zzso in urine of zzso This zzso is also present in the urine of a number of zzso carriers after oral loads consisting of small quantities of zzso zzso In this report, we present the results of preliminary animal studies on the zzso nature of the toxic effects of these zzso derivatives in these diseases along with preliminary data on the influence of zzso on protein synthesis in cultured zzso zzso zzso zzso as a natural zzso agent and may, along with zzso be responsible for the high zzso of zzso zzso in the clinical chronic forms of zzso zzso
