Among 82 cases of deep seated tumors treated by zzso with an zzso array zzso zzso and/or a zzso coupled 8 zzso system zzso combined with radiation therapy, 13 cases were treated by both zzso The efficiencies of tumor heating were compared in terms of the time required to attain 42 degrees C, the duration of heating time and the zzso dose as determined by a biological zzso formula for equivalent minutes at zzso degrees zzso zzso profiles and percent of temperature levels greater than 42 degrees C were better in the cases treated by the zzso but higher zzso doses were obtained with the zzso because longer treatment times were tolerated with the zzso than with the zzso zzso are necessary to prevent excess zzso of body temperature in the case of the zzso and to reduce superficial pain where the zzso contact the skin in the case of the zzso
