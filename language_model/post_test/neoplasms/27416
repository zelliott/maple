zzso zzso plays an important role in controlling cellular growth, differentiation and zzso zzso regulation of zzso zzso can result in human diseases such as zzso A major challenge of signal zzso research is to determine how the initial zzso of zzso zzso zzso by zzso stimuli triggers multiple downstream signaling zzso which ultimately elicit diverse cellular zzso Recent studies reveal that members of the zzso zzso of scaffolding zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso play a crucial role in zzso key signals that control cell growth, differentiation and function from multiple zzso Here, we review the structure, mechanism of action and function of these interesting molecules in normal biology and zzso
