Originally described for its capacity to induce zzso necrosis of zzso tumors in mice, zzso also exerts zzso effects against some tumor cell lines in zzso It is now known that zzso is an essential zzso of cellular immunity and a wide variety of biological activities of zzso in zzso and in zzso has been zzso zzso is an important zzso of inflammation and is involved during the zzso of several zzso infectious or cancer zzso While some zzso properties of zzso have at least been partially zzso the zzso basis of zzso zzso action remains largely zzso Furthermore, the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso have yet to be zzso Clinical studies with zzso zzso as an zzso agent are zzso Multiple phase I and phase II trials have been carried out without major therapeutic zzso In fact, zzso resistance and zzso systemic toxicity are two major limitations for the use of zzso as an zzso zzso The clinical application of human zzso remains an area of active research and innovative approaches such as gene therapy need to be zzso The zzso of the process of zzso and the zzso of zzso resistance are crucial to the future development of zzso and its use in zzso zzso
