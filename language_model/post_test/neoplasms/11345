zzso is a model system for cancer zzso Investigation with fruit flies has facilitated a number of important recent discoveries in the field: the zzso signaling pathway, which coordinates cell proliferation and death to achieve normal tissue size; zzso behaviors of cells, including cell competition and zzso zzso zzso that help ensure normal tissue size; and a growing understanding of how zzso and tumor zzso cooperate to achieve tumor growth and zzso in zzso In the future, zzso models can be extended beyond basic research in the search for human zzso
