The high zzso of zzso zzso zzso is one of the major issues in the field of gene zzso zzso zzso are susceptible both to zzso zzso and zzso immune zzso In addition, leaky zzso genes also render zzso cells susceptible to host immune zzso These are the main reasons why zzso zzso are not suitable to correct genetic disorders, which require long-term expression of the zzso Another limit to long-term zzso expression is posed by the fact that zzso zzso do not integrate their zzso into the cellular zzso DNA of zzso cell zzso As it stands, zzso gene transfer is a promising tool for cancer therapy and for genetic zzso programs against infectious diseases, provided that host immune responses are carefully zzso
