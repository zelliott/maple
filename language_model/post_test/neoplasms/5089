zzso imaging is defined as the zzso zzso and measurement of biological processes at the molecular and cellular levels in humans and other living zzso Most clinical molecular imaging is currently done using zzso agents to define the activity of various zzso pathways in zzso or to determine the distribution and density of various receptors relevant to human zzso This paper briefly reviews most of the commonly used zzso in nuclear medicine, as well as newer agents that are likely to become available in the near zzso The zzso pathways include those relevant to the zzso zzso heart, brain, bones, zzso liver, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso systems include agents useful in evaluating movement disorders, zzso cardiac sympathetic zzso and zzso zzso systems relevant to tumors include zzso receptors zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso IX zzso zzso and zzso zzso These agents, and newer agents that are being developed, are likely to become critical in the development of personalized medicine, where it will become increasingly important to determine whether a treatment that is targeted to a specific zzso zzso or zzso is likely to be zzso
