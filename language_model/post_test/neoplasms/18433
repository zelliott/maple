Class 3 zzso zzso were first identified as zzso that zzso mediate zzso guidance by binding to zzso and zzso zzso away from the source of zzso However, studies have shown that zzso are also zzso by other cell types, including tumor cells, where they play an zzso role in tumor growth and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso primarily inhibit the cell zzso and migration of tumor and zzso cells by inducing collapse of the zzso zzso via zzso and zzso Besides binding to zzso zzso also binds the zzso and zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso Although some studies attribute the zzso and zzso properties of zzso to competition between zzso and zzso for binding to zzso zzso several others have shown that zzso display zzso activity independent of competition with zzso A better understanding of these molecular interactions and the role and signaling of zzso in tumor biology will help determine whether zzso represent potential therapeutic zzso zzso we briefly review zzso the role of zzso in zzso tumor growth, zzso the zzso receptors zzso and zzso and zzso the potential competition between zzso and zzso family members for zzso zzso
