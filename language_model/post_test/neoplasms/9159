zzso and clinical cancer research, as well as clinical trials and treatment of cancer, are essentially structured based on the organ in which tumors zzso However, the recent explosion of knowledge about the molecular characteristics of tumors is opening a new way to tackle zzso This article proposes a different approach to the zzso of cancer with important implications for treatment and for zzso zzso and clinical zzso The authors zzso that zzso from diverse zzso of origin with similar molecular traits should be managed zzso The common molecular features observed in different tumors determine clinical actions in a better way than zzso zzso Thus, comparisons between tumors residing in different locations but with shared molecular characteristics will improve the therapeutic approach and the understanding of the biology of zzso
