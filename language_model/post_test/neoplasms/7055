To check the hypothesis that cancer patients suffer from extended pulmonary embolism zzso more frequently than patients without cancer we zzso zzso proved by zzso zzso zzso 

One hundred and fifty consecutive CT scans at the University Hospital of zzso from March 2002 until December 2004 which proved a zzso case of pulmonary embolism were zzso reviewed (79 men, 71 zzso mean age zzso zzso zzso disease and blood parameters were included zzso zzso zzso and total zzso if determined within 48 h before the CT zzso 

Patients with zzso disease were older zzso years zzso zzso years, zzso and tend to have a higher rate of central zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than patients without zzso The odds of a central zzso in cancer patients was about twice as high as in patients without a zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso Additional adjustment for the clinical information zzso zzso patient and clinically expected zzso did not deteriorate the zzso zzso density determined in patients with central zzso only shows a trend towards a lower density in patients with zzso disease zzso HE zzso zzso zzso zzso There is no statistical evidence that zzso density is related to one of the blood parameters or even blood density measured in the pulmonary zzso 

Although this is a retrospective study including a small number of patients it shows that cancer patients are at a higher risk for central zzso than patients without zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in cancer and zzso patients seem to be zzso
