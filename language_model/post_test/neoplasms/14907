Cell and tissue movement are essential processes at various stages in the life cycle of most zzso The early development of zzso organisms involves individual and collective cell zzso zzso must migrate towards sites of infection as part of the immune zzso and in cancer, directed movement is involved in invasion and zzso The forces needed to drive movement arise from zzso zzso molecular zzso and other zzso but understanding the zzso or zzso organization of these processes that is needed to produce the forces necessary for directed movement at the appropriate point in the cell or tissue is a major zzso In this paper, we present three models that deal with the mechanics of cells and zzso a model of an arbitrarily zzso single cell, a discrete model of the onset of zzso growth in which each cell is treated individually, and a hybrid zzso model of the later stages of zzso zzso While the models are different in zzso their underlying mechanical and mathematical principles are similar and can be applied to a variety of biological zzso
