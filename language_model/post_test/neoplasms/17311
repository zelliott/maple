zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso can be zzso zzso and zzso by members of the zzso zzso of proteins associated with zzso family from zzso zzso to humans, and these modifications can be found at distinct regions of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is relatively more enriched at zzso zzso regions compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso which is enriched at zzso start sites in all zzso Our recent studies of zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso branch of the zzso family regulates zzso activity and is responsible for the zzso of zzso at these zzso There are six zzso family members in zzso two of which, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are most closely related to zzso zzso Here, we use zzso zzso zzso of this class of zzso family members in both human zzso cells and mouse embryonic stem cells and find that zzso is zzso found at zzso zzso zzso and zzso are frequently zzso in cancer, and indeed, the widely used zzso cancer cell line contains zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Using zzso cells in which zzso has also been knocked out, we demonstrate that zzso and zzso are major regulators of zzso in these cells, with the greatest loss of zzso at zzso zzso Moreover, we find a redundant role between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso in mouse embryonic zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso zzso and zzso function in the regulation of zzso activity and that zzso of zzso and zzso that are found in zzso could exert their properties through malfunction of these zzso zzso zzso
