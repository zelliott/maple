Although older people make up the majority of cancer patients, little is known about aging and cancer zzso The objective of this study was to explore age-related patterns in adaptation to chronic zzso pain in younger and older zzso 

A zzso study combining quantitative measures with individual zzso zzso zzso measures included the zzso zzso zzso zzso Management Index, zzso zzso Index, and zzso Performance zzso 

Two zzso clinics zzso Care and Cancer zzso zzso in an academic cancer zzso 

Fifteen younger zzso age: zzso zzso zzso years old) and 17 older zzso age: zzso zzso zzso years old) people with zzso zzso 

Two age-related adaptation outcomes emerged from the zzso zzso to zzso and zzso despite zzso Younger patients were more likely than older patients to be zzso to zzso They felt that complete pain relief was necessary before their lives could move forward and reported feeling out of control, angry, and unable to accept their zzso zzso strain was zzso zzso despite zzso was more frequent among older than younger zzso These patients accepted pain as an inevitable part of cancer, pursued life goals, and modified activities to maximize zzso zzso growth was zzso 

Older and younger cancer patients described different adaptations to cancer pain despite reporting comparable pain intensity and zzso Older patients adapted by employing zzso zzso Younger patients were less likely to use these strategies and struggled with accepting the losses associated with cancer zzso These findings may guide future research into age-related patterns in cancer pain and the development of zzso interventions tailored to patients' life stage zzso
