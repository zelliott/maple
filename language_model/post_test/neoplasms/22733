To zzso investigate the possibility of a zzso zzso ranking of zzso zzso plans based on comparing the tumor control probabilities zzso produced by the competing plans for different values of the zzso model parameters determining the radiation zzso 

Individual zzso models based on the Single hit model of cell kill and on the zzso zzso model of cell damage, with and without zzso are zzso The tumor dose zzso in case of zzso dose zzso are described by a zzso distribution function on the basis of which a zzso expression is derived depending only on the mean dose to the tumor and its standard zzso and the zzso model zzso 

It is shown that in case of homogeneous dose to the tumor the plan ranking in terms of zzso is zzso zzso In case of zzso dose to the tumor there are cases when the plan ranking is zzso zzso and cases when the zzso zzso is zzso An interesting dependence of the extent of the zzso zzso violation on the model of cell kill as well as on the size and zzso rate of the tumor is zzso 

We conclude that in many cases zzso plan ranking in terms of zzso is zzso zzso However, since there exist cases where the zzso zzso is lost an investigation of the specific plans to be ranked should be performed applying the proposed zzso
