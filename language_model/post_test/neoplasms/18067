Mouse embryonic zzso zzso cells prepared from transgenic mice zzso a zzso and zzso cell surface zzso zzso with protein zzso interchange activity grew at rates approximately twice those of zzso embryonic zzso zzso Growth of transgenic zzso cells zzso zzso was inhibited by low zzso of the green tea zzso zzso zzso or the synthetic zzso zzso Both are putative zzso zzso with zzso zzso With both zzso and zzso growth zzso was followed after about 48 h by zzso Growth of zzso mouse zzso cells from the same strain was unaffected by zzso and zzso and neither compound induced zzso even at zzso zzso higher than those that resulted in zzso death in the transgenic zzso zzso The findings validate earlier reports of evidence for zzso presence as contributing to zzso growth of cancer cells as well as the previous identification of the zzso protein as the molecular target for the zzso activities attributed to both zzso and zzso The expression of zzso emerges as both necessary and sufficient to account for the cancer zzso growth inhibitions by both zzso and zzso
