A successful strategy for improving the efficacy of radiation therapy has been to improve dose distribution, that is, reduce treatment volume toward target zzso This is so as the smaller treatment volume has permitted a higher dose to the target zzso a high tumor control zzso and a lesser volume of zzso zzso being zzso zzso a reduced frequency and severity of treatment related zzso There are in place several important means for further improvements in dose zzso These include: zzso zzso graphic reconstruction of the affected part with definition of the position of the tumor zzso the adjacent normal zzso zzso explicit inclusion in the treatment plan of the uncertainty band around each zzso zzso zzso zzso contrast enhanced visual monitoring of the target tissue during the individual treatment zzso zzso gating of treatment so as to reduce the impact of patient motion on the needed treatment zzso zzso use of computer control systems to execute the zzso and zzso use of treatment methods which achieve a reduced treatment zzso In an examination for sites for which treatment volumes might be decreased by a substantial factor we have compared treatment volumes for radical surgical and radiation zzso zzso are presented for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso breast zzso zzso floor of mouth zzso zzso We describe a system developed here for zzso visual monitoring of the zzso covered by the treatment zzso zzso descriptions are given of results of low LET charged particle radiation therapy and of zzso electron beam zzso Also, the program developed here to use computer graphic techniques to display tumor and normal structures and zzso zzso with uncertainty bands around each zzso is zzso
