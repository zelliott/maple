The data reported in the past 5 years have highlighted new aspects of protein zzso and zzso zzso it appears that protein zzso may be a generic property of zzso chains possibly linked to their common zzso backbone that does not depend on specific zzso acid zzso In addition, it has been shown that even the toxic effects of protein zzso mainly in their zzso organization, result from common structural features rather than from specific sequences of side zzso These data lead to zzso that every zzso chain, in itself, possesses a previously zzso hidden dark side leading it to transform into a generic toxin to cells in the presence of suitable zzso zzso This new view of protein biology underscores the key importance, in protein evolution, of the negative selection against molecules with significant tendency to zzso as well as, in biological evolution, of the development of the complex molecular zzso aimed at hindering the appearance of zzso proteins and their toxic early zzso These data also suggest that, in addition to the well-known zzso a number of degenerative diseases whose molecular basis are presently unknown might be determined by the zzso or zzso deposition of zzso of presently zzso zzso From these considerations one could also zzso the possibility that protein zzso may be exploited by nature to perform specific zzso functions in differing biological zzso The present review focuses the most recent reports supporting these ideas and discusses their clinical and biological zzso
