The purpose of this study was to evaluate a custom portal image - digitally reconstructed zzso zzso registration software zzso The software works by transforming the portal image into the coordinate space of the zzso image using three control points placed on each image by the user, and displaying the fused zzso In order to test statistically that the software actually improves setup error zzso an zzso and zzso phantom study was zzso zzso images of zzso zzso and pelvis zzso with virtually placed zzso fields at known setup errors were zzso A group of five doctors was first asked to estimate the setup errors by examining the portal and zzso image zzso not using the zzso A second group of four technicians then estimated the same set of images using the registration zzso These two groups of human subjects were then compared with an zzso feature of the software, which is based on the mutual information between the portal and zzso zzso For the zzso case, the average distance between the actual setup error and the estimated error was zzso zzso zzso zzso for doctors using the side-by-side method, zzso zzso zzso zzso for technicians using the registration method, and zzso zzso zzso for the automatic zzso For the pelvis case, the average distance between the actual setup error and estimated error was zzso zzso zzso zzso for the doctors using the side-by-side method, zzso zzso zzso zzso for technicians using the registration method, and zzso zzso zzso zzso for the automatic zzso The ability of humans to estimate offset values improved statistically using our software for the chest phantom that we zzso zzso error zzso was further improved using our automatic error zzso zzso zzso were not statistically different for the pelvis zzso zzso improved using the software for both the chest and pelvis zzso We also tested the automatic zzso with a database of over 5,000 clinical cases from our zzso The zzso performed well for head and breast but performed poorly for pelvis cases, probably due to lack of contrast in the zzso portal zzso The software incorporates an original zzso to fuse portal and zzso images, which we describe in zzso The offset zzso zzso used in the automatic mode of operation is also unique, and may be useful if the contrast of the portal images can be zzso
