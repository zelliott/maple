The purposes of this study is to estimate the cost of cancer care after its diagnosis and to identify factors that can influence the cost of cancer zzso 

The study subjects were patients with an initial diagnosis one of four selected tumors and had their first zzso of cancer care at a national cancer zzso The data were obtained from medical records and patient zzso We classified cancer care costs into medical and zzso costs, and each cost was analyzed for burden type, medical service, and cancer stage according to cancer zzso zzso affecting cancer care costs for the initial phase included demographic zzso socioeconomic status and clinical zzso 

Cancer care costs for the initial year following diagnosis were higher than the costs for the following successive year after zzso Lung cancer zzso zzso had higher costs than the other three cancer zzso Of the total costs, patent burden was more than 50% and medical costs accounted for more than zzso zzso costs accounted for more than zzso of the medical costs for stomach and liver cancer in the initial zzso Care for late-stage cancer was more expensive than care for zzso zzso zzso costs were estimated to be between zzso to zzso won with expenses for the caregiver being the zzso The factors affecting cancer care costs were treatment type and cancer zzso 

The cancer care costs after diagnosis are substantial and vary by cancer site, cancer stage and treatment zzso It is useful for policy makers and researchers to identify zzso medical and zzso zzso The effort to reduce cancer costs and early detection for cancer can reduce the burden to society and improve quality of life for the cancer zzso
