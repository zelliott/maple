To study zzso zzso instability in cancer zzso late S and zzso zzso of 15 patients with common variable zzso and 14 healthy controls were exposed to zzso in zzso The groups did not differ in the frequency of spontaneous zzso zzso In zzso samples we found higher numbers of break events per cell and increased frequency of cells with aberrations compared to the control zzso A slightly reduced breakage of zzso group D was noted in zzso These results support the hypothesis that a higher zzso of cancer in patients with genetically determined zzso may be explained by an increased zzso zzso instability in at least some of zzso
