zzso zzso zzso 16, zzso zzso has previously described a model for predicting the sensitivity and dose profiles in the zzso zzso direction for CT zzso The model, developed prior to the advent of zzso CT zzso is still widely zzso however, it does not account for the effect of zzso tilt on the zzso or include the heel effect, both of which are increasingly important for the wider beams (up to 40 zzso of contemporary, zzso zzso Additionally, it applied only on (or zzso the axis of zzso and did not incorporate the zzso energy zzso The improved model described zzso transcends all of the aforementioned limitations of the zzso model, including extension to the peripheral phantom zzso zzso of simulated and measured dose data provides experimental validation of the model, including zzso of the superior match to the zzso provided by the zzso model, as well as the zzso effects on the cumulative dose zzso The initial motivation for the model was to simulate the zzso dose distribution on the zzso phantom axes resulting from a zzso scan series in order to facilitate the zzso of an improved method of CT dose measurement utilizing a short zzso chamber, as proposed by Dixon zzso zzso 30, zzso zzso A more detailed set of guidelines for implementing such zzso is also presented in this zzso In addition, some fundamental principles governing CT dose which have not previously been clearly enunciated follow from the model, and a fundamental zzso quantity dubbed zzso is zzso
