The majority of zzso tumors exhibit complex zzso zzso and it has been suggested that an elevated rate of zzso zzso is present in zzso zzso This zzso evolution is probably initiated at a zzso stage and then proceeds continuously but at variable rates during tumor zzso Even though the initiating events may vary among zzso the end point is often a similar set of zzso and zzso zzso These include an excessive zzso of zzso repeats, zzso the normal zzso process and triggering zzso zzso events and gross zzso zzso zzso dysfunction may also cause a failure of zzso resulting in zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso In turn, this could cause zzso cell division and gross aberrations in zzso zzso Several well-known cancer risk factors could contribute to these zzso For instance, zzso instability can be induced directly by zzso zzso whereas zzso virus infection has been shown to zzso zzso zzso A prerequisite for the induction of zzso instability through these mechanisms is partial zzso of the DNA damage response and the zzso checkpoint zzso Also, zzso of zzso appears to play a crucial role for zzso the rate of zzso zzso
