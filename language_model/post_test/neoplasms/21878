An zzso model is presented for predicting the transport and capture of therapeutic magnetic zzso in the human zzso The zzso with surface bound drug zzso are injected into the vascular system upstream from zzso zzso and are captured at the tumor site using a local applied magnetic zzso The applied field is produced by a zzso zzso magnet positioned outside the zzso An zzso expression is derived for predicting the trajectory of a particle as it flows through the zzso in proximity to the zzso In addition, a zzso relation is developed that enables the prediction of the minimum particle radius required for particle zzso The theory takes into account the dominant magnetic and zzso forces, which depend on the position and properties of the zzso the size and magnetic properties of the zzso the dimensions of the zzso the zzso level of the blood, and the flow zzso The model is used to study zzso drug zzso and the analysis indicates that zzso particles can be directed to tumors that are several zzso from the field zzso
