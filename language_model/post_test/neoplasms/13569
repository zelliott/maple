Human DNA zzso I plays an essential role in DNA zzso zzso and repair by catalyzing the formation of zzso bonds between adjacent zzso and zzso zzso at single breaks in duplex DNA zzso DNA zzso I is responsible for the majority of DNA zzso activity present in zzso cells among four different forms of DNA zzso designated DNA zzso I, II, III, and zzso In this study, we were interested in comparing DNA zzso I level in human tumors versus normal zzso and in studying whether the zzso of DNA zzso I could lead to tumor cell zzso 

DNA zzso I level was measured by Western zzso zzso in various human zzso tumor specimens and benign zzso obtained from patients, in peripheral blood zzso obtained from healthy donors, and in human tumors grown in nude zzso We also have designed zzso zzso zzso targeting the zzso of DNA zzso I and tested whether DNA zzso I zzso zzso could control tumor cell zzso 

The amount of DNA zzso I zzso in zzso tumors was considerably higher than that in benign normal zzso and peripheral blood zzso The level of DNA zzso I in human tumors grown in nude mice was also very high, and the expression of DNA zzso I appears to be zzso during in zzso tumor zzso We have observed that DNA zzso I zzso zzso inhibited tumor cell growth in a zzso manner, but zzso control zzso had little effect on the growth of the same cell zzso 

The presence of DNA zzso I at higher levels in human tumors than in benign normal zzso and normal peripheral zzso suggests DNA zzso I plays more of a role in zzso cells than in resting zzso These results, together with our finding that DNA zzso I zzso zzso can suppress tumor cell zzso warrant the design and testing of human DNA zzso I zzso as new zzso zzso
