zzso organ function and good performance status zzso are common eligibility criteria for phase I zzso As inflammation is zzso and zzso in cancer we investigated the zzso performance of zzso zzso including the zzso zzso and zzso to zzso ratio zzso 

We studied inflammatory scores in 118 zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso at disease zzso Each variable was assessed for zzso zzso and overall survival zzso on zzso and zzso analyses and tested for 90 days survival zzso prediction using receiving operator zzso zzso 

We included 118 patients with median zzso zzso months, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted for longer zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso ranked as most accurate zzso of both zzso with area under zzso values of zzso and zzso and zzso with zzso of zzso and zzso The combination of zzso increased zzso accuracy to zzso The zzso was zzso validated in a cohort of 126 zzso 

We identified the zzso as a validated and objective index to improve patient selection for experimental therapies, with its zzso following treatment predicting for a survival benefit of 7 zzso Prospective validation of the zzso is zzso
