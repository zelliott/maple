Several investigators have reported that tumor necrosis factor zzso can alter the zzso properties of vascular zzso cells in zzso We have examined the in zzso effects on the zzso mechanism of zzso human zzso administered as a continuous intravenous infusion to 23 cancer patients with active zzso A battery of sensitive and specific zzso techniques were used to monitor changes in blood zzso zzso zzso of F1 + 2, the protein C zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso were obtained prior to the initiation of the zzso infusions and at three and 24 hours after the start of therapy in 12 individuals who received greater than 3 zzso zzso zzso The mean levels of F1 + 2, zzso and zzso were significantly elevated at both time points as compared to the baseline zzso The zzso behavior of zzso + 2 in an animal model was not affected by infusions of the zzso We therefore conclude that the observed zzso in the concentration of this marker in humans receiving zzso result from zzso system zzso In 11 subjects infused with 1 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso h of the zzso the mean levels of F1 + 2, zzso and zzso were not significantly greater at 24 hours as compared with the baseline values, indicating that there is a threshold dose at which the zzso can exert a zzso effect on the zzso zzso Our studies demonstrate that zzso is able to provide a substantial net zzso stimulus to the zzso zzso and suggest that this zzso may be a zzso of certain zzso states in zzso
