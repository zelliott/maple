Several opposite effects of zzso zzso on zzso growth have been zzso On one hand, zzso is known as a growth factor for several types of zzso cells, and it has been proposed to take part in the zzso zzso of growth factors contributing to cell proliferation in aggressive zzso such as small cell lung zzso Depending on the zzso type either zzso or zzso zzso zzso have been found to inhibit the zzso increase in zzso zzso In contrast, several authors have also reported that zzso and zzso zzso can inhibit zzso zzso Most often this effect has been considered to be related with the specific zzso effect of zzso or zzso zzso on the vessels irrigating the zzso which has been evidenced by zzso zzso zzso zzso studies have also shown that vessels zzso the zzso exhibit a specific zzso response to zzso zzso In addition, zzso has been shown to be involved in the effects of several zzso treatments associated with the reduction of zzso zzso Finally, the specific zzso effect of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso might also be useful in inducing zzso in zzso which could be exploited in a strategy using zzso zzso or zzso gene zzso
