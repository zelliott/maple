To study the effect of zzso C virus zzso protein 3 zzso deleted protein zzso zzso on zzso transformation and tumor zzso 

zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso deleted zzso by zzso and selected in zzso The expression of zzso zzso gene and protein was determined by zzso and zzso zzso Biological behavior of zzso cells was observed through cell proliferation zzso zzso growth and tumor development in nude zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso proteins in the induced tumor was evaluated by zzso 

zzso zzso was strongly expressed in zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso and the positive signal was located in zzso Cell proliferation zzso showed that the population doubling time in zzso zzso cells was much shorter than that in zzso and zzso cells (24 zzso 26 zzso 28 h zzso The cloning ratio of cells zzso with zzso zzso and zzso cells was 33 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, the former one was higher than that in the rest two groups zzso zzso development was seen in nude mice zzso with zzso zzso cells after 15 zzso HE zzso showed its feature of zzso and zzso confirmed the expressions of zzso zzso and zzso proteins in tumor zzso The positive control group zzso with zzso also showed tumor development, while no tumor developed in the nude mice injected with zzso and zzso cells after 40 zzso 

zzso zzso zzso deleted protein has transforming and zzso zzso zzso Human liver cell line zzso may be used as a good model to study zzso zzso zzso
