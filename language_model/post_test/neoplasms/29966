Different types of human cells which normally grow as zzso or suspension cultures were tested for their capacity to form and grow as zzso Sixteen out of the 27 tested zzso cell lines formed zzso Nearly all of these zzso also zzso With only two exceptions the doubling times were longer when the zzso cells grew as zzso than when they grew in conventional mass zzso Eleven out of 13 tested human zzso cells formed small zzso but of these only the zzso of zzso origin could zzso These zzso cells grew faster when zzso to zzso than when in zzso suspension zzso None of the other zzso cells, which normally grew as zzso could grow as zzso The normally zzso zzso cells formed symmetrical zzso with smooth surfaces while the normally zzso cells formed irregular zzso with rough zzso All large zzso had a zzso zzso surrounded by a shell of viable zzso The thickness of the viable cell layer varied depending on cell zzso The shape and organization of cells within the zzso also varied zzso The results show that many types of human cells can be cultured as zzso and that a wide spectrum of zzso appearances and growth rates can be zzso
