In the present study, zzso changes in bone mineral density, bone zzso and bone hormonal metabolism were evaluated in newly diagnosed children with zzso zzso spine zzso and zzso neck bone mineral zzso zzso per zzso were measured by dual energy zzso zzso in 28 children zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 acute zzso zzso 18 solid zzso at diagnosis and after a zzso zzso zzso zzso density zzso per zzso was calculated to minimize the effect of bone size on zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso type I collagen zzso zzso zzso and type I collagen zzso zzso were measured serially during the zzso zzso zzso D, zzso D, zzso growth factor I zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed at diagnosis and at zzso zzso A significant decrease in zzso bone mineral density and apparent zzso density was observed during the year after diagnosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso controls showed annual increments of zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso The markers of bone formation zzso and zzso were significantly decreased at zzso By the end of the zzso zzso and OC were zzso whereas the marker of bone zzso zzso I collagen zzso zzso was significantly zzso zzso levels of zzso D, zzso D, and zzso zzso were observed during the zzso To zzso increased bone zzso and impaired development of zzso bone density were observed in children with cancer during zzso zzso zzso of bone mass may lead to impaired development of peak bone mass and zzso children with cancer to increased risk of osteoporosis and diminished skeletal resistance to fractures later in zzso
