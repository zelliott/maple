zzso are composed of both zzso and normal cells, including zzso zzso cells, zzso stem cells, and inflammatory immune cells such as zzso These various zzso components interact with cancer cells to promote growth and zzso For example, zzso attracted by zzso zzso zzso produced by tumor cells, in turn produce various growth factors such as vascular zzso growth factor, which supports the growth of tumor cells and their interaction with blood vessels leading to enhanced tumor cell zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso zzso signaling pathways by zzso growth factors and zzso has been implicated in promoting tumor cell proliferation and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso derived from both tumor cells and the zzso compartment are regarded as major players assisting tumor cells during zzso zzso these recent findings indicate that targeting zzso interactions is a promising strategy in the search for novel treatment zzso in human zzso This chapter summarizes our current understanding of the tumor zzso and highlights some potential targets for therapeutic intervention with small interfering zzso
