zzso are members of the zzso of zzso which are required for the synthesis of zzso and zzso and for the zzso of essential biological zzso including zzso DNA, and zzso zzso cannot be zzso de zzso by zzso zzso an efficient zzso zzso process is zzso zzso folate transport is zzso zzso and zzso with similar affinity for oxidized and reduced zzso acid zzso The various zzso zzso reduced folate carrier, zzso folate zzso zzso zzso and organic zzso zzso are involved in the folate transport process in various zzso Any impairment in zzso of folate can lead to a state of folate zzso the most prevalent vitamin zzso in world, affecting zzso of the population in the zzso Such zzso in folate transport occur in a variety of conditions, including chronic use of ethanol, some zzso zzso disorders, and certain zzso Among these, ethanol zzso has been the major contributor to folate zzso zzso folate zzso can develop because of dietary zzso zzso zzso altered zzso zzso enhanced zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso Ethanol reduces the zzso and zzso zzso of folate by altering the binding and transport zzso of folate transport zzso Also, ethanol reduces the expression of folate zzso in both zzso and zzso and this might be a contributing factor for folate zzso leading to folate zzso The maintenance of zzso folate zzso is essential for the zzso transfer reactions necessary for DNA synthesis and biological zzso zzso DNA zzso is an important zzso zzso in gene zzso in the maintenance of DNA integrity and stability, in zzso zzso and in the development of zzso zzso a toxin that is consumed regularly, has been found to affect the zzso of zzso In addition to its effect on DNA zzso due to folate zzso ethanol could directly exert its effect through its interaction with zzso zzso impairment of zzso group zzso and affecting the zzso regulating the synthesis of zzso the primary zzso group donor for most biological zzso zzso Thus, ethanol plays an important role in the zzso of several diseases through its potential ability to zzso the zzso of biological zzso This review discusses the underlying mechanism of folate zzso in alcoholism, the mechanism of zzso zzso of zzso and how the interaction between ethanol and folate zzso affects the zzso of zzso thereby modulating zzso stability and the risk of zzso
