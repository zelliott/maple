zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso and growth factor zzso zzso As both zzso pathways contribute to cancer cell resistance, zzso seems well suited as a promising zzso zzso 

Data were obtained by performing a zzso database search and zzso with a focus on the function of zzso in cancer zzso 

The findings on the zzso function of zzso on the putative zzso of zzso and on the expression of zzso in zzso and normal zzso are zzso In the context of cancer, two of these issues might be of zzso First, a variety of reports indicate a lack of zzso zzso in zzso Second, zzso or zzso of zzso has been found to considerably zzso zzso cells to zzso zzso as compared to zzso knockout or zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso or zzso of zzso has been shown to protect zzso cells from zzso cell zzso 

Due to these conflicting data, it is difficult to evaluate if therapeutic targeting of zzso is a reasonable strategy in cancer zzso A more comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms controlled by zzso may help to answer this zzso
