The issue of the relative merit of zzso and alternative measures of exposure arises most commonly in the context of zzso studies aimed at hazard detection and zzso When zzso are from biological agents, zzso are usually the first and often the only justifiable zzso In general, however, the relative merit of different types of exposure zzso need to be evaluated on a case-by-case zzso zzso may be affected by random zzso zzso sampling zzso zzso zzso and zzso differential error, all of which need to be explicitly evaluated before embarking on the use of a zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Random errors affecting zzso may be reduced by replication or combination of zzso or zzso Alternative zzso of exposure can be evaluated against a zzso when there is adequate evidence for regarding the marker as the true measure of a biologically relevant zzso
