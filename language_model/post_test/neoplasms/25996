zzso zzso therapy involves the passive transfer of zzso T cells to a zzso host in order to initiate tumor zzso Based upon animal models, zzso T cells with zzso zzso are superior to zzso zzso T cells in zzso tumor zzso in zzso Both zzso and zzso T cells are capable of initiating tumor rejection after adoptive zzso Several different culture methods have been reported that permit in zzso expansion of immune T cells while retaining tumor zzso The ability to generate human zzso zzso T cells capable of zzso tumor rejection in zzso has provided tools to identify zzso zzso Future directions in this field involve the selective isolation and expansion of zzso of T cells critical to initiating tumor zzso and the use of molecular techniques to generate zzso T zzso
