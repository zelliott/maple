Advances in molecular biology have had a tremendous impact on our understanding of the zzso of zzso disorders, zzso and infectious zzso It is anticipated that zzso DNA technology will gradually assume an important role as a diagnostic tool in medicine, since at least some of the techniques are now ready for routine use in the clinical zzso The most lucrative application (and hence the most competitive zzso for DNA zzso will be the detection of bacteria, viruses and other zzso organisms by zzso acid zzso zzso The value of zzso DNA technology for prenatal diagnosis and carrier detection in genetic disorders is now firmly zzso Analysis of DNA and zzso obtained from zzso may provide diagnostic information of practical relevance in carefully selected zzso It is, however, unlikely to challenge the established value of the more zzso diagnostic tools such as zzso and zzso
