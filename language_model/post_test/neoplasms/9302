Clinical trials showing longer survival when chemotherapy is combined with zzso agents zzso have led to growing interest in designing combined zzso protocols that exploit abnormalities in tumor zzso Approved agents include zzso a zzso zzso zzso that binds to vascular zzso growth factor, and two small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso that have been approved for therapy of zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso has a strong biological rationale in radiation therapy, and zzso studies consistently show an increase in zzso with combined zzso zzso studies indicate that excessive damage to tumor zzso can result in zzso in some situations, and early clinical data suggest that treatment sequencing may be important when combining zzso with zzso zzso itself appears to antagonize any zzso that can be induced by long-term administration of zzso The optimal biological doses of zzso with zzso are unknown, and surrogate markers of efficacy remain to be zzso Early clinical trials should therefore include studies designed to identify mechanisms of interaction and increases in tumor zzso This review highlights zzso and early clinical data that are relevant for clinical trial zzso zzso radiation planning and delivery is required to minimize the volume of zzso normal zzso and to establish safe zzso parameters for phase zzso clinical zzso
