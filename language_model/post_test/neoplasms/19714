Currently all approved zzso therapeutic zzso zzso zzso are of the zzso zzso which rely on zzso receptors zzso to recruit cellular zzso zzso In zzso studies showed that targeting of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso resulted in more effective elimination of zzso cells by zzso zzso cells than targeting of zzso Here we studied the in zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso generated using the variable sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using zzso transgenic mice, we demonstrated significant in zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso against zzso cells in zzso and lung zzso models, as well as against zzso cells in a lung zzso model in zzso zzso zzso zzso was more effective than zzso in a short-term zzso zzso model using zzso zzso target zzso The in zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso was zzso by zzso and was significantly decreased in the absence of zzso These results support the potential of targeting zzso for effective zzso therapy of zzso
