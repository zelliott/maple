In an era of ongoing improvement in cancer patient survival, available long-term survival figures from cancer zzso are often outdated and too pessimistic for two reasons: first, delay in availability of cancer registry data, typically in the order of a few years, and, second, application of zzso methods of survival analysis, which provide survival estimates for patients diagnosed many years zzso We developed a zzso period analysis approach aimed to overcome both zzso We provide extensive empirical evaluation of our approach by comparing its performance with that of previously available methods for monitoring of zzso and 10-year relative survival, with the use of data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer zzso of zzso patients ages zzso years and diagnosed with one of 20 common forms of cancer between 1953 and zzso We show that, in most cases, the zzso approach predicts zzso and 10-year relative survival expectations of newly diagnosed patients quite closely and much better than any of the previously available methods, including standard period zzso We conclude that the zzso approach may enable zzso up-to-date cancer survival rates even with the common zzso in availability of cancer registry zzso
