The zzso system has evolved primarily to control the trafficking of zzso during immune or inflammatory zzso However, through their expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso have commandeered various aspects of this host zzso system in order to enhance their zzso Although engineered zzso of some zzso zzso can stimulate host zzso zzso this is unlikely to be the reason that zzso cells express zzso Rather, a growing body of clinical and laboratory evidence indicates that cancer cells may zzso zzso in order to attract host cells that supply the zzso with growth and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso expression by zzso cells may permit them to use the zzso pre-existing zzso trafficking system to invade target zzso during zzso zzso Together, these observations suggest that therapies directed against zzso zzso or receptors may be beneficial in zzso
