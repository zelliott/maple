During zzso cancer cells breach the basement membrane and migrate through the zzso mostly composed of a network of collagen I zzso Cell migration on zzso is initiated by zzso of the cell membrane followed by formation of zzso that link the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso then move forwards by exerting traction forces on the zzso at its front and by disassembling zzso at the zzso In zzso only the zzso surface of a zzso cell is in contact with the zzso where zzso zzso are zzso In zzso zzso even though the whole surface of a zzso cell is available for interacting with the zzso it is unclear whether discrete zzso structures actually zzso Using high-resolution zzso zzso we zzso the zzso zzso proteins in three different cancer cell types embedded in zzso collagen type I, zzso at a slow rate, to allow the formation of a network that resembles the organization of zzso observed in zzso zzso zzso were detected in the cellular zzso frequently zzso with collagen zzso zzso they zzso to zzso structures in zzso As the distance from the zzso bottom increases, zzso zzso become smaller and almost zzso in some cell zzso Using zzso imaging we show here, for the first time, the existence of zzso proteins zzso in zzso These zzso share similarities with the ones found in zzso collagen zzso It still remains to be determined if zzso assembled in zzso and in zzso share functional similarities to the zzso zzso in zzso This will provide a major step forward in understanding cell migration in more zzso zzso
