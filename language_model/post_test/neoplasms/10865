Cancer is a highly complex disease due to the disruption of tissue zzso Thus, zzso and not individual cells, are the proper level of observation for the study of zzso This paradigm shift from a zzso approach to a systems biology approach is long zzso Indeed, cell zzso are emergent modes arising through collective zzso interactions among different cellular and zzso zzso generally described by zzso space zzso where stable states zzso are embedded into a landscape zzso Within this zzso cell states and cell transitions are generally conceived as mainly specified by zzso zzso However, the system's dynamics is not zzso to the integrated functioning of the zzso network alone; the zzso interacting system must be taken into consideration in order to give a more comprehensive zzso Given that cell shape represents the spatial geometric zzso acquired as a result of the integrated set of cellular and environmental cues, we zzso that zzso parameters represent zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Within this zzso function appears to follow form, and not the other way zzso
