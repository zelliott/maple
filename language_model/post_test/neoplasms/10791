The objective of this zzso study was to evaluate the risk of zzso in diabetic patients who received zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A total of zzso new diabetic patients who started zzso treatment were identified from the Taiwan National Health Insurance claims database during the period from July 1, 2000, to December 31, zzso As of December 31, 2007, patients with incident cancer were included as cases and up to four zzso and zzso controls were selected by zzso zzso zzso zzso models were applied to estimate the odds ratios zzso and zzso zzso between zzso use and cancer zzso adjusted for other types of zzso drugs, insulin, oral zzso agents, zzso and underlying zzso 

Among the zzso patients with incident cancer and zzso controls, zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, received zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso There was no statistically significant association between the effect of zzso as a class and cancer zzso after adjustment for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Among the individual zzso zzso decreased the risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso possibly increased the risk of occurrence of zzso 

The results did not show an effect of zzso as a class on increasing cancer zzso in patients with zzso However, there was a negative association of zzso but a positive one of zzso and zzso with the overall occurrence of zzso The underlying mechanism certainly requires further zzso
