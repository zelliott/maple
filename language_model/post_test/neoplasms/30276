zzso is a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso class zzso family and involved in early signaling events of zzso regulating zzso differentiation and zzso Currently, several zzso of zzso are under investigation for the treatment of zzso zzso In contrast to the beneficial effect of zzso zzso in tumor cells, several studies reported the requirement of zzso for the function of immune cells, such as natural killer and T helper zzso zzso T zzso zzso are essential for tumor zzso The scope of this study is to clarify the potential impact of zzso zzso on the function of zzso with emphasis on tumor zzso 

zzso mice develop significantly bigger tumors when challenged with zzso colon zzso zzso This zzso is accounted for by the fact that zzso controls the zzso zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso of zzso zzso leading to severely diminished zzso against target cells in zzso and in zzso in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso express low zzso levels of important components of the zzso machinery, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso display a zzso reminiscent of zzso T cells zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso confirmed a fundamental zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

Our results demonstrate that zzso tumor surveillance is severely impaired in the absence of zzso and predict that impaired zzso may limit the effectiveness of zzso zzso in long-term zzso
