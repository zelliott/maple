zzso plays an important role in tumor growth and zzso zzso of new zzso targets may broaden the zzso for future therapeutic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso and tumor cells, is essential for zzso and mobility of adherent zzso In the current study we analyzed the zzso properties of the zzso inhibitor zzso on the proliferation of blood outgrowth zzso cell zzso and differentiation of zzso zzso cells zzso derived from peripheral blood zzso cells, tube formation and on zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The effects of zzso were compared to those of the zzso analogue zzso The combination of both drugs was also zzso We showed that zzso tumor cells and zzso were most sensitive to the action of zzso compared to zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso affected the proliferation of both types of zzso cells stronger than that of zzso zzso zzso we could show that zzso inhibited tube formation in a dose dependent zzso In a zzso subcutaneous tumor model zzso and zzso diminished zzso at commonly employed doses to a similar zzso Combination of both compounds did not show zzso in zzso or in zzso Since zzso has been shown to inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, addition of zzso may not increase this zzso In conclusion, we have shown that treatment with zzso leads to a reduction of zzso in zzso and in a mouse zzso The effects are zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso
