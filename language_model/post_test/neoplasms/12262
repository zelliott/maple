Patients with zzso syndrome zzso have a risk of zzso to zzso of developing childhood tumors, zzso of which are zzso zzso zzso zzso of two distinct clusters of imprinted genes on zzso zzso is detected in approximately zzso of zzso zzso Our aim was to determine associations between the zzso status of both zzso clusters zzso and the tumor zzso and zzso 

zzso patterns of zzso and zzso were collected in 114 patients with zzso with a clinical zzso The patients were followed until 5 years of age, and tumor zzso and type were zzso 

A lower risk of developing childhood tumors was found among patients with a zzso zzso limited to zzso compared with other patients with zzso No zzso tumors were found in this group, whereas in patients with a zzso zzso limited to zzso zzso tumor was the most common zzso 

In addition to clinical factors indicative for a high tumor risk zzso zzso zzso patterns discriminate between patients with zzso with a high and low tumor zzso It also is possible to predict whether they are at risk of developing a zzso zzso zzso of patients is important to select the type of screening protocol to be proposed to these zzso
