Several studies have indicated that primary zzso zzso zzso may be associated with increased risk of some zzso but the results are zzso We conducted a systematic review of studies to examine the association of zzso with cancer risk by zzso We searched the zzso and zzso databases for English-language studies published before November zzso Studies were included if they reported relative risk estimates with zzso confidence intervals zzso or related data for the association between zzso and cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso patients from several countries were included in this zzso Of the zzso titles identified, 16 publications involving 17 studies meeting the inclusion criteria were included in the zzso Compared with the general population, zzso patients had a significantly higher risk of overall cancer zzso rate ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For stomach and zzso zzso the results of one study that only examined male patients with zzso indicated that zzso patients had increased risk of stomach cancer and pancreatic cancer, whereas the results of other studies of zzso patients showed no significant zzso zzso despite inconsistent results, the zzso could not be conducted for assessing the zzso zzso was not significantly associated with increased risk of other zzso 

The present systematic review and zzso demonstrate that zzso is closely associated with a greater risk of overall cancer and zzso but not with other zzso The data regarding the association between zzso and risks of several zzso need to be further confirmed in future zzso
