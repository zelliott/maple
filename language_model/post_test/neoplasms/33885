The zzso basis of zzso growth has been zzso Many models have been proposed to explain cancer zzso The descriptions employ zzso potential, zzso or zzso growth zzso Some of these models are concerned with the interaction between cancer and the zzso zzso Among other properties, these models are concerned with the microscopic behavior of tumors and the emergence of zzso We propose a modification of a previous model by zzso which describes the specific zzso response against zzso The modification consists of the substitution of a zzso law for the exponential rate used for zzso zzso This modification is motivated by the numerous works confirming that zzso equation correctly describes solid tumor zzso The modified model predicts that near zero, tumors always tend to zzso zzso zzso never zzso to induce a complete zzso of the zzso Instead, a stable microscopic equilibrium between cancer and zzso activity can be zzso In other words, our model predicts that the theory of immune surveillance is zzso A zzso equilibrium in which the system develops cancer is also zzso In this case, zzso activity is zzso This is consistent with the phenomena of cancer zzso Both equilibrium points can coexist or can exist without the zzso In all cases the fixed point at zero tumor size is zzso Since immunity cannot induce a complete tumor regression, a therapy is zzso We include zzso therapies and show that they are zzso Final levels of zzso cells and zzso cells are zzso thus zzso regrowth of the tumor is zzso We also evaluate zzso therapies which are zzso They induce an zzso zzso to zero tumor zzso zzso response is also suppressed by the therapy, and thus plays a negligible role in the zzso We conclude that treatment evaluation should be successful without taking into account zzso zzso
