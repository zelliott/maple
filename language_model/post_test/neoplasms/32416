The effects of zzso zzso disturbances were examined in zzso zzso and zzso toxicity studies, and in a zzso zzso zzso zzso were fed a natural ingredient diet zzso supplemented with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Additional controls were fed zzso zzso zzso diet providing zzso and zzso in amounts zzso to those in the zzso zzso diet and the zzso zzso diet, zzso zzso induced the expected zzso zzso as shown by decreased base excess in blood, decreased urinary pH and increased urinary net acid zzso zzso induced the opposite zzso zzso did not affect the zzso zzso Clinical condition and death rate were not zzso The feeding of high levels of each salt resulted in growth zzso and increased water intake and urinary zzso Plasma zzso and urinary zzso zzso were increased with zzso and zzso Plasma zzso was increased with zzso but not with zzso zzso calcium and zzso zzso were increased with zzso but there were no indications that bone minerals were involved zzso calcium content and fat free solid of the zzso were not zzso Standard zzso and clinical chemistry parameters were not zzso zzso weights were increased with zzso zzso zzso of the adrenal zzso zzso occurred with zzso zzso and zzso due to chronic stimulation of the adrenal zzso by either zzso or by zzso zzso An early onset (from week zzso of zzso zzso was noted in the zzso of rats fed zzso and, after 30 months, the zzso of this zzso was much higher than the background zzso in zzso zzso No progression to zzso was zzso zzso showed only slight effects on the early onset of zzso zzso (from 18 zzso In contrast, the severity of zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso were decreased with zzso zzso suggesting a protective effect of zzso The feeding of zzso resulted in zzso zzso and zzso of the urinary zzso With zzso only a slight increase in zzso zzso zzso was zzso Apart from these zzso zzso in the urinary zzso there were no zzso differences in zzso response among the zzso We concluded that most of the observed changes represent zzso adaptations to the feeding of zzso or zzso zzso zzso effects noted with zzso and to a far lesser extent with zzso consisted of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the urinary zzso zzso zzso chronic zzso zzso was not associated with dissolution of alkaline bone zzso in zzso Finally, a protective effect of chronic zzso on zzso development was not zzso
