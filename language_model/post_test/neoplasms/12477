The new zzso lineage zzso of zzso was described in a prior zzso The zzso is simple (the entire hierarchy is described with just 39 zzso comprehensive zzso a place for every tumor of zzso and consistent with recent attempts to characterize tumors by zzso and molecular zzso A zzso is a list of the instances that populate a zzso The zzso of zzso attempts to list every known term for every known tumor of zzso 

The zzso provides each concept with a unique code and groups synonymous terms under the same zzso A zzso script validated successive drafts of the zzso ensuring that: 1) each term occurs only once in the zzso 2) each term occurs in only one tumor zzso 3) each concept code occurs in one and only one zzso position in the zzso and 4) the file containing the zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso currently contains zzso different terms encompassing zzso zzso zzso Each concept has, on average, 23 zzso The zzso populates zzso zzso lineage zzso of zzso and is available as an zzso file, currently zzso zzso in zzso A representation of the zzso listing each term followed by its code, followed by its full zzso is available as a zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso is the largest nomenclature of zzso with more than twice the number of zzso names found in other medical zzso including the 2004 version of the zzso Medical Language System, the zzso zzso of Medicine Clinical zzso the National Cancer Institute's zzso and the International zzso of Diseases zzso zzso 

This manuscript describes a comprehensive zzso of zzso that collects synonymous terms under a unique code number and assigns each tumor to a single class within the tumor zzso The entire zzso and zzso are available as open access files (in zzso and zzso zzso with this zzso
