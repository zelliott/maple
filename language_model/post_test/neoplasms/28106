The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible influence of oral zzso pain and performance status on some aspects of zzso function and zzso in cancer zzso One hundred and thirty cancer patients between 40 and 76 years of age were zzso included in the zzso In order to separate the impact of performance status, pain and oral zzso on zzso functioning the patients were allocated in a zzso design to five different zzso Group 1 zzso which was considered the control group, was characterized by being in zzso Performance zzso zzso A zzso to carry on normal activity and zzso No special care is zzso had no pain and received no oral zzso zzso Group 2 zzso was characterized by being in zzso B zzso to zzso zzso to live at home and care for most personal zzso A varying degree of assistance is zzso had no pain and received no oral zzso zzso Group 3 zzso was characterized by being in zzso B, had pain, but received no oral zzso zzso Group zzso zzso was characterized by being in zzso B, had pain and received stable doses of oral zzso Group zzso zzso was characterized by being in zzso B, had no pain and received stable doses of zzso zzso comprised pain intensity, zzso zzso doses, time from zzso of last zzso dose to testing and zzso side zzso The zzso tests used were continuous reaction time zzso finger tapping test zzso and paced auditory serial addition task zzso Regarding the zzso tests group 1 was compared with each of the other groups and respecting the hierarchy of increasing numbers of zzso factors group 1 was compared with group 2, group 2 with group 3 and so zzso zzso zzso group 1 performed statistically significantly faster than groups 2, zzso and zzso zzso zzso group 1 performed statistically significantly faster than groups 3 and zzso zzso zzso groups 1 and zzso performed statistically significantly better than group zzso Furthermore, the zzso groups 2 and zzso performed statistically significantly better in zzso than the zzso groups 3 and zzso We conclude that in cancer patients the impact of zzso factors zzso zzso pain and reduced performance zzso seems to impair some important aspects of zzso performance, but more specifically our results indicate that zzso the use of long-term oral zzso treatment in cancer patients per zzso did not affect any of the zzso tests used in the present study, zzso cancer patients being in zzso B had statistically significantly slower zzso than patients being in zzso A and zzso pain itself may deteriorate the performance of zzso more than oral zzso zzso
