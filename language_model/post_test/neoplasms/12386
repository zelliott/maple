Patients with cancer often are rotated from other zzso to zzso to improve the balance between analgesia and side zzso To the zzso knowledge, no clear guidelines currently exist for the safe and effective rotation from zzso zzso to zzso 

The authors evaluated a protocol for switching zzso from zzso zzso to oral zzso in 17 patients with zzso zzso for switching were uncontrolled pain zzso of zzso and zzso side effects zzso of zzso zzso was initiated zzso hours after zzso withdrawal, depending on the patient's previous zzso doses (from zzso 100 zzso per hour to zzso 300 zzso per zzso The starting zzso dose was calculated according to a zzso conversion between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and oral zzso zzso zzso ratio or zzso zzso The correlation between previous zzso dose and the final zzso dose or the zzso dose ratio was assessed by means of zzso and zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso A Friedman test was used to compare pain intensity before and after the switch and the use of daily rescue zzso 

zzso rotation was fully or partially effective in zzso and zzso respectively, of patients with zzso zzso zzso pain was not affected by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were reverted in zzso and zzso of patients, respectively, after zzso zzso A positive linear correlation was obtained between the zzso and zzso doses zzso zzso zzso Previous zzso doses were not correlated with the final zzso dose ratios zzso zzso - zzso 

The protocol studied provided a safe approach for switching from zzso zzso to oral zzso improving the balance between analgesia and side effects in patients with zzso
