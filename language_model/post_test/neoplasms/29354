Modern tumor therapy has achieved considerable progress, but many tumors remain zzso to treatment or zzso following initial zzso Recent evidence points to one possible reason for this limited therapeutic zzso that the design of zzso agents so far may not have been aimed at the right zzso While conventional tumor therapies have targeted the main mass of tumor cells, there is now compelling evidence that tumor initiation and progression are driven by a zzso of tumor cells that possess stem cell properties and are resistant to traditional cancer zzso cancer stem cells zzso zzso have been identified in most types of cancer and can be separated from the rest of the tumor cells using appropriate zzso zzso are regulated by molecular mechanisms and specific, zzso and hypoxic zzso which largely overlap with those controlling stem cells from normal zzso Our improved understanding of zzso biology has already provided a number of novel targets and drug discovery platforms for the design of specific therapies that aim to eradicate the zzso zzso zzso approaches can be targeted either at eliminating the zzso themselves or at zzso the niches in which zzso zzso Moreover, the importance of zzso for tumor growth, resistance, and progression implies that clinical trials and zzso studies of zzso therapies should include as a key element an assessment of the abundance and persistence of zzso Thus, zzso research holds great promise for providing important new impetus to the fields of tumor biology and clinical zzso
