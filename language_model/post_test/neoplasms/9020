Blood vessels exhibit highly regulated barrier function allowing selective passage of zzso zzso vascular zzso caused by disorder in barrier function is often associated with various pathological states such as tumor progression or pulmonary zzso There are no realistic in zzso models for measuring vascular zzso as most models are limited to mimicking anatomical structural properties of in zzso vessel zzso This paper presents a reliable zzso chip for measuring zzso by engineering zzso zzso zzso This platform is compatible with high resolution, zzso zzso imaging and high zzso zzso zzso The zzso were formed by natural zzso process and thus exhibit reliable barrier properties with zzso zzso of zzso (for zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed properties similar to in zzso vessels in terms of zzso junction expression zzso zzso and zzso and response to zzso such as zzso and zzso We showed that zzso of the tumor zzso could be zzso with zzso zzso treatment, consistent with the mechanism of action for zzso The method developed here provides a relatively simple, robust technique for assessing drug effects on zzso of zzso with a number of potential applications in fundamental vascular biology as well as drug zzso
