Use of laboratory animals to identify zzso potential of zzso zzso and other agents has a modern history of greater than 40 years from which much useful scientific and public health information can be zzso While laboratory animals differ from humans in some respects that may affect responses to hazardous zzso use of such models is based on experimental evidence indicating that there are more zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso similarities than differences among zzso zzso zzso of zzso of responses between zzso species and between zzso and humans as well as zzso and zzso are important considerations in evaluating laboratory animal zzso zzso zzso in experimental design such as animal strain, diet, route of exposure, and study, duration as well as zzso versus zzso zzso responses all influence interpretation and intelligent use of study zzso zzso and differences in zzso laboratory animal and corresponding human zzso should also be considered in study zzso Recent attempts to explore genetically engineered mice and to zzso the mouse for more relevant identification of zzso hazard identification have yielded mixed zzso In the end we are confronted by the realization that virtually all animal cancer models are useful but imperfect surrogates for zzso Assuming the percentage of chemicals currently in commerce that are estimated to be potent animal or human zzso is quite low, the task of identifying agents with significant zzso potential is daunting and zzso The biological conundrum of scientific debate regarding the relevance of zzso studies in laboratory animals is likely to zzso Nonetheless public health considerations must take zzso when deciding human safety zzso
