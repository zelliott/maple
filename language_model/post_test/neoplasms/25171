The International Human zzso zzso Project zzso was founded in 1997 to coordinate worldwide research efforts aimed at using zzso zzso zzso to study DNA damage in human zzso The central aims were to zzso collect databases on baseline MN zzso and associated zzso zzso genetic and exposure zzso zzso determine those variables that affect MN frequency, zzso establish zzso protocols for performing zzso so that data comparisons can be made more reliably across laboratories and countries and zzso evaluate the association of MN frequency with disease outcomes both zzso and zzso In the first 10 years of the zzso project, all of these objectives were achieved successfully for the MN zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso in human peripheral blood zzso and the findings were published in a series of papers that are among the most highly cited in the zzso The zzso protocol and scoring criteria are now zzso the effect of age, gender and smoking status have been zzso and it was shown zzso using a database of almost zzso subjects that an increased MN frequency in zzso predicts cancer zzso More recently in 2007, the zzso zzso group decided to launch an equivalent project zzso on the human MN zzso in zzso zzso cells because it provides a complementary method for measuring MN in a tissue that is easily accessible and does not require tissue zzso This new international project is now known as the human MN zzso in zzso cells zzso At present, a database for zzso subjects worldwide has been established for the zzso zzso The zzso zzso exercise for the zzso project is at an advanced stage of planning and the analyses of data for zzso zzso zzso lifestyle and exposure variables are at a final stage of zzso Future activities will be aimed at zzso defining the genetic variables that affect MN zzso zzso validation of the various automated scoring systems based on image analysis, flow zzso and laser scanning zzso zzso zzso of protocols for scoring zzso zzso in cells from other zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells and zzso prospective association studies with pregnancy zzso zzso zzso childhood zzso cardiovascular disease and neurodegenerative zzso
