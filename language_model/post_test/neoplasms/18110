To investigate zzso of clinical target volume zzso zzso and zzso according to doses delivered in normal tissue for abdominal tumor zzso in zzso 

For a case of zzso six French pediatric radiation zzso outlined zzso zzso on the same zzso CT scan according to the International Society for zzso Oncology 2001 zzso On a reference zzso and zzso at risk zzso we performed zzso planning with the constraints as zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso to 50% for liver, zzso zzso for zzso Data were analyzed with zzso zzso 

Final zzso showed zzso zzso zzso zzso The recommended liver doses were not respected in four zzso zzso from zzso to zzso of the zzso for zzso in two zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso For zzso bodies, no zzso were zzso 

zzso not only affected zzso zzso but also dose distribution to zzso with different zzso This practice training demonstrates the zzso lack of data about correlation between dose, volume and risk of late effects in pediatric zzso We intend to record zzso the zzso zzso of each zzso in a national database in order to characterize late effects occurring in relation to treatment zzso
