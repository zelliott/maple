zzso zzso are a set of 3 zzso zzso repeat proteins of the zzso zzso termed zzso 1, zzso 2, and zzso 3, which have been shown to be functionally relevant for zzso zzso We have performed a systematic zzso study of the 3 zzso in oral and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and prostate zzso zzso zzso 31), and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso 1 and zzso 3 revealed common zzso zzso their expression level being zzso correlated with the degree of zzso Instead, zzso for zzso 2 was zzso In contrast, all zzso contained zzso 2 zzso zzso 3 in zzso pattern, whereas zzso 1 was expressed only in prostate zzso The presence of zzso 3 in zzso was confirmed by zzso In zzso only zzso 2 was zzso Under certain zzso conditions, focal nuclear zzso for zzso 1 was observed in some zzso and zzso Our results, which are inconsistent with previously published data to some extent, indicate a principal preservation of the cell type and zzso expression patterns of zzso in normal zzso For zzso 1, a zzso function of zzso behavior seems zzso whereas the putative functional significance of its occurrence in tumor cell zzso requires further zzso
