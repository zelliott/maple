To evaluate zzso measures of gene expression and tumor response in a zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso a zzso fusion gene between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso CD zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso subsequently converts zzso to zzso zzso and both of these reactions can be monitored zzso in zzso and in zzso using zzso magnetic resonance zzso zzso Following transient zzso the zzso fusion protein exhibited both zzso and CD zzso activities as documented by zzso zzso In addition, an increase in CD activity and zzso stability was witnessed for the fusion protein compared to native zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso cells increased both zzso and zzso sensitivity in zzso compared to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso MRS of both CD and zzso gene function in zzso demonstrated that in animals bearing zzso tumors there was limited conversion of zzso to zzso with no measurable zzso of zzso fluorinated zzso zzso In contrast, zzso tumors had increased CD gene activity with a zzso higher zzso zzso of zzso and significant generation of zzso Finally, zzso yielded increased efficacy in an zzso animal model of high-grade zzso More importantly, early changes in cellular water mobility, which are felt to reflect cellular death, as measured by zzso zzso were zzso of both durable response and increased animal zzso These results demonstrate the increased efficacy of the zzso zzso compared to CD alone both zzso and in a zzso model and validate both zzso MRS and zzso zzso as tools to assess gene function and therapeutic zzso
