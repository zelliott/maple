zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could provide the means for zzso and repetitive imaging of zzso of zzso expression and signaling activity in tumors in individual patients before and during therapy with zzso signaling zzso We developed the synthesis and zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso which zzso zzso and zzso binds the zzso site to the activated zzso zzso zzso but not to the inactive zzso zzso The latter was demonstrated using in zzso modeling with crystal structures of the wild type and different zzso zzso of zzso zzso Also, this was demonstrated by selective zzso of the zzso zzso domain with zzso in zzso human zzso zzso cells and Western zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies demonstrated a rapid zzso and progressive retention zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and in zzso human zzso cells genetically modified to express the zzso zzso zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso cells under zzso zzso Using zzso we obtained zzso PET images of zzso activity in zzso subcutaneous tumor zzso but not in subcutaneous tumor zzso grown from zzso human chronic zzso leukemia cells in zzso rats and zzso Based on these zzso we suggest that PET imaging with zzso should allow for identification of tumors with high zzso zzso signaling activity, including brain tumors expressing zzso zzso and zzso lung cancer expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso Because of significant zzso clearance and zzso zzso of the zzso additional zzso derivatives with improved water zzso may be required to zzso the zzso of this class of molecular imaging zzso
