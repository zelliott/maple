Human vascular zzso is a zzso exhibiting zzso activity through both its zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso is identified as being one of the most significant molecular signatures defining a poor prognosis in zzso breast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The survival zzso zzso with zzso expression in tumor tissue from zzso and in serum from lung zzso In zzso zzso zzso is also increased in tumor zzso However, mouse zzso has not yet been fully zzso Here, we produced a panel of rat zzso zzso directed against mouse zzso leading to the development of a specific zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso serum level was measured at a median of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso mice and zzso zzso These results also provide new tools to characterize and explore the role of zzso in mouse and rat models of human zzso These results present mouse vascular zzso as a circulating zzso similar to human zzso
