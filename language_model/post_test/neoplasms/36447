A loss in zzso zzso and an increase in cell zzso are clearly zzso for the development of invasive tumors and zzso Since zzso tumor cells have to interact with and migrate through zzso zzso it is of interest to compare the composition of zzso zzso proteins in normal and tumor zzso in order to determine whether the zzso zzso could be critically involved in affecting tumor cell zzso and zzso The question will be addressed whether tumor zzso zzso contains increased amounts of potentially zzso zzso zzso components and whether cells behave differently depending on the zzso zzso they zzso The results reviewed support the hypothesis that changes in the zzso zzso and the cellular receptors are indeed important in the process of zzso
