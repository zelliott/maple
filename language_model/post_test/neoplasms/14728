zzso zzso zzso bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with molecular weight of 550 Da zzso zzso along with zzso acid as a functional group was zzso to create a drug delivery system, which is based on locally zzso biodegradable, and zzso zzso In addition to the evaluation of the in zzso and in zzso zzso activities, the zzso properties, zzso degradation, and zzso release profile of the zzso zzso were zzso The zzso solution of the zzso zzso showed a zzso transition behavior depending on temperature zzso Based on the in zzso zzso activities of the locally injected zzso zzso into the zzso nude mice, the zzso zzso after the local injection at the tumor site was shown to inhibit tumor growth more effectively with less toxicity and much longer than zzso and saline as controls, indicating that tumor active zzso from the zzso zzso is released slowly over a longer period of time and effectively accumulated locally in the tumor zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso hold great potential for use in zzso and clinical studies as single and/or combination zzso
