The application of zzso in tumor pathology is discussed, zzso its use in studying the biology of tumors, in creating tumor zzso in creating methods for the identification of a tumor in the diagnostic context, and in characterizing diagnostic zzso in absolute zzso In traditional zzso diagnostic zzso zzso can be defined zzso but the definition of accuracy is zzso in zzso zzso a satisfactory definition is found for both concepts but it may be difficult to separate them in zzso zzso zzso can study parameters measured from sections or parameters derived from the primary zzso through zzso In the zzso of tumors, the following parameters have turned out to be specially zzso zzso zzso of zzso nuclear area, perimeter and form factors, zzso zzso the number of zzso cells per area, the zzso the volume fraction of the zzso and parameters associated with the fraction of tumor tissue in the zzso The standard zzso or other moments of the distribution of these zzso can be more relevant than the mean values of the zzso This indicates that more attention should be given to sampling rules, which are important in defining the efficiency of the zzso For rational application of zzso methods, it is very important to make a distinction between group zzso and diagnostic zzso The latter engenders numerous sources of variation zzso in section zzso variation in tissue processing, variation in the techniques of zzso zzso variation, zzso variation, variation due to zzso zzso zzso which are usually better controlled in group zzso The influence on zzso parameters of variation in section thickness and tissue shrinkage during processing are zzso
