Band 3, the major zzso zzso of zzso mediates the exchange of zzso zzso and zzso across the zzso We suspected that band 3 was present on zzso zzso cells as well as zzso because the zzso cell zzso that is zzso related to band 3 is present on zzso zzso adult liver cells, and embryonic kidney zzso and zzso prepared against the zzso cell zzso isolated from zzso react with zzso band zzso For this reason, we examined human zzso lung cells, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, lung zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso cells, and rat zzso for zzso forms of band 3 by using zzso zzso to zzso band zzso The results demonstrated that zzso sharing common zzso zzso with zzso band 3 are present in zzso zzso cells as determined by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mapping revealed substantial sequence zzso between zzso band 3 and the band zzso protein of zzso zzso studies indicate that the band zzso proteins in zzso cells participate in zzso cell surface zzso
