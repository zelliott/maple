The zzso system plays critical roles in zzso growth in an zzso fashion zzso zzso as well as proliferation and differentiation of normal and zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso is known to zzso the actions of zzso in circulation as well as the immediate zzso zzso Interestingly, apart from the ability to inhibit or enhance zzso actions, zzso also exhibits very clear, distinct biological effects independent of the zzso zzso zzso Over the past decade it has become widely appreciated that zzso actions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso contribute to improving the zzso of a variety of human diseases, such as cancer, diabetes, and zzso Recent studies have implicated interaction of zzso with a variety of proteins or signaling zzso critical to cell cycle control and zzso however, the actual mechanism of zzso action is still zzso This review reinforces the concept in support of the zzso zzso actions of zzso and zzso potential underlying mechanisms involved and subsequent biological significance, focusing in particular on functional binding partners and the clinical significance of zzso in the assessment of cancer zzso
