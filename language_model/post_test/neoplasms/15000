Regulatory T cells zzso expressing zzso play a critical role in the maintenance of the immune system zzso zzso express the cell surface markers zzso and zzso as well as the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso can be generated from mouse and human zzso T cells in zzso via zzso zzso As growing zzso suggest that zzso T cells also have zzso function, we have attempted to identify and characterize zzso cells in mouse and human zzso T zzso We found that freshly isolated mouse zzso zzso T cells did not express zzso When mouse zzso were zzso with zzso in the presence of zzso a population of zzso zzso T cells appeared, in most of which expressed zzso as zzso Compared with zzso zzso T cells, zzso induced zzso zzso T cells not only expressed zzso but also had increased zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso induced zzso T cells zzso a potent zzso effect on zzso zzso T cell zzso and zzso In contrast, although a small fraction of human peripheral blood and tumor zzso zzso T cells expressed zzso similar culture condition with zzso plus zzso failed to generate functional human zzso zzso T zzso In conclusion, our results suggest that mouse zzso zzso zzso T cells with zzso function can be induced by zzso and zzso zzso whereas functional human zzso zzso T cells in peripheral blood could not be generated under the same zzso
