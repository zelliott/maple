We have previously demonstrated that oral administration of bovine zzso zzso markedly zzso lung zzso colony formation, and that this zzso was possibly due to the zzso of T and zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso zzso is induced in zzso cells of the small zzso by zzso The present study was undertaken to confirm zzso production in response to zzso and to assess the underlying zzso zzso elevated zzso levels were found in the small zzso 1-3 h after a single administration of zzso its zzso hydrolysate zzso or zzso zzso while zzso was significantly increased after a regimen of seven daily administrations of zzso or zzso administration of zzso over the course of seven days had little or no zzso In addition to zzso a significant increase in zzso activity and zzso zzso was found in the small zzso after administration of zzso Similarly, in zzso zzso zzso markedly enhanced zzso activity and zzso zzso Finally, a zzso inhibitor significantly decreased zzso zzso induction of zzso in zzso zzso had no effect on either zzso or zzso or on zzso in zzso These results demonstrate the possibility that zzso of zzso activity by zzso and its hydrolysate may be important for production of mature zzso in zzso and thus in zzso the killing activity of T and zzso cells against tumor zzso
