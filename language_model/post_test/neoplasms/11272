The International Atomic Energy Agency zzso held a Technical Meeting of Consultants to zzso discuss a selection of relatively new agents, not those well-established in clinical practice, that operated through a variety of mechanisms to sensitize tumors to radiation and zzso to compare and contrast their tumor zzso normal tissue zzso and status of development regarding clinical zzso The aim was to advise the zzso as to which developing agent or class of agents would be worth promoting further, by supporting additional laboratory research or clinical trials, with the eventual goal of improving cancer control rates using zzso in developing countries in zzso 

The agents under discussion included a zzso but not complete, range of different types of drugs, and zzso that zzso with molecules in cell signaling zzso These were contrasted with new molecular zzso and gene therapy zzso All the drugs discussed have previously been shown to act as tumor cell zzso or to kill hypoxic cells present in zzso 

zzso recommendations were made for more zzso studies with certain of the agents and for clinical trials that would be suitable for zzso countries, as well as trials that were considered more appropriate for developing zzso
