zzso zzso are short zzso zzso that have been recognized to regulate the expression of zzso number of zzso Their zzso expression has been found to be linked to the pathology of many diseases including zzso There is a drive to develop zzso targeted zzso for different diseases especially zzso Nevertheless, reining in these short zzso zzso is not as straightforward as originally zzso This is in view of the recent discoveries that zzso are under zzso regulations at multiple zzso zzso 5 protein zzso nuclear export zzso regulation of zzso is one such important zzso zzso zzso is responsible for exporting precursor zzso through the nuclear membrane to the zzso and is thus a critical step in zzso zzso A number of studies have shown that variations in components of the zzso zzso zzso particularly the zzso expression of zzso increase the risk of developing zzso In addition to zzso the zzso 1 protein zzso or zzso region maintenance 1 zzso can also carry zzso export zzso These findings are supported by zzso analyses that reveal certain zzso as direct interaction partners of zzso An in depth understanding of zzso export zzso regulatory mechanisms is important for the successful design of clinically viable zzso In this review, we describe the current knowledge on the mechanisms of zzso nuclear transport zzso regulation and propose strategies to selectively block this important mechanism in zzso
