zzso zzso zzso zzso from mice became zzso after incubation with zzso zzso zzso activity was evident with M zzso treated with zzso for 4 zzso became zzso after 8-12 zzso of zzso and decreased to control levels by zzso zzso zzso induced marked changes in M zzso zzso zzso cellular content of cholesterol zzso and zzso fatty acid zzso content of cellular lipids (especially zzso increased two- to zzso after 8 zzso when the cells showed zzso zzso zzso Cellular zzso and zzso content returned to control levels by 24 zzso when the M zzso had lost zzso zzso These changes were not observed with equal numbers of M zzso cultured in control zzso To analyze the role of zzso and zzso in M zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso M zzso were enriched in zzso or zzso acid zzso and then tested for their ability to kill zzso tumor zzso The zzso cells were markedly zzso whereas controls cultured in zzso medium alone or enriched with saturated fatty acid zzso were not zzso zzso M zzso were not zzso indeed, these cells were inhibited in their killing after treatment with zzso compared to M zzso cultured in zzso medium with zzso zzso The effects of zzso and zzso enrichment of the M zzso on their zzso status, inflammatory function, and tumor zzso capacity were zzso The zzso M zzso were depressed in their ability to zzso protein and in zzso activity compared to zzso these cells showed a transient increase in zzso zzso M zzso cultured with zzso for 48 zzso were also zzso for zzso tumor cells, but did not show an enhanced capacity for zzso binding compared to zzso zzso M zzso were similar to control cells in their protein zzso and zzso activities; these cells also showed an early transient increase in zzso zzso zzso M zzso were not zzso for zzso cells, but bound the tumor cells more readily than did the zzso M zzso The data suggest that zzso levels of zzso and zzso can regulate M zzso tumor zzso but not through regulation of M zzso protein zzso zzso zzso or zzso capacity for tumor target zzso
