The zzso zzso is zzso in models of zzso zzso diseases, and zzso Both zzso and zzso show increased expression also in the zzso in response to different zzso particularly zzso zzso and zzso leading to zzso of zzso and release of zzso zzso Although zzso zzso against these proteins have been shown to have therapeutic efficacy in animal models of zzso no zzso zzso are yet zzso Here, we describe the development of a novel homogeneous zzso zzso zzso screening zzso together with several zzso for the identification of zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins as well as zzso and zzso proteins and an zzso zzso were used to establish and validate these zzso and to screen a library of 60 zzso zzso Two zzso zzso with unrelated proteins in the same zzso format, an zzso zzso and a zzso zzso were applied to filter out potential zzso zzso The novel zzso and associated screening cascade should be useful for the discovery of zzso zzso of the zzso protein zzso
