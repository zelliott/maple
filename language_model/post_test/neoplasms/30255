Upon receiving the Nobel Prize in zzso or Medicine in 1987, zzso zzso referred to the then recent discovery of the zzso zzso zzso and stated that zzso the function of the T cells bearing this zzso is currently unknown zzso these T cells may be involved in an entirely new aspect of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Twenty-five years of intense research later this ambivalent view still holds zzso zzso now appreciate that zzso T cells indeed represent a highly intriguing zzso aspect of zzso that is unique and distinct from conventional zzso yet even scientists in the field still struggle to understand the molecular basis of zzso zzso responses, especially with respect to the enigmatic mode of zzso zzso Here, we portray the peculiar responsiveness of human zzso T cells to zzso tumor cells and zzso in an attempt to integrate the corresponding - and at times confusing - findings into a zzso of zzso that may help explain how such diverse stimuli result in similar zzso zzso responses via the recognition of soluble low molecular weight zzso
