Although significant progress has been made in identifying long-term zzso for adult survivors of childhood cancer, comparatively little attention has been paid to the functioning of their zzso In a previous study, we observed that a majority of adult survivors are accompanied to clinic visits by at least 1 parent, suggesting ongoing concern for their children's zzso In the current study, we explore zzso zzso that characterize this population and might account for this zzso 

zzso to measures of zzso functioning zzso zzso zzso zzso Impact on Family zzso Impact of Events zzso zzso Experience of Child Illness zzso were compared between 27 parents of adult survivors zzso zzso zzso of pediatric cancer and 28 parents of current pediatric cancer patients zzso zzso zzso on, or within 1 year of, active zzso 

Compared with parents of pediatric cancer patients on treatment, parents of adult survivors demonstrated few significant differences in overall zzso zzso zzso stress symptoms, and adjustment to the disease zzso Indeed, the 2 groups differed only in their report of objective and family burden zzso financial cost, time off from work, less time with family zzso and in their levels of anger associated with the illness zzso 

zzso suggest that parents who continue to accompany their adult child to clinic may remain psychologically vulnerable many years after the end of treatment, and that the impact of having a child with a life-threatening illness may not diminish even years into the child's zzso
