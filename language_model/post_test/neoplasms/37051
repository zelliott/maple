Mouse zzso a member of the zzso gene family, has been mapped to mouse zzso zzso The zzso relationship between this zzso and human zzso 1 suggests that the human zzso gene maps to the zzso short arm of human zzso 1 zzso Since this region is frequently deleted or altered in certain tumors of zzso origin, it is important to define the specific zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso screening of a zzso zzso cell hybrid panel by zzso zzso showed that zzso is indeed localized to human zzso zzso Additional zzso screening of a regional screening panel for zzso zzso indicated that zzso is localized to zzso zzso to zzso Furthermore, zzso in zzso zzso analysis with an zzso zzso clone showed that zzso maps zzso to genetic marker zzso Taken together, the data suggest that zzso maps to zzso a region that is frequently deleted in zzso melanoma, and other zzso zzso
