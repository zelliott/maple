The aim of this contribution is to outline how methods of system analysis, control theory and computer science can be applied to simulate zzso and normal cell growth and to zzso cancer zzso Based on biological observations and cell kinetic data, our group has constructed three types of computer models: 1) A cell cycle model describing the spatial zzso and zzso growth of tumor zzso 2) A compartment model describing the growth of rapidly zzso normal zzso 3) A compartment model simulating slowly zzso normal zzso These growth models have been extended by an zzso model based on the zzso survival zzso Different clinical zzso schemes zzso zzso zzso and weekly high single zzso have been applied to the zzso mentioned zzso The simulation results show that in the case of irradiating a rapidly growing tumor zzso the zzso (3 zzso zzso zzso per day) leads to a particularly good zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso response of rapidly growing normal tissue to a zzso treatment schedule is zzso The same result is observed when simulating the late reaction on slowly growing zzso zzso zzso this therapeutic zzso is ensured only if the overall dose is reduced from zzso zzso 60 zzso to zzso zzso 50 zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
