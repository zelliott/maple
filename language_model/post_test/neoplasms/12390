zzso patients have an increased risk of experiencing progression of zzso zzso tuberculosis infection zzso to active tuberculosis zzso zzso In January 2002, 2 patients with leukemia zzso 1 and 2) developed pulmonary zzso after recent exposure at 3 hospitals zzso A, Hospital B, and Hospital zzso and at a residential facility for patients with zzso Neither was known to have zzso Within 1 year, 3 other patients with zzso and zzso disease had been identified at these facilities, prompting an investigation of zzso zzso transmission of zzso zzso 

The authors performed zzso analysis of the five available zzso tuberculosis zzso from patients with zzso at these facilities, reviewed medical records, interviewed individuals who had identical zzso tuberculosis zzso patterns, and performed zzso skin testing zzso and case finding for possible exposed zzso 

Only Patients 1 and 2 had identical zzso zzso Neither patient had baseline zzso results zzso Patient 1 had clinical evidence of zzso 3 months before the diagnosis of zzso was zzso Among employee contacts of Patient 1, zzso zzso occurred in 1 of 59 zzso 2 of 34 zzso 2 of 32 zzso and 0 of 8 who were tested at zzso A, B, and C and at the residential facility, zzso Among the others who were exposed to Patient 1, 1 of 31 zzso 1 of 30 zzso 0 of 40 zzso and 12 of 136 zzso who were tested had positive zzso at zzso A, B, and C and at the residential facility, zzso 

Delayed zzso diagnosis in 2 patients with leukemia resulted in the transmission of zzso tuberculosis to 19 patients and staff at 3 hospitals and a residential zzso zzso zzso screening and earlier clinical recognition of active disease could reduce zzso zzso transmission of zzso tuberculosis among patients with zzso
