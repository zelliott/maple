The purpose of this study is to establish and validate a methodology for zzso the standard zzso of zzso with large activity zzso within a PET image using replicate imaging that is immediately available for use in the zzso To do this, ensembles of zzso in the averaged replicate images were compared to the corresponding ensembles in images derived from summed zzso In addition, the replicate imaging noise estimate was compared to a noise estimate based on an ensemble of zzso within a zzso To make this comparison two zzso were zzso The first phantom was a zzso phantom constructed of 1 liter plastic zzso Each chamber of this phantom was filled with a different activity concentration relative to the lowest activity concentration with ratios of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The second phantom was a GE zzso zzso These zzso were zzso and reconstructed on a GE zzso zzso scanner with zzso and zzso zzso filtered zzso zzso and with zzso and zzso subset expectation zzso zzso A series of tests were applied to the resulting images that showed that the region and replicate imaging methods for zzso standard zzso were equivalent for zzso zzso Furthermore, the noise properties of the zzso zzso allowed zzso the replicate estimates of the standard zzso by a factor of zzso root zzso where N is the number of replicate images, to obtain the standard zzso of the full data zzso This was not the case for zzso image zzso Due to zzso of the zzso algorithm, the noise is shown to be both position and activity concentration dependent in such a way that no simple zzso factor can be used to extrapolate noise as a function of zzso The use of the zzso phantom contributed to the development of a zzso zzso of the noise as a function of radius in zzso In addition, the zzso ratio for high zzso objects was confirmed to be higher with zzso image reconstruction zzso These techniques were applied to several patient data sets acquired in either zzso or zzso mode, with zzso zzso and zzso Images of the standard zzso and zzso ratios were constructed and the standard zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso Finally, a zzso noise zzso relationship deduced in this paper was applied to patient zzso
