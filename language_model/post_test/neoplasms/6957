To examine the number of cancer specialists identified in three national zzso the effect of combining these zzso and the use of refinement rules to zzso physicians as cancer zzso 

zzso linked zzso zzso and End zzso zzso data and a zzso comparison population of Medicare beneficiaries, zzso zzso Identification Number zzso zzso and the American Medical Association zzso zzso 

We compared differences in counts of cancer specialists identified in Medicare claims only with the number obtained by combining data sources and after using rules to refine specialty zzso 

We analyzed physician specialty variables provided on Medicare claims, along with the specialties obtained by linkage of zzso zzso on Medicare claims to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and all sources zzso 

Medicare claims identified the fewest number of cancer specialists zzso compared with zzso who were identified when we combined all three zzso The percentage increase identified by combining zzso varied by zzso zzso percent for surgical zzso to 50 percent for radiation zzso Rules created to refine identification most affected the count of radiation zzso 

Researchers should consider taking the additional effort and cost to refine zzso by using additional data sources based on their study zzso
