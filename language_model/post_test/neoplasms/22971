A zzso zzso zzso method for the study of the semiconductor properties of tissue is zzso This method makes use of the zzso properties of tissue in conjunction with its zzso properties as described by zzso zzso The region of the body under examination is illuminated by a zzso zzso field which zzso with the zzso field generated by this zzso This zzso gives rise to an zzso spectrum which should be zzso by using a radiometer tuned to a predetermined difference frequency, or alternatively a sum frequency of the zzso zzso Potential applications to zzso location and zzso research are zzso
