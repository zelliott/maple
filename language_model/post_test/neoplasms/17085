zzso are known to be zzso containing a dynamic mixture of zzso and functionally different tumor zzso The two concepts attempting to explain the origin of zzso zzso are the cancer stem cell hypothesis and the zzso evolution zzso The zzso model argues that tumors are biologically zzso and all cancer cells within the tumor have equal ability to zzso the tumor growth depending on continuing zzso and selective zzso By contrast, the stem cells model suggests that cancer zzso is due to the hierarchy that originates from a small population of cancer stem cells zzso which are biologically distinct from the bulk tumor and possesses zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although these two hypotheses have been discussed for a long time as mutually exclusive explanations of tumor zzso they are easily zzso serving as a driving force of cancer evolution and zzso Recent discovery of the cancer cell plasticity and zzso makes the zzso population a moving target that could be hard to track and zzso zzso the signaling mechanisms regulating zzso during the course of cancer treatment can be indispensable for the zzso of current treatment zzso
