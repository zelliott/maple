To evaluate the long-term mortality experience of workers exposed to zzso cadmium, and other substances at a copper mine and zzso in zzso Tennessee studied earlier as part of an industry-wide zzso 

zzso were zzso male workers employed three or more years in the zzso or mill between zzso until the plant strike and zzso of operations in April zzso Vital status was determined through 2000 for zzso of subjects and cause of death for zzso of zzso zzso Historical zzso were estimated for lead, zzso zzso cadmium, dust, and zzso We zzso standardized mortality ratios zzso based on zzso and local county rates and modeled internal relative risks zzso 

We observed overall deficits in deaths based on national and local county comparisons from all causes, all zzso and most of the cause of death categories zzso We found limited evidence of increasing mortality risks from cerebrovascular disease with increasing duration and cumulative zzso exposure, but no evidence of an zzso relationship for cadmium exposure and zzso 

Our limited evidence of an association between zzso zzso exposure and zzso is an exploratory finding not observed in other epidemiology studies of more highly exposed occupational zzso zzso alternative explanations include chance alone and uncontrolled zzso or effect modification by zzso or other factors correlated with zzso exposure and unique to the zzso zzso
