To verify the zzso accuracy of a novel zzso dynamic zzso zzso zzso technique using the zzso zzso zzso head of a zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso was performed using three zzso a three-dimensional moving phantom with a steel ball target, a laser displacement zzso and an zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso with a zzso zzso zzso head and the system controller of the zzso The moving phantom was driven based on seven periodic patterns zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso breathing period zzso zzso zzso and 15 patients' zzso respiratory patterns zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The target position was detected in real time with the zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso using the stereo vision zzso zzso the zzso predicted the next position of the target, and then the zzso zzso zzso head tracked the corresponding orientation of the zzso The zzso of the target were measured zzso using the laser displacement zzso The difference between the target positions predicted by the zzso and those measured by the laser displacement gauge was zzso as the prediction error zzso and the difference between the target positions tracked by the zzso zzso zzso head and predicted target positions was zzso as the mechanical error zzso Total tracking system error zzso was defined as the difference between the tracked and measured target zzso 

The root mean squares zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were up to zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, for the periodic zzso Regarding the zzso patterns, the median zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso From the results of principal component analysis, tracking efficiency, defined as the ratio of twice the zzso of zzso to A, was improved for patients with high respiratory function (R zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

The present study demonstrated that the zzso is capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso was caused primarily by zzso and zzso was zzso Furthermore, principal component analysis showed that tracking efficiency could be improved with this system, especially for patients with high respiratory zzso
