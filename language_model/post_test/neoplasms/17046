zzso compounds are of great interest in medicinal zzso In recent years, several synthetic routes have been developed to obtain zzso molecules derived from zzso In this zzso we focus on the synthetic aspects and strategies used to design these compounds and on the biological activities of these substances for the development of drugs against the neglected diseases zzso and zzso disease as well as malaria, tuberculosis and zzso Three strategies used to develop zzso zzso compounds are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso modification and zzso zzso zzso Among these strategies, reactions such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cross zzso and zzso will be discussed for the development of zzso compounds against zzso zzso zzso and zzso The aim of zzso is the generation of novel molecules that inhibit cellular zzso generate zzso oxygen species zzso and increase zzso to enhance penetration through the plasma zzso zzso zzso have emerged as promising prototypes for the development of drugs against neglected diseases and zzso
