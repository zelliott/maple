In this article, we describe a novel straightforward method for the specific identification of viable cells zzso and cancer cell lines zzso and zzso in a buffer zzso The detection of the various cell types is based on changes of the heat transfer resistance at the zzso interface of a zzso sensor device induced by binding of the cells to a zzso zzso layer covering an aluminum zzso We observed that the binding of cells to the zzso layer results in a measurable increase of heat transfer resistance, meaning that the cells act as a zzso insulating zzso The detection limit was found to be on the order of zzso zzso and mutual zzso effects between the cells and different types of imprints were carefully zzso Finally, a zzso method was applied, allowing for the specific detection of cancer cells with their respective imprints while the zzso toward peripheral blood zzso cells was zzso The concept of the sensor platform is fast and low-cost while allowing also for repetitive zzso
