To identify new candidate cancer drug targets, we used zzso as a tool to functionally evaluate genes that play a role in maintaining human tumor cell zzso We screened a small interfering zzso zzso library directed against approximately 3,700 individual genes to assess the ability of zzso to induce cell death in an in zzso cell zzso zzso We found that zzso specifically targeting zzso nuclear protein zzso targeting protein for zzso zzso protein 2 zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso significantly reduced the survival of multiple human tumor cell zzso Further target validation studies revealed that treatment with Ran and zzso zzso zzso reduced the survival of activated zzso cells compared with their normal zzso counterparts in which the zzso zzso gene had been disrupted zzso zzso of Ran and zzso in activated zzso zzso cells selectively induced zzso arrest or transient zzso arrest zzso respectively, that preceded zzso cell zzso Given our observations that Ran and zzso depletion zzso reduces the survival of activated zzso cells, these two proteins may serve as useful zzso targets in tumors expressing the activated zzso zzso
