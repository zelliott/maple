The Leeds Assessment of zzso zzso and Signs zzso scale was developed to differentiate pain of predominantly zzso or zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether the zzso scale was an appropriate tool to zzso pain in a trial of patients with advanced cancer and chronic zzso zzso 

zzso assessment of pain type zzso or zzso was used to determine the sensitivity and specificity of zzso scores in 112 trial zzso Those classified as zzso or of uncertain zzso were zzso We undertook several analyses in an attempt to improve the zzso scale and better diagnose pain type for our specific zzso 

There was strong association between the zzso score and a diagnosis of zzso versus zzso pain, zzso When the clinical assessment was compared with the zzso scale, the overall accuracy was zzso zzso The 5 false zzso and no false zzso resulted in a sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso specificity of 1 zzso 1), positive zzso value of 1 zzso 1) and negative zzso value of zzso zzso zzso The negative likelihood ratio was zzso zzso zzso The scale had good zzso and construct zzso zzso was assessed via internal consistency with zzso zzso similar to that of the original validation study zzso None of the new scales developed was better at zzso pain zzso 

The zzso scale predicted well for pain type in a cancer population and is a useful tool for zzso pain in cancer pain zzso
