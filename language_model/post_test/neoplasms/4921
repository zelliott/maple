zzso toxicity to healthy zzso is among the major hurdles in zzso treatment along with intrinsic or acquired zzso zzso Development of small zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso proteins is a novel approach in a way that these zzso are aimed to interfere with specific zzso interactions unlike conventional zzso zzso of zzso zzso proteins are assumed to compete with zzso zzso to occupy zzso zzso grooves on the surfaces of zzso family zzso Instead of directly initiating cell death, these zzso are intended to decrease zzso threshold in tumor cells that were already primed to zzso In this regard, zzso zzso protein zzso have the advantage of lower normal tissue toxicity relative to conventional zzso therapies that interfere with general mechanisms including DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Besides, zzso zzso were shown to zzso zzso of established drugs in several zzso zzso and solid tumors which render them promising candidates for combination zzso zzso zzso these zzso in such a way may prove to decrease the patient drug load by diminishing the required zzso zzso This review summarizes and compares zzso zzso on the basis of zzso mode of action and zzso as well as providing remarks on their zzso potential and routes of development in near zzso
