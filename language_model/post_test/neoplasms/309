zzso has been theoretically determined to be among the best therapy zzso due to its unique zzso particulate and gamma emissions and zzso zzso Traditionally, zzso zzso have been zzso by the tin reduction method at low pH which frequently produces zzso of acid zzso zzso A comparative study has been carried out to assess three techniques of reducing zzso in order to label biologically active zzso zzso human serum zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso to zzso zzso These experiments showed that zzso and zzso reduction methods provide for an overall labeling yield of between 5 and zzso with an associated zzso of zzso The zzso acid zzso reduction method, however, yielded no usable zzso zzso The preparation of zzso produced an zzso zzso yield zzso X zzso zzso and zzso retention of binding zzso Using the zzso or zzso reduction methods for the zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in a relatively low yield zzso but the labeled product retained binding affinity of zzso with zzso zzso
