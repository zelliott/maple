The possible role of zzso in the zzso mechanism against zzso is discussed from the standpoint of the complement zzso zzso complement is activated by the majority of zzso in zzso via either the classical or the alternative pathway, and this zzso is sometimes observed following systemic administration of zzso Besides zzso the complement, systemic administration of zzso zzso serum complement levels, and in some cases binds zzso to tumor zzso zzso serum complement by an zzso induced an zzso of zzso in zzso with tumor cell destruction when zzso injected, indicating that zzso zzso factors zzso and zzso generated by an zzso had an zzso zzso This evidence strongly supports the concept that complement system plays an important role in the zzso mechanism against zzso
