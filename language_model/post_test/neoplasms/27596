In addition to lower operative zzso patients undergoing selected cancer operations at high volume centers have improved zzso zzso We sought to determine the overall effect of hospital volume on life expectancy after cancer zzso 

We used a zzso decision analysis model to estimate life expectancy for patients undergoing zzso for zzso zzso or colon zzso Model zzso included probabilities of operative mortality and zzso zzso For input data, we examined operative mortality zzso or within 30 zzso zzso by volume in over 400,000 patients undergoing zzso for these three zzso using the national Medicare database zzso zzso of late mortality were zzso from published studies zzso 1966 to zzso to model the effect of hospital volume on zzso zzso In analysis, we first calculated life expectancy for patients undergoing surgery at very low, low, zzso high, and very high volume zzso We then explored the effects of various zzso zzso 

Life expectancy increased steadily with hospital volume for all three zzso Life expectancy after pancreatic cancer zzso increased zzso with hospital zzso from zzso years at very low volume centers to zzso years at very high volume zzso For lung cancer, life expectancy ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso in life expectancy for colon cancer were not as zzso from zzso at very low volume hospitals to zzso years at very high volume zzso zzso in life expectancy across volume strata were largely attributable to differences in zzso survival, not operative zzso From a policy perspective, zzso surgery for colon cancer would produce the greatest overall life-expectancy gains, but it would require moving most zzso 

Patients aged 65 and older with zzso zzso and colon cancer have substantially greater life expectancy after cancer zzso at higher volume zzso Further work is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying differences in performance across hospitals in cancer zzso
