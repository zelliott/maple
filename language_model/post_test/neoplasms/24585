In a previous phase 1 study, adverse events, especially zzso symptoms, were observed mainly following the first zzso zzso dose of zzso an zzso zzso disease zzso zzso to adverse events of subsequent doses occurred, allowing a zzso increase in the maximum tolerated dose for these zzso Although zzso zzso (a single desensitizing dose with higher subsequent zzso addressed the zzso of high repeat doses, additional testing was required to further improve zzso of the initial zzso This study tested the hypothesis that zzso zzso using two dose increments before high repeat doses, would be well zzso 

Sixteen adults with incurable solid tumors were zzso zzso consisted of six zzso doses over 2 weeks followed by a zzso zzso zzso 1 to 2 were 1 and 12 zzso zzso zzso units zzso respectively, whereas doses 3 to 6 were escalated by cohort from 24 to 120 zzso zzso zzso 

No zzso zzso were observed, permitting dose escalation through cohort 4 zzso 12, zzso zzso zzso 120 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso symptoms were common following the first infusion, diminished with repeated zzso and were less pronounced than those seen zzso zzso zzso was observed in a patient with zzso zzso who enrolled with stable disease following zzso zzso Four patients with clearly progressing cancer before enrollment had disease stabilization of zzso zzso 

This novel zzso zzso improved patient zzso compared with the previous zzso zzso were predictable and zzso zzso the first zzso virus to enter phase 1 zzso testing, continues to show zzso activity, zzso planned phase 2 zzso
