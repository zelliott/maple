The regulation of zzso number and function zzso bipolar zzso zzso formation and genetic zzso Cancer cells both in culture and in zzso exhibit a wide range of zzso zzso Here, we briefly review advances in our understanding of the pathways that govern normal zzso function and outline the potential causes and consequences of their deregulation in zzso There is ample zzso but little experimental evidence to support the conventional model that zzso dysfunction causes zzso instability and, as a result, zzso This model has been challenged by recent studies that have uncovered evidence of a direct link between zzso function in zzso cell division and zzso Thus, it is timely to discuss the provocative idea that, in certain zzso abnormal zzso drive zzso transformation not by generating zzso instability but by zzso zzso cell zzso
