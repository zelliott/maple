zzso zzso is the process by which new blood vessels are formed and enhance the zzso and growth of zzso As zzso is recognized as being a critical event in cancer development, considerable efforts have been made to identify zzso of this zzso zzso treatments that target the molecular events of the zzso process have been developed, and have met with some zzso However, it is usually difficult to zzso assess the effectiveness of targeted therapies, and apparently promising compounds sometimes fail in clinical zzso We have developed a zzso mathematical model of zzso and tumor zzso At the molecular level, the model focuses on molecular competition between zzso and zzso substances modeled on the basis of pharmacological zzso At the tissue scale, the model uses partial differential equations to describe the zzso changes in cancer cells during three stages of the cell cycle, as well as those of the zzso cells that constitute the blood vessel zzso This model is used to zzso assess how efficient zzso gene therapy zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso The gene therapy zzso zzso zzso in the tumor and in the surrounding zzso zzso show that there is a critical treatment dose below which increasing the duration of treatment leads to a loss of zzso This theoretical model may be useful to evaluate the efficacy of therapies targeting zzso and could therefore contribute to designing prospective clinical zzso
