A greater understanding of the zzso and biology of cancer coupled with major advances in biotechnology has resulted in the identification of rationally zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ushering in new therapeutic opportunities and high expectations for the future as well as zzso zzso Because these agents appear to principally target zzso cells, it is expected that they will produce less toxicity at clinically effective doses than zzso zzso agents, but their target requirements are likely to be much more zzso The innate complexity of the networks that contain elements targeted by these agents also decreases the probability that any single therapeutic manipulation will result in robust clinical activity and success when used alone, particularly in patients with solid zzso that have multiple relevant signaling zzso In contrast, proof of principle and robust zzso activity may be most efficiently demonstrated in zzso evaluations involving tumors that are principally driven by aberrations of the specific zzso The zzso therapeutic manifestation of zzso agents in zzso studies is due to decreased tumor growth rates and will likely be similar in the zzso however, such manifestations are not readily zzso and quantifiable using zzso clinical zzso To curtail the increasing rate of late-stage attrition of zzso agents, which, if zzso will zzso progress in cancer therapy, the design of initial zzso evaluations, particularly the selection of tumors and patients, must be guided by the principal biological features of the zzso Next, evaluations, some of which must be randomized, can be performed in a wide range of tumor types, depending on the presence and relevance of the zzso To validate the concept of zzso zzso and to realize their full potential, radically different development, zzso and regulatory zzso must be zzso
