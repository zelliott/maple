zzso is a novel zzso zzso inhibitor that has shown promising suggestions of single agent activity in patients with advanced solid tumors when administered as a 1 h intravenous zzso infusion every 3 zzso The degree of zzso zzso in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso was greatest at the end of the infusion and rapidly reversed as the concentration of the drug in the plasma zzso A second phase I trial of zzso administered as a weekly 24 h zzso infusion was initiated to determine if the duration of maximum zzso zzso could be significantly extended by zzso the infusion time and increasing the frequency of zzso 

zzso of zzso was prolonged from 2, 4, 8, 16, 24 h in single patient zzso and repeated weekly for 3 out of 4 zzso The initial dose was 56 zzso When the infusion duration reached 24 zzso the dose was escalated at a constant multiples of zzso in single patient zzso until the occurrence of toxicity greater than grade 1, upon which groups of at least three patients were evaluated at each dose zzso The plasma zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were measured in all patients at the prospective maximum tolerated zzso 

zzso patients participated in the study (11 zzso zzso and the weekly dose was increased to a maximum of 300 zzso given as a 24 h zzso zzso zzso toxicity greater than grade 1 first occurred at 300 zzso with two patients experiencing zzso zzso One patient developed a grade 3 zzso and another developed zzso grade 3 zzso grade 2 zzso zzso and grade 3 zzso A 275 zzso dose was then zzso where one of the three patients treated experienced zzso grade 4 zzso toxicity and grade 3 zzso In view of the identical zzso toxicity at 275 zzso in another study and limited drug zzso there was no further zzso to this dose level and the study was zzso No evidence of zzso activity was zzso The plasma zzso of zzso was linear with high zzso zzso In the three patients evaluated at the 275 zzso dose level, the maximum zzso of zzso activity in zzso was zzso of the zzso 

zzso zzso as a weekly 24 h continuous zzso infusion permitted a considerably greater dose intensity to be delivered as compared to a single 1 h infusion given once every 3 zzso The more prolonged infusion schedule resulted in a much lower degree of maximum zzso zzso in zzso than achieved with the 1 h infusion, although the duration of zzso zzso was longer, consistent with the lower peak plasma concentration of the drug provided by comparably tolerated doses when given as a 24 h zzso Similarly, delivering the drug with increased dose intensity permitted by this weekly administration schedule did not appear to enhance its therapeutic benefit, at least in this phase I zzso zzso development of zzso may depend upon the potential for using it in combination with other zzso zzso
