Clinical and zzso data show a wide zzso of zzso response to combined zzso of the zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso are obvious not only between different zzso entities, but also between different combination schedules and different classes of zzso The underlying reasons are currently not well zzso 

In light of the disappointing results of some phase III trials on combined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and chemotherapy in zzso lung cancer, but also of some early clinical trials on the triple combination of zzso zzso and zzso negative interactions between the components of the treatment cannot be ruled zzso Also, there is increasing evidence for a differential activity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Potential reasons are an zzso component of the zzso effect of zzso zzso alternative signal zzso pathways leading to acquired resistance against the drugs, different effects on zzso zzso or nutritional supply, differences in zzso and zzso distribution or different effects on cancer stem zzso zzso these potential mechanisms will require further zzso and clinical research effort but could in future enable us to individually tailor the use of molecular targeted drugs in order to fully zzso their high potential in cancer zzso
