The molecular zzso zzso zzso shock protein zzso is a promising target in cancer zzso zzso and clinical evaluations of a variety of zzso zzso have shown zzso effect as a single agent and in combination with zzso Current zzso zzso are zzso into several classes based on distinct modes of zzso including zzso blockade of zzso zzso zzso disruption of zzso zzso zzso antagonism of zzso associations and zzso interference with zzso modifications of zzso The different functions of zzso zzso and the zzso selectivity of drugs need further zzso The correlation of cell surface zzso with cancer zzso and the emerging involvement of zzso zzso in cancer stem cells have become exciting areas that could be zzso zzso the aim of this review is zzso to zzso the up-to-date knowledge of zzso studies and clinical prospect of currently available zzso zzso zzso to enhance our perspectives for designing and discovering novel zzso zzso and zzso to provide an insight into zzso potential of zzso zzso in cancer zzso
