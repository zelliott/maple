The zzso model for zzso incremental cancer risks linked with zzso exposure is zzso The distinguishing feature of the model is that the additional cancer rate in the result of exposure to zzso chemicals changes with age as a value zzso to the background cancer at this zzso The proposed methodology enables assessing excess relative risk taking into account age and sex structure of background cancer rate in the exposed population, as well as the existence of a zzso time between an exposure and an onset of zzso The model also enables zzso the environment zzso health damage, defined as the expected number of lost years of forthcoming life in the result of zzso The model could be of value for the regulatory community and scientists in projecting a zzso increase in cancer rate in one population to increases in cancer rates in other zzso
