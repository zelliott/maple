zzso plays a fundamental role in regulating cell zzso Many types of human cancer zzso have higher copper levels than normal zzso zzso can also induce gene zzso However, zzso factors that mediate zzso cell proliferation have not been identified in zzso Here we show that zzso zzso previously appreciated as a copper zzso represents a novel zzso zzso factor that mediates zzso cell zzso zzso of mouse embryonic zzso zzso with copper markedly increased cell zzso zzso D1 zzso and entry into S phase, which were completely abolished in zzso zzso zzso analysis and zzso revealed that copper stimulates the zzso binding to a previously zzso zzso element in the zzso D1 zzso The zzso zzso confirms that copper stimulates zzso binding to the DNA in zzso zzso of zzso fused to the zzso domain of zzso demonstrated a zzso zzso in various cell types, including zzso and cancer zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso to the nucleus in response to copper through its highly zzso zzso zzso motif and zzso zzso zzso Finally, the functional role of nuclear zzso is demonstrated by the observation that zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso rescued the defective zzso cell zzso Thus, zzso functions as a novel zzso factor that, when activated by copper, zzso nuclear zzso DNA zzso and zzso thereby contributing to cell zzso
