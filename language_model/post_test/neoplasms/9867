Two approaches to the inclusion of zzso factors in the analysis of zzso relations are zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis incorporating simple exposure zzso together with additional zzso variables and their zzso and zzso direct fitting to models of the disease zzso These approaches are illustrated on zzso data relating lung cancer to zzso and zzso From approach i average age at exposure, age at risk, and duration of exposure were found to contribute direct or interaction zzso Two models of zzso were zzso In a zzso zzso model the median zzso period was estimated at zzso years overall, but was somewhat longer for zzso and shorter for zzso zzso When this difference was allowed for, zzso periods seemed to be zzso related to the average zzso of both zzso and zzso In the zzso model, the best fit was obtained with zzso acting at the fourth and smoking at the fifth of six zzso Lifetime risks of lung cancer are projected under the different zzso
