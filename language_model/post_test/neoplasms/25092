Recent advances in zzso cell zzso and directed differentiation make it possible to generate zzso zzso cells and further derive functional zzso cells for biomedical research and future zzso Chemical compounds targeting zzso or signaling proteins are powerful tools to regulate and reveal complex cellular processes and have been identified and applied to controlling cell fate and function, including stem cell zzso zzso and zzso Not only are small molecules useful in generating desired cell types in zzso for various applications, but also such small molecules could be further developed as conventional zzso to target patient's own cells residing in different zzso for treating degenerative diseases, injuries, and zzso Here, we will review recent studies of small molecules in controlling cell zzso
