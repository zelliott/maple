Based on the fact that zzso zzso zzso zzso develop high metabolism and use more blood supply than normal zzso infrared zzso zzso has become a reliable clinical technique used to indicate zzso the presence of zzso diseases, zzso skin and breast zzso However, to diagnose zzso diseases by zzso the technique requires procedures that explore the relationship between the zzso characteristics zzso blood zzso rate and heat zzso and the resulting temperature distribution on the skin zzso In this research work the dual zzso boundary element method zzso has been coupled with the simulated zzso technique zzso in a new inverse zzso which coupled to the zzso technique, is capable of zzso simultaneously geometrical and zzso parameters of the zzso The method is of an evolutionary type, requiring random initial values for the unknown parameters and no calculations of sensitivities or search zzso In addition, the zzso does not require any zzso at each proposed solution to solve the zzso zzso The inverse procedure has been tested considering input data for simulated zzso of different sizes and positions in relation to the skin zzso The successful zzso of unknown zzso parameters zzso the idea of using the zzso technique and the zzso in the zzso of zzso Other zzso techniques, based on genetic zzso or sensitivity zzso have not been capable of obtaining a solution because the skin surface temperature difference is very zzso
