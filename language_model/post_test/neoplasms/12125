zzso zzso zzso zzso drugs rely primarily for their therapeutic effect on zzso differences between cancer and normal zzso One approach aimed at improving the selectivity of tumor cell killing by such compounds is the use of less toxic zzso forms that can be selectively activated in tumor tissue zzso zzso zzso There are several mechanisms potentially zzso for the selective zzso of zzso Some zzso unique aspects of tumor physiology such as selective zzso expression or zzso Others are based on zzso delivery techniques, including zzso of zzso by zzso zzso delivered to tumor cells via zzso zzso zzso or generated in tumor cells from DNA zzso containing the corresponding gene zzso zzso zzso mechanism is used, only a small proportion of the tumor cells are likely to be competent to activate the zzso zzso TAP need to fully exploit these zzso cells by being capable of killing zzso cells as well via a zzso zzso A wide variety of zzso have been explored for the selective zzso of zzso Examples are given of the most zzso reduction of zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso or zzso the zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso metabolism by a variety of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso
