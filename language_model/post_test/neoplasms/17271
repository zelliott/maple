zzso resistance, especially that zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a major obstacle to the efficacy of most zzso zzso drugs in zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be highly zzso to breast cancer cell lines zzso and zzso which zzso zzso via long term culture with zzso and cervical cancer cell lines zzso and zzso which zzso zzso via stable zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments also confirmed that zzso can circumvent zzso and zzso zzso zzso drug zzso In addition, its zzso was lower than that of zzso in the human zzso cell line zzso and the human zzso retinal zzso zzso cell line zzso suggesting a better safety margin for this compound in zzso It exhibited more potent zzso zzso ability than zzso in zzso and also induced zzso phase arrest in zzso zzso Moreover, it was found to induce zzso in zzso cells through the zzso zzso zzso by enhancing levels of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso was found to be a poorer zzso of zzso compared to zzso in both binding and zzso experiments, which is likely responsible for its ability to circumvent zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso All of these results indicate that zzso is a novel zzso agent that has the potential to evade drug resistance zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso
