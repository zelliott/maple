Recent evidence suggests that some zzso treatments could affect the zzso of zzso This study was aimed at the assessment of zzso mortality in type 2 diabetic patients treated with different zzso zzso 

A retrospective zzso cohort study was performed on a consecutive series of zzso type 2 diabetic zzso zzso death was identified through the City zzso zzso For patients visited for the first time after January 1 zzso 2000, information on zzso of cancer was also zzso 

During a mean follow-up of zzso years, 87 cases of zzso death were recorded, with a yearly zzso rate of zzso Patients receiving zzso showed a significantly higher mortality than the rest of the sample zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso which was maintained after adjustment for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso no significant association of zzso mortality was observed with insulin zzso or zzso zzso In comparison with patients receiving no zzso treatment, those on zzso or insulin zzso showed a higher zzso mortality zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The effect of treatments on zzso of zzso was similar to that observed on zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso insulin, appear to be associated with increased mortality for cancer, even after adjustment for multiple zzso This issue deserves further investigation through zzso studies on larger samples of zzso
