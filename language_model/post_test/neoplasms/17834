zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that binds to plasma zzso after intravenous zzso In zzso experiments with human plasma have shown that zzso initially binds to an unknown protein and subsequently redistributes to zzso zzso It has been suggested that this might explain the unusual zzso profile of zzso zzso In humans, unlike in zzso reappearance of zzso has been reported, resulting in a second plasma peak after intravenous zzso However, previous studies analyzed only limited time points during the first 24 h after zzso Our aim was to determine the zzso of zzso in detail, and to investigate whether the zzso behavior of the drug is affected by binding of zzso to zzso in zzso 

Plasma of cancer patients and mice, zzso injected with zzso was analyzed for total drug content and drug distribution over the zzso zzso 

zzso profiles of zzso in a group of human subjects showed that apparent steady state drug levels were maintained for at least 10 zzso Closer examination of individual profiles showed that the initial (5 zzso plasma drug levels were on average zzso of the zzso plasma zzso which occurred at about 5 h after zzso In mice, however, plasma zzso were described by a standard zzso decline of the drug zzso The majority zzso of zzso injected into both zzso nude mice and patients initially bound to the HDL plasma zzso We extended our study to zzso zzso mice, with highly elevated zzso levels, and zzso zzso mice, which are lacking the main clearance zzso for HDL associated zzso zzso to take into account the differences between zzso levels and clearance in mice and zzso Although zzso distribution over the zzso changed in these mice, zzso profiles of zzso remained the zzso 

We conclude that neither zzso levels nor cholesterol metabolism affects the zzso of zzso in zzso
