We choose to discuss from the zzso point of view because this diagnostic reference is commonly zzso We wish outline its restrictive sight which could prevent the professional from having a diagnosis of zzso We don't want to say there is a zzso everywhere but it appears to us that a traumatic reading can be a precious advantage for the zzso to establish a real therapeutic relation with some zzso zzso syndrome differs from the majority of other diagnostic categories as it includes in its criteria the zzso cause of the trauma zzso zzso In the case that this syndrome originates in war experiences, the presumed cause presents itself as an exceptional event overcoming the zzso zzso The notion of war zzso has been extended to other events such as catastrophes, physical attacks, rapes, child and wife zzso and sexual zzso But the events which cause zzso zzso Stress zzso are significantly more zzso It can be seen that medical events such as giving birth, zzso heart attack, cancer, or zzso following resuscitation may give rise to zzso Further, people experiencing prolonged periods of distress may equally develop a post-traumatic syndrome without any particular event having occurred to surpass their zzso It's the case of the zzso zzso Stress Disorder zzso The series of zzso stress zzso the psychic balance and may give rise, at one moment, to zzso symptoms described in zzso without any specific stressful zzso The existence of criterion A is therefore not a necessary prerequisite in establishing a diagnosis of zzso It is, in fact, very difficult to predict which events could cause a zzso and this, especially, as the zzso aspects count at least as much as the objective zzso The zzso should have to carefully explore how the patient experienced the event or, how he apprehended the event itself and it's outcome, if he wants get the traumatic range of a life zzso The feeling of deep distress, the feeling of being zzso the loss of control, the collapse of basic beliefs, the feeling that one's life is in zzso that the physical integrity is zzso or in one's zzso threatened, the feeling of zzso are quite as much clues for a possible zzso which hides behind others clinical manifestations either psychological or zzso Furthermore, the zzso form described in the zzso and grouping together three further criteria zzso events, avoiding stimuli associated with the zzso zzso is extremely rare in the chronic zzso An zzso post-traumatic syndrome zzso with time and may present, initially, with very different pathological symptoms giving rise to equally varied zzso Different zzso models propose to account for the zzso 's zzso appearance and instability with zzso The zzso concept sees the zzso as an independent entity other independent zzso coexist zzso The zzso concept suggests that the zzso is an independent entity which shows different clinical appearances based on symptomatic zzso The zzso concept suggests to see the zzso as an independent entity which offers, with time, different symptomatic appearances, in evolution, because of events caused by after effects, in different areas of the zzso zzso All of these concepts outline the zzso appearance of the zzso which makes it hardly zzso The zzso syndrome is rarely diagnosed forming a real challenge to zzso In effect, the present authors insist on the crucial nature of early detection of zzso since the greater the time elapsed the more difficult it becomes due to the evolutionary aspect of the syndrome, which initially has more readily recognizable zzso The consequences of an zzso zzso are serious and affect both the individual and his immediate family and friends, contributing further to the zzso of the zzso When a zzso is zzso it can allow the zzso to further a more global care which will help the patient to get a better zzso With patients who suffered an zzso the treatment of zzso which prevents their recovery will help to go back to the way they lived before the zzso It has been showed how important could be the zzso detection on the severe burned people's pain zzso Thus it seems to be crucial for the zzso to keep this diagnosis in mind alongside any zzso
