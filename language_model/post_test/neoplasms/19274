How tumor zzso more specifically low zzso pH zzso alters cell response to zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer therapy has yet to be zzso The aim of the current work was to test the effect of zzso zzso pH on zzso cell death in human zzso colon zzso and zzso zzso cell lines as well as in human primary zzso We found an increase in TRAIL sensitivity at low zzso zzso which is partially inhibited by zzso expression in zzso zzso At low zzso zzso TRAIL induced a new form of cell death, sharing zzso and zzso features in tumor zzso By contrast, human primary zzso were resistant to zzso cell death even at zzso zzso zzso
