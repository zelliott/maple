zzso blood zzso cells zzso are now widely used to restore zzso following high dose chemotherapy in patients with zzso We sought to identify parameters that could predict the yield of zzso after zzso with chemotherapy zzso with or without zzso zzso factor zzso in cancer zzso 

One hundred and fifty patients underwent zzso zzso collections during the recovery phase following CT with zzso zzso zzso or without zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell count were performed on peripheral blood and zzso zzso After log transformation of the data, differences between groups were assessed with the zzso zzso or one-way analysis of zzso 

zzso and two patients required 2 and 3 zzso cycles respectively to reach our target of zzso zzso In patients with zzso but not in those with zzso the yields of both zzso and zzso zzso were dramatically increased when zzso was added to CT for zzso In collections primed with CT and zzso better yields were obtained in patients with breast cancer or zzso lung zzso zzso as opposed to other solid tumors and zzso Among potential zzso factors of zzso and zzso zzso we found that the zzso cell count in peripheral blood zzso was strongly correlated with both the zzso and zzso cell zzso Except in leukemia patients, more than zzso zzso zzso were harvested when the zzso cell count in blood was above zzso Similarly, better results were obtained in collections performed when the percentage of zzso zzso in blood on the day of zzso was above 5 % or when the zzso count in blood was above zzso 

A diagnosis of breast cancer or zzso a zzso count in zzso of more than zzso more than zzso zzso zzso or more than zzso zzso zzso in zzso were associated with higher yields of zzso in collections mobilized with zzso
