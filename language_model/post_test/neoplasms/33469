Bone zzso cells, which are recruited to peripheral zzso have been shown to play a major role as zzso factor zzso Moreover, bone zzso zzso through graded zzso production, can function as the molecular hub for zzso zzso zzso Current focus on cancer zzso has centered on the intrinsic factors regulating the cell autonomous zzso of the tumor cells to the zzso site : Bone zzso cells expressing vascular zzso growth factor zzso 1 can be mobilized into the circulation due to growth factors released by the primary zzso These cells cluster at distant sites, zzso zzso zzso , where they set up a zzso ideal for tumor cells to seed, thereby completing the zzso zzso Focus on the early cellular and molecular events in cancer zzso zzso and proliferation will likely lead to new approaches to detect and prevent zzso at its earliest zzso
