zzso analysis serves multiple objectives in zzso data zzso The objectives most often emphasized are zzso of uncertainty due to systematic errors and reduction in zzso by specifying hypotheses that compete with the zzso zzso A third objective is the utility of bias analysis to identify strategies for new data collection that will be productive in evaluating the zzso of an zzso The authors illustrate the value of this objective using two zzso The first example examines the value of comprehensive zzso zzso in a study of tamoxifen zzso zzso is zzso primarily by zzso to more active zzso More than thirty zzso in the zzso gene reduce its zzso We zzso the most prevalent zzso zzso and found a zzso association between zzso and breast cancer recurrence in a Danish zzso One possibility is that incomplete zzso of the multiple functional zzso introduced zzso zzso and biased the association toward the zzso We used bias analysis to evaluate the zzso of this explanation and to guide a decision about zzso study resources toward more comprehensive zzso of other zzso in the zzso zzso The second example examines the association between vitamin K zzso zzso therapy and the zzso of 24 zzso zzso using heart valve replacement as an instrumental zzso Earlier studies suggested a protective association between zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso We observed a zzso distribution of associations, which may be due to zzso zzso of zzso therapy by the zzso We used bias analysis to evaluate whether this zzso was likely to explain the zzso distribution of associations and to guide decisions about conducting a more expensive validation zzso In the first example, the bias analysis showed that new data collection would be required to resolve the uncertainty, whereas the second example showed that new data collection was unlikely to be a productive use of scarce study zzso
