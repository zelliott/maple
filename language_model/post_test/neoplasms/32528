Because of the lack of power of zzso study designs to detect zzso zzso flexible matching has recently been proposed as a method of improving zzso In this paper, the authors consider a zzso approximation method that allows zzso of the most efficient matching strategy when zzso and exposure are either independent or zzso The authors provide tables of the sample sizes required to detect zzso interactions if this flexible matching strategy is followed, and they make brief comparisons with other study zzso
