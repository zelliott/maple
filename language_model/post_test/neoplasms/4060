Much of the public perceives that exposure to synthetic zzso zzso in the diet is a major cause of zzso The National Research Council zzso in a 1987 report, zzso zzso in Food: The Delaney zzso evaluated cancer risks for 29 pesticides that are zzso zzso and estimated that the risks for 23 were greater than zzso In contrast, our group has ranked possible zzso hazards from a variety of human zzso to zzso zzso using the zzso (Human zzso zzso index, and found that dietary zzso of synthetic pesticides ranked zzso This paper evaluates the disparities in these analyses by examining the two components of risk zzso zzso potency in zzso and human zzso zzso estimates based on zzso zzso data are shown to be similar whether zzso as in the zzso report, as the regulatory zzso or as zzso In contrast, estimates of dietary exposure to zzso of synthetic pesticides vary enormously, depending on whether they are based on the zzso zzso zzso Contribution zzso calculated by the Environmental Protection Agency zzso the average dietary zzso measured by the Food and Drug Administration in the Total Diet Study zzso The zzso is the theoretical maximum human exposure anticipated under the most severe field application conditions, which are far greater than dietary zzso measured in the zzso Several independent exposure studies suggest that the zzso dietary zzso are reasonable estimates of average human zzso whereas zzso values are large zzso Using standard methodology and measured dietary zzso in the zzso the estimate of excess cancer risk from average lifetime exposure to synthetic zzso zzso in the diet appears to be less than zzso for each of the ten pesticides for which adequate data were zzso
