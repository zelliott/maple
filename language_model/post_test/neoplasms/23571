zzso evidence supports that the zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role in protein metabolism implicated in the regulation of many biological processes such as cell cycle control, DNA damage response, zzso and so zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso signaling or functional zzso for the zzso zzso components are involved in the zzso of many diseases, particularly in cancer zzso In this zzso we first give a brief outline for the zzso zzso pathway, we then discuss with focus for the zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of cell cycle control and DNA damage response, the relevance for the altered regulation of these signaling pathways in zzso is also zzso We finally assess and zzso the advancement for targeting the zzso zzso zzso in cancer zzso A better understanding of the biological functions underlying zzso regulatory mechanisms would provide us a wider prospective on cancer zzso
