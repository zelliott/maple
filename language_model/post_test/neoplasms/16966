To assess the effectiveness of influenza vaccine in zzso adults with zzso The primary review outcome is zzso zzso preferably at the end of the influenza zzso zzso illness zzso a clinical zzso confirmed zzso pneumonia, any hospitalization and zzso mortality were defined as secondary zzso 

We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso zzso zzso and zzso databases up to August zzso We searched the following conference zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso between the years 2006 to zzso In addition, we scanned the references of all identified studies and pertinent zzso We searched the zzso of the manufacturers of influenza zzso Finally, we searched for ongoing or unpublished trials in clinical trial registry databases using the zzso 

zzso controlled trials zzso prospective and retrospective cohort studies and zzso studies were considered, comparing zzso influenza vaccines versus zzso no vaccination or a different zzso in adults (16 years and zzso with zzso We considered solid zzso treated with chemotherapy, zzso cancer patients treated or not treated with chemotherapy, cancer patients zzso (up to six months after zzso or zzso (at any zzso zzso stem cell zzso 

Two review authors independently assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from included studies adhering to Cochrane zzso zzso could not be performed because of different outcome and zzso definitions in the included zzso 

We identified four zzso one zzso and three zzso studies, including 2124 zzso One study reported results in zzso while the other three reported per zzso The studies were performed between 1993 and 2012 and included adults with zzso diseases zzso zzso patients following bone zzso transplantation (one zzso and solid zzso (three zzso Only two zzso studies reported zzso zzso one showing an adjusted hazard ratio zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso for death with vaccination and the other reporting an odds ratio zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The zzso reported a statistically significant reduction in zzso with zzso while no difference was observed in one zzso zzso zzso influenza rates were lower with vaccination in the three zzso studies, the difference reaching statistical significance in zzso zzso was observed significantly less frequently with vaccination in one zzso study, but no difference was detected in another or in the zzso The zzso showed a reduction in zzso following zzso while an zzso study found no zzso No life-threatening or persistent adverse effects from vaccination were zzso The strength of evidence is limited by the low number of included studies and by their low zzso quality zzso risk of zzso
