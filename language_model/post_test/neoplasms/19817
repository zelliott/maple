With the growing numbers of liver transplant recipients, it is increasingly important to understand the risks of de zzso zzso after liver zzso 

To characterize the zzso of de zzso zzso after liver transplantation compared with a control zzso zzso 

We studied zzso Indiana state residents undergoing liver transplantation at our center between 1997 and 2004, followed through August zzso The zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso The standardized zzso ratio zzso of cancer in our cohort was compared with zzso zzso and zzso state population using the Indiana State Cancer zzso 

After a mean follow-up of zzso zzso zzso zzso 73 patients zzso developed 80 zzso with five- and zzso zzso rates of zzso and zzso zzso These included 24 zzso skin, 16 zzso zzso and 40 zzso solid zzso The most common solid zzso were zzso Compared with matched state population, liver transplant recipients had significantly higher zzso of all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso skin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and solid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

There is a significantly increased risk of de zzso zzso after liver zzso highlighting the need for surveillance strategies in this zzso
