The processes of cellular proliferation and progressive acquisition of a specialized zzso show a high degree of zzso In particular, these complex signaling networks zzso cell growth, zzso migration, and zzso are regulated in part by zzso growth factors that can act, by zzso and/or zzso mechanisms of action, as positive or negative zzso Because these growth factors are unable to cross the zzso cell zzso they exert their effects via binding to cell surface zzso most of which possess intrinsic zzso zzso zzso zzso to the interaction of zzso growth factors with their specific zzso zzso a cascade of zzso zzso signals, resulting in the zzso and repression of various zzso of zzso is zzso One of the major incentives for studying factors that regulate processes of proliferation and differentiation is the recognition of their involvement in zzso zzso aberrations in growth factors signaling pathways are, in fact, inextricably linked to zzso zzso cells arise as a result of a zzso progression of genetic events characterized by the zzso expression of growth factors or components of their signaling zzso The main aim of this review is to examine the current understanding of the crucial contribution that several growth factors may have on zzso zzso and progression in several human tumors among the most widespread in western zzso For this purpose, we will analyze the chemistry and the molecular organization of the most important growth factors and their specific zzso In addition, we will focus on the mechanisms of signal zzso the complex cascade of zzso events zzso from the growth zzso zzso The present knowledge of the role of growth factor zzso signaling networks in cancer leads to improvements not only in diagnosis and prognosis for this disease, but also for new and more targeted therapeutic zzso The second part of this review will focus on the novel pharmacological approaches for cancer therapy that have been developed already or are being developed with the aim to specifically interfere at various steps of the growth factors signaling zzso
