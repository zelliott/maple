We present an overview of the role of zzso copy number variations zzso in cancer zzso zzso represent a significant source of genetic diversity, although the mechanisms by which they influence cancer zzso still remain largely zzso zzso 100 highly zzso zzso zzso genes are now known to cause cancer predisposition inherited in a zzso zzso in this review, we show that nearly half of these genes have also been observed as rare zzso associated with zzso However, these highly zzso zzso seem to account for less than zzso of all familial zzso We zzso that most of the genetic risk of cancer in the general population must largely involve genes of low or moderate zzso In the last 5 years, studies have demonstrated that although common low zzso zzso are modest contributors to cancer individually, their combined impact on cancer predisposition must be taken into account in zzso cancer zzso
