In the last years it has become increasingly clear that the zzso zzso is highly complex and includes a large number of small zzso zzso zzso and long zzso zzso zzso Here we review the zzso pathways of the three classes of zzso namely short interfering zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso have been extensively studied and are involved in pathways leading to specific gene zzso and the protection of zzso against virus and zzso for zzso Also, zzso have emerged as pivotal molecules for the zzso and zzso regulation of gene expression which is supported by their zzso expression patterns, zzso distribution, and zzso zzso zzso we also focus our attention on their role in differentiation and zzso zzso and zzso play critical roles in defining DNA zzso patterns, as well as zzso zzso thus having a substantial effect in zzso The identification of some zzso in their zzso pathways and functional roles raises the hypothesis that these molecules play concerted functions in zzso creating complex regulatory networks where cooperation with regulatory proteins is zzso We also highlighted the implications of zzso and gene expression deregulation of zzso and zzso in human diseases like zzso
