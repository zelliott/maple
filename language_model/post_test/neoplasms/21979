zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso stem cell transplantation zzso is often zzso Standard therapy with high-dose zzso is not always zzso There is paucity of data in the literature about other potentially useful agents, such as zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso We zzso reviewed our data on 115 consecutive patients who underwent zzso and had pulmonary zzso with the aim of determining the overall clinical outcome in recipients of zzso transplants and in the zzso of these patients who were treated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid was added at the discretion of the attending zzso We identified 14 zzso transplant recipients zzso age, 41 zzso with 15 episodes of zzso who were treated with zzso zzso zzso to 1 g zzso per zzso Of these, 8 patients also received zzso zzso acid at 1000 zzso zzso every 6 zzso Failure to improve was the most common reason for adding zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso zzso in zzso versus zzso in zzso zzso The overall zzso zzso mortality and median transplantation survival were zzso and 99 days, zzso Among the subset of patients treated with the combination of zzso and zzso acid, we observed a zzso zzso mortality and median transplantation survival of zzso and 167 days, respectively, compared with zzso and zzso days in those treated with zzso zzso The median time to zzso was zzso days, and the median time to death was 53 days in the combined treatment group compared with zzso days in those treated with steroid zzso There were no significant differences in zzso parameters between zzso zzso zzso respiratory zzso virus, zzso zzso virus, and zzso were isolated and treated from 6 diagnostic zzso zzso zzso samples and were more common in the zzso treated with zzso zzso Respiratory failure was the documented cause of death in zzso of zzso There were no clinically significant side effects from zzso zzso Although these historically lower zzso outcomes are intriguing, prospective studies are needed to confirm the role of zzso acid in zzso occurring in the zzso transplantation zzso
