The reconstruction of large, complex defects of the abdominal wall after the zzso of zzso zzso can be zzso The transfer of an zzso thigh zzso zzso is an attractive zzso This study compared free zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for abdominal wall zzso 

From 1996 through 2011, 20 patients underwent abdominal wall reconstruction with zzso zzso The zzso were zzso in 12 patients and free in eight zzso Medical records were reviewed for complications and clinical and demographic zzso zzso wall defects were classified into the following four groups: upper zzso lower zzso upper zzso and lower zzso 

zzso zzso were transferred to the upper zzso region in one patient, the lower zzso region in six patients and lower zzso in five zzso Free zzso were transferred to the lower zzso region in two patients, upper zzso in four patients and lower zzso in two zzso Mean zzso time was significantly longer with free zzso (6 h 32 zzso than with zzso zzso (4 h 55 zzso p zzso zzso Although free zzso zzso size, 360 zzso were larger than zzso zzso zzso size, zzso zzso the difference was not significant zzso zzso zzso The rates of complications did not differ between free zzso and zzso zzso No total zzso loss occurred, and there was partial loss of only a single zzso zzso which was the zzso furthest from the zzso zzso zzso developed of two zzso zzso and three free zzso 

This study suggests that complication rates do not differ between free and zzso zzso zzso The choice of zzso depends on the size and location of the zzso and the length of the vascular zzso
