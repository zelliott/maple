The development of zzso zzso models in cancer chemotherapy has been extremely zzso A population approach was used to develop such a model to describe the effect of zzso zzso zzso via its active zzso zzso on zzso zzso depletion in peripheral zzso zzso The Phase I trial zzso escalating doses of zzso from 5 to 17 zzso as a multiple infusion zzso The population model consisted of a linear zzso zzso model coupled to an indirect response zzso The indirect response model consisted of a zzso compartment with input and output rate processes that are modulated as a function of zzso and zzso zzso The model predicted the observed gradual depletion of zzso a zzso at approximately 30 h after the last dose of zzso and a return to baseline zzso zzso On the basis of an zzso estimate of about zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso the target zzso of zzso the population model predicted near identical zzso concentration time profiles over the dose range zzso zzso zzso models are seen as a powerful means to design dosing regimens and to provide a mathematical platform for zzso based zzso
