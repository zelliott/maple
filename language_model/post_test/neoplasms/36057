zzso zzso zzso zzso has been accepted as a promising zzso in the treatment of tumors in zzso zzso such as liver tumors and zzso However, zzso for treatment of tumors in low zzso zzso has been seldom zzso The aim of this study was to determine the feasibility and safety of zzso for the treatment of tumors in low zzso zzso in a rabbit zzso 

Fifteen rabbits with zzso tumors implanted zzso underneath the right second zzso were divided into a zzso group zzso and a control group zzso zzso was performed with output power of 40 W for one to two zzso The therapeutic efficacy was evaluated by magnetic resonance imaging zzso physical zzso survival rate, and zzso The zzso outcome after zzso was also zzso 

In the zzso group, tumor zzso was achieved in six rabbits zzso without any evidence of tumor recurrence and zzso as proven by zzso and zzso zzso The mean greatest and shortest tumor diameters of these six rabbits were zzso and zzso zzso zzso Slight zzso zzso which proved zzso were found in seven rabbits zzso The zzso group had a significantly longer survival than those in the control group zzso The four rabbits with zzso tumors survived more than three months with their tumors becoming zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso is feasible and safe in the treatment of tumors in low zzso zzso in a rabbit zzso Attention should be paid to avoid skin burns with zzso
