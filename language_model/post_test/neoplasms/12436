The expression of zzso zzso fragments on the surface of zzso cells has recently emerged as a therapeutic strategy, particularly in the treatment of a number of zzso zzso technologies that allow for the facile characterization of fragments expressed on the cell surface would zzso the identification and isolation of zzso to be used as zzso In this report, we describe a cellular zzso platform for the comparative functional analysis of zzso zzso zzso expressed on the plasma membrane of zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a model system, the native binding site and three zzso were expressed as zzso on the membrane of zzso zzso cells in a zzso zzso zzso the equilibrium zzso zzso of the soluble forms of the zzso zzso and the three zzso spanned nearly 3 orders of zzso zzso of the zzso on the surface of zzso cells was achieved by the deposition of zzso zzso in zzso spots onto the surface of a glass microscope zzso The addition of cells to the printed array resulted in the expression of the zzso in clusters of cells in zzso discrete zzso zzso binding zzso performed with a zzso serum zzso zzso demonstrated the ability of the zzso cell zzso to differentiate the relative binding affinities of the expressed zzso Further, the apparent affinities of the zzso zzso were within zzso of those reported for the soluble forms of the zzso The zzso described zzso demonstrate the potential for cellular zzso to be used for the zzso screening of potential therapeutic zzso More generally, our work details the utility of zzso cell zzso in zzso the functional characterization of expressed membrane zzso zzso
