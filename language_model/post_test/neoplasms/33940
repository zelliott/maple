The lack of efficient zzso zzso of tumors is a major obstacle to successful adoptive zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso expression in tumors can significantly enhance zzso tumor zzso In this study, active zzso zzso T cells were prepared by zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells from transgenic OT I mice with zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso These zzso and zzso T cells predominantly zzso zzso and displayed significant killing activity zzso at zzso cell ratio of zzso against zzso zzso tumor cells through zzso zzso Our data also showed that zzso zzso and zzso not only can zzso but also stimulate proliferation of zzso T cells in zzso and that a mixture of zzso and zzso can more efficiently zzso zzso T cells than either one of zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that the transferred zzso T cells detected in group of tumors treated with both zzso and zzso zzso a) are around 4 and 2 times more than that in groups of tumors treated with control zzso zzso b) and either zzso zzso c) or zzso zzso zzso zzso Around zzso of mice in group a were zzso compared to the aggressive tumor growth in all 8 mice of group b and zzso or zzso cured mice seen in groups c and d zzso Thus, our results indicate that enhancement of adoptive zzso therapy can be obtained by double zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso through proliferation and zzso of the transferred zzso T cells by in zzso zzso zzso expressions in the zzso zzso our data provide solid evidence of a potent zzso between adoptive zzso therapy and zzso zzso and zzso gene transfer into tumor zzso which culminated in the zzso tumor zzso and zzso of well-established tumor zzso
