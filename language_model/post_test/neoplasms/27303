Based on gene sequence zzso a zzso zzso gene family become apparent with the addition of the most recently identified zzso zzso formerly zzso and zzso zzso genes to the already known zzso The zzso gene encodes for a unique protein zzso well-known tumor zzso gene zzso properties that mediate cellular response to DNA damage, zzso cell cycle arrest or zzso In contrast, both zzso specify an array of zzso different in their zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso show zzso properties similar to zzso while zzso lacking zzso zzso domain such as zzso induce a functional block against zzso as well as zzso zzso Both zzso types of zzso are involved in development: zzso is critical for zzso stem cell renewal and zzso zzso and zzso is involved in zzso and natural immune zzso These facts support zzso functions for the zzso family members, which appear linked together in a complex and tight regulation network to fulfill cellular functions related to DNA damage and tissue zzso zzso The lack of zzso zzso in human zzso rule out a typical zzso role for either of the zzso zzso Nonetheless, zzso and zzso genes seem strongly involved in zzso acquisition and maintenance process because of: 1) their tissue zzso and 2) their close interplay activities within the zzso family members, and primarily through the negative regulatory role played by zzso zzso for cell death control and zzso
