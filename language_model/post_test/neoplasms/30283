The zzso pathway, which signals through the zzso zzso zzso family and several zzso has long been implicated in zzso Here we demonstrate a therapeutic approach to targeting the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso This zzso initially identified by binding to zzso 7, interacts with five zzso receptors through a zzso zzso within the zzso domain and blocks zzso zzso signaling induced by multiple zzso family zzso In zzso studies with minimally zzso human tumors, this zzso zzso the growth of a range of tumor types, reduces zzso cell frequency, and exhibits synergistic activity with zzso zzso zzso
