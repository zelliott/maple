zzso of exposure and biological effects have frequently been used to monitor populations for their exposure to toxic substances and for the prediction of disease risk, such as zzso Current interest is focused on improving the use of zzso to better understand biological mechanisms for improved risk zzso Such improvements involve the understanding of zzso variations in response to exposure, integration of zzso and zzso technologies into zzso studies, development of functional zzso and the use of high tech procedures like zzso and zzso zzso The latter two approaches can provide unique contributions by providing specific and real-time reporting of excessive zzso Based on the generation of more reliable information regarding zzso effects, biological mechanisms, and health risk, more realistic prevention and intervention protocols have been zzso The usefulness and application of these zzso and technologies will be zzso
