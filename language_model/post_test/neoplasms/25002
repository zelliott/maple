zzso zzso zzso with unique zzso zzso zzso properties have recently been zzso explored as novel contrast agents for zzso biomedical zzso In this work, we zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso grafted zzso zzso The zzso zzso are loaded with a commonly used chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso by simple physical zzso via a zzso chemistry approach for zzso drug zzso The loading and releasing of zzso from zzso are controlled by varying zzso with an increased drug zzso rate in zzso environment, favorable for controlled drug zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging by a modified laser scanning zzso microscope reveals the time course of zzso delivery of zzso by zzso It is found that zzso is shuttled into cells by the zzso zzso carrier and released inside cells after zzso By zzso zzso with zzso acid, which targets folate receptors over expressed on various types of cancer cells, we further demonstrate targeted drug delivery and zzso cell imaging with zzso Besides zzso this zzso drug loading strategy can also be used for loading of zzso molecules on zzso for potential zzso light induced zzso zzso Our results suggest the promise of zzso as interesting zzso carriers for zzso cancer therapy and zzso
