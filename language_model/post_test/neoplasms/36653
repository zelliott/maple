The last few years have seen the development of a branch of zzso gene therapy which aims at strengthening the immune surveillance of the body, leading to zzso of zzso cancer tumor cells and zzso zzso after surgical removal of the primary zzso Such a tumor vaccination protocol calls for zzso of the primary tumor tissue and the zzso of one of three types of genes into the isolated cultured tumor cells followed by zzso of the zzso or zzso cells to render them incapable of further zzso The cells so treated constitute the zzso zzso A review of the literature suggests that for mouse models, in the initial period after zzso rejection of the tumor cells is usually zzso by zzso zzso whereas the long-term systemic immune response is based on zzso zzso High expression of the gene inserted into the tumor cells may be critical for the success of the vaccination zzso Examples are given which indicate that zzso a procedure to introduce genes by zzso zzso zzso meets some important zzso for successful application of this type of gene zzso
