Cancer patients could benefit from a surgical procedure that helps the surgeon to determine adequate tumor zzso zzso zzso injection of zzso zzso agents with subsequent zzso optical imaging can guide the surgeon in this zzso However, tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, determination of adequate zzso margins can be very challenging due to invasive tumor strands that are difficult to resolve and because of the zzso effect of variations in tissue optical properties in the surgical zzso We provide an overview of the zzso zzso of imaging zzso targets or zzso zzso zzso and explain the limitations of these targeting zzso It is proposed that problems of tumor zzso can theoretically be zzso by shifting focus of tumor targeting towards the zzso hormone zzso zzso Furthermore, we discuss why objective determination of zzso margins is required to improve zzso of the invasive zzso a goal that may be achieved by targeting the zzso When invasive strands would nevertheless extend beyond such a standardized zzso margin, we suggest that zzso zzso therapy would be a very suitable therapeutic zzso Finally, we describe how point optical zzso can be used to scrutinize suspect tissue that is difficult to differentiate from normal tissue by measuring the local tissue optical properties to recover a local intrinsic zzso zzso
