zzso zzso activity is high in populations of cells that are zzso and is low or zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso in zzso that normally lack the capacity for zzso is strongly correlated with zzso zzso activity can be detected in samples containing very small numbers of cells and studies of human patients suggest that measurement of zzso activity may be useful for the evaluation of samples that can be obtained in a minimally invasive zzso This study compares the presence or absence of zzso activity with zzso evaluation of body cavity zzso to determine if zzso is the underlying cause for the zzso in dogs and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso was no more sensitive than zzso evaluation for the identification of underlying zzso and was less specific zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso sensitivity zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso We conclude that although the zzso zzso may constitute a useful zzso test for the diagnosis of zzso in some dogs and cats with body cavity zzso the results of this zzso are not sufficiently reliable to be used as a sole diagnostic zzso
