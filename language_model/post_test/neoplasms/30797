Human peripheral blood zzso were analyzed for expression of zzso zzso using zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso from healthy donors were shown to express variable levels of zzso This expression was rapidly zzso after the removal of the cells from the circulating zzso In zzso culture of zzso abolished zzso zzso which could be zzso by addition of zzso to the culture zzso zzso expression of zzso was instead demonstrated in zzso zzso zzso from normal donors and from a zzso zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso confirmed that zzso expression occurs both in zzso and in zzso from peripheral zzso These findings show that zzso can actively contribute to zzso expression in the peripheral blood and suggest their role in the zzso limb of the immune response, since by zzso production they might zzso zzso and zzso functions, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
