Previously, a gender dependency of zzso was found in the zzso in the plasma zzso Here, we zzso studied the red blood cell zzso zzso of zzso and evaluated its consequences for overall drug zzso Blood samples were obtained from 12 patients receiving zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed in whole blood, plasma and zzso zzso slower clearance was noted in females zzso compared to males zzso for zzso and total zzso in plasma zzso and for total drug in zzso zzso but not in whole zzso In addition, no zzso differences were observed in the terminal zzso of zzso in any of the zzso The area under the curve ratios for zzso total to plasma zzso were zzso and zzso in males and zzso zzso zzso zzso displays preferential affinity for zzso compared to zzso although these cells do not act as a depot in which drug accumulates over zzso zzso thus play a principal role in the distribution zzso of zzso and have a major impact on its plasma zzso The data warrant a change from current practice in zzso studies with this agent and provide further evidence that, in general, the choice of the appropriate zzso zzso should be rationally zzso
