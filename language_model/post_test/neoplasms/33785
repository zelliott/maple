A procedure involving the use of the reducing agent zzso aluminum hydride zzso has been designed to explore the nature of the zzso linkages in the zzso component of zzso zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso were used to determine the reduction zzso The results are consistent with a structure wherein zzso linkages join zzso zzso The presence of minor amounts of zzso zzso was confirmed, and their origin was determined through the application of the chemical reduction process to zzso An increased proportion of zzso zzso was detected during storage of zzso at room temperature or zzso The commercial product zzso II, presumably an zzso preparation enriched in the zzso zzso was found to contain approximately 50% zzso zzso This product therefore differs from the corresponding fraction of freshly prepared zzso
