The aim of this study was to first calculate the zzso effect from zzso radiation by the presence of zzso contrast media using zzso Carlo simulations, and then provide in zzso zzso for this novel method of zzso zzso 

The zzso Carlo program zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to simulate the interaction of zzso radiation with zzso zzso or zzso zzso containing contrast zzso zzso the zzso effect induced by I or zzso was evaluated in cell culture zzso using zzso peptides zzso with zzso emitting zzso and clinically available contrast zzso 

zzso Carlo simulations predicted significant enhancement zzso zzso of radiation dose in the presence of high zzso contrast zzso This enhancement is radiation and zzso zzso zzso showed that in the presence of contrast media, low-energy zzso favor zzso of secondary zzso whereas higher energy zzso zzso zzso radiation by reducing the zzso of the primary zzso The dose enhancement was verified in zzso in two cell zzso 

zzso Carlo simulations in parallel with in zzso studies provide zzso for dose enhancement that occurs when utilizing an zzso source of radiation followed by the addition of zzso contrast zzso This dose enhancement is both radiation and zzso zzso
