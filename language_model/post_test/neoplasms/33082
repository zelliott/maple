Driving high-level zzso expression in a zzso manner remains a key requirement in the development of cancer gene zzso We have previously demonstrated the strong zzso effects of generating zzso high levels of zzso zzso following the zzso of the zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso Much of this work has focused on utilizing zzso activated zzso which have been primarily induced using X-ray zzso Here we further examine the potential of the zzso promoter, zzso a combination of nine zzso zzso zzso to drive the zzso zzso zzso of X-ray zzso on promoter activity were compared in zzso under zzso conditions and various degrees of zzso The zzso promoter generated high-level zzso zzso comparable with that achieved using the zzso driven zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso cells exposed to zzso and zzso zzso was effectively eliminated following zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso growth was also observed in zzso following direct zzso injection of the zzso construct compared to empty zzso alone zzso or to a single radiation dose of 10 zzso zzso The combination of both therapies resulted in a significant zzso day growth delay compared to the gene therapy treatment alone zzso In zzso we have demonstrated the potential of the zzso construct for reducing zzso zzso by zzso cell zzso in zzso and in zzso with greater zzso growth delay observed following the treatment with the gene therapy construct as compared with zzso zzso
