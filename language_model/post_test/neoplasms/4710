Memory T cells exhibit tremendous zzso specificity within the immune system and accumulate with zzso Our studies reveal an zzso expansion of memory, but not zzso zzso T cells after several zzso regimens for cancer resulting in a distinctive zzso Signaling through zzso receptors zzso or zzso in both mouse and human memory zzso T cells markedly zzso programmed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and led to zzso tumor cell zzso In contrast, exposure to zzso alone in zzso or with zzso in zzso did not zzso these markers but resulted in expanded memory zzso T cells expressing zzso zzso B, and possessing broadly zzso zzso zzso of zzso in mice also resulted in significantly diminished zzso effects after zzso Treatment of zzso mice bearing zzso expressing tumors with zzso still resulted in significant zzso zzso Human melanoma tissue zzso obtained from patients after zzso applied zzso treatment resulted in increased numbers of these zzso zzso cells within the tumor zzso These findings demonstrate that memory zzso T cells can express differential zzso indicative of zzso or innate zzso based on the nature of the stimuli in a process zzso across zzso
