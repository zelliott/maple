To investigate the relationship between the cumulative duration of exposure to zzso drugs and the risk of developing and/or dying from zzso in patients with rheumatic diseases attending rheumatology practices throughout zzso 

Patients with rheumatic diseases who first started an zzso drug between 1979 and 1990 were zzso They were followed annually for up to 10 years through their zzso Information was collected on vital status, the development of zzso and starting and stopping dates of zzso zzso zzso of observation were attributed to one of 4 groups according to the cumulative duration of exposure to zzso Age and sex adjusted zzso rate ratios zzso were calculated by comparing each of the higher 3 groups with the baseline exposure zzso 

In total zzso patients, from 15 countries, contributed zzso zzso of zzso The principal drugs used were zzso methotrexate, zzso and zzso Patients in the highest cumulative exposure group had an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of developing a zzso of the immune system or skin or zzso cancer compared to those in the lowest zzso A similar pattern was seen when the analysis was confined to patients who took only zzso The risk estimates were unchanged after adjustment for disease duration since first zzso 

In addition to any increased risk of zzso that may be zzso by individual rheumatic diseases, there is a further risk of specific types of zzso that is related to the duration of exposure to zzso zzso
