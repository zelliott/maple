When zzso cells grow in confined spaces in zzso they exert a finite force on the surrounding tissue resulting in the generation of solid zzso By growing zzso zzso in zzso gels of defined mechanical properties, we have recently shown that solid stress zzso the growth of zzso and that this zzso stress ranges from 45 to 120 zzso Here we show that solid stress zzso the formation of zzso in the highly zzso zzso zzso rat prostate zzso zzso cells, which predominantly do not grow as zzso in free zzso The maximum size and the growth rate of the resulting zzso decreased with increasing zzso zzso solid stress by zzso zzso of gels resulted in gradual loss of zzso zzso in 8 zzso In contrast, the low zzso zzso zzso cells, which grow as zzso in free suspension as well as in the gels, maintained their zzso zzso even after stress zzso zzso examination revealed that most cells in zzso zzso are in close zzso whereas a regular zzso separates the cells in the zzso gel zzso zzso with the zzso binding protein revealed that the zzso between zzso cells in zzso contained zzso while zzso cells had negligible or no zzso when grown in free zzso zzso was found to be present in both free suspensions and zzso gel zzso of zzso We suggest that zzso zzso may be adequate for zzso formation, whereas solid stress may be required to form zzso when zzso zzso is zzso These findings have significant implications for zzso growth, invasion and zzso
