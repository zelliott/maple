zzso therapy is one of the oldest treatments available for cancer zzso Since the discovery of zzso and zzso in the zzso patients have been treated with zzso Advances in equipment and in the understanding of zzso permit delivery of effective doses of radiation to tumors while minimizing normal tissue zzso Recent advances in radiation have expanded the scope of zzso zzso zzso radiation, such as zzso treatment, permits treatment of zzso disease in an effective and zzso manner in patients too ill to travel for zzso Total skin electron therapy has been successful in managing extensive skin zzso zzso treatment is an experimental approach that attempts to achieve better tumor control by treating with two zzso per zzso zzso radiation is a zzso sound but zzso cumbersome plan in which treatment is given in a single fraction at the time of zzso Its full potential may be realized when the technical difficulties of administration can be zzso zzso is the use of radioactive sources implanted directly into the tumor or in a cavity in proximity to the zzso zzso have improved in both surgery and radiation, which allow previously zzso sites such as the brain to be zzso zzso breast cancer has been effectively managed with zzso followed by zzso zzso is the use of heat in conjunction with zzso Heat has been found to enhance the effect of radiation and limit the repair of radiation zzso The properties of heat cause it to be more damaging to tumor cells than to normal zzso The ability to sensitize cancer cells to radiation and protect normal cells from radiation has been an ongoing research zzso Clinical trials are in progress to isolate effective, easily zzso and nontoxic zzso The nurse caring for the patient receiving radiation must have an understanding of how radiation works and what the treatment goals are for the zzso zzso is a difficult zzso for patients to zzso Many fears and concerns are based on this lack of zzso The nurse must be prepared to describe the experience of receiving radiation and assist patients to anticipate and manage side zzso Patients need to know what to expect from therapy in terms they can zzso Recent advances and experimental treatments should be explained in terms of what is known including the rationale for the zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
