Recently, many agents have been identified that target molecular pathways that can mitigate radiation zzso To date, no drugs have been approved as radiation injury zzso which are defined as agents administered after zzso but before toxicity is zzso In order to accelerate the application of potential zzso for cancer patients, a meeting sponsored by the National Cancer Institute zzso and National Institute of zzso and zzso Diseases zzso was held in January zzso This article presents an zzso to guide clinical trials for such agents in patients receiving zzso or zzso It reviews the mechanisms of radiation injury, the clinical problem, the zzso and clinical development of candidate agents, and the design and conduct of clinical zzso The central role of patient reported outcomes is zzso as well as key lessons learned from prior clinical zzso Ultimately, the goal is to be able to apply such promising agents to improve the quality of life for patients receiving zzso or zzso for zzso
