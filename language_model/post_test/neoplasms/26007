A rapid and sensitive zzso liquid zzso zzso method has been developed to determine tissue distribution of zzso acid in zzso The method involved zzso of these samples with zzso volumes zzso of zzso zzso and then 5 zzso zzso of the zzso were injected onto a zzso zzso column coupled with an zzso zzso zzso The mobile phase employed zzso zzso with zzso zzso for 10 zzso the zzso was zzso zzso The column zzso was analyzed by selected zzso monitoring for the negative zzso zzso of zzso acid zzso at zzso zzso The limit of detection for zzso acid in biological samples by this method was approximately zzso zzso and the zzso of variation of the zzso zzso and zzso were generally low zzso zzso When zzso mice bearing human melanoma were treated with zzso acid zzso zzso zzso distribution was as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blood, zzso zzso zzso zzso No interference was noted due to zzso zzso These methods of analysis should be of value in future studies related to the development and characterization of zzso zzso
