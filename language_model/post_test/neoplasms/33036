A pilot study was carried out in the zzso NC zzso nuclear facility in order to investigate a possible zzso effect of internal radiation exposure among nuclear workers in zzso The objective of this study was to develop a method for retrospective reconstruction of the occupational exposure to internal radiation from uranium and associated chemical zzso 

A zzso and zzso job exposure zzso zzso was zzso Job groups and exposure agents groups including uranium compounds and other chemical agents known as being zzso zzso or toxic were defined by an expert zzso Exposure was evaluated by active and retired workers included in the zzso zzso A quantitative assignment of quantity and frequency of handling (both coded from 0 to 3) was performed for each agent groups using a method derived from the zzso zzso 

In all, 23 experts and 353 zzso participated to the zzso zzso A final zzso involved 232 zzso presenting throughout the plant period zzso and 22 exposure agents groups in use at the zzso Six of them involved uranium compounds classified by their zzso and toxicity zzso A first validation of the zzso by experts in zzso protection and industrial hygiene showed an acceptable internal zzso 

In the context of missing past exposure measurement data, the zzso and zzso job exposure zzso may be considered as a valid alternative for exposure zzso This method may be applied to other nuclear plants and offers allowance to investigate a possible zzso effect of internal radiation exposure among nuclear zzso
