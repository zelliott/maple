zzso we propose that viral infection can induce a deficient cell stress response and thereby zzso stress tolerance and makes zzso vulnerable to zzso Having a valid paradigm to address the pathological impacts of viral infections could lead to effective new therapies for diseases that have previously been unresponsive to zzso Host response to viral infections can also lead to zzso diseases like type 1 zzso In the case of zzso disease virus, the effects of viral infection on heat shock proteins may be leveraged as a therapy for zzso Finally, the search for a specific virus being responsible for a condition like chronic fatigue syndrome may not be worthwhile if the disease is simply a zzso response to viral zzso
