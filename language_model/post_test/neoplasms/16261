Identification of zzso zzso and progress in the induction and control of zzso zzso immune responses have led to renewed interest in zzso as a treatment for severe zzso such as cancer and zzso zzso Reliable procedures for detecting and monitoring T cell responses induced by the treatment throughout a clinical trial are needed in order to design rational protocols with increased zzso We have attempted to develop such a procedure by combining T cell sorting using zzso complexes zzso on magnetic beads together with the quantitative zzso zzso Once a recruited patient has been typed for zzso and target zzso relevant zzso zzso can be selected and used for sorting specific peripheral T cells prior to any treatment and at the peak of the expected response to zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso zzso of the specific T cell clones can then be designed and used for measuring the frequency of their zzso transcripts by quantitative zzso on blood samples or T cell zzso throughout the zzso In reconstruction experiments as well as in samples from one zzso arthritis patient, we were readily able to detect and follow several T cell clones with a frequency as low as zzso among zzso T zzso The main advantages of this procedure over other currently available zzso are that it does not require any assumptions on the functional status of the specific T cells and it permits the monitoring of individual T cell clones whose zzso shift can thus be zzso
