The objectives of this study were to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the detection of primary tumors in patients presenting with zzso of unknown primary zzso unidentified by conventional zzso and to compare the statistical difference between the zzso and zzso zzso studies zzso a total of 910 zzso published between 1990 and 2007 were zzso These studies evaluated the role of zzso and zzso in the detection of unknown primary tumors after physical examination and conventional zzso failed to detect a primary zzso zzso methods were used to zzso zzso and evaluate the zzso quality of the studies as well as to zzso the overall findings of sensitivity, zzso and detection capacity of the primary zzso The overall sensitivity and specificity of zzso in detecting unknown primary tumors were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso detected zzso of tumors that were not apparent after zzso failed to be detected by conventional zzso Data were collected on the locations of primary tumors detected by zzso in 17 studies and detected by zzso in seven zzso zzso from the base of the tongue accounted for zzso (six of 29) of all zzso zzso scans, corresponding to a zzso rate of zzso (six of 29), much higher than tumors from the zzso zzso exhibited a lower sensitivity with respect to the tumors at the base of the tongue and zzso which was zzso and zzso zzso In the eight studies with 430 patients diagnosed with zzso by zzso zzso zzso of primary tumors were zzso The pooled sensitivity and specificity were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can detect primary tumors that went zzso by physical examination and conventional zzso zzso exhibited lower sensitivity with respect to the tumors at the base of the tongue and the zzso
