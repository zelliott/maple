Small amounts of free DNA circulate in both healthy and diseased human zzso and increased zzso of DNA are present in the plasma of cancer zzso zzso of zzso DNA have been found in genetic material extracted from the plasma of cancer zzso These features include decreased strand stability and the presence of specific zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso Point zzso of the zzso genes have been detected in the plasma DNA of patients suffering from zzso zzso zzso and pancreatic cancer, sometimes prior to clinical zzso zzso zzso heavy chain DNA has been found in the plasma of patients with zzso zzso and acute B cell zzso zzso instability, expressed either as a new zzso or a loss of one zzso zzso occurs in the plasma and serum DNA of patients suffering from head and neck, lung and zzso cell zzso The results obtained in many different zzso have opened a new research area indicating that plasma DNA might eventually be a suitable target for the development of zzso zzso zzso and follow-up tests for zzso
