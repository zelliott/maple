zzso is an established zzso marker with which to detect zzso The objective of the current study was to evaluate the use of zzso in the diagnosis of zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

The authors evaluated zzso specimens of zzso in which zzso zzso was performed on zzso cell block sections or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso was considered to be zzso The zzso results were correlated with the zzso diagnoses and clinical follow-up zzso 

A total of 215 zzso and zzso were identified zzso blocks in 162 cases, zzso preparations in 53 cases, and both in 2 cases in which zzso zzso was zzso A total of 94 zzso of the 215 cases were found to be positive for zzso including 87 zzso zzso zzso were positive for zzso in 76 zzso 55 cell blocks and 21 zzso zzso of 87 cases of zzso zzso Eleven cases of zzso zzso were found to be negative for zzso (4 cases from lung tumors, 2 from stomach tumors, 2 from colon tumors, 2 from breast tumors, and 1 from a zzso zzso zzso and/or focal zzso zzso for zzso was noted in zzso of cases of zzso zzso zzso The sensitivity of zzso for zzso zzso was zzso the specificity was zzso the negative zzso value was zzso and the positive zzso value was zzso 

zzso alone was found to be highly sensitive for distinguishing zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso in zzso zzso Interpreting zzso zzso zzso as positive can help prevent confusion between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso 2011 American Cancer zzso
