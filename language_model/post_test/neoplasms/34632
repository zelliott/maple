Cellular transformation is initiated by genetic and zzso zzso that activate zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso thus arise when zzso cells escape intrinsic and zzso tumor zzso mechanisms in the context of their cellular zzso Given the well established importance of the immune system at controlling and shaping developing tumors, pointing the different strategies of tumor escape may provide important insights for the development of effective cancer zzso In respect, a better understanding of the molecular interactions between tumors and the host immune system may thus allow the development of novel integrated approaches based on the simultaneous control of tumor escape pathways and the zzso of zzso immune zzso We zzso review the currently known escape strategies developed by tumors and discuss the very limited success of trials using active zzso with vaccines or adoptive zzso conducted to date, with a focus on potential therapeutic zzso We believe that the induction of clinically relevant zzso immunity and tumor rejection require an orchestrated set of events that are thus far impossible to activate by a single zzso zzso combining zzso with conventional therapies may help in breaking down the existing zzso
