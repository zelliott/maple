The evidence from recent studies demonstrates that a zzso can predict morbidity and mortality in older patients with zzso zzso data show the benefits of incorporating a zzso in the evaluation of older patients with zzso Prospective trials evaluating the utility of a zzso to guide interventions to improve the quality of cancer care in older adults are zzso 

Growing evidence demonstrates that the variables examined in a zzso can predict morbidity and mortality in older patients with cancer, and uncover problems relevant to cancer care that would otherwise go zzso
