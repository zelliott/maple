zzso is an important natural zzso that can selectively kill cancer cells at pharmacological zzso Despite its benefit, it is quite difficult to predict the zzso effects of zzso because the relative zzso of zzso differs between cancer cell zzso zzso it is essential to examine the basis for this fundamental zzso Because zzso is activated by zzso stress and then regulates various cellular conditions, we hypothesized that zzso can sensitize cancer cells to zzso Using zzso cancer cells, we observed that the presence of zzso can affect zzso zzso and also zzso of zzso can make cancer cells sensitive to zzso zzso enhancement of zzso zzso is caused by increased zzso oxygen species generation via a zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso We also found that zzso activated zzso was derived from zzso zzso by zzso and subsequently its signaling network renders cancer cells more susceptible to zzso zzso Similar to the zzso effect on in zzso zzso zzso zzso of tumor growth is also stronger in zzso tumors than in zzso ones in zzso This is the first observation that zzso zzso is positively related to zzso zzso zzso its zzso network to zzso zzso zzso stress and consequently enhancing its zzso Based on our study, zzso of zzso may help to achieve more consistent zzso effects of zzso in cancer zzso
