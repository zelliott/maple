zzso zzso rhythms result from a complex organization involving molecular clocks within nearly all zzso cells and a dedicated zzso system, which coordinates the so-called zzso zzso The core of the central clock system is constituted by the zzso zzso that are located on the floor of the zzso Our understanding of the mechanisms of zzso rhythm generation and coordination processes has grown rapidly over the past few zzso In zzso we have zzso how to use the predictable changes in cellular metabolism or proliferation along the zzso time scale in order to improve treatment outcome for a variety of diseases, including zzso The zzso of zzso diseases has emerged as a result of a consistent development ranging from zzso clinical, and technological zzso to zzso clinical trials of zzso delivery zzso zzso large zzso zzso characterize the zzso of zzso agents in mice or rats, a better efficacy usually results from treatment administration near the least toxic zzso time in zzso tumor zzso zzso in time zzso pumps have allowed to test the zzso concepts in cancer patients and to implement zzso delivery schedules in current zzso Clinical phase I and II trials have established the zzso the safety, and the activity of the zzso schedules, so that this treatment method has undergone further evaluation in international zzso phase III zzso Overall, more than 2,000 patients with zzso disease have been registered in zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or better zzso activity have been demonstrated in zzso zzso studies involving large patient zzso The relation between zzso zzso and quality of life and even survival has also been a puzzling finding over the recent zzso An essential step toward further developments of zzso therapy has been the recent constitution of a zzso cooperative group within the European Organization for Research and Treatment of zzso This group now involves over 40 institutions in 12 zzso It is conducting currently six trials and preparing four new zzso The 19 contributions in this special issue reflect the current status and perspectives of the several components of cancer zzso
