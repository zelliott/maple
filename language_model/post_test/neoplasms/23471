Scaffolding proteins such as zzso zzso are thought to control zzso signaling pathways by regulating key zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in many human zzso often associated with promoter zzso or the loss of its locus at zzso zzso with progression to zzso and zzso The forced zzso of zzso in cancer cell lines suppresses in zzso parameters of zzso growth, zzso and cell zzso through its ability to scaffold protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and possibly through additional scaffolding zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso in tumor models results in zzso suppression through the zzso of zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso The current review will describe the emerging understanding of how zzso regulates cellular zzso and zzso progression at the level of tumor cells and zzso zzso via its multiple scaffolding zzso
