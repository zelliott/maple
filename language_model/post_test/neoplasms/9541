Conventional zzso harbor zzso changes that could be subdivided into four, usually mutually zzso zzso zzso in particular through zzso of zzso bands zzso resulting in deregulation of the zzso zzso loss of material from or zzso of zzso 13, zzso ring or giant marker zzso and aberrations of zzso band zzso In the present study, 272 conventional zzso two-thirds of them zzso with acquired zzso zzso changes were assessed with regard to zzso and clinical zzso A zzso distribution of zzso and imbalances could be confirmed, with zzso of the cases harboring one or more of the previously known zzso zzso zzso with clinical features revealed that zzso with zzso markers were larger, occurred in older patients, were more often zzso and seemed to have an increased tendency to recur locally, compared with tumors with other zzso zzso The possible involvement of the zzso gene in cases that did not show any of the characteristic zzso changes was further evaluated by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealing zzso cryptic disruption of the gene but abundant expression of full length or truncated zzso By zzso we could also show that zzso in bands zzso do not affect the zzso zzso whereas zzso in zzso or zzso occasionally target the zzso or zzso zzso respectively, also in conventional zzso
