Recently, the binding ability of DNA on GO and resulting zzso resistance have attracted increasing attention, leading to new applications both in zzso and in zzso In zzso zzso acids absorbed on GO can be effectively protected from zzso degradation and biological interference in complicated samples, making it useful for targeted delivery, gene regulation, zzso detection and imaging with high zzso zzso high zzso stability, and very low zzso In zzso the zzso of zzso on GO surface and zzso of zzso or zzso zzso from GO surface result in the protection and zzso of DNA from zzso zzso respectively, which has led to zzso zzso zzso amplification methods zzso for amplified detection of zzso with sensitivity 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than that of zzso binding zzso This Concept article explores some of the latest developments in this zzso
