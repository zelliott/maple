The surgical approach to zzso tumors is different for benign and zzso zzso but the clinical symptoms do not correlate well with zzso zzso in tumor zzso also arise in imaging zzso in which zzso has the lowest and MR imaging, the highest zzso The purpose of this study was to review our experience using conventional MR imaging of the neck in the evaluation of zzso tumors and to evaluate which MR imaging findings are best able to predict zzso zzso 

zzso consecutive patients zzso zzso 41 zzso median age, 56 years; range, zzso zzso with zzso zzso tumors who underwent MR imaging before surgery were zzso included in the present study and zzso zzso zzso was available for all zzso We analyzed the following MR imaging zzso signal intensity, contrast enhancement, zzso margins zzso versus zzso zzso location zzso zzso growth pattern zzso zzso or zzso and extension into neighboring structures, zzso spread, and zzso 

The 57 zzso benign and 27 zzso zzso tumors consisted of 29 zzso zzso 17 zzso tumors, 11 various benign tumors, 5 zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso cell zzso 1 zzso ex zzso zzso 9 zzso and 8 various zzso zzso zzso signs zzso of zzso were the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso margins zzso zzso zzso diffuse growth zzso zzso zzso zzso of subcutaneous tissue zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Low signal intensity on zzso images and zzso zzso margins of a zzso tumor are highly suggestive of zzso
