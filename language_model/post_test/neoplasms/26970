Previous results from two proficiency panels of zzso zzso zzso zzso from the Cancer zzso zzso and panels from the National Institute of zzso and zzso Disease and the Association for Cancer zzso highlight the zzso across laboratories in reported % zzso or % zzso zzso zzso One of the main causes of zzso zzso in flow zzso zzso is due to differences in gating strategies between laboratories, which may prohibit the generation of robust results within single centers and across zzso To study how gating strategies affect the variation in reported results, a gating panel was organized where all participants analyzed the same set of zzso zzso Standard zzso files from a zzso zzso zzso using their own gating protocol zzso I) and a gating protocol drafted by consensus from the organizers of the panel zzso zzso Focusing on analysis removed zzso zzso and instrument variation, enabling us to zzso the zzso caused by gating zzso One hundred ten participating laboratories applied 110 different gating zzso This led to high zzso in the reported percentage of zzso cells and consequently in response detection in Phase zzso However, zzso was dramatically reduced when all laboratories used the same gating strategy zzso zzso Proximity of the zzso gate to the negative population most impacted zzso and zzso response zzso zzso are provided for the zzso placement of the zzso gate, zzso identification of zzso zzso zzso T cells, zzso placement of zzso gate, zzso inclusion of dim cells, zzso gate zzso and 6) proper adjustment of the zzso zzso
