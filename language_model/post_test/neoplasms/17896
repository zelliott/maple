Several reports have described zzso zzso in various types of human zzso However, the interpretation of zzso frequency in various human zzso has some limitations because of the different materials and methods used for zzso zzso To gain an insight into the role of DNA zzso in human zzso and allow direct comparison of tissue specific zzso we generated zzso profiles in zzso human zzso including 24 breast, 48 zzso 61 stomach, 48 liver, 37 zzso 24 zzso 40 zzso and 46 zzso cervical cancer samples by analyzing zzso island zzso of 13 genes using zzso zzso The mean numbers of zzso genes were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso liver, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in breast cancer samples, zzso The number of genes that were zzso at a frequency of more than zzso in each tumor type ranged from nine zzso to one zzso Generally genes frequently zzso in a specific cancer type differed from those zzso in other cancer zzso The findings indicate that zzso zzso island zzso is a frequent finding in human zzso of various tissue types, and each tissue type has its own distinct zzso zzso
