Human tumors result from an evolutionary process operating on zzso cells within zzso zzso natural selection operates on the zzso zzso generated by the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso evolution leads to adaptations such as increased zzso zzso and invasive zzso In this review we outline how cancer zzso are beginning to be investigated from an evolutionary zzso We describe recent progress in the cataloging of zzso genetic and zzso zzso and investigate the contributions of zzso as well as zzso factors to cancer zzso zzso Finally, we outline the challenges facing researchers who investigate the processes driving the evolution of the cancer zzso
