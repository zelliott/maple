Basic differences and similarities of flow and zzso zzso instruments are viewed with regard to technical peculiarities and zzso in the fields of biology and tumor zzso In flow systems, precision of the information concerning quantities of constituents is high, whereas precision of information concerning zzso parameters is zzso In zzso systems, zzso identification by a trained operator can be used zzso to zzso any given cell zzso thus replacing a large number of flow zzso This is why the vast majority of automated zzso machines used in pathology are still more or less semiautomatic or zzso zzso performed zzso cell preparation procedures in which each step is strictly zzso highly standardized zzso methods, and internal controls are zzso in order to obtain reliable zzso zzso In a number of human tumors with zzso zzso and/or zzso and clinical data, quantitative zzso analysis has been demonstrated to provide diagnostic and zzso information complementary to that obtained by conventional clinical and zzso zzso
