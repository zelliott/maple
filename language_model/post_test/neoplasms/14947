This review considers recent advances in the chemical pathology of homocysteine in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a potent zzso neurotransmitter that binds to the zzso zzso zzso and leads to zzso stress, zzso calcium influx, cellular zzso and zzso zzso According to the zzso theory, zzso calcium influx leads to depletion of cellular zzso zzso zzso by reaction with zzso zzso leading to calcium zzso zzso zzso stress is caused by failure of zzso synthesis and zzso of zzso oxygen zzso theoretically because of zzso of zzso zzso function within zzso and zzso zzso The toxicity of oxygen zzso is theoretically explained by the displacement of ozone from zzso zzso leading to zzso of cellular zzso zzso of zzso zzso from cellular zzso is suggested to zzso the zzso and zzso effects of zzso and other zzso zzso In zzso the acute inflammatory response is related to cellular zzso and zzso zzso to proteins containing zzso homocysteine and oxidized zzso zzso zzso and microbial products and zzso originating from zzso LDL zzso trapped within zzso zzso of developing zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso and obstruction of the zzso of zzso zzso are enhanced by high tissue pressure and by zzso dysfunction because of narrowing of the zzso by swollen and zzso zzso cells, leading to the creation of vulnerable zzso
