zzso zzso zzso is zzso in a high percentage of zzso zzso and has proven useful as a target for imaging and targeted zzso Our goal was to express a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and directly compare its tumor and normal tissue zzso and imaging properties with zzso generated zzso zzso In this study, the genes coding for zzso zzso were cloned from zzso cells and expressed in zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso and its zzso toward bovine zzso zzso zzso confirmed by zzso The tumor and normal tissue zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were compared in zzso mice bearing zzso zzso colon cancer or zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso showed that pure and zzso zzso of zzso was produced and labeled with zzso At 24 h post zzso injection zzso tumor zzso for zzso in zzso zzso was zzso zzso which was zzso higher than in zzso zzso zzso tissue ratios increased between 2 and 24 h and exceeded zzso at 24 h zzso of zzso zzso exhibited significantly lower liver zzso at 12 h zzso and lower kidney zzso at 2 h zzso than zzso zzso tumors were zzso as early as 2 h after administration of zzso We conclude that zzso zzso can be produced in a zzso zzso host system and accumulated at comparable levels as zzso in zzso colon cancer zzso in zzso The lower liver zzso of zzso as compared with zzso suggests that it may be more useful for imaging liver zzso No major effect, except for zzso and liver, was observed on tumor and normal tissue zzso due to introduction of zzso and zzso affinity tags or zzso zzso in the scaffold of zzso
