The mechanisms by which cells regulate gene expression are often altered in zzso zzso aspects of the components responsible for the nuclear packaging of DNA is one means by which the cell can control transcription, either by packaging the DNA such that access to specific sites of zzso is blocked or by zzso the DNA itself to prevent zzso factor zzso One such DNA modification is the zzso of zzso In addition, zzso zzso status has been linked recently through a large number of studies to the regulation of gene zzso zzso genes are located in highly zzso zzso The zzso status of zzso (the basic packaging unit of zzso is regulated by a group of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These two zzso zzso and zzso zzso have also been linked together, zzso zzso is used to direct gene repression through a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been shown to be altered in zzso We present an overview of the current knowledge surrounding these elements in cancer, and in the final sections describe the likelihood of zzso of the zzso zzso apparatus in zzso zzso
