Related studies showed that the protein zzso zzso zzso transcription, and zzso zzso a mouse zzso zzso zzso binds and releases zzso from a zzso zzso zzso Here we show that this mechanism regulates zzso in human cells, with human zzso replacing zzso zzso A library of human zzso fragments was used to zzso by affinity zzso 5 zzso zzso fragments that bind to human zzso zzso releasing zzso from a zzso and zzso zzso Each of the 5 zzso fragments maps to a different human zzso The zzso function of the zzso zzso was tested in a human melanoma line and mouse zzso line, by determining the effect of the zzso on formation of colonies in zzso and tumors in zzso zzso zzso in human melanoma cells the zzso fragments individually promoted zzso zzso zzso in human melanoma cells a zzso which causes degradation of the zzso zzso from which an zzso zzso was zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso cells the zzso fragments individually resulted in transformation to zzso zzso zzso A screen of 9 human tumor lines showed that each line expresses high levels of several zzso zzso relative to the levels in human zzso zzso We conclude that human zzso zzso drive transformation and zzso by reversing zzso repression of zzso zzso and that dysfunctional regulation of human zzso zzso expression has a central role in the zzso of human zzso
