zzso zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso with promising zzso activity against solid tumors at doses substantially below the zzso We performed a phase I trial to determine a suitable phase II dose of zzso when administered as a zzso intravenous infusion for five consecutive zzso 

A group of 25 patients with a range of solid tumor diagnoses and good performance status received zzso at eight dose levels ranging from zzso zzso per day to zzso zzso per zzso zzso were repeated every 35 days and patients were evaluated for response following two cycles of zzso zzso were escalated in zzso of three using a modified zzso zzso zzso sampling was performed during the first cycle in all zzso 

zzso of zzso on this schedule included zzso fever, zzso and zzso but all were mild and not zzso zzso zzso of the corrected zzso zzso zzso during infusion in all patients monitored at the zzso zzso dose level prompted closure of the zzso zzso lengthening correlated with increasing plasma zzso of zzso zzso zzso values increased zzso with dose, but substantial zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso There was no evidence of drug zzso when day 1 and day 5 zzso and zzso values were zzso Seven patients displayed tumor growth zzso lasting for 4 months or zzso 

We conclude that zzso administered on a zzso schedule is associated with tolerable clinical symptoms and some activity against a range of solid tumors but dosing is limited by zzso zzso a condition that zzso to zzso zzso Phase II development on this schedule is not recommended based on the occurrence of this zzso zzso Further investigation of alternative schedules of administration and of zzso zzso is zzso
