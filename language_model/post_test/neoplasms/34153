We describe here the use of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso based on decomposition by parts that can reduce the dimension of expression data from thousands of genes to a handful of zzso zzso with a model selection zzso adapted to work for any zzso zzso algorithm, zzso is an efficient method for identification of distinct molecular patterns and provides a powerful method for class zzso We demonstrate the ability of zzso to recover meaningful biological information from zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to have advantages over other methods such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso We found it less sensitive to a zzso selection of genes or initial conditions and able to detect alternative or zzso patterns of gene expression in complex biological zzso This ability, similar to semantic zzso in text, provides a general method for robust molecular pattern zzso
