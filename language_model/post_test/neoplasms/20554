DNA zzso the addition of a zzso group to the zzso position of zzso zzso is the only common zzso modification of human DNA and occurs almost exclusively at zzso that are followed immediately by a zzso zzso zzso zzso The bulk of the zzso displays a clear depletion of zzso zzso and those that are present are nearly always zzso By contrast, small stretches of DNA, known as zzso islands, are comparatively rich in zzso zzso and are nearly always free of zzso These zzso islands are frequently located within the promoter regions of human zzso and zzso within the islands has been shown to be associated with zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso zzso in DNA zzso might be pivotal in the development of most zzso In recent years, it has become apparent that the pattern of DNA zzso observed in cancer generally shows a dramatic shift compared with that of normal zzso Although zzso often exhibit clear reductions throughout their zzso in the levels of DNA zzso this goes hand-in-hand with increased zzso at the zzso zzso Such changes in zzso have a central role in zzso in particular, zzso of zzso islands has been shown to be important in zzso repression of numerous genes that function to prevent zzso growth or zzso Studies of DNA zzso in cancer have thus opened up new opportunities for diagnosis, prognosis and ultimately treatment of human zzso
