The zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently zzso and functionally altered in zzso cells and thus provides opportunities for selective targeting of tumor zzso We describe here the development of a novel, zzso zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso This zzso simultaneously targets zzso on tumor cells and the zzso zzso complex on T cells and possesses structural and functional characteristics of the recently developed zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso was selected for recognition of an zzso that is zzso exposed on zzso cells based on the concept of zzso zzso this was fused to a zzso zzso zzso to generate zzso The zzso zzso redirected zzso human T cells to lyse zzso tumor cells both in zzso and in zzso In separate experiments, efficient tumor cell zzso was achieved in zzso at drug zzso zzso zzso at a low zzso zzso target cell ratio zzso and with tumor cells that possess few available binding sites zzso per zzso for zzso zzso zzso revealed potent zzso activity of zzso T cells against zzso of zzso cells but not against zzso of zzso zzso cells except at the edges of the zzso where the target zzso was zzso zzso was also zzso in human zzso mouse models modified to show human zzso killing of zzso Together, our results reveal opportunities for zzso the potent activity of zzso T cells towards tumor cells that express selectively accessible zzso and establish zzso zzso molecules as novel and potent zzso with selectivity for tumor zzso
