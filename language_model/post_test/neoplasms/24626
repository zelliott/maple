zzso of zzso zzso fragments to the pulmonary zzso is a very rare form of pulmonary embolism which is only sporadically reported in the zzso The zzso and clinical picture of this complication are zzso 

In this retrospective analysis between 1999 and 2004, in our clinic, zzso port zzso were zzso In this zzso period, the patients' files were screened for the zzso of pulmonary embolism of zzso fragments and the accompanying complication zzso 

In 11 patients, port zzso zzso and embolism into the pulmonary artery zzso In all the patients' port examination by zzso zzso dislocation and zzso were zzso In these 11 patients, no obvious clinical signs indicating dislocation of zzso fragments into the pulmonary circulation were zzso None of these patients demonstrated respiratory zzso Heart rate, blood pressure, zzso frequency, and even oxygen zzso were zzso In 7 of the 11 patients, malfunction of port zzso was the first indicator of zzso zzso In four patients, zzso zzso fragments were an incidental zzso The main cause of zzso zzso was the pinch off zzso All zzso zzso fragments were retrieved by a zzso snare without zzso 

These results suggest that the migration of fractured zzso into the pulmonary artery occurs in zzso of the central port zzso zzso It is often zzso and malfunction of the zzso may be the first sign of this zzso The pinch off syndrome might be prevented by using the internal jugular vein or by zzso of the port zzso more zzso in the zzso zzso
