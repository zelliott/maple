Normally, cell division leads to zzso of zzso the zzso complexes located at the ends of linear zzso When zzso reach a critically short zzso cells cease to zzso However, zzso tumor cells display stable zzso lengths and are able to maintain their zzso zzso zzso and colleagues have found that zzso is zzso by zzso during certain stages of the cell cycle, decreasing the likelihood of zzso access to zzso until the late S zzso Additionally, they demonstrate that zzso radiation tends to keep zzso zzso in zzso whereas cell transformation leads to zzso zzso into the zzso where, presumably, it can catalyze the lengthening of zzso at appropriate and inappropriate zzso The zzso of zzso thus zzso a newly identified level of regulation on zzso activity, implicating zzso zzso as a potentially useful target for zzso
