The technique of zzso cell zzso and the concept of zzso zzso genes share a common zzso zzso cell hybrids between zzso zzso cells and their normal cellular counterparts invariably are zzso establishing the zzso genetic nature of zzso The development of zzso and zzso zzso has provided methods for zzso of the zzso zzso genes to specific zzso zzso Continuing studies of this type will facilitate the isolation of these genes by molecular methods including differential zzso screening and zzso zzso
