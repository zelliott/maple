zzso of new blood vessels is essential for several zzso and pathological events, zzso zzso wound healing and tumor growth and zzso In order to increase the insight into the mechanisms of zzso we have zzso the different components of the zzso in human wounds and tumors by zzso on the light and zzso zzso For this purpose, zzso recognizing distinct markers for human zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso were used on freshly frozen or zzso tissue zzso In terms of zzso the zzso zzso is highly specific for blood vessel zzso Its sensitivity is less than other zzso zzso such as von zzso factor and CD 31, as it is not expressed in zzso Within the context of the zzso zzso muscle zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso are useful markers for zzso Type IV zzso and zzso can be zzso consistently in the zzso zzso zzso During the formation of zzso tissue in wound healing a zzso of the expression of zzso and zzso markers is zzso In the least matured zone in zzso tissue of zzso zzso and experimental skin wounds zzso already contained both zzso cells and zzso suggesting a role for both cell types in the early steps of zzso Regarding the tumor zzso zzso to von zzso factor often failed to stain zzso that did show expression of the other zzso markers zzso Broad zzso in zzso was found for the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, these cells only locally expressed zzso muscle zzso zzso of the zzso zzso components Type IV zzso and zzso within tumors was not restricted to the zzso zzso zzso recognizing zzso zzso particularly zzso and zzso zzso are preferable as tools to zzso the tumor zzso In accordance with the situation in zzso tissue of wound healing the broad presence of zzso in the zzso of human tumor suggests an involvement of this cell type in tumor zzso Recent zzso studies on human tumor zzso indicated that a high number of zzso adjacent to the tumor as a measure of tumor zzso is an zzso zzso factor in zzso melanoma, zzso zzso and zzso cell pulmonary zzso This new application of zzso represents a valuable, clinically relevant adjunct to the repertoire of the surgical zzso
