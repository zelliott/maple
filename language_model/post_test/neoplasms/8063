In an effort to improve the efficacy of zzso delivery, we evaluated zzso zzso 2 zzso alone or grafted with zzso zzso block zzso zzso zzso as a carrier for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an abundant nuclear protein that plays an important role in zzso DNA end joining and has implications in zzso and acquired drug zzso zzso of adherent and suspension cell lines with zzso zzso zzso with zzso (2 zzso zzso was associated with a specific decrease in zzso zzso levels zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, zzso More importantly, no requirement for reduced serum conditions was necessary during zzso In contrast, whereas zzso zzso zzso with zzso (2 zzso alone were effective in decreasing zzso zzso levels in adherent cell lines zzso zzso zzso the zzso did not produce any zzso decrease in zzso zzso levels in suspension cell zzso zzso of adherent cell lines with 500 zzso zzso zzso formulated with zzso (2 zzso was associated with a specific decrease zzso remaining of zzso in zzso protein expression and a zzso increased cell death after treatment with zzso radiation zzso In zzso nude mice bearing subcutaneous human zzso colon zzso zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso administration (15 zzso zzso with a zzso zzso 7 treatment schedule, when combined with a single dose of zzso (6 zzso caused a significant zzso of zzso tumor growth compared with zzso and naked zzso control groups zzso from 200 to 1000 zzso zzso versus zzso and zzso days, zzso A zzso of the zzso activity was observed in all mice treated with zzso zzso (2 zzso zzso however, tumor growth zzso was zzso upon treatment zzso No zzso or changes in zzso were observed under this treatment zzso Our results indicate that zzso (2 zzso zzso may increase the efficacy of zzso zzso delivery in management of resistant zzso thus providing a rationale for their evaluation in cancer patients in combination with conventional zzso zzso
