Previously, we have shown that zzso growth factor zzso zzso delivery of soluble tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso by genetic fusion to zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso zzso activity of zzso Insight into the respective contribution of the zzso receptors zzso and zzso to zzso zzso may provide a rational approach to further zzso zzso zzso Recently, this issue has been investigated using zzso zzso designed to selectively bind to either zzso However, the relative contribution of the respective TRAIL zzso in particular zzso in TRAIL signaling is still zzso Here, we fused zzso to designed zzso zzso zzso reported to selectively activate zzso and investigated the therapeutic zzso activity of this novel fusion zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso induced zzso which was superior to the zzso activity of zzso and a zzso zzso During zzso with zzso or the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso acid, zzso retained its superior zzso activity compared to zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso was found to not only bind to zzso but also to zzso zzso to zzso also had functional consequences because the zzso activity of zzso was strongly inhibited by a zzso blocking zzso zzso Moreover, zzso retained zzso activity upon selective zzso of zzso using small zzso zzso zzso these data indicate that both zzso TRAIL receptors are functionally involved in TRAIL signaling by zzso in solid tumor zzso Moreover, the superior target zzso zzso activity of zzso indicates its therapeutic potential for zzso solid zzso
