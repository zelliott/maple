To develop and validate a zzso index for zzso mortality of hospitalized older adults using standard administrative data readily available after zzso 

The zzso index was developed and validated zzso in zzso older adults discharged from general medicine services at an urban teaching hospital over a zzso zzso Potential risk factors for zzso mortality were obtained from administrative data and examined using zzso zzso zzso Each risk factor associated independently with mortality was assigned a weight based on the odds ratios, and risk scores were calculated for each patient by adding the points of each independent risk factor zzso Patients in the development cohort were divided into zzso of risk based on their final risk zzso A similar analysis was performed on the validation cohort to confirm the original zzso 

zzso factors independently associated with zzso mortality zzso aged 70 to 74 years (1 zzso aged 75 years and greater (2 zzso length of stay at least 5 days (1 zzso discharge to nursing home (1 zzso zzso cancer (2 zzso and other zzso zzso heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, zzso disease, zzso or solid, zzso zzso and zzso each 1 zzso In the derivation zzso zzso mortality was zzso in the lowest-risk group zzso or 1 zzso and zzso in the zzso group (4 or greater zzso Similarly, in the validation zzso zzso mortality was zzso in the lowest risk group and zzso in the zzso zzso The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was zzso for the derivation cohort and zzso for the validation zzso 

zzso zzso information for zzso mortality in older patients discharged from general medicine services can be derived from administrative data to identify high-risk groups of zzso
