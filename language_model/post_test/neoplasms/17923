The study of cancer cell zzso on two-dimensional surfaces in zzso has relevance to the diverse migratory zzso exhibited in zzso that involve a directed zzso These may include zzso along collagen zzso invasion into the basement membrane and across zzso zzso and zzso to arrive at a secondary destination designated for cancer cell zzso zzso invariably denotes the ability of cells to sense zzso zzso adhere and zzso to zzso and zzso in the right zzso zzso these, the sensing function is perhaps the unifying aspect of different migration styles, permitting the cells to resolve its orientation and zzso This review examines the decision-making processes that take place during zzso and illustrates that a universal mechanism is zzso In various cell types from zzso to zzso there are some unifying principles that dictate sensing and how the putative leading edge and trailing end of cells are zzso Some of these principles have recently been applied in the study of cancer cell zzso albeit different pathways are zzso In zzso cancer cells, local zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso global zzso of zzso by zzso occur to promote the zzso distribution and amplification of these internal signals in response to an external zzso zzso
