zzso target of zzso zzso is a key regulator of zzso cell zzso In particular, zzso one of the two complexes that contain zzso is involved in the regulation of protein zzso zzso cell cycle and zzso zzso of the zzso signaling zzso is observed in human zzso A variety of approaches including deletion analysis, zzso genetic screens and mining of human cancer zzso databases were taken that resulted in the identification of zzso zzso of zzso These studies suggest that the zzso zzso and zzso zzso are the three regions of zzso where zzso zzso can be zzso Within the zzso domain, the zzso are clustered in three hot spots that are all located in the zzso active site that was deduced by the alignment with zzso One of the hot spots zzso to the region where zzso zzso zzso have been zzso These results are beginning to provide important insights into the mechanism of zzso of zzso
