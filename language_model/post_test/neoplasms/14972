Several states with large Hispanic populations have historically served as the source for US Hispanic cancer zzso rates, with zzso of data across all states limited by different zzso to identify Hispanic zzso Now with data available for more than zzso of the US Hispanic population, state rates suggest regional diversity in their Hispanic cancer zzso 

We tested an approach of using a surrogate indicator of county residential zzso for Hispanic groups based on the 2000 US zzso The indicator used the counts of specific Hispanic residents compared to the total Hispanic population in the county to define counties with zzso Hispanic zzso From these data, we zzso counties into zzso categories for each Hispanic group and defined thresholds and rules for allocating Hispanic persons to a specific Hispanic zzso 

We found that it was possible to use county demographic data in many counties to zzso attribute a specific Hispanic ethnicity to incident cancer cases based on zzso zzso Cancer rates for the US Hispanic population describe a profile of high rates of zzso of the liver, zzso zzso (in zzso stomach, and lower rates of the zzso of the zzso female breast, and prostate compared with the zzso white zzso In general, rates among US zzso are lower than the US Hispanic rates, while rates for Puerto zzso and Cubans are higher than the US Hispanic zzso Additional variations among the three Hispanic groups were also zzso 

The approach yielded reasonable and useful information to explore zzso differences among the zzso as well as to develop relevant cancer control zzso However, direct identification of specific Hispanic ethnicity in medical records and annual Census estimates of these populations would be preferable if they ever became zzso
