Recent experimental evidence indicates that many solid zzso have a zzso organization structure with a zzso of cancer stem cells zzso The ability to identify zzso zzso now allows for testing the responses of zzso to treatment zzso like radiation zzso zzso studies have found zzso in zzso and breast cancer relatively resistant to zzso radiation and possible mechanisms behind this resistance have been zzso This review summarizes the landmark publications in this young field with an emphasis on the radiation responses of zzso The existence of zzso in solid zzso place restrictions on the interpretation of many zzso zzso while explaining zzso The fact that these cells may be a relatively zzso zzso that are metabolically distinct from the other cells in the tumor has implications for both imaging and therapy of zzso This is particularly true for biological targeting of cancer for enhanced zzso benefit, which must consider whether the unique properties of this zzso allow it to avoid such zzso
