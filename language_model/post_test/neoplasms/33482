zzso refers to zzso zzso zzso in the absence of DNA sequence changes, and DNA zzso is one of the extensively studied zzso zzso DNA zzso is an zzso zzso mechanism to regulate gene expression in zzso Because DNA zzso is preserved during DNA replication it can be zzso Thus, DNA zzso could be a major mechanism by which to produce zzso changes in gene expression in zzso zzso Although it remains controversial whether zzso DNA zzso in zzso zzso is zzso zzso frequent zzso and zzso de zzso zzso events are observed during zzso cell zzso In this zzso we discuss the use of restriction landmark zzso zzso together with in zzso analysis, to identify zzso zzso regions in the zzso zzso We then present a rough overview of quantitative DNA zzso patterns at zzso zzso sites and more than 150 zzso zzso regions in several zzso mouse zzso Comparative analysis between mice and humans suggests that some, but not all, zzso zzso zzso regions are zzso A deeper understanding of zzso differences in DNA zzso might lead to a better illustration of the mechanisms behind zzso differentiation in zzso
