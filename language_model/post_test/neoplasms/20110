zzso of methods for zzso risk assessment often focus on zzso lifetime cancer zzso With intermittent or zzso zzso lifetime risk is often zzso on the basis of a lifetime average daily dose zzso In this article, we show that there exists a lifetime equivalent constant dose zzso which leads to the same lifetime risk as the actual zzso exposure zzso The ratio C zzso zzso then provides a measure of accuracy of risk estimates based on the zzso as well as a basis for correcting such zzso zzso results derived under the classical zzso model and the zzso zzso model suggest that the maximum value of C, which represents the factor by which the zzso may lead to zzso of risk, will often lie in the range of zzso to zzso The practical application of these results is illustrated in the case of astronauts subjected to relatively short-term exposure to volatile zzso in a closed space station environment, and in the case of the zzso of zzso zzso in food where consumption patterns vary with zzso
