We attempted to grow zzso zzso zzso from 34 fresh tumors of eight different zzso using zzso for the initiation phase and hollow fiber zzso to expand zzso to therapeutic zzso zzso success rate was zzso zzso including melanoma zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso zzso The mean number of days required to reach successful initiation (1 zzso zzso zzso for all tumor types was 29 zzso 16 days zzso zzso zzso zzso doses of zzso required an average of 88 zzso 23 days zzso plus zzso with an average zzso number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was predominantly zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso samples accounted for zzso of the predominantly zzso zzso zzso bearing the natural killer zzso zzso represented only zzso of zzso while zzso zzso represented zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso zzso was the zzso zzso in one patient with kidney zzso zzso tests showed consistent zzso and zzso activity in addition to zzso of zzso zzso zzso tumor cell restricted zzso was noted for three zzso zzso The overall success rate and characteristics of zzso were similar to our results with zzso expanded in zzso plastic zzso This work confirms that zzso zzso are a suitable alternative to zzso bags and roller bottle systems for the expansion of human zzso for therapeutic use in cancer zzso
