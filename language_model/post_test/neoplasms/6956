There is a growing interest in the role that cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso may play in the development and progression of various zzso However, few studies have addressed the reliability of such zzso in healthy individuals over zzso The objective of this study was to investigate the zzso reliability of multiple proteins in serum samples from healthy women who donated blood over successive zzso Thirty five, zzso women with two, repeated annual visits, and zzso zzso women with three, repeated annual visits were randomly selected among eligible subjects from an existing, prospective zzso zzso zzso zzso technology was used to measure the levels of 55 serum proteins representing cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso zzso and other markers in these zzso The zzso with high detection rates zzso zzso and acceptable reliability zzso correlation zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso using zzso method were: cancer zzso zzso CA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 8, 9, zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and other proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso The rest of the zzso under investigation either had zzso less than zzso or had low levels of detection zzso zzso These included cancer zzso CA zzso CA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, 3, 7, 12, 13; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso factors: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso and other zzso zzso and heat shock protein zzso zzso In conclusion, 34 out of the 55 zzso investigated were present in zzso levels in zzso zzso of the samples, and with an zzso zzso or zzso zzso indicating that a single serum measurement can be used in prospective zzso studies using the zzso zzso
