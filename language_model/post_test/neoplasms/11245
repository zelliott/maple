The developments of zzso methods for analyzing zzso peptides are of paramount zzso zzso and their zzso fragments play a vital role in the regulation of many biological processes and zzso This paper presents the use of zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso method for monitoring zzso along with their degradation products in plasma samples from cancer zzso The zzso focused in this study were zzso substance zzso and zzso The method involves the zzso zzso of the zzso peptides followed by zzso sample preparation and subsequent acquisition of the zzso spectral zzso The mass spectral profile identifies most of the zzso and zzso zzso and the mass accuracy was in the range of zzso to zzso Da with the mass zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso degradation patterns from the cancer patients were compared with the controls showed similar zzso The study reveals that this approach can be used to identify the zzso zzso products of zzso
