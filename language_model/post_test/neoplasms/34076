zzso amplification (the presence of more than two zzso at zzso is characteristic of many human zzso Extra zzso can cause the assembly of zzso zzso which zzso distribute zzso to daughter zzso the resulting genetic imbalances may contribute to cellular zzso However, this raises the question of how a population of cells with zzso amplification can survive such chaotic zzso without soon becoming zzso as a result of zzso zzso Recent observations indicate that a variety of mechanisms partially mute the practical consequences of zzso zzso zzso populations of cells zzso with good efficiency, despite zzso amplification, yet have an elevated zzso error rate that can fuel the evolution of the transformed zzso
