There has been a growing interest in the combined effects of noise and zzso In a population of zzso workers diagnosed with zzso disease zzso a large zzso of zzso was zzso These workers were exposed to large pressure zzso zzso zzso or zzso 90 zzso zzso noise, with energy content concentrated within the low frequency zzso bands zzso or zzso 500 zzso and zzso zzso zzso To our knowledge, there are no studies conducted in humans or animals that address the issue of the potential zzso effects of zzso combined with zzso In the present study, the levels of sister zzso exchanges zzso and of cells with high zzso of zzso zzso were analyzed in peripheral blood zzso of workers employed in various zzso within the zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were analyzed in zzso of 50 workers zzso exposed to noise and zzso and of 34 zzso controls zzso The exposed group zzso 10 zzso tool operators zzso 15 engine test cell technicians zzso 12 aircraft run-up technicians zzso and 13 Portuguese Air Force helicopter pilots zzso Groups 2-4 were exposed to zzso and zzso zzso group 1 was exposed to zzso high frequency noise and local zzso zzso analysis of the mean zzso count per cell was carried out by multiple zzso analysis comparing various predictor zzso type of exposure, duration of exposure, age, and cigarette zzso 

Only cigarette consumption and type of exposure were found to be significantly correlated with the mean zzso zzso After allowing for the effects of smoking, the analysis indicates that: 1) there was no significant difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) the differences between zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were all highly significant zzso zzso zzso 3) there was no significant difference between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso nor between zzso and zzso combined and zzso zzso zzso zzso and 4) zzso and zzso combined had a significantly elevated mean zzso frequency compared zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the proportion of zzso was consistent with these zzso 

Our data suggest that occupational exposure to zzso noise and zzso may lead to increased levels of zzso in zzso These results also suggest a reason for the high zzso of zzso in zzso zzso The observed effects may not reflect a direct action of these physical agents on zzso Alternative explanations may lie in the zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso
