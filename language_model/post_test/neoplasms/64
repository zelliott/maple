The isolation and sequencing of zzso clone coding for the entire sequence of human zzso zzso protein zzso is zzso zzso analysis reveals that the open reading frame constitutes only zzso of the transcript, that the zzso region is extremely rich in zzso zzso zzso and that the zzso region is highly enriched in AT zzso The zzso acid zzso deduced from the reading frame, is zzso zzso to the calf zzso protein suggesting evolutionary constraints on the zzso of the zzso The human zzso contains zzso zzso gene copy zzso which, as suggested by Southern analysis, are not zzso zzso Northern analysis of zzso isolated from several sources reveals that a zzso zzso codes for this zzso Southern analysis reveals that zzso sequences are present in the zzso of several different species indicating that the evolutionary origin of this gene was over 350 million years zzso The overall features of the human zzso zzso are very similar to those of the human zzso zzso and the number of gene zzso present in the human zzso is similar for the two zzso However, their zzso sequence is significantly different indicating that the zzso family coding for zzso is distinct from that coding for zzso
