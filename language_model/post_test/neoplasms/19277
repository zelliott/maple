Whether being older than 65 years should be considered an absolute zzso to heart transplant zzso as it is in some centers, is zzso In our zzso patients older than 65 years are accepted for zzso if they satisfy stringent zzso The aim of this study was to examine whether heart recipients older than 65 years have a greater risk of zzso zzso or mortality than younger zzso 

We studied zzso patients who underwent zzso between April 1991 and December 2003, 42 of whom were older than 65 years and zzso who were 65 years or zzso The parameters evaluated were the cumulative zzso of zzso and rejections zzso grade zzso or zzso zzso and the survival rates 1 month, 1 year, and 5 years zzso 

The two groups had similar percentages of patients with at least one rejection episode zzso or zzso years zzso zzso years zzso P zzso zzso and although there were zzso almost twice as many tumors in the older group zzso as in the younger zzso this difference was not statistically significant zzso Nor were there any significant differences in survival, the zzso zzso and zzso rates being zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in the younger group and zzso zzso and zzso respectively, in the zzso 

Among carefully selected patients aged more than 65 years, zzso can be performed without incurring greater risk of zzso zzso or death than is found among recipients younger than 65 zzso
