In zzso zzso proposed a zzso of causes for zzso zzso zzso that zzso changes in the vessel wall or changes in the blood could lead to zzso We now know that zzso high levels of some zzso factors and defects in the natural zzso contribute to zzso zzso Among these, factor V zzso which renders factor Va resistant to activated protein C, is the most prevalent with approximately zzso of the Caucasian population having this genetic zzso These genetically controlled zzso in zzso factors work in concert with other risk factors, such as oral contraceptive use, to dramatically increase zzso zzso While these abnormalities in the blood zzso proteins are associated with zzso disease zzso they are less frequent contributors to zzso than age or zzso Cancer increases zzso risk by producing tissue factor to initiate zzso by shedding zzso zzso zzso or by zzso blood zzso Age is the strongest risk factor for zzso Among possible reasons are fragility of the vessels potentially contributing to zzso increased zzso factor levels, impaired function of the zzso valves, decreases in the efficacy of natural zzso associated with the vessel wall, increased risk of zzso and increased risk of severe zzso
