More than zzso zzso zzso molecules are now licensed for the treatment of a variety of zzso and chronic zzso Initially, the attraction of zzso was their specificity for target zzso however, it is now appreciated that the downstream consequences of engaging zzso after the formation of immune complexes, is crucial to clinical outcomes in zzso This review introduces the structural and functional activities of the zzso class of zzso zzso in zzso and criteria that determine choice between the four zzso zzso we demonstrate that, although accounting for only zzso of zzso mass, zzso of the zzso is essential to the zzso of downstream zzso mechanisms zzso zzso zzso the precise structure of the attached zzso can influence zzso zzso These findings have led to cellular engineering to enable the production of selected zzso of zzso that are considered to be optimal for the disease indication to be zzso
