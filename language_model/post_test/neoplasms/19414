zzso imaging for zzso objects was considered in this zzso zzso zzso approach to represent prior information about zzso distribution of observed object by prior probability density and combine zzso information of scattering field, we obtained zzso probability density that included synthetic information about the observed zzso And then, Gibbs zzso one of zzso zzso zzso Carlo method, was used to sample the zzso probability zzso The sample mean was regarded as an evaluation of the zzso zzso The results of simulation imaging with zzso objects showed that this set of methods made good use of information and had the advantages of feasibility and very strong zzso zzso In zzso is capable of describing zzso or zzso prior information in a convenient and zzso way, as well as capable of giving the zzso solution, zzso the occurrence probability of every zzso zzso
