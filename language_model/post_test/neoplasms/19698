Our study compared cancer zzso rates and stage distribution between zzso zzso and Hispanic zzso in the United States between 1992 and zzso 

A retrospective cohort study was conducted for the years 1992 through zzso 

Data represent 13 zzso in the zzso zzso and End zzso Program, which reflect zzso of the total US zzso 

The zzso rates for most cancer sites were significantly higher in zzso zzso than in Hispanic zzso zzso included zzso of the stomach and liver and, for females only, kidney and zzso pelvis and zzso zzso Overall, cancer zzso in zzso zzso was zzso greater in males and zzso greater in females as compared with Hispanic zzso Cancer sites with higher zzso rates among zzso zzso than Hispanic zzso in 2009 compared with 1992 were melanoma, zzso cancer, oral cavity and zzso cancer, lymphoma, urinary zzso cancer, and all zzso combined for males and melanoma, zzso cancer, cervical cancer, and lung and zzso cancer for zzso However, difference in rates narrowed between the zzso for colon and zzso cancer and corpus and zzso zzso zzso zzso tended to have a higher percentage of early staged cancer, with little evidence that disparity between the ethnic groups was narrowing in terms of early zzso However, two exceptions involved liver cancer and zzso cancer in zzso The disparity appeared to widen for lung cancer in zzso 

Cancer zzso rates are generally lower in Hispanic zzso than zzso zzso The difference in rates between groups has widened over the study period for many cancer sites, with a few zzso Poorer screening practices among Hispanic zzso have tended to zzso
