Technology platforms originally developed for tissue engineering applications produce valuable models that mimic three-dimensional zzso tissue organization and function to enhance the understanding of zzso function under normal and pathological zzso These models show that when replicating zzso and pathological conditions as closely as possible investigators are allowed to probe the basic mechanisms of zzso differentiation and zzso zzso efforts investigating zzso processes and factors in zzso are currently undertaken to establish ways of targeting zzso in zzso zzso agents have been accepted for clinical application as attractive targeted zzso for the treatment of zzso Combining the areas of zzso zzso combination therapies and drug delivery systems is therefore closely related to the understanding of the basic principles that are applied in tissue engineering zzso Studies with zzso model systems have repeatedly identified complex interacting roles of zzso zzso and zzso zzso growth factor receptors and zzso in development and zzso These insights suggest that zzso regulation and suppression of these processes can provide strategies and therapeutic targets for future cancer zzso The historical perspective of the fields of tissue engineering and controlled release of zzso including zzso of zzso in zzso is becoming clearly evident as a major future advance in merging these zzso New delivery systems are expected to greatly enhance the ability to deliver drugs locally and in therapeutic zzso to relevant sites in living zzso zzso the phenomena of zzso and zzso in zzso in zzso models such as the zzso zzso loop mode in a separated and isolated chamber within a living zzso adds another significant horizon to this perspective and opens new zzso for zzso research in this zzso
