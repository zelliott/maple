zzso is a mechanism that limits cellular lifespan and constitutes a barrier against cellular zzso To identify new zzso regulatory genes that might play a role in zzso we have designed and performed a large-scale zzso genetic screen in primary mouse zzso zzso zzso Out of this screen, we have identified five different genes through which loss of function partially zzso zzso These genes belong to very different zzso families: zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso II zzso zzso homocysteine zzso and zzso zzso at least zzso of these genes zzso resistance to both zzso and zzso proliferation zzso Furthermore, such zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso of zzso Since the aim of the screen was to identify new regulators of zzso we have tested their zzso in human zzso We have found, either by northern zzso or quantitative reverse zzso analysis, that the expression of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is lost at different ratios in tumors of different zzso These genes are located at common positions of loss of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have measured zzso losses of these specific genes in different zzso We have found that zzso and zzso also show zzso losses of one zzso in different zzso Our data suggest that the three genes identified in the zzso zzso genetic screen are putative tumor zzso located at zzso zzso and zzso
