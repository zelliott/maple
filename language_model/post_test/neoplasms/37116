A zzso zzso zzso zzso is produced by group B zzso zzso zzso from zzso who died of zzso zzso zzso zzso named zzso in the clinic, was hypothesized, on the basis of our previous in zzso studies, to induce inflammation in pulmonary zzso in zzso by zzso of embryonic receptors still expressed after birth and in tumor zzso in zzso zzso chemical in zzso analysis of human zzso showed that tumor zzso is indeed a binding site for zzso In zzso studies in mice have demonstrated that zzso induced inflammatory responses in zzso tumor zzso causing zzso of tumor growth and tumor cell zzso These experimental observations warranted a phase I clinical trial for zzso as an zzso agent in human cancer zzso Cancer patients received one cycle of therapy consisting of three treatments during 1 zzso zzso was administered over 15 zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso (1 zzso zzso zzso 3; 15 zzso (2 zzso zzso zzso 6; zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3; and zzso zzso (5 zzso zzso zzso 3 were zzso zzso zzso sandwich zzso zzso of the patients zzso showed a marked zzso of soluble zzso with a peak concentration observed at 8-12 h after each zzso zzso The average baseline value for soluble zzso prior to the first treatment was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the average peak level at 8 h was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 15; P zzso zzso zzso treatments gave average maximum soluble zzso levels again at 8 h of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for treatments 2 and 3 zzso zzso values for treatments 2 and 3 were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso versus treatment zzso Out of 15 patients, 5 showed tumor reduction or stabilization and were given additional cycles of zzso zzso induced an increase in soluble zzso levels, which remained elevated over baseline at the start of the following treatment zzso The baseline remained elevated for several weeks after the final treatment, zzso P zzso zzso for levels before treatment 1 compared to those at week 4 after zzso zzso soluble zzso is considered proof of zzso engagement in an inflammatory zzso Our data support the contention that the inflammatory response observed in these cancer patients is targeting the tumor zzso and that measurement of soluble zzso levels in patients treated with zzso can provide important information on the magnitude of zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor cell damage in cancer of zzso origin, or cancer with a major zzso zzso
