Although it is well recognized that the tumor zzso plays a key role in regulating tumor zzso the mechanisms through which this occurs need to be zzso Current international research activities toward defining the role of the tumor zzso in cancer progression were the subject of the first zzso Forum on zzso zzso held at zzso University in zzso China, July 2 to 4, zzso The importance of variety of zzso such as inflammation and zzso in the role of tumor progression was described for multiple tumor types including breast, zzso and zzso zzso as well as the process of bone zzso Identification of novel signaling pathways that impact both zzso and bone zzso were zzso Several themes emerged from this meeting, such zzso zzso tumor cells modify the zzso to enhance their own survival and zzso zzso targeting host factors, in addition to targeting tumor cells, will have important therapeutic zzso and zzso host cells distribution within the tumor has both zzso and therapeutic zzso Several priorities for future research were defined including use of a systems biology approach to define the role of host factors in tumor zzso to define the importance of targeting both arms of the bone zzso process for therapy of bone zzso and to determine how different cell zzso contribute to zzso regulation of tumor zzso
