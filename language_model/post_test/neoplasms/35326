It is now little disputed that most if not all cancer cells express zzso that can be recognized by specific zzso T zzso However, a central question in the field of zzso immunity is why such zzso tumors are not spontaneously eliminated by the immune zzso While in some cases, this lack of rejection may be due to zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso responses in many patients has been detected in the peripheral blood, either spontaneously or in response to zzso without accompanying tumor zzso These observations argue for the importance of barriers downstream from initial zzso zzso that need to be addressed to translate immune responses into clinical tumor zzso Recent data suggest that the proper trafficking of zzso T cells into the tumor zzso may not always zzso T cells that do effectively home to tumor zzso are often found to be zzso pointing toward zzso mechanisms in the tumor zzso zzso zzso due to insufficient B7 zzso zzso suppression by regulatory cell zzso zzso by zzso such as programmed death zzso zzso zzso by zzso such as zzso and the action of soluble zzso factors such as transforming growth zzso have all been clearly implicated in generating this zzso zzso Identification of these downstream processes points to new therapeutic targets that should be manipulated to facilitate the zzso phase of zzso immune responses in concert with vaccination or zzso adoptive zzso
