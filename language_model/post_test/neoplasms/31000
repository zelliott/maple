In this paper we propose methods for designing phase II trials that allow for a zzso between treatment safety and zzso activity, where safety and zzso activity are measured as zzso zzso The designs can be carried out either in a single stage or can be conducted in two zzso with an interim analysis to assess whether the treatment appears sufficiently safe and effective to warrant zzso The emphasis is on the derivation of stopping rules for phase II trials that require the enrollment of a small number of patients and are based on enumerating the exact distribution of the proposed test zzso We illustrate the methods with a recent study that required the use of a group sequential design to monitor zzso activity and zzso
