It has been suggested that dealing with cancer is associated with increased stress and zzso in health-care zzso The aim of this study is to examine the prevalence of psychiatric morbidity and zzso in surgeons working in the National Health Service zzso and the putative relationship between psychiatric zzso zzso and the amount of zzso zzso 

All consultant zzso and vascular surgeons identified from their professional societies were sent a booklet consisting of questions about zzso and zzso work load, job satisfaction and zzso It also included the General Health zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was used to identify independent zzso of psychiatric morbidity zzso zzso zzso and retirement zzso 

Five hundred and one questionnaire zzso were completed and returned zzso rate zzso The mean age of respondents was 47 years zzso zzso The majority of the surgeons were male zzso zzso One hundred and zzso zzso surgeons scored in the positive range of the zzso and 154 zzso had high zzso on at least one zzso of the zzso Three hundred and zzso zzso surgeons stated that they intended to retire before the statutory retirement zzso Level of work satisfaction and perceived zzso of training in communication and management skills were significantly zzso correlated with zzso and zzso zzso Surgeons who planned to take early retirement or wished to retire as soon as they could afford to were more likely to have psychiatric morbidity and/or zzso Surgeons who were married or zzso were less likely to have psychiatric zzso and younger surgeons were more likely to have higher levels of zzso zzso Work satisfaction was zzso correlated with psychiatric morbidity and all three zzso zzso zzso surgeons had a greater zzso workload than vascular surgeons zzso vs zzso respectively, zzso zzso However, there were no significant differences between the two groups in psychiatric zzso personal accomplishment and emotional zzso zzso zzso however, had significantly higher levels of zzso zzso 

zzso of psychiatric zzso zzso and work dissatisfaction are zzso high in zzso and vascular surgeons and are likely to impact adversely on patient satisfaction and service zzso The number of surgeons intending to retire early is also a cause for concern both in terms of the overall number of trained surgeons in the zzso and in the balance between senior and junior zzso Apart from zzso these indicators of stress, however, were unrelated to cancer zzso
