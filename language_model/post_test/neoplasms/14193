zzso zzso have been reported to be zzso expressed in patients with zzso Many studies have shown that circulating zzso could play potential roles as diagnostic and zzso zzso of zzso The aim of this zzso is to zzso the role of circulating zzso as a zzso in patients with a variety of zzso 

zzso studies were identified and assessed for quality through multiple search zzso For diagnostic zzso the sensitivity, zzso and other measures of zzso in the diagnosis of cancer were pooled using zzso zzso approach zzso For zzso zzso pooled hazard ratios zzso of circulating zzso for survival were zzso 

A total of 36 studies dealing with various zzso were included for the systemic zzso Among them, 23 studies were finally enrolled in the global zzso (17 studies for diagnosis and 6 studies for zzso For diagnostic zzso the overall pooled results for sensitivity, zzso positive likelihood ratio zzso negative likelihood ratios zzso and diagnostic odds ratio zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso the pooled zzso of higher zzso expression in circulation was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which could significantly predict poorer survival in general zzso zzso zzso analysis suggested that higher expression of zzso correlated with worse overall survival zzso significantly in zzso of zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Our findings suggest that circulating zzso may not suitable to be a diagnostic zzso but it has a zzso value in patients with zzso
