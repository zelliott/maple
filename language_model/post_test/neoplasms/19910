As a zzso factor, zzso exerts significant influence in cancer development by regulating zzso of a large number of target genes including zzso However, details of regulatory networks composed of zzso zzso and zzso target genes are still zzso Here, at system level, we built a comprehensive zzso zzso zzso regulatory network through the integration of zzso validated zzso data and zzso zzso Using zzso zzso information with zzso we identified 30 zzso and found most of these zzso target genes were significantly enriched in cell cycle, zzso cell proliferation GO terms and zzso signaling zzso using gene sets enrichment zzso We found most zzso involved in zzso cancer pathways expressed zzso in zzso tumors through the integration of diverse types of experimental zzso Based upon zzso target genes identified by zzso zzso we identified that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly different from those obtained by zzso also, 11 high-quality zzso were extracted from zzso validated zzso Finally, we built the zzso interaction network of zzso validated zzso and discussed the more complex network composed of several zzso zzso As shown in this study, we performed comprehensive analysis of the zzso regulatory network and provided potential zzso target genes which were involved in zzso zzso and zzso biological zzso
