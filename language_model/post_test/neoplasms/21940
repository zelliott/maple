Although numerous zzso strategies have been studied in patients with cancer, consistent induction of clinical responses remains a formidable zzso Cancer vaccines are often successful at generating elevated numbers of zzso T zzso in peripheral blood, however, despite this, tumors usually continue to grow zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso regulatory cells, known to play a major role in the induction of immune tolerance to self and prevention of zzso as well as zzso zzso cells invoked in the zzso state, may be largely responsible for preventing effective zzso immune zzso This review will focus on the major regulatory cell zzso including zzso zzso cells, type 1 regulatory T cells, natural killer T cells, and immature zzso zzso Studies in humans and in animal models have shown a role for all of these cells in tumor zzso although the mechanisms by which they act to suppress immunity remain largely zzso zzso of the dominant molecular mechanisms zzso immune suppression in zzso will allow more precise targeting of the relevant regulatory cell zzso as well as the development of novel strategies and clinical zzso that will directly block molecules that induce the suppression of zzso zzso
