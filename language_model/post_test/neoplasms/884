The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potential synthetic lethal therapeutic strategy for the treatment of zzso with specific zzso zzso including those arising in carriers of a zzso or zzso zzso We conducted a clinical evaluation in humans of zzso zzso a novel, zzso orally active zzso zzso 

This was a phase 1 trial that included the analysis of zzso and zzso characteristics of zzso zzso was aimed at having a study population enriched in carriers of a zzso or zzso zzso 

We enrolled and treated 60 zzso 22 were carriers of a zzso or zzso zzso and 1 had a strong family history of zzso cancer but declined to undergo zzso zzso The zzso dose and schedule were increased from 10 zzso daily for 2 of every 3 weeks to 600 zzso twice daily zzso zzso zzso toxicity was seen in one of eight patients receiving 400 zzso twice daily zzso 3 mood zzso and zzso and two of five patients receiving 600 zzso twice daily zzso 4 zzso and grade 3 zzso This led us to enroll another zzso consisting only of carriers of a zzso or zzso zzso to receive zzso at a dose of 200 zzso twice zzso Other adverse effects included mild gastrointestinal zzso There was no obvious increase in adverse effects seen in the zzso zzso zzso data indicated rapid zzso and zzso zzso studies confirmed zzso zzso in surrogate samples (of zzso zzso cells and plucked zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso activity was reported only in zzso carriers, all of whom had zzso breast, or prostate cancer and had received multiple treatment zzso
