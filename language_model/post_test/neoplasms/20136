The zzso zzso zzso zzso with a human nuclear cell zzso zzso that is expressed in all active parts of the cell zzso Recently we have raised zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso parts of the zzso zzso These zzso are true zzso zzso as demonstrated by zzso of fresh zzso zzso and molecular biological zzso zzso zzso sections routinely processed for zzso failed to stain for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso 3 zzso zzso figures, while zzso zzso cells were negative under these zzso However, when zzso zzso zzso zzso sections of zzso zzso were used, zzso 1 and zzso 3 gave strong nuclear zzso of those cells presumed to zzso under a variety of normal and zzso zzso Moreover, routine zzso or zzso techniques did not alter the zzso of zzso 1 and zzso 3 with zzso zzso zzso This method is highly zzso easy to perform at low cost, and no additional technical skill is needed because after zzso treatment just routine zzso methods are zzso Since we have successfully applied this new method to sections obtained from zzso blocks stored for a long time (in one case more than 60 zzso the assessment of cell zzso through the detection of zzso zzso is now possible on archival material collected in zzso departments all over the zzso
