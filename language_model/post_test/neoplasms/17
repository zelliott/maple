The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is a plasma membrane zzso It contains four distinct segments: an zzso zzso binding domain which is exposed at the cell surface; a short zzso zzso a zzso domain with zzso zzso zzso and a zzso regulatory zzso zzso of zzso to the external domain of the zzso activates the zzso zzso activity of the zzso and this elevated zzso activity is presumed to be involved in the zzso of cell zzso The zzso transforming gene of avian zzso virus is zzso by zzso zzso from the gene zzso which encodes the avian zzso zzso The transforming capacity of zzso appears to result from zzso of the zzso In zzso cells, zzso of the zzso zzso binding domain is sufficient for zzso whereas in zzso removal of an additional zzso segment is required for zzso The zzso zzso is subject to complex regulatory controls, including zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso and zzso involving zzso by zzso zzso This review is centered around the hypothesis that the transforming capacity of the truncated zzso gene product results from a loss in sensitivity to regulators and the zzso zzso of protein zzso zzso
