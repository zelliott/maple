The transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a critical and dual role in the progression of human zzso During the early phase of zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso zzso exemplified by deletions or zzso in the core components of the zzso zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso also promotes processes that support zzso progression such as zzso cell invasion, zzso and immune zzso zzso the functional outcome of the zzso response is strongly zzso including cell, zzso and cancer zzso In this review, we describe the molecular zzso pathways employed by zzso in cancer and how these, when zzso may lead to the development of zzso zzso with our increased appreciation of the molecular mechanisms that govern zzso zzso the potential to zzso target specific zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Indeed, clinical trials with systemic zzso zzso zzso for treatment of cancer patients have been zzso However, considering the important role of zzso in cardiovascular and many other zzso careful screening of patients is warranted to minimize unwanted zzso side zzso
