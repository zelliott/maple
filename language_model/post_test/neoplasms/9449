zzso instability is regarded as an underlying mechanism of zzso zzso integral to the zzso selection and evolution that leads to zzso We evaluated zzso instability in zzso Barrett's esophagus tissue using high resolution zzso mapping zzso zzso zzso as patients progressed through three molecular stages of zzso only, zzso and zzso with zzso Within individuals over time, we observed increases in both numbers and sizes of regions of zzso or copy number zzso In the earliest zzso only samples, we detected few regions with both copy change and zzso whereas copy loss and zzso were highly correlated in more advanced zzso These data indicate that zzso instability increases in severity and changes character during zzso zzso In addition, distinct patterns of zzso evolution could be discerned within a segment of Barrett's zzso Overall, this study illustrates that zzso disease can be associated with extensive instability and zzso dynamics that evolve from an initial stage characterized by small zzso zzso to one with larger copy change events likely associated with zzso zzso
