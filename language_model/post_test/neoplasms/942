zzso zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor with high affinity for the vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso which plays an important role in zzso zzso The aim of this work was to develop and evaluate in mice the zzso analogue as an in zzso zzso for zzso expression in solid zzso 

zzso was zzso by an zzso of zzso using zzso zzso The zzso zzso properties and its distribution in both subcutaneous and zzso zzso models were evaluated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used as a reference zzso for zzso zzso PET results were zzso by ex zzso and in zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso and PET in healthy animals revealed low zzso zzso limited zzso over 60 zzso and a zzso and irreversible zzso zzso zzso in subcutaneous zzso masses was low, while focal areas of high zzso (up to zzso zzso were observed in regions connecting the zzso to the zzso zzso was similarly high but more distributed in zzso growing within the zzso The pattern of zzso zzso was generally different from that of the zzso zzso zzso and correlated well with variations in zzso expression determined ex zzso by zzso zzso 

These results suggest that zzso has potential as a zzso PET zzso for in zzso imaging of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso
