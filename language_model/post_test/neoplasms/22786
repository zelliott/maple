Although zzso zzso a vitamin E isolated primarily from palm and rice zzso oil, has been linked with zzso activities, the mechanism of this action is poorly zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso can zzso the zzso cell signaling pathway, closely linked to inflammation and zzso We found that zzso but not zzso the most common saturated form of vitamin zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, and this zzso was not cell zzso zzso also inhibited zzso DNA zzso This correlated with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso reversed the zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of a zzso zzso When examined further, we found that zzso induced the expression of the zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso of the zzso by small interfering zzso abolished the ability of zzso to inhibit zzso zzso suggesting a vital role for zzso in the action of zzso Also zzso zzso zzso of zzso and induced zzso in zzso Eventually, zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso and this correlated with suppression of zzso the zzso of cells in zzso phase of the cell cycle, and induction of zzso This vitamin also zzso the tumor cells to the zzso effects of zzso and zzso Overall, our results suggest that zzso is a novel blocker of zzso zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso and thus may have potential in prevention and treatment of zzso
