As our understanding of stem-cell zzso rapidly increases, more and more reports suggest that use of stem-cell therapy will extend well beyond zzso medicine in the near zzso Due to their inherent zzso migratory properties, stem cells can serve as vehicles for the delivery of effective, targeted treatment to isolated zzso and to zzso zzso In zzso stem cells can readily be engineered by inserting specifically tailored zzso with zzso effects to create zzso therapeutic zzso zzso effects include direct zzso killing, promotion of local immune responses, zzso virus production, and zzso zzso zzso Many of these strategies have been validated in a wide range of studies assessing treatment feasibility or efficacy and establishing methods for real-time monitoring of stem-cell migration and fate in zzso New insights into avenues for stem-cell sourcing have shortened the probable time to zzso of such treatments for zzso In this Review, we provide an outline of the rationale and status of zzso treatments for zzso and we discuss prospects for clinical zzso and the factors crucial for maintaining momentum towards this zzso
