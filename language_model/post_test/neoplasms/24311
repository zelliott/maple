The mechanisms by which zzso and zzso zzso regulate zzso remain zzso We generated a mouse zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain zzso zzso exhibited increased sensitivity to zzso degradation and decreased zzso capacity, zzso with deficient cell cycle arrest and reduced zzso zzso zzso induced zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso loss did not alter zzso stability but significantly increased zzso zzso to partially restore cycle zzso In contrast, decreasing zzso levels increased zzso levels without altering zzso zzso Thus, zzso regulates zzso activity, while zzso mainly controls zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso loss dramatically improved zzso suppression of zzso tumors, emphasizing the importance of targeting zzso in zzso designed to activate zzso
