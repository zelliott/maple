This review focuses on vascular zzso growth factors zzso a group of zzso proteins that serve as key growth factors for zzso zzso Pathways induced by zzso proteins that regulate biological functions of key cell types involved in tumor zzso including vascular zzso cells, zzso and tumor cells, are zzso Strategies that are currently being developed and tested based on the emerging definitions of the roles of the multiple cell types involved in tumor vessel development, their selective production of zzso proteins and other zzso growth factors, their expression of associated receptors as well as identification of signal zzso pathways involved in zzso tumor survival and zzso zzso will be zzso
