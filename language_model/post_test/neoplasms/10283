The zzso growth factor zzso axis is an important signaling zzso in the growth and survival of many cell and tissue zzso This zzso has also been implicated in many aspects of cancer progression from zzso to zzso The multiple roles of zzso signaling in cancer suggest that zzso of the zzso might yield clinically effective zzso 

We describe zzso a novel zzso zzso small zzso inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso responsible for zzso signal zzso This compound was first tested for its activity and selectivity via conventional in zzso zzso profiling and cellular zzso zzso Additionally, cellular selectivity and efficacy of zzso were analyzed in an zzso zzso cell line by zzso signaling and zzso zzso Finally, in zzso efficacy of zzso was assessed in the zzso cell line and in a zzso model as a single agent as well as in combination with clinically approved zzso targeting zzso in models of pancreatic and zzso cell lung zzso 

zzso is a selective zzso inhibitor that is able to abrogate zzso of the zzso both in zzso and in zzso This novel compound zzso as a single agent is able to produce significant growth zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso is also able to provide additive effects when used in combination with clinically approved agents directed against zzso in zzso cell lung and human pancreatic tumor zzso 

These results suggest that a selective zzso inhibitor such as zzso may provide a useful clinical therapeutic for zzso zzso affected tumors and warrants further zzso
