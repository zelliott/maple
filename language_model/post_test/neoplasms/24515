The dogma that genetic zzso are restricted to directly zzso cells has been challenged by observations in which effects of zzso radiation, characteristically associated with the consequences of energy deposition in the cell nucleus, arise in zzso zzso zzso so called, zzso effects are demonstrated in cells that have received damaging signals produced by zzso cells zzso bystander zzso or that are the descendants of zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso instability is characterized by a number of delayed adverse responses including zzso zzso gene zzso and cell zzso Similar effects, as well as responses that may be regarded as zzso have been attributed to bystander zzso zzso the majority of studies to date have used in zzso systems, some adverse zzso effects have been demonstrated in zzso However, at least for zzso zzso zzso zzso instability in zzso may not necessarily be a reflection of zzso unstable zzso Rather the damage may reflect responses to ongoing production of damaging zzso zzso bystander responses, but not in the sense used to describe the rapidly induced effects resulting from direct interaction of zzso and zzso zzso The findings are consistent with a delayed and zzso tissue reaction to radiation injury characteristic of an inflammatory response with the potential for zzso zzso zzso An important implication of the findings is that contrary to conventional zzso dogma and interpretation of zzso risk estimates, zzso radiation may contribute to zzso and particularly childhood zzso by promoting initiated cells rather than being the initiating zzso zzso mechanisms may also contribute to other pathological zzso
