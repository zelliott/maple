In patients with zzso zzso zzso blood T zzso proliferated in zzso in response to zzso freshly isolated zzso tumor cells in the zzso mixed zzso culture zzso and to zzso blood zzso cells in the zzso mixed zzso culture zzso Treatment of the zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso capacity in zzso but not in zzso A subset of T cells that formed zzso with zzso zzso showed zzso response to zzso zzso cells, whereas this subset did not respond to zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso were zzso by zzso on zzso zzso density zzso zzso T zzso were excellent zzso in zzso but were weak zzso in zzso Small T zzso proliferated zzso in zzso but responded poorly in zzso Large zzso zzso zzso did not zzso in mixed cultures of either zzso Instead, zzso suppressed the zzso proliferation in zzso The same zzso zzso however, had no zzso effect on zzso zzso of the zzso subset reduced or abolished zzso response in zzso in all cases, whereas it was ineffective in diminishing the reaction in 6 of 8 zzso In contrast, removal of the zzso subset decreased or eliminated zzso proliferation in 4 of 8 zzso but in none of the zzso These results indicate that the zzso T zzso zzso in response to tumor cells and zzso zzso cells differ in several zzso Thus, the reaction in the zzso is not due to zzso zzso cells in the zzso population and may be a zzso zzso zzso
