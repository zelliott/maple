zzso of the zzso is now recognized as a major mechanism involved in the development and progression of human diseases such as zzso As opposed to the irreversible nature of genetic events, which introduce changes in the primary DNA zzso zzso modifications are zzso and leave the original DNA sequence zzso There is now evidence that the zzso landscape in humans zzso modifications as the result of normal aging, with older individuals exhibiting higher levels of promoter zzso compared to younger zzso Thus, it has been proposed that the higher zzso of certain disease in older individuals might be, in part, a consequence of an inherent change in the control and regulation of the zzso These observations are of remarkable clinical significance since the zzso zzso changes characteristic of disease provide a unique platform for the development of new therapeutic zzso In this review, we address the significance of DNA zzso changes that result or lead to disease, occur with aging, or may be the result of environmental zzso We provide a detailed description of quantitative techniques currently available for the detection and analysis of DNA zzso and provide a comprehensive framework that may allow for the incorporation of protocols which include DNA zzso as a tool for disease diagnosis and zzso which could lead to the tailoring of therapeutic approaches designed to individual patient zzso
