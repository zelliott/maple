The zzso zzso protein zzso with a specified number of tandem repeats has been expressed by zzso of the zzso in both the zzso cell lines zzso and zzso and human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso The structure and zzso states of the zzso in these four lines were compared with that of the zzso zzso found in the human pancreatic zzso and breast zzso tumor cell lines using flow zzso and Western zzso analysis with zzso zzso which are either sensitive or insensitive to the zzso state of the tandem zzso and zzso of cells with zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso A similar analysis of zzso expression in zzso normal and zzso defective zzso cells reveals that the addition of zzso to the core zzso structure is apparently responsible for the anomalous difference in zzso between the mature and zzso forms of the zzso Both the tumor cells and the zzso zzso cells consistently express significant steady state levels of both the heavily zzso mature forms and the poorly zzso zzso forms of the zzso whereas zzso is found predominantly as the mature extensively zzso species in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cross sections of the polarized zzso cells grown on culture filter zzso reveals that the zzso is clearly present at the zzso surface of the cells, consistent with its expression in normal zzso Thus, the successful expression of the zzso by zzso of either zzso cells or zzso cells yields model systems both for studying the natural zzso relationships of the protein zzso within the zzso zzso and for further zzso the previously reported zzso zzso recognition of the zzso
