We have attempted to establish in zzso growth in a consecutive series of 245 zzso zzso submitted for routine zzso Initially, three zzso procedures were zzso mechanical zzso zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso The resulting cell zzso had varying success rates in establishing zzso zzso zzso cell growth was achieved in zzso culture in 63 zzso and the sensitivity of the cells to zzso agents was zzso There was no indiscriminate zzso effect, and each zzso type varied in its sensitivity from one patient's zzso to zzso While testing of all solid zzso is not possible with zzso techniques, we believe that the employment of in zzso sensitivity testing as a routine procedure may be possible in the future if a suitable system giving correlation between in zzso and in zzso sensitivity can be zzso
