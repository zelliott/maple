Cellular zzso is achieved by the proper balance of regulatory networks that if disrupted can lead to cellular zzso These cell circuits are fine-tuned and maintained by the coordinated function of proteins and zzso zzso zzso In addition to the zzso protein coding and zzso constituents, large zzso are also emerging as important regulatory molecules in zzso and zzso zzso Recent studies have revealed zzso insight of large zzso regulating key cancer pathways at a zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here we zzso these latest advances within the context of their zzso roles in regulating and maintaining cellular zzso We zzso that similar to zzso zzso large zzso are a newly emerging class of zzso and zzso zzso Our growing knowledge of the role of large zzso in cellular transformation is pointing towards their potential use as zzso and targets for novel therapeutic approaches in the zzso
