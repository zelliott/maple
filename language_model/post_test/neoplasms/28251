To assess survival in cancer patients admitted to an intensive care unit zzso with respect to the nature of zzso cause of zzso zzso and course during zzso stay as well as to evaluate the zzso value of the Acute zzso and zzso Health zzso zzso III zzso 

zzso cohort zzso 

zzso at a university cancer referral zzso 

A total of zzso cancer patients admitted to the zzso during a period of 66 zzso 

zzso 

Charts of the patients were analyzed with respect to underlying disease, cause of admission, zzso III score, need and duration of mechanical zzso zzso and development of septic zzso as well as zzso survival and survival after zzso zzso data were compared with two control groups: zzso patients admitted to our zzso suffering from diseases other than cancer and zzso cancer patients not admitted to the zzso 

zzso survival was zzso and zzso survival was zzso The zzso mortality rate was significantly lower in both control zzso Patients admitted after bone zzso transplantation had the highest zzso In a zzso analysis, prognosis was zzso influenced by respiratory zzso the need of mechanical zzso and development of septic shock during the zzso zzso Admission after zzso resuscitation yielded high zzso mortality but a relatively good long-term zzso Admission after surgery and as a result of acute zzso was associated with a good zzso Age, zzso and underlying disease did not influence outcome zzso Admission zzso III scores were significantly higher in zzso but failed to predict individual outcome zzso All patients with zzso III scores of zzso died at the zzso 

A combination of factors must be taken into account to estimate a critically ill cancer patient's prognosis in the zzso The zzso III scoring system alone should not be used to make decisions about therapy zzso Admission to the zzso worsens the prognosis of a cancer patient zzso however, as zzso mortality is zzso comparable with severely ill zzso patients, general reluctance to admit cancer patients to an zzso does not seem to be zzso
