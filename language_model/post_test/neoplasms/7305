zzso receptors from human tumors were isolated by zzso zzso zzso and affinity zzso zzso The isolated zzso receptors showed specificity for zzso in the closed chamber zzso technique and also in the zzso experiments using zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso receptors isolated from tumor tissue are similar to zzso receptors isolated from normal human zzso dog zzso and peripheral white blood cells zzso However, the zzso receptors isolated from zzso are more potent zzso when compared with zzso zzso and peripheral zzso zzso zzso Also, zzso receptors isolated from the various sources are independent of species zzso
