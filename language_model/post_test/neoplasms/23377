Much effort in cancer research has focused on the tiny part of our zzso that codes for zzso However, it has recently been recognized that zzso also contribute decisively to zzso Studies have also shown that zzso zzso by zzso island zzso of zzso with tumor zzso activities is a common feature of human zzso The importance of other classes of zzso zzso such as long zzso zzso zzso and transcribed zzso regions zzso as altered elements in zzso is also gaining zzso Thus, we wondered whether there were other zzso undergoing zzso island zzso zzso in cancer zzso We focused on the small zzso zzso zzso a subset of zzso with a wide variety of cellular functions, such as chemical modification of zzso zzso processing and control of alternative zzso By data mining zzso databases and the scientific literature, we selected 49 zzso that had a zzso island within zzso 2 zzso or that were processed from a host gene with a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of multiple clones in normal colon zzso and the zzso cancer cell line zzso showed that 46 zzso were equally zzso in the two zzso completely zzso zzso zzso 26) or fully zzso zzso zzso zzso Most interestingly, the host zzso zzso islands of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso in the cancer cells but not in the corresponding normal zzso zzso island zzso was associated with the zzso zzso of the respective zzso zzso of a DNA zzso zzso platform in a comprehensive collection of normal zzso cancer cell lines and primary zzso demonstrated that the observed zzso of zzso was a common feature of various tumor types, particularly in zzso Overall, our findings indicate the existence of a new zzso of zzso zzso that are targeted by zzso zzso in human zzso
