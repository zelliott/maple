zzso zzso of zzso and double zzso block zzso have been increasingly zzso as potent zzso zzso of therapeutic drugs, zzso zzso zzso and zzso agents due to improved water zzso zzso and extended blood circulation zzso Though passive and active targeted drug delivery strategies have long been proposed to promote desirable drug zzso specifically at the disease sites, the introduction of zzso into zzso block zzso zzso can additionally lead to zzso release of zzso agents into target pathological zzso and cells, with zzso advantages of enhanced delivery efficiency and therapeutic zzso zzso designed zzso block zzso zzso can exhibit chemical structure zzso zzso zzso and zzso or even zzso into zzso or smaller ones under external stimuli such as zzso temperature, zzso strength, zzso potential, light, electric, and magnetic fields, and specific zzso molecules and zzso Compared to normal zzso pathological sites such as tumor zzso typically exhibit vascular zzso weak acidity zzso zzso abnormal temperatures, zzso proteins and zzso zzso high levels of zzso and zzso small zzso species, zzso Moreover, upon cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso will be subjected to zzso pH zzso zzso zzso in early zzso and pH zzso in late zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso zzso within different cell zzso and the zzso Thus, block zzso zzso responsive to the above described zzso stimuli or zzso signals characteristic of zzso zzso and cells will provide an alternative type of zzso zzso strategy, which can be zzso to further boost therapeutic efficacy and imaging sensitivity via disease zzso delivery and controlled zzso A variety of zzso or zzso stimuli innate to disease sites, such as mildly zzso zzso temperature, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and abnormal levels of zzso molecules or zzso have been zzso for this zzso In this review, we zzso recent advances in zzso block zzso zzso which are responsive to tumor and zzso zzso and their applications in zzso drug delivery and enhanced imaging zzso
