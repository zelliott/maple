A zzso (1 zzso zzso serial electrical zzso zzso zzso system has been zzso It is based on 16 active zzso and can be extended up to zzso Each active zzso can be programmed for current driving and for measuring either the injected current or the zzso difference between adjacent electrodes, and includes zzso zzso Real and imaginary parts of the zzso are obtained by applying a zzso identification method zzso zzso but other techniques are easily zzso Image reconstruction is carried out using the Sheffield filtered zzso zzso zzso frequency images are under development and should be of great interest to distinguish between normal and zzso zzso
