Two zzso zzso produced by zzso were identified by an indirect zzso A binding zzso that define cell surface zzso expressed on cultured human melanoma cells but not on zzso zzso zzso The first zzso zzso (an zzso zzso bound to zzso melanoma lines, zzso zzso and zzso 7/7 zzso and zzso zzso fetal cell lines, zzso zzso cell lines, and zzso to zzso leukemia zzso The second zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso with the fetal cells, but not with the zzso or zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso and zzso with 28 other zzso zzso from different laboratories identified several with similar binding patterns to a panel of tumor and zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso was not observed by zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, zzso was completely blocked by zzso zzso showing that these two zzso bind to the same zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso a 95 zzso zzso membrane protein and the zzso zzso bound a 125 zzso protein from zzso melanoma zzso The broad distribution of these two proteins on zzso and other solid tumors suggests that they define common zzso zzso expressed on zzso zzso
