The aim of this study was to examine the relationship of changes in zzso levels to changes in fatigue and cognitive functioning in cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy zzso zzso zzso patients completed a self-administered measure of fatigue and a battery of zzso measures of cognitive performance before the start of chemotherapy and again before the start of the fourth treatment zzso zzso levels were measured at corresponding zzso zzso partially supported the hypothesis that greater declines in zzso over the course of repeated chemotherapy administrations would be accompanied by greater increases in fatigue and greater declines in cognitive performance over the same zzso Among the subset of 49 patients who demonstrated a decline in zzso to a final value zzso or zzso zzso greater declines in zzso were significantly zzso related to greater increases in fatigue duration and zzso and more negative changes in performance on three cognitive zzso These findings suggest that, in addition to previously reported relationships with fatigue, declines in zzso levels during chemotherapy treatment are associated with adverse changes in cognitive zzso
