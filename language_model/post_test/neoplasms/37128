An experimental study with zzso was performed in order to evaluate the effect of the tumor volume on the quantitative zzso in tumor zzso The ratio of mean zzso in the phantom to that of the background zzso zzso was well correlated with the size of the zzso even when the concentration of the zzso zzso solution of zzso zzso with diameters of 29, 37 and 46 zzso was constant, the greater the size of the zzso the higher was the zzso zzso This study showed that we should understand that the zzso ratio was certainly affected by the reduction of the tumor size itself whenever we evaluate zzso or assess tumor viability after treatment by reference to the zzso zzso
