With the advent of next generation sequencing methods and progress in zzso analysis, it became obvious that the human zzso contains much more than just zzso zzso In fact, up to zzso of our zzso is transcribed into zzso that does not serve as templates for zzso In this review, we focus on the emerging roles of these long zzso zzso zzso in the field of tumor zzso Long zzso were found to be zzso in several human zzso and show zzso zzso zzso studies revealed a broad spectrum of mechanisms applied by zzso such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso to fulfill their zzso Here, we link the cellular processes influenced by long zzso to the hallmarks of cancer and therefore provide an zzso zzso on tumor zzso This should stimulate new research directions and therapeutic options considering long zzso as novel zzso markers and therapeutic zzso
