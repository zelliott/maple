The population of cells that comprises a zzso may consist of genetically different zzso Often, such zzso result from the expansion of a new, advantageous zzso The hypothesis is presented that sometimes zzso cells may adopt zzso strategies to boost their own replication at the expense of other cells in the zzso zzso zzso models have been used to study this hypothesis, taking as an example the hypothetical advantage gained by zzso cells which produce a zzso to harm other zzso zzso The models show that zzso which cause cells to produce zzso substances can spread through the zzso cell population, as can zzso for resistance to the zzso in other circumstances, stable zzso between these strategies can zzso The path of the zzso cell population to internal or external equilibrium is often complex, with large fluctuations in zzso zzso zzso strategies are usually superior to fixed zzso As in populations of whole organisms, zzso interactions between zzso cells can act in zzso of the individual cell at the expense of the zzso as a whole: strategies that zzso the growth of the zzso can be selected and zzso zzso is theoretically zzso Many zzso in zzso especially in large or late-stage zzso may play a role in relations between zzso cells rather than providing those cells with a simple zzso zzso
