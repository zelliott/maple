zzso is an zzso of the family of zzso zzso zzso and is involved in the zzso of a large variety of regulatory proteins by zzso at basic zzso A large number of zzso have been attributed to zzso on the basis of in zzso and ex zzso zzso However, no zzso zzso have been confirmed directly in a zzso model system, and early embryonic zzso of a zzso zzso mouse model has precluded in zzso zzso of most candidate zzso Here, we report the generation and characterization of an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso resulted in near-complete zzso of the zzso fur zzso in zzso In sharp contrast with the general zzso zzso mouse model, no obvious adverse effects were observed in the transgenic mice after zzso zzso analysis of the liver did not reveal any overt zzso from normal zzso Analysis of candidate zzso in liver revealed complete zzso for the processing of the insulin zzso zzso degrees of zzso were observed for the processing of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso None of the tested zzso displayed a complete block of zzso The absence of a severe zzso raises the possibility of using zzso as a local therapeutic target in the treatment of zzso like cancer and viral infections, although the observed zzso may require combination therapy or the development of a more broad spectrum zzso zzso
