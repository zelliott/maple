One of the greatest challenges in zzso is to define the critical targets and network interactions that are zzso to elicit growth deregulation in human zzso zzso and developing rational treatments for cancer requires a definition of the key molecular targets and how they interact to elicit the complex growth deregulation zzso zzso proteins provide discerning and powerful zzso to understand both how cells work and how they can be manipulated using a minimal number of zzso The small DNA viruses have evolved to target inherent weaknesses in cellular protein interaction networks to zzso the cellular DNA and protein replication zzso In the battle to escape the inevitability of zzso and programmed cell death, zzso have zzso on similar mechanisms, through the acquisition and selection of zzso zzso that drive unchecked cellular replication in zzso zzso the dynamic mechanisms through which a minimal number of viral proteins promote host cells to undergo unscheduled and pathological replication is a powerful strategy to identify critical targets that are also disrupted in zzso zzso can therefore be used as tools to probe the zzso zzso interactions and structures that drive growth deregulation in human zzso Ultimately this can provide a path for developing system zzso zzso This review will describe ongoing experimental approaches using viruses to study pathways zzso in cancer, with a particular focus on viral cellular zzso interactions and zzso
