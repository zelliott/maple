zzso scaffold comprises a zzso ring system and is known to exhibit a wide range of biological properties including zzso and zzso zzso zzso derivatives have long been zzso used for the treatment of various zzso However, in recent years, zzso have emerged as an important zzso in the development of zzso zzso The promising biological profile and synthetic accessibility have been attractive in the design and development of new zzso and their zzso systems as potential zzso 

This review mainly focuses on the structural modifications of zzso scaffold, development of various series of zzso and their zzso as new zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso derivatives bearing zzso zzso and their in zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso relationships zzso zzso zzso clinical use and their future therapeutic applications are discussed zzso 

A large number of zzso derivatives discussed here possess potent zzso activity and can be further developed as drug zzso zzso zzso could also display synergistic effect and still there is a need to use the drug combinations permitting lower dose and development of new generation of zzso Despite encouraging results that have been observed for their response to tumor in clinical studies, full characterization of their toxicity is further required for their clinical usage as safe drugs for the treatment of zzso We believe that this review gives a better understanding and scope for future drug design and development of zzso compounds to zzso their use in cancer zzso
