zzso zzso selective cell zzso using the zzso zzso has been achieved in zzso by targeting the zzso gene to the zzso cells of the zzso zzso in transgenic zzso We report that the cell zzso occurs very zzso starting as early as 7 h after administration of the zzso By zzso the zzso transgenic mice to a zzso mouse strain, we have generated zzso transgenic mice on a zzso zzso background and tested zzso cell zzso in these zzso The transgenic mice lacking a functional zzso gene showed cell zzso at a similar level compared with zzso zzso transgenic mice, showing that functional zzso is not required for zzso zzso cell zzso These results provide further support for using this system in zzso zzso
