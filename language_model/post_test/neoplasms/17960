The objective of this study was to determine the minimum volume of blood that should be discarded from a range of different types of central zzso zzso zzso such that the subsequent blood sample was not diluted or contaminated by the residual zzso zzso 

zzso children aged zzso years with central zzso access inserted as part of their standard clinical treatment were recruited to this prospective zzso zzso comparison of the extent of variation in zzso and zzso parameters observed between two blood samples taken following routine 5 zzso discard blood volumes, as compared to the extent of variation between samples drawn following a 5 zzso discard volume and zzso zzso volumes, was carried zzso 

Data indicate that the measurement error in a clinical sample obtained following a 3 zzso discard volume is no different to the measurement error obtained when using a standard 5 zzso discard zzso zzso results were obtained from patients with various different types of zzso or zzso zzso 

The withdrawal of a 3 zzso discard volume is sufficient to ensure that the subsequent blood sample is not diluted or contaminated by residual zzso zzso This may have a significant clinical impact in zzso zzso where patients frequently require blood zzso due to the zzso zzso associated with zzso It is hoped that these results will impact on hospital policies concerning specified discard volumes taken from zzso prior to the withdrawal of blood samples for research purposes and routine clinical zzso
