Although the zzso of white zzso tissue zzso is a risk factor for disease, brown zzso tissue zzso has been suggested to have a protective role against zzso 

We studied whether changes in BAT were related to changes in the amounts of subcutaneous zzso tissue zzso and visceral zzso tissue zzso in children treated for zzso 

We examined the effect of BAT activity on weight, SAT, and zzso in 32 pediatric patients with cancer whose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scans at diagnosis showed no BAT zzso Changes in weight, SAT, and zzso from diagnosis to zzso for children with metabolically active BAT at zzso follow-up zzso were compared with those in children without zzso BAT when free of disease zzso 

zzso zzso studies zzso zzso zzso zzso later) after successful treatment of the cancer showed zzso in 19 patients but no active BAT zzso in 13 zzso zzso patients, in comparison with zzso patients, gained significantly less weight zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and had significantly less SAT zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso during zzso Multiple zzso analysis indicated that the inverse relations between BAT zzso and measures of weight, SAT, and zzso persisted even after age, zzso treatment, and the season when the zzso scans were obtained were accounted zzso 

The zzso of BAT in pediatric patients undergoing treatment of zzso is associated with significantly less zzso zzso This trial was registered at zzso as zzso
