Using approaches first applied in human zzso recent progress has been made in the identification of putative cancer stem cells in several different zzso and other solid zzso Additional studies have suggested that cancer stem cells may be derived not only from transformation of zzso long-term stem cells but also from short-lived zzso that then obtain the ability to undergo zzso zzso the zzso observed in many types of human zzso may reflect the zzso of specific zzso and/or loss of specific tumor zzso genes and the different stem and/or zzso cell populations in which these genetic or zzso events zzso zzso have been observed in the pathways regulating stem cell zzso and zzso and increasing evidence also suggests that treatment failure and the recurrence of human cancer may reflect the intrinsic zzso and drug resistance of cancer stem zzso
