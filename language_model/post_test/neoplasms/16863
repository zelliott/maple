A phase zzso clinical study was undertaken to assess the efficacy of zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso factor in attenuating zzso and associated morbidity caused by high-dose zzso chemotherapy administered in the presence or absence of zzso bone zzso zzso 

Twenty-two patients with various solid tumors and zzso zzso were treated with a single daily subcutaneous dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso 48 hours after receiving a second cycle of highly zzso chemotherapy for a period of 10 zzso zzso comparisons on zzso clinical and laboratory variables were made with data obtained from the same patients after they received the first zzso cycle of identical chemotherapy in the absence of zzso 

zzso was active in zzso patients because it significantly increased the zzso zzso reduced the time of relevant zzso and reduced the duration of a patient's hospital stay and the necessity for zzso zzso No significant toxicity was encountered with subcutaneous zzso zzso 

Although zzso was shown to significantly reduce zzso morbidity in patients receiving zzso cancer chemotherapy, additional studies are needed to assess whether the use of zzso in zzso chemotherapy will allow an increase in the dosage level, leading to improved response rates and survival among cancer zzso
