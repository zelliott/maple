zzso is a humanized zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso of zzso growth factor zzso zzso We conducted a phase I trial to assess the zzso zzso effects of escalating doses of zzso administered alone in patients with advanced solid zzso zzso 

Patients were treated with escalating doses of weekly intravenous zzso at doses ranging between 100 and 800 zzso zzso and skin zzso were done before start of treatment and repeated 3 weeks after to assess zzso expression of zzso and its downstream zzso 

zzso patients were zzso including 1 patient never zzso Although 1 zzso zzso was observed at 100 zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso dose was escalated to 800 zzso with no other zzso No grade 4 toxicity was zzso Only 3 patients developed a grade 1 zzso rash zzso One patient achieved a partial response zzso and 8 patients had stable disease zzso The median zzso was zzso zzso No significant changes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were observed between zzso and zzso tumor or skin zzso 

zzso could be safety administered up to 800 zzso with manageable zzso No relationships were found between zzso effects on zzso downstream signaling pathways and drug efficacy or zzso
