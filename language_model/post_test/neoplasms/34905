zzso of zzso a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso is restricted to activated T and B zzso and mature zzso zzso zzso has also been detected on zzso tumors and on zzso The restricted expression pattern of zzso in normal zzso and its widespread expression in various zzso makes it an attractive target for zzso zzso zzso to exploit zzso as a cancer target have lead to the identification of potential zzso clinical zzso zzso zzso for therapeutic use have been developed and used to validate zzso as a target for zzso zzso are also used as a vehicle to deliver potent zzso drugs to target zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso targeting zzso have been tested in animal models of human zzso 

To describe the expression of zzso in cancer cells and the development of zzso therapies against zzso 

A review of the available zzso 

zzso zzso zzso have shown significant zzso activity in zzso zzso models of zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso exhibit potent zzso activity in solid tumor zzso models, confirming increased therapeutic efficacy through zzso drug zzso Thus, zzso animal models have provided strong evidence that targeting zzso either with zzso zzso or with zzso zzso represents a promising approach to treat human zzso
