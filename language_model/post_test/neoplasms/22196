The establishment of the correct conceptual framework is vital to any scientific discipline including cancer zzso zzso by zzso cancer studies, the current cancer concept focuses on the zzso patterns of progression as defined by specific zzso genetic zzso This concept has faced a tough challenge as the majority of cancer cases follow zzso patterns and display zzso zzso In light of the recent discovery that zzso instability is directly linked to zzso zzso zzso aberrations zzso and that cancer progression can be characterized as a dynamic relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso aberrations zzso we propose that the dynamics of zzso is a key element for zzso evolution in solid zzso To support this viewpoint, we briefly discuss various basic elements responsible for cancer initiation and progression within an evolutionary zzso We argue that even though zzso changes can be detected at various levels of genetic organization, such as at the gene level and zzso level, it is primarily detected at the zzso or zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso variation plays a dominant role in cancer zzso To further illustrate the involvement of zzso cycles in the pattern of cancer evolution, four cancer evolutionary models have been proposed based on the comparative analysis of zzso patterns of various types of zzso
