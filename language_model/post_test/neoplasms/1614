With the completion of the human zzso sequence and the advent of zzso zzso technologies, it is now possible to study the entire human zzso and zzso The challenge in the next decade of biomedical research is to functionally zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso technology has already produced massive amounts of data including zzso zzso single zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso Our ability to manage and analyze data needs to match the speed of data zzso We will zzso our studies of zzso gene expression using zzso and zzso approaches and identification of sequence motifs that are signature of imprinted zzso We will also discuss about how zzso can facilitate zzso zzso
