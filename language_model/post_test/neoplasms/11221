Advances in radiation zzso have been made on three major fronts: biology, physics, and clinical zzso Our biological understanding of how radiation kills cells and how zzso cells avoid damage has identified new targets for therapeutic zzso Research in physics has yielded sophisticated methods to direct the deposition of radiation energy in ways that enhance target coverage while minimizing dose to normal structures as much as zzso zzso radiation therapy zzso and zzso radiation therapy represent new zzso in treatment planning and dose zzso Clinical management of the cancer patient is zzso Increasingly, combinations of radiation and chemotherapy, with or without surgery, are enhancing cure rates, often with preservation of organ zzso Taken together, these advances have increased the effectiveness of radiation therapy and promise better treatment results in the zzso
