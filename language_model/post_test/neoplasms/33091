This report describes the technique and initial experience using cone beam CT zzso for zzso of treatment targets in patients undergoing zzso body radiation therapy zzso Patients selected for zzso underwent 3-D or zzso CT scans in a customized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso radiation beams, multiple 3-D zzso beams, or dynamic zzso arcs were delivered using a zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso images were obtained prior to each zzso and registered to the planning CT by using soft tissue and zzso structures to assure accurate zzso zzso Patients were zzso for treatment based on the zzso zzso zzso images zzso zzso or zzso were taken before and after beam delivery to further assess zzso zzso Ten patients with zzso liver, and spine zzso received 29 zzso of treatment using this zzso The prescription doses ranged zzso approximately zzso zzso in 1 approximately 5 zzso Compared to traditional zzso matching using zzso structures, zzso zzso target zzso from 1 zzso to 15 zzso with an average of 5 zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso images demonstrated an average 2 zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso may enhance positioning zzso Typical total zzso times for the patients are approximately 1 zzso zzso zzso is feasible and enhances setup accuracy using 3-D anatomical zzso
