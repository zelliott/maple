Despite advances in targeted therapies, there is an ongoing need to develop new and effective zzso drug combinations in zzso cell lung cancer zzso Based on zzso demonstration of additive zzso we evaluated the safety and efficacy of combining zzso and zzso zzso bound zzso zzso with a focus on zzso for phase II zzso 

A 3 + 3 zzso design was used to determine the maximum tolerated dose zzso and the recommended phase II dose zzso Three dose levels were zzso zzso 500 zzso day 1 and zzso day 1 at 180, zzso & 260 zzso every 21 zzso Phase II eligibility included advanced zzso zzso line prior therapy, zzso zzso adequate organ zzso zzso zzso for further study was response rate zzso zzso zzso 

Planned dose escalation was completed without reaching the zzso The zzso was zzso 500 zzso and zzso 260 zzso The phase II portion accrued 37 zzso before early closure due to increasing zzso zzso zzso use in zzso zzso In 31 zzso phase II patients there were 5 partial responses, 12 stable disease, 14 progressive zzso The median overall survival was zzso zzso progressive disease zzso months and disease control zzso zzso 

zzso 500 zzso day 1 with zzso 260 zzso was feasible and well zzso The phase II component demonstrated activity in zzso therapy of advanced zzso response rate zzso and disease control rate zzso Treatment practice patterns of advanced zzso have zzso further trials of this regimen are not zzso
