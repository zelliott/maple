To compare the zzso of continuous zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso with that of oral zzso and to describe zzso and clinical activity of prolonged oral administration of zzso 

A randomized, zzso zzso study compared zzso zzso to an oral zzso zzso zzso patients zzso zzso were randomly assigned to receive zzso combination zzso zzso zzso zzso for 7 zzso during the first study period, followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso for 7 zzso during period 2, with a zzso zzso between zzso Sixteen patients zzso zzso received treatment in the opposite zzso In period 3, all patients received zzso zzso zzso for 28 zzso Plasma levels of zzso during zzso and oral administration were analyzed in periods 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was determined by measuring plasma zzso urinary zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso 

There were no grade 3 or 4 zzso in either zzso zzso responses were observed in three zzso Another three patients had stable disease for zzso or zzso 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso were similar to those observed in previous studies and were unaffected by administration zzso The mean zzso zzso zzso plasma concentration zzso and area under the curve zzso for zzso zzso (104 zzso 45 zzso and zzso zzso 826 zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso greater than those for oral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 182 zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso Individual zzso zzso during zzso were highly zzso whereas those after zzso were very zzso zzso activity in zzso before each study period was zzso 

Both zzso zzso and oral zzso were well zzso with moderate activity in these heavily zzso zzso However, zzso zzso zzso and zzso achieved with oral zzso were significantly less than with zzso zzso
