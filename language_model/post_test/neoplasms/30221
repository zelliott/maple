A zzso procedure was proposed for the optimum design of zzso zzso systems enhanced by zzso zzso plots displayed the relationships among zzso plasma level, current density and initial drug concentration in a zzso This information was combined with a zzso expression of the process time constant, estimated as the zzso in the blood reaches a plateau after application of the electric zzso Analysis was conducted using zzso variables and did not require zzso zzso zzso results show that a current density of zzso zzso and a loading of zzso zzso of zzso sodium zzso were necessary to achieve an equilibrium plasma concentration of zzso zzso with a time constant of zzso zzso
