The zzso sleeve of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso represent frequent and dangerous zzso of central zzso zzso zzso due to the risk of zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso factors zzso (such as zzso zzso are known to be associated with increased zzso zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of zzso III zzso zzso zzso as a risk factor for zzso in cancer patients undergoing zzso The study groups included patients with a reduced AT III activity zzso zzso 20 consecutive zzso and with normal AT III values zzso zzso 20 randomly selected zzso requiring a VC for chemotherapy and/or total zzso zzso The study protocol included evaluation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and AT III at days 0, 1, 3 and 8 after zzso and upon VC zzso zzso and pullout zzso were performed in all patients on zzso zzso A quantitative scale was developed to evaluate both VC and zzso zzso degree in each zzso zzso segment zzso zzso superior zzso zzso the sum of the mean values was defined as overall zzso The average VC dwelling time was similar in both zzso There were no significant differences in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in the remaining parameters of the study between the two zzso The group with AT III zzso presented a higher degree of both zzso zzso zzso zzso and overall zzso zzso zzso zzso Data showed a higher severity of zzso zzso in patients with AT III zzso than in the control zzso Further studies are needed to evaluate whether the zzso zzso of AT III levels can reduce the zzso zzso
