The aim of this study was to determine whether an infrared zzso laser device zzso zzso changes could be identified before measurable modifications in tumor zzso 

zzso zzso treatment magnetic resonance zzso images of tumor zzso and zzso zzso were digitized and a linear transformation was performed to convert images to 256 intensity zzso Data were analyzed by using the zzso zzso and the zzso test zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso mean intensity values of tumor zzso increased significantly zzso zzso zzso for all of the seven patients zzso zzso 7) zzso For zzso zzso a significant increase zzso zzso zzso was measured in four patients zzso zzso zzso The zzso test showed significant values for the tumor tissue of six zzso zzso 6) zzso 

This is the first study of early evidence of zzso activity of a novel zzso showing a significant increase in the water content of tumor zzso before measurable changes in tumor zzso
