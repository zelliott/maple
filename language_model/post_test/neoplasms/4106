The gradual loss of DNA from the ends of zzso has been implicated in the control of cellular zzso zzso zzso is an zzso that restores zzso DNA zzso and expression of its activity was thought to be essential for the zzso of human cells, both in zzso and in tumor progression in zzso zzso activity has been detected in zzso of tumors of different types, but not in most normal adult zzso zzso It has also been detected in about zzso of human cell lines immortalized in zzso and in all zzso cell lines examined to zzso It has previously been shown that in zzso immortalized zzso cell lines acquire very long and zzso zzso in association with zzso presumably via one or more novel zzso mechanisms that we refer to as zzso zzso lengthening of zzso Here we report evidence for the presence of zzso in a subset of zzso cell lines and zzso The maintenance of zzso by a mechanism other than zzso even in a minority of zzso has major implications for therapeutic uses of zzso zzso
