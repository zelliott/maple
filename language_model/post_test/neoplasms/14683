I am proposing a theory which states that stimulation of the immune system at birth detects and destroys embryonic cells or components zzso including zzso pattern zzso molecular structure defects and so forth which may be the source of zzso not only in infancy but throughout zzso The facts are that: Fetal rests or zzso zzso remain in many of the zzso of the zzso liver, the zzso the zzso the brain and so zzso These rests are usually absorbed by the end of the first year of life, but recent evidence indicates that zzso of this fetal tissue may remain throughout one's entire life and be precursors of zzso In animals and in humans, the zzso from zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso Many tumors express fetal zzso and zzso fetal zzso zzso was found in adult cancer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported in cancer of the zzso fetal alkaline zzso has been found in many adult zzso Fetal tissue injected into animals will zzso these animals against certain transplanted zzso Recently, in a lecture at zzso Institute, Sir Peter zzso Nobel Prize winner in medicine and until recently the head of the British Medical Research Council, described the use of zzso tissue as helpful in treating cancer of the zzso The zzso immune system is not fully zzso In fact, one can zzso an infant without typing because he has built no zzso to the blood types in early zzso It has been shown in individuals of any age who are zzso either by zzso or acquired that the rate of zzso may be as high as 10,000 times that of the general zzso The immune system controls cancer development to a great zzso Published data suggests that the immune system detects and destroys embryonic cells or components zzso that may be a locus for cancer zzso Our studies demonstrated that in some zzso zzso vaccinated newborns followed over a period of 20 years, there was an overall 74 percent reduction in the death rate from all forms of cancer when compared to a similar group not zzso The differences were highly significant zzso At an International zzso zzso zzso Against Cancer and zzso held in Chicago October zzso 1982, papers were presented from the zzso zzso Austria zzso and Israel zzso which support the thesis of a lowering of mortality from cancer and leukemia in infants vaccinated at birth with zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
