In 1994, zzso and colleagues zzso identified the zzso zzso a zzso zzso found in breast cancer patients with markedly worsened zzso as fatty acid zzso zzso key zzso for the de zzso fatty acid zzso It now appears that human zzso and their zzso zzso zzso over express zzso and undergo significant zzso fatty acid zzso Moreover, zzso blockade specifically zzso zzso cancer cell death and zzso survival of cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling seems to play a central role in the maintenance of the zzso zzso by enhancing cancer cell survival and zzso This review documents the rapidly changing perspectives on the function of zzso in cancer zzso First, we describe molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso driven by zzso changes zzso the zzso effects of dietary fatty zzso resulting in zzso zzso zzso to nutritional zzso Second, we speculate von the putative function that zzso can play as the zzso factor that triggers and maintains zzso zzso in cancer cells by inducing changes in gene expression and in metabolism for zzso Third, we explore the role that zzso exhibits in cancer evolution by specifically regulating zzso proteins such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, we reveal previously zzso functions of zzso on the response of cancer cells to zzso zzso zzso These findings, all together, should ultimately enhance our understanding of how zzso zzso fatty acid zzso once considered a minor zzso zzso in normal cells, has become a zzso in cancer zzso
