Nurses are potentially exposed to zzso in their working zzso We investigated the risks for 21 types of zzso in Danish zzso 

We identified 92 140 female nurses from the computerized files of the Danish zzso zzso By record linkage, we reconstructed information on employment since 1964 using data from a national pension zzso information on vital status and reproduction was obtained from the Central zzso zzso Each woman was zzso from zzso in the Danish Cancer zzso We calculated standardized zzso ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso Using zzso zzso models, we made internal comparisons in zzso of zzso adjusting for potential zzso 

We documented zzso zzso during follow-up and found significantly increased zzso for breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the brain and nervous system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other skin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased risks were observed for zzso and zzso zzso Nurses who were zzso by the Association after 1981 had significantly increased risks for zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the brain and nervous system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Former nurses had significantly increased zzso for all zzso combined and breast cancer the first ten years after leaving the zzso In a zzso zzso analysis of breast cancer and duration of employment in hospitals, adjusted for zzso factors, nurses had an increase risk the first 25 years of zzso but not for longer zzso 

The increased risk of breast cancer and the decreased risk of zzso and zzso zzso support the findings of most other studies on zzso The elevated risks for zzso of the breast, brain, nervous system, and zzso warrant further zzso
