zzso are exceptionally long living individuals who escaped the most common age-related zzso In particular they appear to be effectively protected from zzso The mechanisms that zzso this protection are quite complex and still largely zzso 

To critically zzso the literature in order to propose a unifying hypothesis that can account for this cancer protection in zzso 

Review of the scientific literature regarding three main players in zzso such as IGF-1, inflammation and zzso and zzso 

zzso appear to be zzso by low zzso responses and high levels of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso a condition that results in protection from zzso Both inflammation and IGF-1 zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso some studies indicate that genetic zzso of zzso are associated with human longevity by providing protection from cancer zzso 

The available data let us to zzso that among other possible mechanisms, zzso zzso responses are likely a key factor contributing to protection from cancer in zzso
