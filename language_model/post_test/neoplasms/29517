This study was designed to investigate the zzso role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were collected and primary cancer cells were zzso Gene expression was detected by quantitative zzso We found that zzso zzso was higher in patients with pancreatic zzso than those with gastric zzso colon zzso and liver zzso zzso correlations were found between expression of zzso and zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso correlated significantly with the zzso of zzso Assessing gene expression would be useful in predicting zzso sensitivity for patients with zzso zzso
