zzso zzso zzso is currently being used as a suicide gene for cancer gene zzso The premise of this therapy is the preferential zzso of zzso zzso to zzso by cancer cells expressing zzso zzso However, a lack of efficient gene transfer to tumors combined with inefficient zzso turnover currently limits the clinical applications of this gene therapy zzso We have used random zzso to create novel bacterial zzso zzso that demonstrate an increased preference for zzso over zzso Among the 15 zzso isolated, one zzso sensitivity to zzso coli in a negative selection system at a concentration of zzso that was zzso lower than a zzso dose for zzso zzso zzso of individual zzso found in this double zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the substitution at zzso zzso was solely responsible for the observed increase in sensitivity to zzso Additional zzso at zzso resulted in the identification of two more zzso with the ability to zzso enhanced zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso of the three CD zzso in the presence and absence of a transition state zzso analogue provide insights to the zzso of zzso binding specificity at the zzso position of the zzso zzso CD zzso zzso is a promising candidate for further gene therapy zzso
