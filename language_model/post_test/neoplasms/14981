zzso and repair of DNA damage is critical for maintaining zzso integrity and suppressing zzso In zzso cells, the sensing and repair of DNA damage are coordinated with cell cycle progression and zzso in order to prevent the propagation of damaged zzso The carefully maintained cellular response to DNA damage is challenged by zzso which produce a large amount of zzso DNA during zzso zzso also express proteins that zzso cellular DNA repair and cell cycle zzso promoting zzso in their quest for cellular zzso This review presents an overview of strategies employed by viruses to manipulate DNA damage responses and cell cycle checkpoints as they commandeer the cell to maximize their own viral zzso Studies of viruses have identified key cellular regulators and revealed insights into molecular mechanisms governing DNA repair, cell cycle zzso and zzso
