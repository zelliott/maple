In patients with advanced cancer, zzso zzso with low performance status and poor quality of zzso In addition, zzso may be associated with reduced response to zzso and a poor prognosis in cancer zzso Nearly all forms of zzso are closely associated with chronic inflammation and elevated levels of inflammatory and zzso circulating factors, including zzso protein zzso which is considered a valid laboratory and clinical zzso Among the different pathways involved in the production of inflammatory zzso and zzso the vitamin zzso D zzso zzso axis plays a fundamental zzso In this study, we explore the possible association between zzso and key factors pertaining to the vitamin D zzso particular, zzso gene zzso cancer patients with zzso Although certain tumor types are more commonly associated with zzso even within the same tumor type there are significant differences in the extent and duration of zzso Such variations may be due to zzso of the zzso gene that could lead to zzso zzso or to zzso zzso Identification of such zzso could be very helpful in the management of cancer zzso 

zzso cancer patients were recruited by the zzso Unit of the zzso zzso Data on age, zzso type of cancer, stage of cancer, and nutritional assessment, as well as zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels, were zzso zzso DNA was extracted from peripheral blood zzso and amplified by zzso chain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso gene were investigated using the respective restriction zzso For the different zzso zzso the absence or presence of the restriction sites were designated with capital or small letters, zzso For example, for the zzso zzso the presence of the zzso zzso identified the B zzso whereas the presence of the zzso zzso identified the b zzso 

Cancer patients with zzso have higher zzso levels compared with zzso cancer patients, independently from the zzso In zzso patients, the presence of specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso was associated with higher zzso zzso In particular, the zzso b and T zzso were more frequent in zzso cancer patients with elevated zzso levels than in zzso patients with normal zzso zzso 

From these results, we zzso that there is an association between zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso and the zzso zzso In particular, we propose that in cancer patients, the zzso of b and T zzso with elevated zzso levels may represent an early clinical predictor for the development of a more aggressive form of zzso
