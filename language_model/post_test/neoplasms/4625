This study was conducted in order to determine whether a gap exists between cancer patients with disabilities and those without disabilities with regard to short-term and long-term zzso mortality in zzso 

The National Health Insurance claims database and the National zzso Database were used for performance of zzso We identified zzso cancer patients zzso zzso zzso who were diagnosed as cancer according to zzso and who underwent treatment between January 1, 2000 and December 31, zzso To distinguish between short-term and long-term zzso zzso we performed survival analysis of short-term zzso zzso zzso mortality for cancer patients and then confined our analysis to zzso cancer survivors in order to assess the impacts of disability on long-term zzso zzso All analyses were performed according to zzso type of cancer, and type of zzso respectively, when cell sizes were large zzso 

Compared with the zzso group, neither male nor female cancer patients with disabilities showed higher short-term zzso zzso zzso zzso When we confined our analysis to zzso cancer survivors, both male zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and female zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso disability had higher long-term zzso mortality than those in the zzso zzso Male patients with impaired communication zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and female patients with internal disability zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had higher short-term zzso zzso zzso mortality than those without these zzso Among both male zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and female zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer survivors, impaired mobility showed a significant association with a higher long-term zzso 

This study raises concerns with regard to zzso disparities in cancer outcome among long-term cancer zzso Further attention and effective collaborative efforts are required for improvement of survival and quality of care for long-term cancer zzso
