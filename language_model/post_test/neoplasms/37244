Long term intravenous access is a common requirement for cancer zzso This analysis was designed to determine zzso morbidity and factors zzso of poor long term outcome for patients with subcutaneous single zzso intravenous access zzso 

Six hundred zzso patients who underwent subcutaneous intravenous port placement between June 1987 and May 1989 at Memorial zzso Cancer Center were followed zzso until port zzso death, or a maximum of 1960 zzso zzso for and circumstances of placement, patient diagnoses, patient zzso and subsequent courses of treatment were recorded, as well as technical and zzso zzso zzso zzso device specific, and complication free device zzso were zzso 

The median patient age was zzso years zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio was zzso to zzso Cancer diagnoses included solid organ tumors zzso leukemia zzso zzso zzso and others zzso zzso included access for systemic chemotherapy zzso total zzso nutrition zzso and others zzso One zzso complication and six zzso failures occurred, without zzso The estimated mean overall zzso device specific duration was zzso days zzso zzso zzso zzso mean complication free, device specific duration was zzso zzso zzso included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso site infection zzso zzso zzso zzso and accessibility failures such as zzso and leakage zzso zzso 40, zzso zzso for end of port duration were patient death zzso end of treatment zzso functional failure or intractable infection zzso and others zzso Independent factors zzso with decreased port specific, complication free duration included placement site, age, tumor type, and zzso tip zzso 

zzso intravenous access ports in cancer patients are safe and well zzso Long term device duration is primarily influenced by patient zzso In this study, zzso of patients alive at 1 year and zzso of patients alive at 4 years had a functional zzso
