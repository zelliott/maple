The zzso protein zzso protein zzso C zzso is a family of closely related zzso which are zzso activated by zzso generated by the binding of a variety of zzso to their cellular zzso Free fatty acids may also play a role in zzso zzso The zzso apparently mediates a wide range of signal zzso processes in cells and, therefore, zzso directed selectively against zzso may have wide-ranging therapeutic zzso This review highlights the evidence that inappropriate zzso of zzso occurs in a number of disease zzso Such evidence, however, is often seriously flawed because it relies on the use of zzso zzso which are potent and direct zzso zzso but may not mimic the zzso triggering of the zzso in cells, or on the use of zzso protein zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso A new generation of zzso derived from the lead provided by zzso shows a high degree of selectivity for zzso over closely related protein zzso and such agents may provide more appropriate tools to investigate the role of zzso in cellular zzso
