zzso agents zzso reduce anemia in cancer patients and may improve quality of life, but there are concerns that zzso might increase zzso 

Our objectives were to examine the effect of zzso and identify factors that modify the effects of zzso on overall survival, progression free survival, zzso and cardiovascular events as well as need for zzso and other important safety and efficacy outcomes in cancer zzso 

We searched the Cochrane Library, zzso zzso and conference proceedings for eligible zzso Manufacturers of zzso were contacted to identify additional zzso 

We included zzso controlled trials comparing zzso or zzso plus red blood cell zzso (as necessary) versus red blood cell zzso (as necessary) alone, to prevent or treat anemia in adult or pediatric cancer patients with or without concurrent zzso zzso 

We performed a zzso of zzso controlled trials comparing zzso zzso zzso beta or zzso alpha plus red blood cell zzso versus zzso alone, for prophylaxis or therapy of anemia while or after receiving zzso zzso zzso data were obtained and analyzed by independent zzso at two academic departments, using zzso and zzso zzso zzso were according to the zzso zzso zzso zzso were on study mortality and overall survival during the longest available zzso regardless of zzso treatment, and in patients receiving zzso Tests for interactions were used to identify differences in effects of zzso on mortality across zzso zzso The present review reports only the results for the primary zzso 

A total of zzso cancer patients from 53 trials were zzso zzso patients died zzso and zzso zzso zzso increased on study mortality zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and worsened overall survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with little zzso between trials zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso trials enrolled zzso patients receiving zzso The zzso for on study mortality was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for overall zzso There was little evidence for a difference between trials of patients receiving different cancer treatments zzso for zzso 

zzso treatment in cancer patients increased on study mortality and worsened overall zzso For patients undergoing chemotherapy the increase was less zzso but an adverse effect could not be zzso
