The preferential zzso of gold zzso within tumors and the increased zzso zzso due to the high atomic number of gold zzso account for the possibility of significant tumor dose enhancement during gold zzso radiation therapy zzso Among the many conceivable ways to implement zzso zzso a zzso approach using low-energy zzso sources zzso zzso zzso 100 zzso appears to be highly feasible and promising, because it may easily fulfill some of the technical and clinical requirements for zzso zzso the current study investigated the zzso feasibility of implementing zzso using the following zzso zzso 50 zzso and zzso Specifically, zzso Carlo zzso calculations were performed to determine the zzso dose enhancement factors zzso defined as the ratio of the average dose in the tumor region with and without the presence of gold zzso during the zzso of the zzso and the zzso electron zzso within a tumor loaded with gold zzso The current study suggests that a significant tumor dose enhancement zzso zzso could be achievable using zzso 50 zzso and zzso sources and gold zzso When calculated at zzso zzso from the center of the source within a tumor loaded with 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso dose enhancement was zzso 92 and zzso for zzso 50 zzso and zzso zzso For a tumor loaded with 7 zzso zzso zzso it was 68, 57 and zzso at 1 zzso from the center of the source for zzso 50 zzso and zzso zzso The estimated zzso values for zzso were remarkably larger than those for zzso on average by up to about 70 and zzso for 18 zzso zzso and 7 zzso zzso cases, zzso The current zzso study also shows a remarkable change in the zzso zzso and spectrum zzso more than two orders of zzso and a significant production zzso comparable to the number of zzso of the zzso electrons within the tumor region due to the presence of gold zzso during low-energy zzso zzso The radiation sources considered in this study are currently available and tumor gold concentration levels considered in this investigation are deemed zzso zzso the current results strongly suggest that zzso can be successfully implemented via zzso with low energy zzso sources, especially with a high dose rate zzso zzso
