This study consists of a novel strategy for the identification of potential cancer exclusively expressed zzso which might lead to the development of valuable diagnostic molecular zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the same patient were collected and subjected to the construction of primary complementary zzso acid zzso zzso The cancer zzso library was generated by zzso normal zzso from the primary cancer zzso The remaining clones in the zzso cancer library were zzso and Basic Local zzso Search zzso zzso against current zzso and zzso databases in the zzso The clones that had no matches with any known gene sequences except the human zzso sequences were identified as ideal candidates for potential molecular marker zzso The candidate marker sequence and associated primer sequences were identified on the target clone sequence of the region with the least, or no, matched zzso The specificity of the markers was measured by a zzso chain reaction test experiment with the DNA templates from different human normal zzso zzso DNA, and additional patients' zzso zzso from zzso and experimental approaches used suggest that the methodology has a high potential to identify cancer exclusive zzso Thus, it might result in the development of diagnostic zzso
