The concept of tumor surveillance implies that specific and zzso components of the immune system eliminate tumors in the early phase of zzso zzso the zzso mechanisms of tumor zzso is of paramount significance because it might allow one to specifically zzso spontaneous zzso zzso We report that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso B cell zzso zzso zzso spontaneous in zzso rejection of tumor cells that express human zzso virus zzso Moreover, zzso mice develop significantly fewer ultraviolet B zzso skin zzso and reject zzso skin zzso zzso T cells were identified as key players in the spontaneous tumor rejection zzso Loss of zzso not only enhances zzso zzso of zzso T cells but also occurs in the absence of zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso T cells are resistant to T regulatory zzso suppression and exhibit enhanced zzso and rapid tumor zzso zzso therapeutic transfer of zzso zzso zzso T cells is sufficient to mediate rejection of established zzso Even up to 1 zzso after the first encounter with the tumor cells, zzso mice carry an zzso zzso These data identify zzso as a key signaling zzso that controls spontaneous zzso activity of zzso T cells in different cancer zzso zzso of zzso is a novel approach to stimulate long-lasting immunity against zzso
