Low zzso pH is a hallmark of solid zzso It has long been thought that this acidity is mainly attributable to the production of zzso zzso In this study, we tested the hypothesis that zzso is not the only source of zzso in solid tumors and explored the potential mechanisms underlying these zzso high rates of acid zzso 

We compared the zzso profiles of zzso zzso zzso and parental cells in both in zzso and two in zzso models zzso zzso chamber and zzso zzso 

We demonstrated that zzso in addition to zzso acid, was a significant source of acidity in zzso We also found evidence supporting the hypothesis that tumor cells rely on zzso for energy production and that the zzso zzso zzso is highly active within tumor zzso Our results also suggest that the zzso acid cycle is zzso and that different zzso pathways are activated to provide for energy production and zzso 

These results are consistent with the paradigm that tumor metabolism is determined mainly by zzso availability and not by the zzso demand of tumor cells per zzso In particular, it appears that the local zzso and oxygen zzso each independently affect tumor zzso These findings have significant implications for cancer zzso
