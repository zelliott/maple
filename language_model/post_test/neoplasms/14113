A method for planning implants of zzso seeds has been zzso The treatment dose prescribed by the physician is delivered to the zzso as zzso as possible, by a minimal number of zzso The number of seeds and their locations are derived by requesting that, at any point in the zzso the dose will be equal to or higher than the prescribed zzso As a result, the total implanted activity is lower for small volumes and higher for large volumes, relative to other zzso protocols which derive their planning from requests on the minimum peripheral zzso zzso obtained from computer simulations performed on different zzso shapes and volumes, show a linear dependence between the total implanted activity and the zzso zzso The total activity does not depend on the shape of the zzso A description of the zzso of our procedure and a detailed example of its application are zzso
