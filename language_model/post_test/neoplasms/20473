Many different signaling pathways are involved in deregulation of cell proliferation leading to zzso Although zzso approaches successfully identified a great variety of molecules associated with zzso other strategies must be applied to zzso complex interactions between these zzso One promising approach is zzso resonance energy transfer, a zzso zzso zzso With the development of zzso different fluorescent proteins and improved technologies for zzso zzso this approach gains an enormous potential for future zzso The zzso resonance energy transfer principle can be applied for studying all kinds of interactions or zzso changes, and it can also be used for microscopic zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso thereby promoting the progress of cancer zzso Moreover, it can be exploited to develop sensitive and efficient drug screening systems and to design valuable diagnostic zzso
