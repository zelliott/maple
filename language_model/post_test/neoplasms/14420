In cancer, the zzso plays an important role of supporting the outgrowth of new tumors in distant zzso zzso the formation of zzso The interplay between cancer cells and the host zzso leads to generation of an active zzso termed a zzso niche that effectively supports cancer progression and outgrowth of zzso The generation and development of the niche is intricately linked to cancer zzso zzso niches are highly dynamic interactions that can be forged by diverse mechanisms and continue to develop as the cancer zzso The composition of the niche is increasingly being characterized and new niche components are being zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factors, zzso and other molecules that carry information to cancer cells are essential parts of the zzso zzso The sources of this molecular milieu are multiple cell types - local or recruited to the site of zzso - and in some cases the cancer cells zzso To understand zzso progression it is essential to dissect the niche composition and identify the sources of niche zzso With future analyses of the zzso zzso significant opportunities can arise to identify novel targets for cancer zzso zzso the zzso niche may be essential to treat and inhibit the progression of zzso
