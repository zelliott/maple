Despite clear evidence of zzso cancer vaccines only provide a modest clinical zzso To evaluate the mechanisms that limit tumor zzso following zzso we have investigated the weak efficacy of a highly zzso experimental vaccine using a zzso melanoma zzso We discovered that the tumor adapts rapidly to the immune attack instigated by zzso zzso T cells in the first few days following zzso resulting in the zzso of a complex set of biological networks, including multiple zzso zzso This rapid adaptation acts to prevent sustained local immune attack, despite continued zzso by increasing numbers of zzso T zzso Combining vaccination with adoptive transfer of zzso T cells produced complete zzso of the treated tumors but did not prevent the zzso zzso In fact, the zzso zzso pathways were more highly induced in zzso tumors, commensurate with the enhanced level of immune zzso zzso of tumor zzso zzso functionality revealed that the zzso zzso leads to a progressive loss in zzso function, even in tumors that are zzso These novel observations that T cells produced by therapeutic intervention can zzso a rapid zzso zzso response within the tumor have important implications for clinical zzso of zzso
