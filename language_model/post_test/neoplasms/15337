A human acute zzso leukemia cell line, zzso releases a factor which activates human zzso zzso T zzso zzso against zzso tumor in zzso The factor, named zzso zzso T cell zzso factor zzso is an zzso protein of 70,000 to 100,000 zzso molecular zzso zzso blood zzso from two patients, bearing zzso zzso or zzso zzso were cultured for 7 days with individual zzso tumor to induce zzso directed to the corresponding zzso zzso peripheral zzso generated lesser zzso activity than the zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso was able to replace the zzso zzso The zzso acted at the zzso generation phase as well as the zzso zzso The zzso killer cells possessed zzso surface zzso The zzso killed zzso tumor or other unrelated tumor cell lines only when they shared some of the zzso class I zzso It was also demonstrated that the zzso does not activate killer cells without proper zzso zzso because the zzso zzso possess specificity against zzso tumor or other zzso or zzso matched tumor cell zzso The therapeutic zzso of human zzso for zzso zzso therapy against zzso tumor is zzso
