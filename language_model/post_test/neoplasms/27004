The increasingly evident limitations of zzso cancer therapy has zzso a flurry of ideas for overcoming the development of resistance and recurrence - the near universal reason for therapy failure from which zzso drugs are not zzso A widely proposed approach to zzso therapy resistance is to depart from the zzso focus on individual zzso pathways and instead target multiple zzso in the cancer cell's gene regulatory zzso However, most ideas rely on a simplistic zzso of zzso utilizing solely their zzso and treating it as a display of zzso zzso while ignoring the integrated dynamics in state zzso Here, we review the more encompassing formal framework of global network dynamics in which cancer cells, like normal cell types, are zzso zzso zzso Then therapy is represented by the network zzso that will promote the exit from such cancer zzso and zzso a normal zzso We show in this qualitative and accessible discussion how the idea of a zzso landscape and the theory of zzso offer a new formal understanding for computing the set of network zzso zzso zzso that need to be targeted in concert in order to exit the cancer zzso But targeting cancer cells based on the network zzso of an zzso cancer cell, however precise, may not suffice to eradicate all tumor cells because of the dynamic zzso zzso of cancer cell populations that makes them moving targets and drives the zzso of the cancer zzso with zzso zzso cells from neighboring abnormal zzso
