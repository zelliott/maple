Research in biomedical text mining is starting to produce technology which can make information in biomedical literature more accessible for zzso One of the current challenges is to integrate and refine this technology to support real-life scientific tasks in zzso and to evaluate its usefulness in the context of such zzso We describe zzso - a fully integrated text mining tool designed to support chemical health risk zzso This task is complex and zzso requiring a thorough review of existing scientific data on a particular zzso Covering human, animal, cellular and other zzso data from various fields of zzso this is highly varied and therefore difficult to harvest from literature databases via manual zzso Our tool zzso the process by zzso relevant scientific data in published literature and zzso it according to multiple qualitative zzso Developed in close collaboration with risk zzso the tool allows navigating the classified zzso in various ways and sharing the data with other zzso We present a direct and zzso evaluation which shows that the technology integrated in the tool is highly accurate, and report a number of case studies which demonstrate how the tool can be used to support scientific discovery in cancer risk assessment and zzso Our work demonstrates the usefulness of a text mining pipeline in zzso complex research tasks in zzso We discuss further development and application of our technology to other types of chemical risk assessment in the zzso
