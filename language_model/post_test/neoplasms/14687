The in zzso population dynamics of 248 literature data bases of normal and zzso growth processes were examined by computer zzso zzso The growth of most tumors was remarkably zzso When abnormalities did occur, they tended to be zzso and zzso zzso growth was highly zzso not zzso zzso growth was rare, and the zzso of both normal zzso and tumors were predominantly zzso With both normal zzso and tumors, the most intense period of growth zzso usually occurred early in zzso In general, growth was rapid only at small zzso There was no evidence that tumors as a group grew faster than normal zzso A small zzso of tumors exhibited a specific zzso zzso Their growth did not stop entirely at large size, but instead continued indefinitely at a very slow zzso zzso The majority of tumors did not exhibit this anomaly, zzso Eight of the data bases permitted a kinetic analysis of the zzso mechanisms underlying growth zzso Six behaved as if their growth were governed by a tissue zzso that is, by a negative feedback zzso that strongly correlated with tumor zzso The seventh behaved as if its growth were regulated by a biological zzso and the final tumor as if by a zzso mechanism such as random arrest or terminal zzso The analysis indicated that many tumors were completely normal in their growth governance policies and control mechanisms, and suggested that in some instances zzso transformation might be a disease of tissue zzso resulting from an altered or inappropriate cellular recognition zzso The ability of 18 different equations to model in zzso growth data was zzso zzso modeling required an equation to be zzso selected from a menu of alternatives by statistical zzso All but one of the equations provided a zzso to at least one data base, and all of the equations were inferior models of some data zzso The zzso and inverse zzso root equations provided the greatest number of zzso The zzso equation was a good growth model for normal zzso but mediocre for zzso
