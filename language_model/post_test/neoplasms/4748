The systematic translation of cancer zzso data into knowledge of zzso biology and therapeutic possibilities remains zzso Such efforts should be greatly aided by robust zzso model systems that reflect the zzso diversity of human zzso and for which detailed genetic and pharmacological zzso is zzso Here we describe the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia zzso a compilation of gene zzso zzso copy number and zzso parallel sequencing data from zzso human cancer cell zzso When coupled with pharmacological profiles for 24 zzso drugs across zzso of the cell lines, this collection allowed identification of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of drug zzso In addition to known zzso we found that plasma cell lineage correlated with sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was associated with zzso inhibitor efficacy in zzso zzso and zzso expression predicted sensitivity to zzso zzso Together, our results indicate that large, zzso zzso collections may help to enable zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso The generation of genetic predictions of drug response in the zzso setting and their incorporation into cancer clinical trial design could speed the emergence of zzso therapeutic zzso
