zzso is one mechanism for zzso of zzso and results in an excess of DNA template, which can lead to overproduction of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso has been observed in different tumor zzso In certain cases amplification and zzso of particular zzso have been correlated with tumor progression and clinical zzso The best example is zzso in which the zzso zzso frequently is found to be zzso Over 1,000 patients with breast cancer have been studied for amplification of the zzso zzso until zzso The evidence from the studies that amplification of zzso is correlated with poor prognosis is in our opinion not zzso More and more investigations about zzso and disease prognosis will take place rather at the protein level than at the DNA zzso
