Linear organization of the zzso requires mechanisms to protect and replicate zzso zzso To this end zzso cells evolved zzso specialized zzso complexes, and zzso the zzso that maintains the zzso zzso zzso allow cells to distinguish zzso ends from sites of DNA zzso In zzso cells this is accomplished by a protein complex, termed zzso that binds to zzso DNA and is able to shield zzso ends from the DNA damage zzso In recent years, we have seen major advances in our understanding of how this protein complex works due to the generation of mouse models carrying zzso of individual zzso zzso This review will focus on our current understanding of how the zzso complex is able to suppress the DNA damage response zzso and on the cellular and zzso outcomes of zzso zzso
