To evaluate the percentage and risk factors of zzso dysfunction in 79 children who underwent bone zzso transplantation in a single zzso 

The mean age of the cohort was zzso and mean follow-up zzso zzso The 79 patients were divided in two groups according to the zzso conditioning zzso zzso total body zzso zzso chemotherapy with zzso zzso zzso function was evaluated by zzso hormone zzso and free zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was defined by low zzso blood levels and zzso zzso 4 zzso and compensated zzso by normal zzso index and zzso zzso zzso 

The six-year probability of zzso was 36 zzso for the whole group of 79 patients, 49 zzso after zzso and 9 zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso Neither zzso nor primary disease, nor presence of graft versus host disease were found to be statistically significant for occurrence of zzso in the zzso zzso However, a younger age seemed to influence statistically the zzso probability of zzso in the zzso group: 59 zzso if age zzso years versus 34 zzso if age zzso years zzso zzso 

A careful follow-up of zzso function is recommended even without zzso conditioning zzso Young age as a potential risk factor of zzso has never been described and needs to be studied in a larger zzso
