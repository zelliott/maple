In the zzso setting, zzso and subsequent zzso degradation of the zzso protein zzso zzso resistance to zzso in solid tumors with zzso zzso zzso zzso administration of the zzso inhibitor zzso enables zzso zzso zzso restoring cancer cell zzso in zzso and producing tumor zzso in mice in zzso A phase I study was conducted to determine the maximum tolerated dose zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Sixteen patients with zzso solid tumors commonly exhibiting zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso were treated weekly with zzso and zzso Starting doses were 40 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso for zzso A modified continual reassessment method adapted for zzso escalation was used for zzso determination with zzso zzso treated at each dose zzso zzso was reached at 60 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the recommended phase II zzso zzso was overall well zzso Most frequently observed zzso included anemia (in zzso of patients, one grade 3 zzso fatigue (in zzso of patients, one grade 3 event beyond cycle 1), and zzso (in zzso of patients, one grade 3 event after cycle zzso Of 15 zzso patients, one zzso lung zzso zzso patient with zzso exposure at the zzso setting had a partial response and five patients had stable disease zzso median disease stabilization was zzso zzso three zzso patients had zzso lasting 165 days or zzso Thus, rationally designed weekly treatment with zzso and zzso in solid tumors with zzso zzso zzso including previously zzso zzso is a tolerable regimen with preliminary signals of zzso activity worthy of further zzso
