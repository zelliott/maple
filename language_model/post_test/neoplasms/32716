The zzso zzso constitutes the major system for nuclear and zzso zzso protein degradation in zzso zzso A plethora of cell proteins implicated in the maintenance and regulation of essential cellular processes zzso processing and functional modification by zzso degradation via the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso have been shown to contribute to the zzso of several human diseases, such as cancer, zzso zzso genetic and zzso disorders, most of them exhibiting abnormal zzso and altered composition of components of the zzso that is suitable for diagnostic zzso While the zzso zzso is currently exploited to develop novel therapeutic strategies, it is less regarded as a diagnostic zzso Future research should lead to an improved understanding of the zzso of the zzso zzso with the aim of allowing the development of subtle diagnostic zzso
