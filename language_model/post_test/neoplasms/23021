This manuscript discusses the biological bases of radiation therapy dose zzso with emphasis on the theoretical implications of the zzso cell survival equation zzso zzso zzso D + beta zzso zzso In the development of the analysis, both the therapeutic ratio, defined as the log tumor cell survival divided by the log normal cell survival, and the therapeutic gain, the ratio of the therapeutic ratios for two different doses per treatment, are shown to be zzso From the analysis it follows that the use of small doses per treatment delivered at short intervals zzso will generally lead to improved local tumor control rates provided the total dose is increased sufficiently to maintain a constant level of normal tissue zzso Improvement may not be seen if the tumor response is dominated by zzso cells with a higher capacity to repair zzso radiation injury than the host normal zzso
