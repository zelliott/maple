The gene expression data are usually provided with a large number of genes and a relatively small number of samples, which brings a lot of new zzso zzso those zzso genes becomes the main issue in zzso data zzso zzso cluster elimination based on support zzso machine zzso has shown the better zzso accuracy on some zzso data sets than zzso feature elimination based on support zzso machine zzso However, zzso is extremely zzso In this paper, we propose an improved method of zzso called zzso zzso first trains a zzso model with all zzso then applies the infinite norm of weight zzso zzso in each cluster to score the zzso finally eliminates the gene clusters with the lowest zzso In addition, zzso eliminates genes within the clusters instead of removing a cluster of genes when the number of clusters is zzso We have tested zzso on six gene expression data sets and compared their performances with zzso and zzso zzso zzso The experiment results on these data sets show that zzso greatly reduces the time cost of zzso meanwhile zzso comparable zzso performance as zzso while zzso is not zzso
