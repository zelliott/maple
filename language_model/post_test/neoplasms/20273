The basis of our physical world is zzso The unified zzso field can appear to us as zzso zzso matter, at certain zzso of zzso A close zzso therefore exists between matter and electric zzso This knowledge is extensively zzso in zzso Various tools and instruments are zzso zzso utilizing the zzso important principle of closed electric zzso zzso closed electric circuits and functions also exist in biology but are more sophisticated and zzso Unfortunately, these aspects are almost zzso The principle of zzso Closed Electric zzso zzso and some of their structural and functional effects are zzso The zzso Closed Circuit zzso is one specific zzso zzso It functions as a circulatory system in addition to the mechanical zzso Its efficiency partly depends on its capacity to provide zzso transport of zzso The zzso is an in zzso zzso system that is powered by zzso energy or injury zzso A zzso zzso leads to zzso of zzso new structuring and healing of an injured zzso Examples are also presented of the process of zzso An zzso zzso prolonged zzso of zzso may also induce zzso zzso formation of cells and tissue can also be healed by the use of artificially applied zzso or an artificially applied electric field as will be zzso Our world once developed from electrical zzso This is probably the reason why the zzso systems make primary differences between zzso and biological zzso
