Experimental studies demonstrated that maternal exposure to certain environmental and dietary factors during early embryonic development can influence the zzso of offspring as well as the risk of disease development at the later zzso DNA zzso an zzso phenomenon, has been suggested as a mechanism by which maternal nutrients affect the zzso of their offspring in both zzso and zzso mouse zzso zzso changes through DNA zzso can be linked to folate metabolism by the knowledge that zzso a zzso of zzso zzso is directly involved in zzso group transfer for DNA zzso During the fetal period, zzso DNA zzso patterns are established through zzso zzso However, established DNA zzso patterns are not zzso and can be modified during our lifetime by the zzso zzso changes in DNA zzso with diet may lead to the development of zzso diseases including zzso It is also known that the aging process by itself is accompanied by zzso in DNA zzso zzso activity of DNA zzso zzso can be a potential mechanism for the decreased zzso DNA zzso during aging, along with reduced folate intake and altered folate zzso Progressive zzso in promoter regions of certain genes is observed throughout aging, and repression of tumor zzso induced by this zzso mechanism appears to be associated with cancer zzso In this review, we address the effect of folate on early development and aging through an zzso zzso DNA zzso
