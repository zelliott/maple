The understanding of zzso and tumor progression on a molecular basis needs a detailed study of proteins as zzso molecules and as critical components of the multiple interconnected signaling pathways that drive the zzso zzso Thus, the zzso approach represents a powerful tool for the challenge of the zzso zzso The term zzso zzso refers to the collection of proteins expressed by a given cancer cell and should be considered as a highly dynamic entity within the cell, which affects a variety of cellular zzso The emerging zzso analysis platforms including zzso mass zzso technologies, and protein zzso represent powerful tools to study and understand zzso These systems aim to not only zzso zzso and characterize cancer zzso but also to unveil how they interact to affect overall tumor zzso Moreover, recent studies on various zzso have reported promising results concerning the detection of novel molecular zzso useful in the early diagnosis of cancer and in drug zzso Thus, a new zzso named clinical zzso zzso with new molecular technologies that are developed, demonstrates promise to discover new cancer zzso The early diagnosis of cancer, even in a zzso state, is crucial for the successful treatment of this zzso For these reasons, it is clear that the identification of zzso for the early diagnosis of cancer should represent one of the main goals of this emerging field of zzso
