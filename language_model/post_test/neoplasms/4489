Fluorescence in zzso zzso has emerged as an extremely important tool for detection and characterization of zzso zzso aberrations in zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso have been very reliable in zzso tumor zzso but have been more unpredictable in zzso zzso zzso We describe novel approaches for detection of zzso aberrations in frozen tumor zzso touch zzso and zzso zzso These approaches are both simple and zzso with minimal zzso variation in zzso efficiency or zzso signal zzso We demonstrate potential applications of these novel approaches by zzso 1) significance of normal zzso in zzso peripheral nerve sheath zzso 2) zzso copy number in prostate zzso and 3) zzso zzso zzso deletion in zzso preparations of zzso fluid from patients with zzso
