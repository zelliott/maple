The purpose of this research was to estimate employment effects for spouses of cancer survivors who were working at the time of the cancer zzso 

zzso of cancer survivors were drawn from the Penn State Cancer zzso zzso zzso spouses of individuals without cancer were drawn from the Panel zzso of Income zzso The final sample included zzso spouses of cancer survivors zzso husbands, 285 zzso and zzso spouses of individuals without cancer zzso husbands, zzso zzso Three employment outcomes were studied 2-6 years after diagnosis: whether working, whether working full time zzso hours per week), and usual hours per zzso We used propensity scores to match cases to controls zzso 

zzso of cancer survivors had a lower probability zzso percentage points) of being employed 2-6 years after diagnosis zzso zzso zzso They were slightly more likely to be working full time, while averaging zzso fewer hours per week overall, but these effects were not statistically zzso zzso effect on husbands was not significant for any of the employment zzso However, if zzso wives and husbands were working at zzso they had more than twice the odds of working full-time zzso OR zzso zzso p zzso zzso husbands OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and worked more hours per week than other spouses zzso zzso p zzso zzso husbands zzso p zzso zzso 

The implications to cancer survivors and their spouses of these results is that the employment of zzso spouses, especially of wives, is somewhat reshaped by cancer in the medium to long zzso However, there is little or no effect on zzso hours worked by spouses who were employed at zzso
