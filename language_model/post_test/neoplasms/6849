zzso drug design requires the zzso of cancer patients as accurate as zzso With advances in zzso sequencing and zzso technology, a large amount of gene expression data has been and will continuously be produced from various zzso zzso Such zzso gene expression data allows us to zzso tumors at the zzso zzso However, zzso gene expression zzso typically have much more number of genes zzso than that of samples zzso which zzso a challenge for zzso of zzso In this paper, a new method is proposed for cancer diagnosis using gene expression data by casting the zzso problem as finding sparse representations of test samples with respect to training zzso The sparse representation is zzso by the zzso least square zzso To investigate its performance, the proposed method is applied to six tumor gene expression zzso and compared with various support zzso machine zzso zzso The experimental results have shown that the performance of the proposed method is comparable with or better than those of zzso In addition, the proposed method is more efficient than zzso as it has no need of model zzso
