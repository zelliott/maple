zzso constitute a family of toxic zzso zzso zzso that exert a highly specific activity on a zzso region of the larger zzso of zzso known as the zzso zzso This zzso of a single zzso bond zzso the zzso and leads to protein synthesis zzso and cell zzso In addition to this zzso activity, zzso can cross zzso zzso in the absence of any known protein zzso This ability is due to their capacity to interact with acid zzso zzso Both activities together explain their zzso character, being rather specific when zzso against some transformed cell zzso The determination of high-resolution structures of some zzso the characterization of a large number of zzso and the use of zzso model zzso and transformed cell lines have been the tools used for the study of their mechanism of action at the molecular zzso The present knowledge suggests that zzso zzso or some modified zzso might be used in human zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso designed against specific tumors stand out as feasible alternatives to treat some human pathology in the zzso zzso
