Advanced cancer patients generally display impaired zzso immune zzso The underlying mechanisms are not well zzso The aim of this study was to analyze whether major zzso of zzso variable gene segment usage could be detected in the blood of these zzso zzso individuals with various zzso were tested using zzso and a panel of zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that these cancer patient zzso expressed most V alpha and V beta zzso zzso similarly to the zzso of healthy donors zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso in advanced cancer patients is not related to major deletions in their zzso zzso We also compared the mean relative expression of each zzso specificity of patients and healthy donors by quantitative zzso zzso We found significant differences in 4 V beta zzso (and no V zzso Our analysis identified unique zzso zzso zzso involved in the mechanisms leading to zzso in advanced cancer zzso zzso the observed differences in terms of V beta specificity expression may reflect the host response against the zzso
