The products of zzso play critical roles in the development or maintenance of zzso societies in animals via strict regulatory zzso When these regulatory systems are zzso zzso can become zzso and thereby induce cell transformation and zzso To understand the molecular basis for development of the regulatory system of zzso during evolution, we screened for ancestral zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by monitoring their transforming ability in zzso zzso consequently, we isolated a zzso gene zzso which encodes a zzso zzso as a zzso zzso We also cloned zzso zzso from zzso and the zzso sponge zzso zzso and compared their regulatory features with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso active and zzso cell transformation in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso from zzso animals are strictly zzso zzso of zzso zzso revealed that structural zzso in the zzso domain zzso are responsible for the enhanced zzso activity and the zzso activity of zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso family zzso regulatory system of zzso zzso is zzso throughout the evolution from zzso to zzso animals, but the zzso is more sensitive to the zzso family zzso zzso than zzso zzso These results show that maturation of AID function was required for the development of the strict regulatory system of the zzso zzso and support the potential link between the development of the regulatory system of zzso and the evolution of zzso Further analysis of zzso functions of zzso zzso in the zzso genes would provide some insights into the mechanisms of the destruction of zzso society in zzso
