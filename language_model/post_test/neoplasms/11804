The effects of active zzso zzso were studied in 42 patients receiving daily zzso zzso zzso at 2 zzso in zzso courses and in 14 patients receiving zzso methanol extraction zzso of zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso The host defense evaluations included measurement of the number of adherent zzso precursors per zzso of blood zzso zzso serum zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of peripheral blood zzso cells to chicken red blood cells zzso or human red blood cells zzso During a single course of zzso zzso zzso adherence did not rise significantly, whereas zzso of peripheral blood zzso cells to zzso and zzso rose significantly zzso and zzso zzso of target cells, zzso However, after a mean of zzso months on therapy, zzso adherence increased an average of zzso During weekly zzso therapy, zzso zzso serum zzso and zzso of peripheral blood zzso cells to zzso rose significantly within zzso days after the first dose zzso adherent zzso blood zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso target cell zzso zzso The host defense zzso which was zzso in the cancer patients zzso zzso was zzso into the normal range in all the deficient patients by zzso zzso The host defense zzso which were normal or slightly elevated in the patients before therapy zzso zzso and zzso of peripheral blood zzso cells to zzso and zzso were zzso above the upper limit of the normal range in zzso zzso and 50% of the patients, respectively, by zzso zzso These methods can zzso reflect zzso of zzso and killer cells by zzso zzso and zzso and may be useful for evaluation and zzso of both active zzso and zzso zzso in zzso
