We performed a literature review zzso - 2007) and compiled data derived from 377 zzso cases out of zzso reported zzso 

Patient age ranged from 14 to 86 zzso Of the patients zzso were 55 years old and the zzso ratio was zzso The most commonly treated tumors were gastrointestinal zzso head and neck zzso and breast zzso Of the patients zzso had a history of heart disease whereas cardiac risk factors were found in zzso zzso of administration zzso continuous infusion zzso zzso zzso intermediate infusion zzso oral zzso and zzso (1 zzso The zzso of zzso used were zzso 750 zzso zzso zzso - 999 zzso 1,000 zzso 1,001 - zzso zzso and 1,500 zzso Of the patients zzso received zzso in combination with other zzso agents zzso zzso whereas 51% received zzso alone or with zzso Only zzso patients had undergone previous or zzso radiation therapy to the zzso Of cardiac incidents that happened zzso were seen during or within 72 h of the first cycle of zzso zzso occurred in zzso of patients whereas zzso zzso was seen in zzso zzso in 23, acute pulmonary zzso in 5, cardiac arrest and zzso in zzso and heart failure in zzso zzso evidence of zzso or zzso changes were recorded in zzso of patients, but abnormal cardiac zzso were found in only zzso The cardiac symptoms were zzso in zzso including in one patient subsequently treated with zzso zzso zzso were also zzso when the same patients were treated with lower doses or different zzso Of the patients zzso responded to conservative zzso therapy, although zzso coronary zzso had limited zzso Overall, zzso of patients showing zzso on zzso administration zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso to zzso zzso 

Our review suggests that zzso zzso is an zzso but real phenomenon that is independent of dose and may be related to a continuous infusion zzso The presence of cardiac risk factors is not zzso Patients should be observed closely and zzso administration discontinued if cardiac symptoms zzso A zzso with zzso should be reserved only for those patients in whom there is no reasonable alternative therapy and should be performed in the setting of aggressive prophylaxis and close zzso
