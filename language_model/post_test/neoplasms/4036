zzso zzso genes are important zzso of individual zzso to the effects of environmental zzso These genes follow the form of zzso 2' zzso interaction, zzso the zzso genetic risk factor functions only in the presence of an environmental zzso Two different effects of zzso dose have been observed for these zzso Sometimes, increasing dose leads to a decreasing interaction, so that cases with the genetic risk factor have lower zzso than those cases without zzso Other examples of a direct dose effect, zzso increasing exposure leads to increased interaction, have also been zzso We propose a model based on multiple zzso zzso to assess the nature of the dose effect in this type of zzso zzso This model allows for distinction between these two dose effects, and other effects such as protective or zzso effects of environmental and genetic risk zzso
