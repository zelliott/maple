To assess the physical and mental health status of older long-term cancer zzso 

zzso study using propensity score methods to control for baseline differences between cancer survivors and zzso 

General community population in the United zzso 

Nine hundred zzso cancer patients who had survived for more than 4 years and zzso control patients who had never had cancer from a zzso sample of Americans aged 55 and older responding to the 2002 Health and Retirement zzso 

Medical conditions, symptoms, health behaviors, health status, mobility, activities of daily living, mental health diagnoses, zzso memory, depressive symptoms, cognitive function, and zzso life zzso 

Cancer survivors reported higher rates of lung disease zzso vs zzso zzso heart condition zzso vs zzso zzso arthritis zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso frequent pain zzso vs zzso zzso and obesity zzso vs zzso zzso than individuals without cancer but lower rates of smoking zzso vs zzso zzso Cancer survivors were less likely than persons without cancer to report excellent or very good health status zzso vs zzso zzso and had more mobility zzso and activity of daily living zzso zzso Cancer survivors did not differ from persons without cancer in rates of depression or cognitive function (both zzso but were less optimistic about their life expectancy zzso 

The physical health status of older long-term cancer survivors is somewhat worse than that of comparable persons who have never had cancer, but they have surprisingly similar mental health zzso Future research is needed to understand factors contributing to poorer health status and identify patients at highest risk of long-term zzso zzso
