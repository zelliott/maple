zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso isolated from the marine zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of zzso have demonstrated activity against a variety of zzso and human tumors in cell cultures and mice zzso The purpose of this Phase I clinical trial was to characterize the maximum tolerated dose, zzso and biological effects of zzso in patients with advanced solid zzso zzso doses of zzso were administered as an zzso zzso every 21 days, using a modified zzso dose escalation zzso zzso studies were performed with the first treatment zzso Neurological testing was performed on each patient prior to treatment with zzso at 6 weeks and at study zzso Thirty eligible patients received a total of 94 cycles zzso 2 zzso zzso 14 zzso of zzso at doses ranging from 65 to 455 zzso zzso toxicity of zzso was seen at 455 zzso for minimally zzso patients zzso or fewer prior chemotherapy zzso and 325 zzso for heavily zzso patients (more than two prior chemotherapy zzso zzso toxicity was generally zzso Local irritation at the drug injection site was mild and not dose zzso Nine patients developed new or increased symptoms of mild peripheral sensory zzso that was not dose zzso This toxicity was more frequent in patients with zzso peripheral zzso zzso studies demonstrated a rapid drug distribution with a prolonged plasma elimination phase zzso zzso zzso 320 zzso The area under the zzso curve increased in proportion to administered dose, whereas the clearance remained constant over the doses zzso zzso analysis demonstrated a strong relationship between zzso area under the zzso curve values and decrease from baseline for zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso administered every 3 weeks as a peripheral zzso zzso is well tolerated with zzso toxicity of zzso The maximum tolerated dose (and recommended Phase II starting zzso is 400 zzso for patients with minimal prior treatment zzso or fewer prior chemotherapy zzso and 325 zzso for patients who are heavily zzso (more than two prior chemotherapy zzso
