A method is presented for zzso relative survival of cancer patients at the national level from survival data provided by cancer zzso covering only a subset of the general population and referring to different, and not necessarily zzso zzso zzso 

Relative survival rates are estimated as a function of the zzso sex, age, zzso of diagnosis, and registry area by means of a multiple zzso zzso National estimates are then zzso by appropriate weighting of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso expected relative survival zzso 

The method is illustrated by a sample application to survival data of female breast cancer patients in zzso The national estimates of breast cancer survival pattern show a mild decrease of survival with age and a marked increase with period of zzso
