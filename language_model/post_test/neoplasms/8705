How the cell maintains and uses its zzso information may be a critical factor in zzso For example, zzso development is thought to depend upon the interplay between random zzso instability and zzso selective zzso Information theory provides a means to analyze these zzso One may zzso not only the amount and zzso of information contained within a segment of genetic code, but also the zzso zzso and the degree of selection affecting a population of zzso In addition, it is theoretically possible to monitor genetic information as it is processed by cells during zzso transcription, and zzso These parameters could permit a detailed analysis of the evolutionary changes hypothesized to zzso zzso zzso
