zzso zzso has been identified by two independent experimental approaches as an zzso of zzso zzso cells, and it has been claimed to be the most abundantly expressed tumor zzso zzso making it a prime candidate for vascular targeting zzso Recent experiments have challenged the zzso expression of zzso and suggested an expression by activated zzso and zzso Thus, clarification of the controversial cellular expression of zzso is critically important for an understanding of its role during tumor progression and its validation as a potential therapeutic zzso We have therefore performed extensive expression profiling analyses of zzso The experiments zzso demonstrate that zzso is expressed by zzso zzso and mural cells and not by zzso zzso zzso expression is barely zzso in normal human zzso with moderate expression only zzso in the zzso of the colon and the zzso zzso cellular experiments confirmed zzso expression by zzso cells and indicated that it may in fact be a marker of zzso stem zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso strongly inhibited migration and zzso zzso the experiments validate zzso as a marker of zzso zzso and tumor zzso mural zzso The data warrant further functional analysis of zzso during tumor progression and its exploitation as marker of tumor zzso mural cells, expression of which may reflect the zzso zzso of the tumor zzso
