zzso belong to a recently emergent class of bacterial natural product zzso that zzso inhibit the zzso of zzso by a novel zzso The total zzso of the zzso molecules zzso A, zzso B, and zzso A have been zzso which allowed the preparation of zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso A hybrid zzso zzso To determine the potency of zzso we employed both in zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso that measure the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We further studied the zzso effects of zzso on tumor cell growth using a panel of multiple zzso zzso and zzso cancer cell lines and showed that zzso strongly blocks the activity of zzso To gain more insights into the zzso relationship, we zzso zzso in complex with the zzso and determined the X-ray zzso The electron density map displays zzso binding of the zzso atoms of all active sites to the zzso ring of the zzso via zzso bond formation, thus providing insights into the zzso relationship for the improved affinity of zzso for the zzso activity compared to those of the natural compounds zzso and zzso Our study revealed that the novel synthetic zzso compound represents one of the most potent zzso zzso analyzed to date and therefore exhibits promising properties for improved drug development as an zzso zzso
