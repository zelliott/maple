Five decades of extensive research have passed since the description for the first time of the existence of an zzso which had the ability to degrade collagen during the metamorphosis of zzso In fact, during these years, a large family of zzso possessing the unique ability of degrading the extra cellular zzso zzso has been zzso These zzso are widely known as zzso zzso zzso and it is noteworthy that many members of this family are directly linked to several human diseases such as arthritis and zzso Moreover, due to the critical role of certain members of zzso in cancer invasion and zzso great efforts have been made in order to find new zzso compounds against these zzso In this work we attempt to zzso the current status of the intervention strategies against zzso using zzso compounds that could block the zzso of zzso directly or zzso zzso we will try to shed light towards new potential strategies of zzso zzso using zzso zzso
