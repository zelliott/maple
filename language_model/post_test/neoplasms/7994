According to some studies, zzso of cells to zzso drug-induced zzso is markedly inhibited by targeted deletion of genes zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso or certain zzso Information about levels of these zzso in common cancer cell types and any possible correlation with drug sensitivity in the absence of gene deletion is currently zzso 

zzso was used to estimate levels of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and -9 in the zzso panel used for drug screening by the National Cancer zzso zzso of the same lines to zzso compounds was determined with zzso zzso B binding zzso Additional zzso zzso were performed for selected zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso varied zzso zzso and zzso which are implicated in zzso zzso after treatment of cells with various zzso drugs, were zzso in all of the cell lines, with levels of zzso ranging from approximately 1 zzso zzso to 2 zzso zzso molecules per cell and zzso from approximately 5 zzso zzso to approximately zzso zzso zzso molecules per zzso zzso levels ranged from zzso zzso zzso to 8 zzso zzso molecules per zzso zzso a major zzso zzso varied from zzso to approximately zzso zzso zzso molecules per zzso zzso between levels of these zzso and sensitivity to any of a variety of experimental or conventional zzso agents in either zzso or zzso zzso zzso were weak at zzso 

With the exception of zzso all of the components of the core zzso machinery are expressed in all of the cell lines zzso Despite variations in zzso levels of any one component are not a major zzso of drug sensitivity in these cells in zzso
