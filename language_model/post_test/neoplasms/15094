zzso metabolism and zzso have become important topics for cancer research and are promising targets for zzso zzso Although zzso serves as the main source of energy, zzso an alternative zzso is important, especially during zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyzing the first step in zzso zzso is induced by zzso and can regulate cell survival as well as mediate programmed cell zzso In a mouse zzso tumor model, we found that zzso greatly reduced tumor formation by causing zzso cell cycle zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso showed decreased zzso expression in tumor zzso zzso zzso signaling was impaired with zzso expression due to the increased production of zzso a critical zzso for zzso zzso and degradation of zzso Combined with previous in zzso findings and reported clinical genetic associations, these new findings lead us to propose zzso as a zzso tumor zzso and a potential target for cancer zzso
