The ability to zzso complex structures is widespread in zzso zzso but among zzso the zzso zzso are zzso Adult zzso can zzso their limbs by local formation of a zzso growth zone or zzso The generation of zzso cells depends not only on the local zzso environment after zzso or wounding but also on the ability to zzso the cell cycle from the differentiated zzso The zzso replaces structures appropriate to its zzso zzso zzso identity is probably zzso as a graded property that controls cellular growth and movement through local cell zzso The molecular basis is not zzso but zzso identity in zzso zzso cells may be zzso by signaling through a zzso acid zzso zzso The possibility of inducing a zzso on a zzso limb cannot be zzso although the molecular constraints are becoming clearer as we understand more about the mechanisms of zzso zzso
