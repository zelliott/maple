In recent years, several zzso have been developed to allow for the zzso detection of zzso tissue using zzso zzso zzso designs include zzso gamma and beta zzso as well as combination devices with background rejection zzso Some laboratory prototypes and zzso systems have demonstrated reasonable sensitivities for zzso zzso photons and zzso b particles zzso from zzso for in zzso zzso This review focuses on the ability of these devices to detect zzso deposits in the zzso environment of the operating room zzso Important technical and biological factors that influence zzso contrast are discussed and potential future applications and developments are zzso In addition, we evaluate the limited data on absorbed doses resulting from zzso zzso administration immediately prior to surgery that indicate acceptable levels of radiation exposure to operating room zzso
