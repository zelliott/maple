The effects of zzso zzso and zzso on zzso muscle were examined in zzso sections of an autopsy zzso zzso sections were examined from four separate muscles of 30 previously healthy subjects who died suddenly, from eight cases with zzso and from 16 cases with zzso and zzso In addition, zzso stained zzso sections were examined from two muscles from most of the zzso All the sections were evaluated with regard to zzso zzso changes and zzso type zzso Furthermore, the exact size of 100 zzso of each type was determined in the zzso stained zzso zzso changes were found in a few muscles, mainly in the normal zzso They were considered incidental findings without clinical zzso zzso type grouping could not be evaluated in the anterior zzso muscle because large clusters of the same zzso type occur normally in this zzso In the biceps zzso only two normal cases and none of the zzso cases showed zzso type zzso A moderate small grouped muscle zzso zzso was found in normal cases with increasing zzso The cases with zzso showed a marked small grouped zzso which involved both zzso zzso There were only small and uncertain differences between cases with zzso and zzso and those with zzso zzso Thus, no changes were observed which could be ascribed to zzso zzso The small grouped zzso in zzso and zzso resembled that seen in zzso zzso but the exact mechanism of the changes remains zzso
