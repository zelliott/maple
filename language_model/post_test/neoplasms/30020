There is considerable research around the morbidity and mortality related to zzso diseases zzso particularly cardiovascular disease and diabetes, among people living with zzso zzso in zzso zzso Less is known about the burden and appropriate management of zzso particularly zzso zzso including cancer, zzso zzso zzso and mental health conditions, among older zzso in zzso settings zzso We undertook a literature review of these other zzso to explore what is currently known about them and identify areas of further zzso 

zzso literature review of published manuscripts and selected conference abstracts and zzso 

Although there is growing recognition of the importance of these zzso among the aging population of zzso in zzso significant gaps remain in understanding the epidemiology and risk factors among older zzso in these zzso Even more concerning is the limited available evidence for effective and feasible approaches to zzso screening and treatment of these zzso The burden of these zzso is related to both the aging of the population of zzso and an increased risk due to zzso infection, other zzso associated with zzso infection or transmission risk and underlying risk factors in the general zzso zzso from zzso settings and zzso highlight zzso zzso and mental health as well as zzso disease as the most significant challenges currently and likely to increase in the zzso 

Although some lessons can be taken from the growing experience with zzso in older zzso in zzso settings, additional research is needed to better understand their risk and impact and identify optimal models of care to effectively address this challenge in the areas where the majority of older zzso will be receiving zzso
