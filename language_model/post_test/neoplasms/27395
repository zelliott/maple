The recent development of advanced zzso and zzso zzso based on zzso and zzso is one of the strategic objectives of the so-called zzso In this field, the development of zzso devices could bring new opportunities in several application fields, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso drug zzso The so called zzso zzso involving zzso of zzso procedures, is expected to enable highly complex laboratory testing to move from the central laboratory into zzso zzso The main advantages of zzso devices are integration of multiple steps of different zzso procedures, large variety of applications, zzso consumption of zzso and samples, and zzso One of the requirement for new generation zzso devices is the possibility to be independent from additional zzso zzso zzso zzso devices should be able to perform with high efficiency and zzso both zzso and sensing zzso In this review, we discuss applications of zzso zzso devices to cancer zzso The theory of zzso as well as the description of several devices, based on zzso parallel and arrayed zzso are here zzso In addition, in this review we describe manipulation of cancer cells using advanced zzso zzso devices in the absence of fluid flow and with the integration of both zzso and sensing zzso
