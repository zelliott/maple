As part of the zzso project, the present study analyzed and compared zzso data on the survival of adult cancer patients in Italy, according to sex, age, period of diagnosis and geographical zzso 

Nine Italian zzso cancer zzso provided data on all their cancer patients zzso zzso zzso followed for at least 5 years and diagnosed during the period zzso About zzso of the Italian population is covered by these zzso The data was analyzed by means of a zzso zzso 

The major findings were that there was a general improvement in zzso relative survival over the study period (from zzso to zzso and that there were significant differences in survival between different areas of the country, particularly for cancer sites which respond well to zzso In general, the area covered by the zzso zzso registry was characterized by significantly worse survival than other registry zzso Other important findings were that for all zzso cancer sites zzso relative survival decreased with age from 50% for the youngest age class zzso zzso to zzso for the oldest age class zzso zzso and that women have a better prognosis for most cancer sites zzso zzso relative survival in women zzso vs zzso in zzso 

The significant regional differences in survival may reflect unequal provision of care, particularly between zzso Italy and the zzso The reasons for the general survival improvement with time are not completely zzso whereas the marked overall sex difference is related to the fact that the zzso cancer in women zzso zzso is eminently more zzso than the zzso zzso in men zzso zzso The zzso trend with increasing age may be due to increasing difficulty in applying complete therapy protocols as general health declines, sometimes in relation to an advanced cancer stage at zzso
