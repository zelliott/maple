zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso gene are known to be at high risk of breast and zzso zzso but the risks of other zzso in zzso carriers are zzso We investigated these risks in 173 zzso cancer families with zzso zzso identified at 20 centers in Europe and North zzso 

Other cancer occurrence was determined in a final cohort of zzso individuals, among whom zzso persons had breast or zzso cancer and zzso persons either were known zzso carriers, were first-degree relatives of known zzso carriers, or were first-degree relatives of breast or zzso cancer zzso zzso rates were compared with zzso zzso rates, and relative risks zzso to carriers, together with zzso confidence intervals zzso were estimated by use of a maximum likelihood zzso Three hundred zzso other zzso occurred in this zzso 

zzso significant increases in risks were observed for prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gallbladder and zzso duct cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stomach cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso for prostate cancer for men below the age of 65 years was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Among women who had already developed breast cancer, the cumulative risks of a second, zzso breast cancer and of zzso cancer by the age of 70 years were estimated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In addition to the large risks of breast and zzso zzso zzso zzso may be associated with increased risks of several other zzso
