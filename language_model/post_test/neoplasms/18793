zzso zzso zzso zzso of approximately 22 zzso zzso zzso expression of its target zzso zzso regulates a variety of biological processes such as cell zzso cell death, development, zzso and zzso stability, not only in zzso conditions but also in various pathological conditions such as zzso More than 1000 mature zzso have been zzso identified in humans and mice, yet the functions of a vast majority of zzso remain to be zzso Identification of novel zzso zzso seems promising considering their possible application in the development of novel cancer therapies and zzso Currently, there are two major approaches to identify zzso that are associated with zzso expression profiling study and functional screening zzso The former approach is widely used, and a large number of studies have shown zzso zzso expression profiles in cancer zzso compared with their zzso zzso Although zzso expressed zzso are potentially good zzso in most cases a majority of them do not play zzso roles in zzso when functional zzso are zzso In contrast, the latter approach allows screening of zzso zzso with zzso zzso such as cell proliferation and cell zzso Thus, this approach might be suitable in finding crucial targets of novel cancer zzso The combination of both types of approaches will contribute to further zzso of the cancer zzso and to the development of a novel class of cancer therapies and zzso
