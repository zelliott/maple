The development of cancer zzso has been ongoing for many years and has shown limited zzso Novel zzso are needed to identify patients most likely to respond to zzso zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso approach is required for comprehensive understanding of the interconnected zzso zzso and cell types associated with an immune zzso In this chapter, we describe single cell network profiling zzso a novel method for assessing and measuring immune zzso at a systems zzso zzso is a zzso zzso analysis that can simultaneously measure, at the single cell level, both zzso surface markers and changes in zzso signaling proteins in response to zzso zzso zzso changes in signaling proteins following the application of an external zzso informs on the functional capacity of the signaling network which cannot be assessed by the measurement of zzso signaling zzso In addition, the simultaneous analysis of multiple pathways in multiple cell zzso can provide insight into the connectivity of both cell signaling networks and immune cell zzso The experimental steps associated with an zzso zzso are zzso zzso sample zzso zzso zzso for functional zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso data acquisition on flow zzso and zzso data analysis and zzso Important considerations for each step of the zzso will be discussed, and data demonstrating the utility of zzso for immune monitoring applications will be zzso
