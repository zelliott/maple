The nuclear transport protein zzso 1 zzso also called zzso region maintenance 1 zzso is zzso zzso 4 fold in zzso zzso is one of seven nuclear exporter zzso and is solely responsible for the transport of the major tumor zzso proteins zzso from the nucleus to the zzso zzso exports any protein that carries a zzso zzso nuclear export sequence zzso A number of zzso have been discovered that block zzso function and thereby restore zzso to the nucleus of both zzso and normal zzso However, natural product, irreversible zzso zzso such as zzso B zzso have proven toxic in both zzso models and in the zzso Recently, orally zzso zzso small zzso potent and selective zzso of zzso zzso nuclear export zzso have been designed and are undergoing clinical evaluations in both humans and zzso with zzso The breadth of clinical zzso and long-term viability of an zzso zzso strategy requires a deeper evaluation of the consequence of global zzso of proteins in cancer and normal zzso Unfortunately, most of the studies on zzso zzso have focused on evaluating a limited number of zzso or other zzso Because zzso carries zzso zzso proteins out of the nucleus, such zzso has not permitted a global understanding of cellular behavior upon drug-induced disruption of zzso zzso The consequence of zzso zzso requires holistic investigations that consider the entire set of zzso targets and their respective pathways modulated without losing key zzso Systems biology is one such holistic approach that can be applied to understand zzso regulated proteins along with the downstream players zzso This review provides comprehensive evaluations of the different zzso tools that can be zzso in the better understanding of zzso and its zzso We anticipate that such holistic approaches can allow for the development of a clinically successful zzso targeted therapeutic strategy against zzso
