This paper describes a system for characterizing zzso electric field patterns of zzso zzso in zzso media, in particular, of those used in zzso treatments for cancer zzso We discuss the design, fabrication and testing of small, zzso electric field zzso which are capable of measuring both zzso and zzso An appropriate test zzso for mapping field patterns radiating from zzso zzso zzso also is zzso The system was developed specifically for the evaluation of zzso centered at 434 zzso and zzso zzso
