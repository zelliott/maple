zzso growth and progression rely upon zzso which is regulated by zzso and zzso factors, including members of the zzso zzso By analyzing 3 different mouse models of zzso zzso we show here that during zzso zzso 3A zzso is expressed in zzso where it serves as an zzso inhibitor of zzso that is present in zzso zzso and lost during tumor zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso during the zzso switch, the point when zzso zzso initiate an zzso phase that persists throughout tumor growth, enhanced zzso and accelerated tumor zzso By contrast, when, during the later stages of zzso following zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso reintroduced into zzso cell tumors by zzso gene transfer, successive waves of zzso zzso first in zzso and then in tumor cells, resulting in reduced vascular density and branching and zzso of tumor growth and substantially extended zzso Further, long-term zzso of zzso markedly improved zzso coverage of tumor blood vessels, something that is thought to be a key property of tumor vessel zzso and restored tissue zzso We zzso therefore, that zzso is an zzso and effective zzso agent that zzso zzso the tumor zzso
