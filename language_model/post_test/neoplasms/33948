zzso of zzso properties in the intact animal remains a major bottleneck in drug zzso zzso dosing involves administration of a cocktail of drugs to individual zzso Here we describe the cassette dosing properties of a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso A three-step parallel synthesis approach produced compounds with purity ranging from zzso to zzso zzso dosing was validated by comparing the zzso parameters obtained following zzso administration of a mixture of zzso zzso zzso and zzso each at zzso zzso with results for administration of single agents at 50 zzso No significant difference was observed between the zzso parameters of agents when zzso in combination compared with those of individual zzso zzso showed the highest area under the curve zzso and the longest elimination zzso zzso Further zzso evaluated the library of zzso zzso with zzso and zzso A included as zzso standards in a validated limited sampling zzso The ratios of zzso parameters to that of zzso zzso maximum concentration zzso and zzso remained similar when compounds were tested in two different zzso or as individual zzso Following dosing of the same cassette on three different days, there was less than zzso variation in zzso parameters between zzso The zzso relationship showed that the favored zzso zzso are zzso and zzso at position 6, zzso zzso at position 2, and zzso or zzso at position zzso Without cassette zzso this study would have used 3 times as many animals and would have taken 4 times longer, illustrating the power of this method in lead zzso
