zzso DNA techniques were zzso successfully to join the coding regions for the variable region of a mouse zzso zzso zzso and the human zzso constant region for both the light and heavy zzso After zzso into a mouse myeloma host cell line, the zzso genes were expressed successfully and the resulting zzso zzso was zzso In this study, we describe zzso zzso zzso and functional properties of the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso revealed that while it was similar in size to the mouse zzso it had a different zzso as determined by zzso The flow zzso binding profiles of the new zzso were found to be essentially identical to the parental mouse zzso The specificity of the zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso were compared by extensive zzso analysis on human normal and tumor zzso The zzso zzso retained the same broad zzso binding activity, showing strong zzso with greater than zzso of zzso tumor zzso as was previously observed for the mouse zzso zzso The zzso and mouse zzso also recognized the same selected normal zzso primarily zzso zzso gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of the biological function of the zzso zzso revealed that it possessed zzso activity against zzso tumor targets in zzso which was absent from the mouse form of the zzso zzso zzso cells could be either zzso from normal healthy donors, zzso from cancer patients receiving zzso therapy, or zzso cells prepared from cancer zzso zzso zzso even in the presence of zzso cell killing was noted with zzso cells from the latter two zzso This contrasts sharply with the absence of activity in the same systems when the native zzso zzso was zzso The in zzso zzso of zzso zzso observed with the zzso zzso when zzso cells from both normal and zzso donors were used strongly suggests that comparable activity would be observed in zzso These results, along with the broad zzso binding activity and minimal normal tissue zzso suggest that the zzso zzso zzso may be useful in cancer zzso The application of the zzso zzso zzso for treatment of tumors thus offers a promising avenue for future zzso
