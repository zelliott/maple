zzso acid technology has assumed an essential role in various areas of in zzso zzso Its major applications include the zzso characterization of zzso and zzso amplification of zzso acids by the zzso chain reaction, analysis of gene expression patterns at the zzso level, specific detection of zzso zzso and engineering of proteins used in zzso binding zzso zzso the expression of genes in cells and experimental animals allows detailed analysis of processes leading from zzso zzso to disease manifestations and may ultimately yield refinements in diagnostic zzso The addition of DNA and zzso to the conventional diagnostic in zzso targets and novel approaches to the study of disease processes and manifestations characterize a diagnostic strategy referred to as zzso zzso This contribution describes some of essential ways in which molecular zzso differs from conventional diagnostic zzso zzso such as differential diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis, early diagnosis, and diagnosis of disease zzso are well established in zzso disorders, and the diagnostic impact of DNA zzso is steadily increasing in zzso zzso The high sensitivity of the zzso chain reaction makes possible the detection of single infectious agents or tumor zzso With increasing knowledge of expressed gene sequences the expression pattern of zzso will reflect the biological state of cells with high zzso zzso proteins can be analyzed based on their structural or biological zzso Use of the appropriate expression systems makes it possible to design proteins for diagnostic in zzso applications such as zzso binding zzso
