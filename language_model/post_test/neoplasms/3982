zzso is an essential trace element, the zzso of which is associated with an increased zzso of some human zzso zzso supplementation with zzso has been reported to produce a decrease in the zzso of some zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso is a newly discovered zzso zzso zzso protein that zzso the zzso reduction of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a number of human tumors, and experimental studies have shown that zzso contributes to the growth and to the transformed zzso of some human cancer zzso Thus, zzso by reducing zzso could play a role in regulating the growth of normal and cancer zzso We have investigated mechanisms by which zzso in the form of sodium zzso added to zzso growth medium regulates zzso activity in cancer cell zzso zzso caused a zzso increase in cellular zzso zzso The increase in zzso activity produced by 1 zzso zzso compared to medium with no added zzso was: for zzso breast cancer cells, zzso for zzso colon cancer cells, zzso and for zzso lung cancer cells, zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso leukemia cells showed no increase in zzso zzso The zzso of the time course of induction of zzso in zzso cells after adding zzso was 10 zzso The increase in zzso activity was accompanied by an increase in zzso protein levels up to zzso and an increase in the specific activity of the zzso of zzso depending on the cell zzso Studies using zzso showed that the amount of zzso incorporated into zzso increased with increasing zzso concentration up to a ratio of 1 zzso per zzso zzso There was an increase in zzso zzso levels of zzso at 1 zzso zzso and an increase in the stability of zzso zzso with a zzso for degradation of 21 h compared to 10 h in the absence of zzso zzso zzso and protein levels and zzso zzso stability were not affected by zzso The results of the study show that the increase in zzso activity caused by zzso is specific and due to several effects, including an increase in the stability of zzso zzso leading to increased zzso zzso levels, an increase in zzso zzso but predominantly to an increase in the specific activity of zzso associated with increased incorporation of zzso into the zzso
