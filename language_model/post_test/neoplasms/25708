DNA zzso is a unique and rare finding associated with aggressive behavior in solid zzso zzso the zzso changes underlying this feature may provide important information on the development and progression of these zzso 

Fluorescence in zzso zzso analysis using zzso zzso for nine zzso and the two sex zzso was performed on zzso cells from 27 solid tumors which had been shown to be DNA zzso by flow zzso The zzso abnormalities were correlated with the DNA index and tumor zzso 

The data show mutually exclusive loss of certain zzso and zzso gain of other zzso in different zzso The net loss was slightly more than the net gain for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso 7 and zzso of zzso 17, X and loss Y were found in most zzso zzso differential loss of zzso zzso and 12 among DNA zzso breast, kidney and lung zzso was zzso 

Our study shows zzso gain of zzso 7 and loss zzso 17 in most DNA zzso tumors, zzso specific zzso loss was noted in breast and zzso cell zzso and zzso that different mechanisms for DNA zzso and zzso development may zzso
