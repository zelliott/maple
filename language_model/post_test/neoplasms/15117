Multiple discrete regions at zzso were recently shown to contain zzso that zzso to many zzso including zzso breast, and zzso These regions are far from any zzso gene and their biological activities have been zzso Here we zzso a zzso zzso segment encompassing all the risk regions for zzso zzso zzso zzso and locations occupied by zzso zzso II and zzso zzso zzso This led to the identification of several zzso zzso which were verified using reporter zzso Two enhancers in one risk region were occupied by zzso and responded to zzso zzso one contained a single zzso zzso zzso that resides within a zzso binding site, with the prostate cancer risk zzso zzso both stronger zzso binding and stronger zzso zzso The study reported here exemplifies an approach that may be applied to any zzso zzso in zzso coding regions as it emerges from zzso association studies to better understand the genetic predisposition of complex zzso
