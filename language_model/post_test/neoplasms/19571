A novel method for detecting zzso patient rotation by comparing a single portal image to its reference image is zzso zzso rotation results in an apparent distortion of the anatomy in a portal zzso This distortion can be zzso predicted with the zzso varying at each point in the zzso While zzso of points at equal depth is zzso under zzso rotation or translation, and changes equally in both dimensions for an zzso shift of the patient, a change of zzso in only one dimension can be ascribed to an zzso zzso For the two conditions that are used in this study, it is shown that zzso rotation yields a different zzso of the image in two perpendicular directions and therefore it is feasible to calculate the scale factors as a function of zzso zzso zzso the recovery of scale factors in two different directions at the same time would enable the magnitude of the zzso rotation to be zzso The properties of the zzso transform of the image are used to align the portal image with the reference image (a simulator image or first approved portal zzso prior to the recovery of the scale zzso zzso the zzso transform of the portal image on a zzso with that of the reference image enables the scale factors to be automatically extracted from a single portal zzso In the two approaches investigated, zzso zzso of up to 41 degrees and 20 degrees zzso have been recovered with a maximum error of zzso zzso This technique could be used to automatically detect patient roll or tilt prior to or during a treatment zzso
