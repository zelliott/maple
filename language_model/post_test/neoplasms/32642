zzso examination, despite of its high zzso has been found to have a low sensitivity in the diagnosis of zzso zzso due to the high percentage of false negative zzso So it is indispensable to seek appropriate zzso markers in zzso The aim of this study was to determine vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities in zzso so as to provide scientific basis for clinical diagnosis and treatment of zzso zzso 

A total of 67 samples were collected, including zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso levels were determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activities were determined by gelatin zzso 

zzso and zzso levels in zzso zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which were significantly higher than those in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The activities of zzso and zzso could not be detected in zzso zzso and tuberculosis zzso but could be detected in 20 and 18 out of 23 zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso levels increase significantly and zzso zzso activities are obvious in zzso zzso The detection of zzso zzso levels and zzso zzso activities are useful in differential diagnosis of benign and zzso zzso
