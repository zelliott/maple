In the past, cancer patients entering phase 1 studies confronted the prospects of high risk and unlikely zzso Over the last decade, cancer drugs under development have become more targeted, and the clinical research environment has become more zzso The impact of these changes on the risks and benefits to patients who participate in phase 1 cancer trials is zzso 

To determine trends in the rates of zzso zzso death, objective response, and serious toxicity and to identify factors associated with these zzso 

We searched abstracts and journal articles reporting the results of phase 1 cancer treatment trials originally submitted to annual meetings of the American Society of Clinical Oncology zzso from 1991 through zzso 

We focused on published zzso trials that enrolled patients with advanced solid tumors and excluded studies testing agents already approved by the US Food and Drug Administration at the time of the zzso zzso 

Multiple observers independently extracted information on trial design, location, zzso types of tumors treated, drug class, route of administration, and clinical zzso 

The overall toxic death rate for zzso studies zzso zzso cancer zzso published in zzso journals was zzso while the overall objective response rate was zzso zzso death rates decreased over the study period, from zzso over the first 4 years of the study zzso to zzso over the most recent zzso period zzso zzso Response rates also decreased but by zzso much zzso After adjusting for characteristics of the experimental trials and the zzso agents, the odds of a patient dying from an experimental treatment while participating in a trial submitted during the most recent zzso period were less than one tenth those of a patient participating in a trial submitted during the first zzso period zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso P zzso zzso In comparison, the adjusted odds of a patient experiencing an objective response over the same time periods decreased by approximately half zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 

The level of risk experienced by cancer patients who participate in phase 1 treatment trials appears to have improved over the 12-year period from 1991 through zzso Because toxic death rates have decreased more quickly than have objective response rates, the ratio of risk to benefit may have also zzso These changes relate in part to the targeted and zzso nature of newer cancer drugs and are zzso with the increased attention that has been paid to the safety of clinical research over the time period we zzso
