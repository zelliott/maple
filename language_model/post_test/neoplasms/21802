zzso are the prominent contrasted structures of the cell zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso processed and assembled with zzso zzso The size and organization of the zzso are directly related to zzso zzso The organization of the zzso reveals the functional zzso of the zzso zzso that depends on zzso zzso When this activity is zzso disrupted or impossible, the zzso proteins have the capacity to interact independently of the processing zzso In addition, zzso are dynamic structures in which zzso proteins rapidly associate and zzso with zzso components in continuous exchanges with the zzso At the time of zzso zzso the processing zzso are recruited in a regulated manner in time and space, controlled by different zzso and form intermediate structures, the zzso zzso The participation of stable zzso in zzso assembly was demonstrated after zzso and during development but this is an intriguing observation since the role of these zzso is presently zzso A brief report on the zzso and diseases is proposed as well as of zzso functions different from zzso zzso
