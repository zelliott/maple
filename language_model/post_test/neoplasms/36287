zzso healing and cancer zzso share a common starting point, zzso a change in the zzso of some cells from stationary to zzso The term, zzso transition zzso describes the changes in molecular biology and cellular physiology that allow a cell to transition from a sedentary cell to a zzso cell, a process that is relevant not only for cancer and zzso but also for normal development of zzso zzso The present review compares the similarities and differences in cellular response at the molecular level as tumor cells enter zzso or as zzso begin the process of zzso of a zzso Looking toward clinical interventions that might zzso these zzso the mechanisms and outcomes of current and potential therapies are reviewed for both zzso and zzso healing treatments related to the pathways that are central to zzso Taken together, the comparison of zzso and tumor zzso serves as a starting point for the development of therapies that can selectively zzso different forms of zzso
