Cancer zzso is a complex phenomenon consisting of several sequential steps: invasion of primary sites, entry into blood or zzso vessels, zzso zzso zzso and growth at the target zzso These steps are achieved by peculiar interactions between tumor cells and host zzso We developed several zzso from rat zzso zzso zzso that displayed different zzso zzso and lung zzso potential and demonstrated that the expression of 62 and zzso zzso substances with zzso zzso on tumor cell surfaces is one of the zzso associated with the zzso potential of these zzso So, we expanded our investigation to detect the zzso zzso zzso in primary zzso of the breast, zzso stomach, and large zzso by zzso zzso or zzso The results showed that certain types of zzso zzso expressions in cancer cells are profoundly related to not only the mode of zzso spread and the organ distribution pattern of zzso but also the prognosis of cancer zzso zzso zzso was related to the expression of zzso core type carbohydrates zzso zzso and zzso zzso in common, whereas there were no conspicuous similarities in the zzso zzso carbohydrates among the zzso The expressions of blood group zzso such as zzso Lewis and MN including their precursors appeared to be strong zzso indicators of these zzso although the relation of these zzso to each cancer zzso These results suggest that zzso molecules and/or carbohydrates are one of the zzso of cancer zzso and prognosis at least in zzso
