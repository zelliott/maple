zzso single gene expression is not only an optimal way to study gene function but also an ambitious goal, which will lead to the treatment of a variety of human diseases whose main zzso event is a genetic zzso The recent efforts focusing on the zzso project have led to array based, high zzso gene expression analysis techniques that allow the study of complex molecular zzso Combining these powerful new technologies with zzso of gene expressions is making it possible to unravel complex molecular networks or, vice versa, to find new gene products responsible for pathological conditions on which zzso zzso can be zzso zzso and specific zzso of gene expression can be obtained either by producing transgenic or gene knockout organisms or cells zzso zzso or by treating organisms or cells with short synthetic zzso acid segments in zzso orientation with respect to the targeted zzso zzso targeting by zzso zzso While zzso manipulation is a time consuming and expensive approach, requiring invasive intervention, the zzso zzso is characterized by high flexibility resulting from zzso zzso zzso zzso and low zzso The rationale of the zzso strategy is that, once one gene sequence is known, its expression can be silenced by application of synthetic zzso zzso acid segments zzso whose sequence is in zzso orientation compared to the targeted zzso Recently, this zzso strategy has been zzso by the discovery of the zzso zzso a natural mechanism by which cells are thought to fight zzso zzso viruses and zzso zzso Despite promising futures, zzso zzso are far from being an established zzso This review analyses the recent improvements in zzso gene expression zzso focuses on the treatment of diseases in the light of the past, and provides our personal findings on this zzso
