The zzso to zzso transition or zzso has become one of the most exciting fields in cancer zzso Nevertheless, its relevance in tumor biology and the zzso process still faces some zzso zzso may arise when considering the zzso as a zzso and often incomplete process, essentially a manifestation of strong zzso zzso zzso cellular states are generated to fulfill specific requirements in each and all the steps of the zzso process, from primary tumor cell detachment to dissemination and zzso zzso multiple cellular programs that promote or prevent zzso thereby zzso or reinforcing zzso integrity, play a central role in the inherent cellular dynamics of cancer zzso These cell biology programs not only drive cells towards the zzso or the zzso state but also impinge into multiple cellular and global responses including zzso zzso zzso and zzso resistance, inflammation and zzso all relevant for the development of the zzso zzso
