zzso caloric restriction zzso is the only intervention zzso and zzso shown to slow aging and maintain health and vitality in zzso Although this paradigm has been known for over 60 years, its precise biological mechanisms and zzso to humans remain zzso We began addressing the latter question in 1987 with the first controlled study of zzso in primates zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso much closer to humans than the zzso most frequently employed in zzso zzso To date, our results strongly suggest that the same beneficial zzso and/or zzso effects observed in zzso zzso also occur in zzso These include lower plasma insulin levels and greater zzso lower body zzso reduced cholesterol, zzso blood pressure, and zzso zzso elevated zzso and slower age-related decline in circulating levels of zzso zzso these zzso suggest that zzso primates will be less likely to incur diabetes, cardiovascular problems, and other age-related diseases and may in fact be aging more slowly than fully fed zzso Despite these very encouraging results, it is unlikely that most humans would be willing to maintain a zzso reduced diet for the bulk of their adult life span, even if it meant more healthy zzso For this reason, we have begun to explore zzso zzso agents that might elicit the same beneficial effects as zzso without the necessity of zzso Our initial studies have focused on zzso zzso a sugar analogue with a limited metabolism that actually reduces zzso flux without decreasing food intake in zzso In a six-month pilot study, zzso lowered plasma insulin and body temperature in a manner zzso to that of zzso Thus, zzso effects that mediate the zzso mechanism can be attained zzso zzso were zzso to eliminate zzso a long-term longevity study is now under zzso In addition, data from other laboratories suggest that at least some of the same zzso end points that are associated with the beneficial effects of zzso may be obtained from other potential zzso zzso agents, some naturally occurring in food zzso Much work remains to be done, but taken together, our successful results with zzso in primates and zzso administration to rats suggest that it may indeed be possible to obtain the zzso and zzso effects of the former intervention without actually decreasing food zzso
