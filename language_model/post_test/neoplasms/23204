In Britain, 14 zzso agents and occupational circumstances currently account for zzso of estimated occupation attributable zzso The future burden associated with these zzso has been forecast, using attributable zzso for forecast scenarios representing patterns of past and predicted future exposure, and exposure levels representing the introduction of new occupational exposure limits, increased levels of compliance with these limits and other reductions in worker zzso Without intervention, occupational attributable zzso are forecast to remain at more than 10,000 by zzso With modest intervention over zzso or with stricter interventions more than zzso zzso could be avoided by zzso although because of long zzso no impact will be seen until at least 10 years after zzso zzso interventions assessed in this study include reducing workplace exposure limits and improving compliance with these zzso zzso associated with zzso diesel engine zzso zzso aromatic zzso work as a painter, zzso and solar radiation are forecast to continue, with construction remaining the prime industry of zzso Although exposure levels to the established zzso are falling, workers are remaining exposed at low levels at which there is still a cancer risk, although the aging population also contributes to rising cancer numbers, These forecasts can be used to assess the relative costs to society of different occupational zzso agents, and the relative merits and savings associated with alternative intervention zzso The methods are adaptable for different data circumstances, other types of interventions and could be extended to environmental zzso and other chronic zzso
