To determine the zzso of sixth nerve zzso in a zzso study, with particular emphasis on associated zzso medical conditions and to use these data to develop a management zzso 

zzso zzso case zzso 

All residents of Olmsted County, Minnesota, USA, diagnosed with sixth nerve zzso between January 1, 1978 and December 31, zzso 

All cases were identified by using the Rochester zzso Project medical records linkage system, which captures all zzso encounters in Olmsted zzso The entire medical record of each patient was reviewed to confirm the diagnosis, document county residency, and to determine associated medical zzso We used stringent predetermined criteria to define diabetes zzso and hypertension as zzso zzso rates were adjusted to the age and gender distribution of the 1990 white population in the United zzso 

zzso or systemic associations of the zzso 

We identified 137 new cases of sixth nerve zzso over the 15-year zzso The zzso and zzso annual zzso of sixth nerve zzso was zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso and associations were: zzso zzso hypertension alone zzso zzso hypertension and diabetes zzso trauma zzso multiple sclerosis zzso zzso zzso diabetes alone zzso cerebrovascular accident zzso zzso zzso aneurysm zzso and other zzso When sixth nerve zzso was the presenting sign in cases of zzso zzso zzso 1) and aneurysm zzso zzso zzso history and examination revealed the presence of other zzso symptoms or zzso 

We provide zzso data on the zzso of sixth nerve zzso with a notably lower zzso of zzso and higher zzso of diabetes and hypertension than previous zzso zzso We suggest that patients with zzso zzso isolated sixth nerve zzso may undergo a focused medical evaluation followed by close zzso whereas zzso isolated cases warrant a full zzso zzso including prompt zzso
