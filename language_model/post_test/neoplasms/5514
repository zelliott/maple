zzso serves as a key relay for signals zzso by cellular stresses arising from diverse environmental or therapeutic zzso This relay then activates a cell cycle arrest or cell death program, depending on the stimulus and cell zzso The absence of zzso function zzso the cell death or arrest zzso thereby allowing the emergence of zzso with various types of zzso zzso The data discussed focus on two different types of signals that trigger the zzso relay zzso zzso zzso arrests cell cycle progression in response to the types of DNA damage most commonly detected in cells undergoing zzso zzso zzso zzso is activated by specific depletion of zzso pools, which prevent cells from entering S phase under conditions that could lead to zzso zzso The contribution of both responses limits the emergence of genetic zzso The DNA damage induced arrest appears to be triggered by as few as one double strand break in normal human zzso Analysis of the arrest zzso after zzso radiation shows that zzso activates a prolonged arrest response in cells with zzso DNA damage and that high efficiency cell elimination is achieved by a process that can be activated over multiple cell zzso These data indicate that the primary function of the zzso zzso zzso in response to double strand break is to eliminate damaged cells from the zzso population, not to allow additional time for zzso zzso However, it remains possible that repair of other types of damage may benefit from zzso zzso zzso zzso in model genetic systems indicate that the absence of zzso function zzso but does not zzso a high intrinsic rate of genetic variation and that instability is increased substantially when cells proceed through S phase under inappropriate growth zzso This implies that zzso of zzso function in combination with other genetic zzso such as zzso zzso could accelerate zzso instability and zzso zzso
