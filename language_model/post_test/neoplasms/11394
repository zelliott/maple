There are sparse data on the frequency of zzso zzso in patients with various types of zzso We sought to determine the zzso and relative risk of zzso zzso pulmonary zzso and deep zzso zzso in patients with zzso 

The number of patients discharged with a diagnostic code for 19 types of zzso pulmonary embolism or deep zzso zzso from 1979 through 1999 was obtained from the National Hospital Discharge zzso Patients studied were men and women of all ages and zzso 

In patients with any of the 19 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso had zzso zzso which was twice the zzso in patients without these zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The highest zzso of zzso zzso was in patients with zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the lowest zzso were in patients with zzso of the zzso and zzso of the lip, oral cavity or zzso The overall zzso of pulmonary embolism and deep zzso zzso were also twice the rates in zzso zzso zzso with cancer were not age zzso The zzso of zzso zzso in patients with cancer began to increase in the late zzso 

Patients with cancer had twice the zzso of zzso zzso pulmonary embolism and deep zzso zzso as patients without zzso The zzso of zzso zzso pulmonary embolism and deep zzso zzso associated with cancer differed according to the type of cancer, was comparable in elderly and younger patients, and increased in the late 1980s and zzso
