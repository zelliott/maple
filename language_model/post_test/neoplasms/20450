We have characterized a zzso pair, zzso that is structurally and functionally related to zzso We reported previously that zzso zzso T cell proliferation and immune responses zzso et zzso Nature zzso Guo et zzso J zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso We report that zzso causes rejection or growth zzso of zzso A, zzso and zzso tumors in zzso zzso zzso zzso A tumors were rejected effectively with a single dose of zzso however, the treatment was less effective on larger zzso Mice that rejected zzso A tumors previously by Day 30, also rejected a subsequent zzso A challenge on Day 60, without additional zzso treatment, indicating a zzso memory zzso zzso cells believed to be less zzso such as zzso and zzso cells, were less responsive to this zzso The zzso responsiveness to the zzso treatment was zzso however, by zzso of the mice with zzso As expected, T cells appeared to be targeted by zzso zzso Thus, the administration of soluble zzso may have therapeutic value in generating or enhancing zzso activity in a clinical zzso
