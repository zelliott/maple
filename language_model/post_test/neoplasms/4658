zzso zzso are a recently discovered family of short zzso zzso molecules of about zzso zzso in length that are involved in regulation of gene zzso These small molecules have been found to regulate genes involved in diverse biological processes such as cell zzso development, zzso zzso and zzso zzso regulate gene expression at the zzso level either by zzso of the target zzso or by its zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso deregulation is a basic problem in studying zzso of many zzso zzso It has been recently shown that zzso are able to regulate thousands of target genes zzso Thus, the key role of zzso in zzso reveals a new layer in the molecular architecture of zzso zzso of altered zzso expression in cancer may serve as molecular zzso for tumor diagnosis, prognosis of zzso zzso and prediction of therapeutic zzso Furthermore, zzso may serve as specific targets of new gene zzso
