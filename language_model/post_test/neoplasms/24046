To examine the mortality pattern of zzso in the Royal Navy to assess the long term effects on health of serving in zzso Any specific cause of death which was increased was considered in advance to be of interest, but attention focused particularly on cancer zzso 

A mortality follow up zzso 15 138 zzso who had conducted their first submarine training between 1960 and 1979 were followed up through their time in the Navy and into civilian life, up to the end of zzso The main outcome measures were the numbers of deaths and zzso mortality ratios zzso which indicate whether the mortality from all causes and specific causes, particularly zzso exceeds that in men in England and zzso 

zzso in zzso was lower than that for men in England and Wales with an all cause zzso of zzso this was comparable with that found in other studies of armed forces zzso Cancer mortality was particularly low with an zzso of 69 and there was no particular cancer site which showed an zzso Increased mortality from zzso diseases was found, the excess being attributable to zzso of the liver, which had an zzso of 221 based on 12 deaths, alcohol being a zzso factor in zzso Deaths from accidents and violence were also higher than expected with an zzso of zzso but this was due to high levels of accidents occurring after discharge from the zzso There was no apparent trend in mortality with time since starting submarine zzso zzso there was no pattern by calendar period, although the excess of zzso of the liver was confined to the period zzso 

The zzso seemed to be a healthy group with low mortality zzso Working in submarines was not associated with any increased cancer zzso Excess deaths from zzso of the liver, and from accidents and violence after leaving the Navy, were of some concern but they cannot be attributed directly to the submarine zzso
