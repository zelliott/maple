The National Cancer Institute's zzso zzso and End zzso zzso database was used to compare survival rates by race among children with common zzso solid tumors between 1985 and zzso 

Diagnosis and outcome data were obtained from zzso zzso survival probabilities were calculated using the zzso zzso Survival hazard ratios were calculated using the Cox zzso hazards zzso Survival probabilities were compared among zzso zzso American zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso survival probabilities were higher for White children than for children belonging to other racial groups zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso for American zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso Male zzso children had worse zzso survival than male White children while there were no differences in survival among females across racial zzso There was no difference when survival probabilities for Hispanic and zzso children were zzso Overall, Black children had a higher risk of death compared to White children zzso P zzso zzso Black children had a higher risk of death from germ cell tumors, zzso and zzso soft tissue zzso zzso zzso children also had a higher risk of death overall zzso P zzso zzso and a higher risk of death from germ cell tumors, zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumor compared to White zzso 

Male children from minority groups have poorer survival from zzso solid zzso than White male zzso Future efforts should be directed at understanding the causes of these differences and at developing practical clinical interventions to eliminate zzso
