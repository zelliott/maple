Small zzso circular DNA zzso belongs to the zzso pool of DNA and is composed of zzso DNA zzso Whether zzso has a special function is currently unclear but their occurrence was suggested to be linked to genetic zzso In this study we investigated as to whether human zzso from healthy volunteers also zzso zzso and whether zzso is present in all permanent cell lines from human normal and zzso zzso Moreover, we were interested to see whether zzso contains sequences of mobile genetic zzso Our results show that zzso is present in all samples investigated yet the amount is lower in normal zzso when compared to cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were present in zzso cancer cell lines whereas zzso zzso sequences were present in 15 of zzso Six tumor cell lines also contained zzso zzso In contrast to that, zzso of normal zzso contains zzso and zzso sequences only in zzso cases and no zzso sequences at zzso Our findings suggest a direct dependency of the amount of zzso and zzso sequences on that of zzso zzso these repetitive zzso sequencing of zzso revealed in most cases zzso sequences of almost all zzso without an increased frequency of single zzso We suggest that the whole zzso including zzso elements and zzso sequences may play a role for zzso zzso and zzso zzso
