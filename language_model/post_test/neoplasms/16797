Despite the advanced treatment methods now available, the total result in zzso survival is zzso of all patients with zzso and zzso of these patients will have the chance of a 10-year zzso In the course of their disease a zzso is indicated in about 2/3 of all cancer zzso Thus, zzso makes quite a considerable contribution to the qualitative improvement of the treatment of patients with zzso zzso of the tumor and protection of normal tissue can be only a compromise between tumor control and the production of zzso For the risk assessment of zzso the zzso of zzso zzso is of paramount zzso That means, small errors in defining and delivering dose can have catastrophic results in terms of failure to control the patient's disease and, on the other side, in terms of zzso that means in quality of zzso Although the costs of therapy, in absolute values, vary from one country to the other, it can be stated in rough approximation that a failed zzso will make rise the costs by a factor of zzso zzso on the fact that in zzso of patients, who received zzso the initial treatment failed to control the primary disease, the enormous additional costs involved become obvious, not to speak of the main zzso regrowth of the patient's zzso For the improvement of this situation quality assurance zzso is an essential zzso which should be guaranteed in all successive steps of zzso In the paper an analysis is given for all individual steps in the chain of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
