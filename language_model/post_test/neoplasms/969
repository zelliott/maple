zzso T cells respond to zzso stimulation through a process of zzso division, and differentiation generating a large pool of activated zzso zzso T zzso zzso Many cancer patients harbor the zzso precursor zzso capable of responding to various zzso zzso zzso In selected cases, vaccination with these zzso can elicit zzso zzso zzso zzso the clinical outcome of cancer vaccination remains zzso The lack of clinical efficacy may be attributed to various molecular and cellular mechanisms developed by tumors to successfully evade the host immune zzso Some of these mechanisms have been zzso It is becoming increasingly apparent that zzso with the sole objective of inducing immune zzso is in itself not sufficient to fully overcome the mechanisms averting efficient zzso zzso Strategies to neutralize zzso immune suppression have to be developed in parallel to zzso zzso Our data show that both zzso zzso and zzso preferential cell death of zzso memory zzso may be a major contributor to zzso immune zzso The persistence of functional zzso is a key element for an efficient zzso response and affects the outcome of any zzso zzso We therefore propose that protecting zzso from premature death by identifying and targeting the responsible zzso can lead to substantial enhancement in zzso zzso In this review, we discuss some of the fundamental factors that may be involved in the zzso of the different zzso zzso towards zzso or resistance to zzso zzso
