zzso affecting the zzso growth factor zzso growth factor alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso are frequently detected in zzso In particular, the zzso zzso zzso has been found zzso in a number of human tumors, and zzso alpha is produced by a large array of tumor zzso Gene transfer experiments have previously demonstrated that expression of either zzso alpha or zzso alone is not sufficient to induce the transformed zzso in zzso zzso In this study we sought to investigate the biological effect of expression of zzso alpha and high levels of zzso in this model zzso We demonstrate that the gene for zzso alpha acts as a potent zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso We further show that zzso alpha directly stimulates proliferation of the cell in which it is produced and provide evidence that the zzso compartment of the transformed cell is the major site of interaction between zzso alpha and zzso Analysis of human tumor cell lines revealed a strong correlation between expression of zzso alpha and zzso of zzso Moreover, high levels of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were detected both in zzso expressing zzso alpha and in high zzso and zzso alpha zzso human tumor cell zzso Thus, the two events instituting the zzso alpha zzso loop responsible for transformation in zzso may play a role in the development of some human zzso
