In almost all studies using zzso embedded zzso zzso protein has been found in the zzso of zzso Since the protein is normally localized in the nucleus it is difficult to determine which zzso observations are real and which are zzso The study designed here evaluated several different methods of fixation prior to zzso embedding in an attempt to identify which would prevent the diffuse of the protein out of the zzso Using various fixation procedures zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we found that fixation in cold zzso zzso degrees zzso overnight followed by zzso zzso fixation in zzso at zzso degrees c and at room temperature, cleared in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso gives zzso nuclear zzso when a variety of normal and tumor zzso are treated with an anti zzso protein zzso This method was then compared to frozen zzso While there was no zzso zzso in same tissue specimens in both zzso processed and frozen zzso the tissue architecture was much better preserved in zzso processed zzso Our data strongly suggest that zzso zzso originally developed for T and B zzso zzso should be used for zzso of zzso zzso in zzso embedded zzso
