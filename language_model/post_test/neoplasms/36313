This work reports on a passive double spiral zzso device allowing rapid and zzso tumor cell separation and enrichment from diluted peripheral whole blood, by exploiting the zzso zzso zzso A zzso model is developed to simulate the Dean flow inside the curved geometry and to track the zzso zzso which is validated against the experimental observations and serves as a theoretical foundation for zzso the operating zzso zzso from separating tumor cells zzso and zzso spiked into whole blood indicate that zzso of blood cells and zzso of tumor cells are collected at the inner and the middle outlet, respectively, with zzso tumor recovery rate at a zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso We expect that this zzso zzso platform, driven by purely zzso forces, would have an impact on fundamental and clinical studies of circulating tumor zzso
