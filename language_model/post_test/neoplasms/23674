An automated zzso system designed for measuring molecular interactions in real-time and without zzso of the zzso has been used to evaluate the zzso rate and affinity zzso of zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in affinity between parental and zzso zzso produced were related to the association rate constants, since the zzso rate zzso were in the same zzso zzso were also closely related to zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso system, besides presenting several advantages for characterizing zzso interaction, is valuable for selecting zzso zzso with properties which might be useful in the development of zzso zzso zzso
