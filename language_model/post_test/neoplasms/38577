The paper is devoted to the development of a mathematical model for describing probabilities of occurrence of radiation complications on the skin (as well as in other normal zzso and zzso during its zzso with homogeneous and zzso dose fields as a function of an zzso skin zzso The model naturally zzso the isolation of an equivalent dose (an zzso zzso introduced by zzso zzso zzso which can be effectively used for comparison of homogeneous and zzso dose fields in normal zzso and zzso The development of mathematical models describing probabilities of occurrence of radiation complications in normal zzso and zzso opens up new opportunities for improvement of methods of cancer zzso zzso
