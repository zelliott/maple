One of the basement membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to support efficient cell zzso and migration through interaction with zzso on the zzso plasma zzso Here, we show that a soluble form of zzso induced migration of human zzso cells and zzso cells by interacting with zzso on the zzso cell zzso Although both zzso and zzso zzso promoted cell migration when coated onto a plastic surface as zzso zzso only zzso zzso cell migration in its soluble form on other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso on the zzso cell surface and zzso cell migration, while the cell zzso was largely dependent on the underlying zzso Thus, zzso signals from the zzso surface and the zzso surface zzso regulated zzso organization and cell zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced cell zzso by zzso signal pathways via protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso dependency was more prominent for soluble zzso than zzso zzso and was absent in the stimulation by zzso zzso In zzso scratch zzso with zzso self-produced soluble zzso bound to the zzso cell surface of zzso cells at the scratched edges, suggesting that soluble zzso may contribute to cell migration in pathological conditions such as wound healing and tumor zzso
