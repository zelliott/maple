We introduce a statistical protocol for analyzing zzso varying data, including putative explanatory zzso The procedures comprise preliminary spatial zzso analysis (from an earlier zzso path analysis, zzso of the resulting set of path zzso zzso of these zzso and zzso tests against zzso zzso To illustrate the application of these methods, we present zzso and mortality rates of 31 zzso and zzso zzso in zzso these rates vary markedly with geography and type of zzso Additionally, we investigated three factors zzso zzso and zzso zzso affecting these zzso The five variables were correlated separately for the 31 zzso over European reporting zzso We analyzed the correlations by path analysis, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the 31 path zzso modeling the correlations vary zzso To simplify zzso we grouped the zzso into five zzso for which we describe the differential effects of the three putative causes on zzso and zzso When zzso the path zzso zzso without marked gaps between zzso zzso differences make for differences in cancer rates, even when the populations tested are ancient and complex zzso zzso analysis zzso zzso a structural model involving effects and putative causes, and estimates the magnitude of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the path zzso suggests the putative causes are the results of multiple zzso Despite this continuity of the path zzso of the 31 zzso zzso offers a useful zzso of the zzso zzso and other zzso information on the zzso map significantly into the five zzso demonstrating their zzso zzso
