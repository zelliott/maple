Recently much attention has been given to the zzso drug zzso an zzso of zzso double minute 2 zzso that actively zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function by zzso thus provides a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of zzso Although zzso seems a potential candidate in restoring zzso activity, it has many zzso zzso poor zzso zzso delivery, and most zzso it is a zzso of zzso resistance zzso The objective of the present study is to prepare and characterize zzso loaded zzso zzso zzso zzso surface zzso with zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso with an aim to deliver zzso drug in a targeted manner to its site of action and to enhance its therapeutic efficacy many times zzso The enhanced cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso loaded zzso zzso over native zzso zzso loaded zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells substantiate the targeting zzso of zzso zzso zzso values depicted superior zzso activity of zzso over zzso and native zzso in the above studied cell zzso Cell cycle arrest, loss of zzso membrane potential and zzso induced by above zzso were confirmed by flow zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins involved in cell cycle regulation and zzso were investigated by western zzso The above investigation indicates the enhanced therapeutic ability of zzso compared to zzso or zzso Thus, our results suggest that zzso could be a potentially useful drug carrier system for targeted delivery of potent zzso drug zzso for cancer zzso
