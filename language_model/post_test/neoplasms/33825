zzso A4 zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso A4 zzso The vascular targeting agent zzso is a zzso zzso zzso The mechanism of action of the drug is thought to involve the binding of zzso to zzso leading to zzso and then zzso changes in zzso zzso These changes increase vascular zzso and disrupt tumor blood zzso In experimental tumors, zzso effects are seen within minutes of drug administration and rapidly lead to extensive zzso necrosis in areas that are often resistant to conventional zzso zzso Following zzso administration a viable tumor rim typically remains from which tumor regrowth zzso When given in combination with therapies targeted at the zzso viable zzso enhanced tumor responses are seen and in some cases zzso zzso from the first clinical trials have shown that zzso zzso is safe and reduces tumor blood zzso There has been some promising demonstration of zzso zzso in combination with zzso is also zzso zzso imaging studies have been used to aid the selection of doses for phase II zzso Both dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso and zzso zzso zzso can measure the zzso effects of zzso in zzso This review describes the background to the development of zzso its proposed mechanism of action, the results from the first clinical trials with zzso and the role of imaging techniques in its clinical zzso
