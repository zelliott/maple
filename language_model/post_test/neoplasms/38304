To measure the bias in absolute cancer survival estimates in the absence of active follow-up of cancer patients in developing zzso 

Included in the study were all incident cases of the 10 most common zzso and corresponding zzso plus all zzso zzso not ranked among the top 10 that were registered in the zzso cancer registry in zzso India, during zzso and followed through zzso zzso incident cases were first matched with those in the zzso mortality database from the vital statistics division of the Corporation of zzso zzso incident cancer cases were then actively followed up to determine their survival zzso Absolute survival was estimated by using an zzso method and applying different assumptions regarding the survival status zzso of cases under passive and active zzso 

Before active zzso matches between cases ranged from zzso to zzso depending on the site of the primary zzso Active follow-up of zzso incident cases revealed that zzso to zzso had died by the end of the follow-up period, while the survival status of zzso to 38% remained zzso Before active follow-up of cancer patients, zzso absolute survival was estimated to be between zzso and zzso higher, than when conventional zzso assumption methods were applied to cases that were lost to zzso The smallest survival estimates were obtained when cases lost to follow-up were excluded from the zzso 

Under the conditions that prevail in India and other developing countries, active follow-up of cancer patients yields the most reliable estimates of cancer survival zzso zzso case follow-up alone or applying standard methods to estimate survival is likely to result in an upward zzso
