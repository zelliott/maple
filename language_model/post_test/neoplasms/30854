The authors conducted a Phase I dose escalation trial of zzso given daily for 3 consecutive days to 29 children with zzso solid zzso zzso of these children had received prior zzso 

Patients were assigned to dosage zzso separately on the basis of prior exposure to the platinum zzso agents zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or the absence of such exposure zzso zzso zzso At least three patients in each category were treated at a starting dosage of zzso zzso for 3 zzso This dosage represented zzso of the total dose delivered in the prior study of zzso given daily over 5 days with dosage escalation of zzso in subsequent zzso 

zzso was zzso at the second dosage level zzso zzso for patients previously treated with platinum and at the third dosage level zzso zzso for those not previously treated with zzso zzso zzso was seen at zzso zzso for the former group, but was not encountered in the latter zzso 

zzso of zzso daily for 3 days is feasible and safe at recommended zzso of zzso zzso for children with prior exposure to platinum and zzso zzso for those without prior zzso
