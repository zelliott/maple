We developed a universal zzso zzso zzso zzso that is capable of zzso zzso T cells to tumor cells via zzso zzso zzso such as zzso fragments or zzso A zzso zzso zzso with binding zzso for the zzso zzso on T cells as well as for the zzso zzso zzso was zzso This zzso zzso is capable of zzso zzso T cells to kill a series of zzso cells, including B cell lymphoma, Hodgkin's lymphoma, and colon zzso via zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso was found to be comparable to zzso zzso zzso with similar zzso Our findings demonstrate that universal zzso zzso could be used for T cell based cellular zzso in a variety of human zzso Additionally, these zzso molecules allow fast and economic testing of zzso zzso on zzso cells for their potential use as zzso target structures if corresponding zzso zzso or zzso are zzso
