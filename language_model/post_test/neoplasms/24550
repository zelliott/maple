The potential risk factors for pulmonary zzso zzso have not been examined in Japan, so the aims of the present study were to assess independent risk factors for zzso and to estimate the recent zzso of symptomatic zzso 

Based on a mailed zzso the potential risk factors for zzso were zzso assessed using a matched case - control study, and the number of new patients with zzso in 2004 was calculated zzso In zzso zzso increase in body mass index zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso by 10 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso prolonged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recent major surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified as independent risk factors for zzso in zzso The risks for zzso zzso zzso hypertension, zzso and zzso and alcohol consumption did not affect the zzso of zzso The calculated number of new patients with zzso per year was zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso
