Agents used for systemic chemotherapy can alter normal bone zzso through mechanisms that affect both zzso and zzso zzso The identification of those agents that influence maintenance of the zzso compartment is an important component of the drug development and testing zzso This brief review focuses on zzso and clinical data illustrating the effect of several classes of zzso agents on skeletal development and bone zzso 

New zzso data demonstrate that several classes of zzso agents, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso alter zzso and zzso zzso zzso data on zzso acid zzso demonstrate that these agents inhibit zzso In addition, a zzso effect of zzso treatment on growth plate thickness and primary zzso height in rats has been zzso Two recently published analyses of clinical data from trials of zzso in myeloma patients found increased zzso markers of bone formation and evidence of increased bone deposition after zzso zzso 

Several classes of zzso agents alter bone metabolism and zzso impact bone zzso Bone mineral density zzso monitoring guidelines for patients receiving systemic chemotherapy are not zzso Limited guidelines exist for zzso monitoring in patients receiving long-term hormonal zzso however, the negative effect of other zzso agents on the skeleton is zzso
