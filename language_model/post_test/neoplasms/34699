zzso is a novel zzso zzso zzso studies showed improved activity with infusions of at least 3 days compared with zzso regimens, especially at zzso zzso zzso This phase I study tested the feasibility of achieving a zzso zzso concentration of 20 zzso for at least 72 h in patients with solid zzso 

Patients with solid tumors received zzso as a progressively longer infusion on days zzso of a zzso zzso The initial length of infusion and infusion rate were 48 h and 3 zzso 

zzso patients were treated at infusion lengths that increased from 48 to 72 h and then 96 zzso The infusion rate was decreased from 3 to zzso zzso due to zzso zzso zzso consisted of grade 4 zzso zzso and grade 3 zzso zzso The maximum tolerated dose of continuous infusion zzso in patients with solid tumors is zzso zzso administered over 96 zzso This dose level resulted in zzso drug concentration of at least 20 zzso for 72 zzso 

Administration of zzso by continuous infusion achieved the zzso defined target plasma zzso zzso zzso modeling coupled with real-time zzso assessment was an efficient approach to conduct zzso phase I zzso
