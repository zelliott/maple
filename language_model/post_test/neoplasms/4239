Recent advances in the molecular biology research have devoted greatly to the clinical applications of genetic zzso Gene diagnosis and therapy is a new medical field to deal with these zzso Nowadays diseases related with gene abnormalities have been shown to reach zzso and gene zzso to cover all these should be very wide and zzso So that any one of the clinical laboratories in a hospital or even research zzso and laboratory centers should not be able to handle all the zzso A model system to promote gene zzso effectively in Japan, which includes a special department in a hospital and limited specifications to the individual laboratories or centers, were zzso In the case of zzso genetic disorders, gene testing results are useful not only to confirm clinical diagnosis but to predict future development of disorders zzso and even during the prenatal or zzso zzso zzso these may evoke critical ethical and social zzso Many of common diseases are zzso in nature and gene zzso in these disorders are not directed to the diagnosis but are quite useful to see the individual characteristics of the patients related to the special zzso or even the fate of disease zzso zzso zzso are known to be resulted from a zzso gene zzso and progress by the associations of further zzso Only limited gene zzso are already now in zzso Wide future development in this field is expected after getting detailed zzso of gene zzso in the individual zzso Gene zzso for infectious diseases are known to be quite effective on the early and accurate diagnosis, and many of these are already covered by the health zzso In conclusion, gene zzso are quite important but variable and laboratory personnel should not be able to deal all of these zzso Considering future development of gene therapy, rapid establishment in a hospital of a special department, Department of Gene Diagnosis and zzso which is consisted from 3 divisions such as genetic counseling, gene testing and management, and monitoring and adviser of gene therapy, is highly zzso
