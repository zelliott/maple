The development of sensitive zzso for measurement of DNA damage in humans has great potential for enhancing intervention zzso zzso for DNA zzso measurement include zzso zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso with zzso or zzso zzso and gas zzso zzso It is now well established that DNA zzso are a marker of exposure to various zzso lifestyle, or occupational chemical zzso Our own studies concentrate on zzso detection of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of isolated DNA or quantitative zzso analysis of intact zzso zzso aromatic hydrocarbon zzso zzso are elevated in blood cells of zzso and zzso oven workers, individuals with high levels of exposure to environmental air pollution, and zzso The study in smokers also found an inverse relationship between serum antioxidants and zzso and is the basis for an ongoing zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso DNA damage zzso are being measured in blood zzso cells and zzso oral and zzso cells from subjects on antioxidants or zzso Data on published intervention studies investigating zzso damage and general aromatic DNA zzso measured by zzso are also zzso These studies have already demonstrated that DNA zzso can be modulated by interventions and suggest that they can provide important zzso information in support of larger scale zzso
