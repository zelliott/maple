Two functional zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have zzso been found to influence zzso to various cancer zzso We tested whether genetically lowered zzso activity affects risk of developing cancer in the general zzso 

We zzso zzso individuals from the Danish general population for the zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso gene and divided them into groups with predicted fast, zzso and slow zzso zzso Using Cox zzso hazards models, we calculated zzso for 26 individual cancer diagnoses and for groups of any cancer, zzso zzso zzso female zzso and other zzso 

Of the zzso individuals, zzso experienced a cancer event, and of these, zzso were zzso After zzso adjustment, the zzso zzso zzso for zzso cancer were zzso zzso and zzso zzso in individuals with intermediate and slow zzso activity versus individuals with the fast zzso zzso zzso zzso The corresponding zzso among zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso among zzso did not differ from zzso 

Our results indicate that genetically lowered zzso activity is associated with increased risk of developing zzso cancer among smokers in the general population; however, additional studies are needed to confirm our zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the largest study to investigate the association of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso combined in the general zzso
