To review the literature and develop a conceptual framework about zzso factors for people presenting to medical zzso with recently diagnosed incurable zzso 

zzso was searched from January 2000 to October 2003 to identify articles testing associations between clinical or laboratory variables and survival time in adults with advanced solid zzso and median survival of 3 to 24 zzso We recorded how frequently zzso factors were significantly associated with survival in zzso and multivariable zzso 

There were 53 studies zzso The factors associated with survival were zzso into four categories related to attributes of the host the zzso the treatment and the interactions between host, zzso and treatment zzso quality of life, performance status and laboratory zzso zzso was consistently associated with shorter zzso Age and gender were not consistently associated with survival zzso except in lung cancer where females survived zzso zzso factors associated with shorter survival included primary zzso zzso zzso site zzso brain and zzso and disease zzso zzso associated with shorter survival included those of the zzso syndrome, zzso pain and impaired physical well zzso Performance status was strongly associated with survival in most zzso Laboratory tests associated with shorter survival included zzso zzso zzso and elevated serum levels of both alkaline zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso factors in patients with advanced cancer can be zzso as attributes of the host, zzso treatment and interactions between the three reflected in symptoms, quality of life performance status and laboratory zzso
