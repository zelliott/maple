Animal models and a few human studies have suggested a complex interaction between cancer risk and longevity indicating a zzso where low cancer risk is associated with accelerating aging zzso and, vice versa, that longevity potential comes with the cost of increased cancer zzso This hypothesis predicts that longevity in one twin is associated with increased cancer risk in the zzso 

A total of zzso twin pairs born zzso in Denmark were followed for mortality in the Danish Civil Registration System through 2008 and for cancer zzso in the period zzso through the Danish Cancer zzso 

The zzso twins who provided risk time for cancer occurrence entered the study between ages 24 and 43 zzso 33 zzso and each participant was followed up to death, zzso or at least 90 years of zzso The total follow-up time was zzso zzso and, zzso zzso were zzso A negative association between age at death of a twin and cancer zzso in the zzso was found in the overall analyses as well as in the zzso zzso on sex, zzso and random selection of one twin from each twin zzso 

This study did not find evidence of a zzso zzso in zzso On the contrary, it suggested that longevity in one twin is associated with lower cancer zzso in the zzso indicating familial factors associated with both low cancer occurrence and zzso
