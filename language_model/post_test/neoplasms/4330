In the past decade, significant progress has been made in understanding the genetic component of familial zzso Genes associated with familial colon and breast zzso have recently been isolated and molecular diagnostic tests are expected to become available in the near zzso zzso now have the opportunity to recognize and counsel individuals with elevated risk of cancer by identifying risk factors and genes associated with cancer zzso The rapid advances in molecular technology are a direct challenge to the medical community and cancer centers to supply specialized clinical services for familial zzso We sought to ascertain the activities of cancer centers in the development of programs and the provision of genetic services for familial zzso We surveyed 41 centers with National Cancer Institute zzso cancer center support zzso One half of the centers responding (17 of 34) reported that they provide some genetic services for familial zzso About one half of these 17 centers zzso zzso of zzso the three remaining clinics that responded had incomplete information on this zzso see a variety of patient types on a small scale zzso than 100 patients per year), and most provide four basic clinical zzso medical zzso cancer risk assessment, genetic counseling, and pedigree zzso Staffing of each center varied widely, as did the types of screening services offered (including molecular diagnostic zzso Several centers (six zzso of 17) indicated that they were in the zzso stages for serving familial cancer patients, and many seem to be increasing their activities in this zzso The remaining 17 zzso centers that responded, however, currently provide no genetic services for familial zzso The results of this survey suggest that there is interest in developing clinical programs for familial zzso by zzso cancer centers, but most of these programs are in zzso zzso A base line has been established to monitor future progress for the provision of cancer genetic zzso
