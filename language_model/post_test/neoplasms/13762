The quality of treatment that one can realize today in zzso zzso can be reached only if one has access to zzso imaging allowing a precise determination of the volume of the zzso at risk and of the zzso For this reason, one has access to anatomical imaging, CT or zzso and functional and zzso imaging, PET or zzso zzso CT gives the electronic density of the zzso which is essential to ensure a very precise calculation of dose zzso Its zzso in the zzso of the tumor and some anatomical structures makes necessary the registration of these images with zzso of which zzso are sufficiently weak to be usable in zzso The registration will be usable only if images of each zzso are realized with the patient in treatment position, except for brain, where only CT, on which is based the zzso must be done in treatment zzso At least, if one wants to zzso the active parts of a tumor or to make the difference between zzso and tumor left or recurrence after zzso or chemotherapy, it is necessary to use PET or zzso To define correctly the zzso using these images, one must realize the anatomical zzso of the zzso zzso which they highlight with a registration based on CT or zzso The difficulties to obtain the registration of these images led the manufacturer to propose mixed machines allowing to realize, at the same time, a CT imaging and a PET or a zzso imaging with the patient in treatment zzso
