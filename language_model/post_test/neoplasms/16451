Since the establishment of human zzso in 1956, human zzso has quickly zzso The description of the Philadelphia zzso in 1960 led up to new applications of zzso in the fields of zzso and zzso The initial techniques allowed only uniform zzso of zzso limiting the detection of most structural zzso Many approaches aimed to gain a better knowledge of zzso structure, a better understanding of zzso and a better identification of the zzso were developed: zzso zzso techniques, electronic zzso Since 1980, new developments in clinical zzso and molecular biology have zzso In zzso labeling using zzso zzso onto zzso and zzso was developed: zzso in zzso zzso zzso was zzso Fish allows detecting many zzso abnormalities of number and/or zzso The major limitation of this technique is that its use should be based on known indications for the choice of the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso the most recent development of Fish on zzso zzso allows to overcome this zzso As shown here in three examples, zzso allows to describe precisely complex zzso in zzso zzso and solid zzso Finally, if no zzso is available, comparative zzso zzso zzso can be performed to detect and simultaneously zzso on zzso gains or losses in zzso zzso
