An alternative form of gene therapy involves zzso of a zzso cell line engineered to zzso a therapeutic zzso zzso of these cells in a zzso zzso serves to protect these zzso cells from zzso rejection while zzso products and nutrients are able to pass by zzso This strategy was applied to the treatment of cancer with some success by delivering either zzso 2 or zzso However, as cancer is a complex, zzso disease, a multipronged approach is now being developed to attack zzso via multiple pathways in order to improve treatment zzso A combination of zzso with zzso therapy was investigated by treating zzso zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso genetically modified to deliver zzso and an zzso 2 fusion protein zzso The combination treatment resulted in improved survival, delayed tumor growth, and increased zzso zzso of zzso activity zzso and zzso In addition to improved zzso the combination treatment also ameliorated some of the zzso side effects from the individual treatments that have led to the previous failure of the single treatments, for example, inflammatory response to zzso or vascular mimicry due to zzso In conclusion, the combination of zzso and zzso therapies delivered by zzso cells was superior to individual treatments for zzso activity, not only because of their known mechanisms of action but also because of unexpected protection against the adverse side effects of the single zzso Thus, the concept of a zzso strategy, with zzso delivering multiple zzso zzso molecules to improve zzso is zzso
