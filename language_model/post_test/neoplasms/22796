Cancer progression is characterized by zzso in growth signals, zzso to zzso signals, evasion of zzso a zzso potential to zzso sustained zzso and tissue invasion, including zzso The regulation of these cellular processes relies on a fine-tuned control of molecular signal zzso In recent years, short zzso zzso termed zzso zzso have been described as a novel class of molecular zzso These affect various signaling zzso during the progression of zzso diseases by the regulation of gene expression on the zzso zzso The novel zzso zzso zzso protein zzso growth zzso domain 7 zzso has been suggested to control vascular zzso Further, the two biologically active zzso zzso and its complement zzso which are zzso by zzso 7 of the zzso zzso have been described to mediate vascular zzso zzso studies in zzso and mice suggested a major role of zzso in zzso and vascular integrity, which was zzso by the repression of zzso of zzso proliferation in zzso zzso Recent studies revealed the distribution and function of zzso and zzso in various types of cancer, and assigned a role to both zzso as zzso of tumor zzso Indeed, zzso and zzso have been reported to impair cancer progression through signaling pathways that control tumor cell zzso migration, invasion, and zzso zzso zzso and zzso may have a supportive role in the progression of cancer as well, which might be zzso by the promotion of blood vessel growth and zzso In this work, we will zzso the current knowledge on functions of zzso that are relevant for cancer formation, and we will discuss their potential clinical use as zzso markers of survival and application as novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of zzso zzso
