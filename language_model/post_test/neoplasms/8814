zzso cholesterol and zzso metabolism are the hallmarks of cancer and contribute to zzso transformation due to the obligatory requirement for cholesterol for the function of zzso zzso To build new zzso and maintain active zzso cancer cells depend on high intensity of zzso cholesterol zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This zzso dependency of cancer cells on cholesterol and other lipids is tightly regulated by the cholesterol zzso network, including zzso zzso response zzso proteins zzso master zzso regulators of cholesterol and fatty acid zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso receptors zzso X zzso zzso which coordinate growth with the availability of zzso and zzso zzso particle zzso such as zzso zzso particle zzso zzso providing zzso zzso and lipids to cancer zzso In addition, activity of zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a general strategy of reducing the cholesterol pool in cancer cells is challenged by the highly efficient feedback zzso zzso for a blockade at a single point in the cholesterol zzso zzso Besides the well-established structural role of cholesterol in zzso recent studies have uncovered potent zzso activities of certain cholesterol zzso precursors and its oxidized zzso zzso The former, zzso zzso exert effects on trafficking and signaling of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the highly active products of cholesterol zzso are being neutralized by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso These recently discovered zzso activities of the cholesterol zzso genes and zzso expand our understanding of the uniquely zzso roles these zzso molecules play in the regulation of cellular proliferation and in zzso
