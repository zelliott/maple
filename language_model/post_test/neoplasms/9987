zzso zzso are a family of zzso originally identified as zzso zzso zzso other properties of zzso were zzso including zzso of cell zzso and effects on the immune response and on expression of surface zzso In this paper we present evidence that zzso even the highly zzso cloned zzso can stimulate zzso tumor growth in zzso Of 225 human tumor zzso samples tested with zzso in a zzso zzso zzso 30 zzso showed growth stimulation zzso than 2 zzso above zzso The phenomenon was observed most frequently with acute zzso leukemia zzso samples, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and breast cancer zzso zzso but significantly less frequent in zzso zzso zzso As an independent assessment of zzso zzso zzso zzso by tumor cells was measured zzso in 21 patients with multiple zzso A significant increase of the zzso labeling index was seen in 4 zzso of the zzso Since this growth zzso effect was also observed with cell lines which lack any zzso zzso cells, there is strong evidence that zzso can directly stimulate the proliferation of zzso tumor cells in zzso Growth stimulation by zzso occurred zzso with lower zzso It is important to be cognizant of potential clinical implications of tumor growth stimulation by zzso
