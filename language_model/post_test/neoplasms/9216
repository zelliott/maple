To perform a zzso to evaluate the diagnostic performance of zzso zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso technique in detection of primary and zzso zzso compared with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Search zzso zzso zzso and Cochrane Library database from January 1984 to July 2013 for studies comparing zzso with zzso for detection of primary and zzso zzso zzso quality was assessed by the quality assessment of diagnostic studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values, diagnostic odds ratio zzso and areas under the summary receiver operator characteristic curve zzso were zzso Potential threshold effect, zzso and publication bias were zzso 

Thirteen eligible studies were included, with a total of zzso zzso There was no significant threshold zzso zzso had a similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso No significant difference was detected between zzso of zzso and zzso zzso had a pooled sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a pooled specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had a pooled sensitivity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a pooled specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to stem primarily from data type zzso zzso versus per zzso MR sequence zzso only and zzso with other zzso and primary zzso type zzso type and multiple zzso The zzso funnel plots suggested the absence of publication zzso 

zzso has similar, good diagnostic performance for the detection of primary and zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso with other MR sequences could further improve the diagnostic zzso More high-quality studies regarding comparison of zzso and zzso and combination of them in detecting zzso are still needed to be zzso
