zzso zzso zzso are a large family of proteins that are engaged in the regulation of the turnover and activity of many target zzso Together with zzso zzso E1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso catalyze the zzso of a variety of biologically significant protein zzso for targeted degradation through the zzso zzso as well as for zzso regulation of their functions or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore, play an essential role in the regulation of many zzso zzso zzso amounts of evidence strongly suggest that the abnormal regulation of some zzso zzso is involved in cancer zzso Furthermore, some zzso zzso zzso are frequently zzso in human zzso which zzso well with increased zzso and poor clinic zzso In this review, zzso zzso zzso (such as zzso double minute 2, inhibitor of zzso zzso and zzso zzso will be evaluated as potential cancer drug targets and zzso zzso zzso study in this field would lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanism by which zzso zzso regulate cellular processes and of how their zzso contribute to zzso This would eventually lead to the development of a novel class of zzso drugs targeting specific zzso zzso zzso as well as the development of sensitive zzso for cancer treatment, diagnosis, and zzso
