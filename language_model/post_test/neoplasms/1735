This study investigated the connection among zzso gene amplification, zzso protein zzso and markers of tumor zzso and zzso in patients with zzso invasive breast zzso 

From 1988 to 1995, 425 patients with zzso breast cancer were enrolled in a study of high-dose chemotherapy with zzso zzso zzso tumor blocks were obtained and evaluated using zzso zzso zzso of vessels with von zzso factor zzso Mean zzso zzso zzso were determined by counting von zzso factor stained cells in three separate zzso hot zzso using image zzso zzso samples were also stained for zzso by zzso zzso gene amplification by zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 9 by zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso by zzso Plasma from 36 patients with primary tumor samples had zzso zzso Systems, zzso and zzso (American zzso Greenwich, zzso levels zzso 

There was a significant positive correlation between zzso gene amplification and both maximum and average zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso There was an inverse correlation with zzso gene amplification and expression of the tumor zzso marker zzso zzso P zzso zzso The level of zzso gene amplification correlated with plasma zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Interestingly, tumors with zzso by zzso had decreased amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no correlation between zzso by zzso and zzso or zzso Of all of the variables zzso only average zzso zzso zzso and maximum zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted zzso survival zzso zzso zzso 

zzso breast zzso have increased amounts of zzso decreased amounts of zzso and increased markers of zzso zzso These findings have zzso zzso and therapeutic implications in breast cancer zzso
