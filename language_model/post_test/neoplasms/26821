To evaluate the diagnostic value of zzso zzso for detection of bone zzso in comparison with the zzso of zzso zzso CT, zzso PET and conventional zzso bone zzso in a series of cancer zzso 

Five hundred and thirty patients who underwent both zzso zzso and bone zzso within 1 month were zzso zzso The skeletal system was classified into 10 zzso segments and interpreted blindly and zzso For each zzso the sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were calculated and the results were statistically zzso 

Bone zzso were confirmed in 117 patients with zzso positive zzso On zzso analysis, the sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso were significantly higher than bone zzso CT and zzso PET zzso On zzso analysis, the sensitivity of CT, bone zzso zzso PET and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively zzso compared with zzso zzso The overall specificity and accuracy of the four zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso compared with zzso zzso The zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three hundred and twelve zzso or segments were presented as zzso or sclerotic changes on CT images at the corresponding sites of increased zzso zzso In zzso or mixed zzso the sensitivity of zzso zzso and zzso PET were better than bone zzso while in zzso zzso bone zzso had a similar performance with zzso zzso but better than zzso PET zzso 

Our data allow the conclusion that zzso zzso is superior to zzso bone zzso CT or zzso PET in detecting bone zzso zzso zzso may enhance our diagnosis of tumor bone zzso and provide more information for cancer zzso
