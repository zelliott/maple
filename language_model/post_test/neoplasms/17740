zzso of cancer using zzso zzso has shown promise in both zzso and clinical zzso One important challenge to reach the full therapeutic potential of zzso zzso is accomplishing efficient infection of cancer cells and avoiding zzso by normal tissue through zzso zzso zzso this goal, we constructed and characterized an zzso zzso carrying zzso zzso proteins to abolish the zzso zzso native zzso and zzso a zzso adapter zzso to target the virus to the zzso growth factor zzso zzso The new virus displayed a highly selective targeting profile, with reduced infection of zzso cells and efficient killing of zzso cancer cells including primary zzso zzso cells that are zzso to infection by conventional zzso Our method to modify zzso zzso might thus be useful to design new zzso zzso for more effective treatment of zzso
