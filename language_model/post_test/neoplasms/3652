We investigated the association between zzso fitness and zzso zzso and total cancer mortality in zzso 

We followed zzso men, age zzso zzso who had a preventive medical zzso including a zzso exercise test and zzso health zzso There were 335 cancer deaths zzso from zzso cancer, 202 from zzso zzso during an average of 10 zzso of follow-up zzso zzso 

After adjustment for age, examination year, smoking habits, alcohol zzso body mass index, and diabetes zzso there was an inverse association between zzso fitness levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and total cancer mortality zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and high levels of zzso fitness were associated with lower risk of zzso and zzso cancer mortality when compared with low fitness in zzso We also observed that zzso mortality rates were progressively lower across low, moderate, and high fitness groups in former zzso zzso zzso for zzso and current zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso 

We conclude that zzso fitness may provide protection against cancer mortality in zzso
