The incremental diagnostic value of integrated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso images compared with PET or zzso alone, or PET or zzso correlated with a CT obtained at a different time includes the zzso zzso improvement in zzso detection on both CT and PET or zzso images, zzso improvement in the zzso of zzso of zzso resulting in better differentiation of zzso from zzso zzso zzso precise zzso of the zzso zzso for example, in the skeleton vs soft tissue or liver vs adjacent zzso or zzso zzso characterization of serendipitous zzso and zzso confirmation of small, zzso or unusual zzso The use of these techniques can occur at the time of initial diagnosis, in assessing the early response of disease to treatment, at the conclusion of treatment, and in continuing follow-up of zzso zzso and zzso fusion images affect the clinical management in a significant proportion of patients with a wide range of diseases by zzso guiding further procedures, zzso excluding the need of further procedures, zzso changing both zzso and zzso therapy, including soon after treatment has been zzso and zzso by providing zzso zzso zzso fusion images have the potential to provide important information to guide the biopsy of a mass to active regions of the tumor and to provide better maps than CT alone to zzso field and dose of radiation zzso It is expected that the role of zzso and zzso in changing management will continue to evolve in the future and that these tools will be fundamental components of the truly zzso zzso we are striving to zzso
