New efforts in cancer therapy are being focused at various levels of signaling zzso With zzso zzso zzso potentially being necessary for a range of zzso functions, we have investigated the influence of selected zzso zzso to zzso on cell growth and zzso We show that zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibit zzso zzso incorporation in human breast cancer zzso cells and the ability to grow in liquid medium and form colonies in zzso zzso medium by small cell lung cancer zzso cells, a human cancer cell line containing a zzso active zzso In an zzso cancer cell line that also contains a zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso again inhibited liquid medium zzso Furthermore, when applied zzso zzso zzso was shown indeed to enter zzso zzso These effects appeared specifically related to zzso zzso known to bind to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicating involvement of the zzso downstream target protein zzso B zzso This was further supported by zzso of zzso zzso domain membrane targeting in zzso cells by zzso Thus, we propose that specific zzso zzso inhibit zzso by competing with zzso zzso zzso zzso and that this occurs mainly at the level of the downstream zzso target, zzso
