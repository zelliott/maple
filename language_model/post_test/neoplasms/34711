The zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso is frequently zzso in human zzso in relation to disease progression and drives cellular zzso zzso and zzso progression in experimental zzso zzso zzso function results from zzso zzso and/or zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso pathways and selectively increases the translation of key zzso involved in tumor growth, zzso and cell zzso zzso by simultaneously and selectively reducing the expression of numerous potent growth and survival factors critical for zzso targeting zzso for zzso may provide an attractive therapy for many different tumor zzso Recent work has now shown the zzso of zzso targeting zzso and has resulted in the advance of the first zzso therapy to clinical zzso These studies illustrate the increased zzso of tumor zzso to zzso zzso and support the notion that the enhanced zzso function common to many tumor types may represent an Achilles' heel for zzso
