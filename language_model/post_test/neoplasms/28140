An excess of cancer was suspected by workers of the zzso department at the French Atomic Energy zzso zzso after several deaths from cancer were reported in 1983 and zzso After a descriptive study performed by the zzso in 1985 the results of which were not conclusive enough to put an end to the controversy, the present cohort study was undertaken in zzso 

As no specific exposure, or a precise cancer site was suspected, it was decided to include all subjects who had worked at the zzso department for at least 1 year between 1950 and zzso The cohort was followed up to 31 December zzso Individual occupational zzso were determined zzso for each year from 1950 to 1990, both zzso zzso job, and hazard records, and assistance from former zzso and zzso (for external zzso On the basis of these zzso three types of occupational tasks were zzso handling of zzso zzso and external zzso zzso mortality ratios zzso were calculated to estimate the risk of death, and the existence of an association between risk of cancer and each of the three tasks was zzso 

The cohort included zzso workers, followed up for an average of 30 years zzso of zzso zzso The number of deaths from all causes and from all cancer sites were respectively 44 and zzso No excess of cancer deaths was found for the study period zzso zzso nor was there a peak in zzso The risk of death from all cancer sites increased with the duration of exposure to zzso 

The results do not justify the workers' impression of an excess of zzso They suggest, however, that the duration of work at some tasks that involved handling chemicals may be an indicator of risk of zzso Communication to the workers during the study played an important part in reducing their concern, contributing to their better understanding of the zzso
