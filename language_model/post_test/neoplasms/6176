DNA repair pathways enable tumor cells to survive zzso and zzso DNA zzso Poly zzso zzso zzso is an zzso involved in base zzso repair, a key zzso in the repair of DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso are an area of active clinical investigation in zzso as they exploit synthetic zzso in tumors with defective zzso zzso zzso the zzso effect of chemotherapy and zzso zzso in zzso pathways are not restricted to zzso tumors, however, various other cancer types may also be characterized by a lack of zzso and are hence susceptible to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the activity of zzso agents, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and radiation both in zzso and in zzso To date, at least nine different companies have initiated clinical zzso trials with zzso zzso ranging in stages from phase 0 to zzso Recent studies have indicated that tumor cells with defective zzso repair zzso the classic example being zzso zzso are exquisitely sensitive to zzso zzso This review summarizes findings and concepts regarding the role of zzso zzso as well as the challenges that will be faced in the clinical development of these zzso The identification of zzso markers for sensitivity to zzso zzso represents a priority area for zzso
