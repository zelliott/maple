The zzso approach used in the first phase of the design of novel protein zzso C zzso zzso was based on the study of the geometry of zzso zzso present in zzso zzso and in the more potent zzso zzso tumor zzso A number of potent zzso zzso were generated by this approach, in which the zzso backbone was constrained into various zzso rings to reduce the zzso penalty associated with zzso zzso Based on the information provided by X-ray and zzso structures of the zzso C1 zzso zzso binding domain, the zzso zzso were further modified to zzso their interaction with a group of highly zzso zzso zzso acids along the rim of the C1 zzso This zzso approach culminated with the synthesis of a series of zzso zzso molecules that can bind to zzso with low zzso zzso These compounds provide insight into the basis for zzso zzso zzso Moreover, some of the compounds reviewed zzso show potential utility as zzso zzso
