zzso zzso 1 zzso was recently identified as a potential tumor marker for human zzso zzso This study further evaluates the usefulness of zzso in zzso tumor patients with normal zzso serum zzso 

zzso and zzso were zzso analyzed in 84 primary zzso cancer and 30 benign zzso tumors in patients with serum zzso levels zzso 35 zzso before zzso zzso zzso were calculated as zzso zzso zzso multiplied by percentage of tumor tissue zzso 

The cell types of the 84 zzso included 11 zzso 10 zzso 51 zzso and 12 zzso zzso There were 55 patients with invasive cancer and 29 with borderline zzso zzso The zzso of zzso but not of zzso in invasive cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were significantly zzso zzso zzso higher than those seen in borderline zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso When the zzso zzso was set at zzso invasive zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified from benign tumors zzso zzso 30) with a sensitivity of zzso a specificity of zzso a positive zzso value of zzso and a negative zzso value of zzso zzso of receiver operating characteristics analysis showed that the area under curve of the zzso zzso was zzso which was superior to that of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso may be useful in detecting invasive human zzso cancer in patients with low serum zzso zzso
