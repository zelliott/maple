This review examines the formation of free radical zzso from a number of clinically active zzso agents including zzso antibiotics and zzso An attempt is also made to relate the formation of these zzso zzso to zzso and pharmacological basis for tumor cell kill and zzso The formation of these zzso in some tumor cells has been detected by both direct zzso and zzso zzso The detection of free zzso in biological systems, however, depends upon cellular zzso zzso reducing conditions, and the presence and/or absence of zzso and zzso zzso Evidence shows that certain zzso drugs generate free zzso in zzso and in zzso and that these zzso species kill tumor cells by causing damage to DNA, zzso or zzso
