For over four decades, zzso zzso has been the mainstay of therapy for zzso cancer and a major zzso agent for treating gastrointestinal tumors and a variety of others, including breast and head and neck zzso zzso zzso is a new drug that is administered orally and has been rationally designed to generate zzso selectively within solid zzso zzso it has two major advantages, which should translate into an improved therapeutic zzso zzso enhanced drug concentration at the cancer site and therefore greater zzso activity and zzso reduced drug levels in zzso zzso with a zzso reduction in systemic zzso After promising zzso studies, phase I clinical trials of zzso have been performed with a variety of schedules, both with and without the oral zzso zzso zzso activity has been observed with all regimens zzso In the setting of zzso cancer, a zzso phase II study substantiated the phase I reports of activity and established the most promising regimen for phase III clinical zzso Patients in the phase II trial were randomly selected to receive either continuous zzso intermittent zzso or intermittent zzso plus zzso There were complete or partial responses in zzso of patients in the continuous arm, zzso in the intermittent arm, and zzso in the arm with intermittent zzso plus zzso In addition, zzso of patients in each arm achieved stable zzso zzso was well tolerated in all three zzso The intermittent regimen of zzso alone was associated with a longer time to disease progression and offered a one-week rest period to the zzso It was therefore selected for subsequent zzso Two zzso phase III trials of zzso versus the zzso regimen in patients with advanced zzso cancer have completed zzso They are designed to demonstrate at least equivalent zzso with important secondary zzso of comparisons of zzso medical care zzso and quality of zzso No formal results are yet available from these zzso The same regimen of zzso is now being evaluated in a large scale zzso study, which is expected to recruit approximately 1,700 zzso C zzso cancer patients zzso zzso The modest toxicity of zzso zzso its low zzso of zzso makes it a suitable candidate for novel combination therapies involving other agents that are active in zzso cancer, including zzso and its zzso zzso and zzso Further studies of zzso can be expected with other diseases known to be responsive to zzso together with diseases traditionally thought to be zzso
