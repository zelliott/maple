A transgenic zzso in which the regulatory elements of the stem cell marker, zzso drive green fluorescent protein zzso expresses zzso in nascent blood zzso Red fluorescent protein zzso tumors transplanted to zzso mice enable specific zzso of nascent vessels in the growing zzso The zzso mouse was also zzso to develop a rapid in zzso zzso fluorescent zzso zzso by zzso zzso a surgical sponge derived from zzso which was rapidly zzso by fluorescent nascent blood zzso zzso could be zzso and zzso when zzso or inhibited by specific compounds in both tumors and zzso These fluorescent models can be used to study the early events of zzso and to zzso determine efficacy of zzso zzso
