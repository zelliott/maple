Dynamic zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso is today the most popular method to assess zzso in the zzso Unfortunately, the technique is mostly used to determine zzso parameters like time to peak zzso zzso zzso remains challenging using zzso The method suffers from two major zzso First, no standardized imaging technique is zzso zzso no standard evaluation technique for zzso zzso has been established which accurately describes the zzso zzso of available contrast zzso Different imaging techniques using zzso zzso echo sequences and the basics of the evaluation are zzso To assess zzso changes due to zzso using zzso one has to take into account the systematic variation of the zzso input function required for zzso zzso zzso zzso the contrast agent zzso in that a shorter and more highly concentrated zzso appears earlier in the zzso
