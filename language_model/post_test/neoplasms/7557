zzso cells cultured with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells display a zzso effect against zzso zzso targets, but not against modified targets from unrelated zzso zzso zzso that share the K and I region of the zzso complex with the zzso (or zzso cell are zzso to the same extent as the specific targets, while targets that share the I region only are zzso When only the D region is shared, a weak zzso effect is zzso zzso the zzso (or zzso and target cell must share the K or D but not the I region of the zzso complex in order for optimal zzso to zzso zzso cells zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells are zzso to these specific zzso zzso of F1 hybrid cells with zzso zzso parental cells result in a zzso effect against only those specific parental cells and not zzso cells from the other zzso The zzso effect of the F1 zzso cells in the zzso zzso test is blocked by the addition of zzso zzso targets that are zzso zzso with the zzso parental strain, but not zzso zzso with the other parental zzso These data demonstrate that the specificity of the zzso cell in this zzso zzso system is directed against altered self zzso products, rather than a requirement for sharing of zzso genes between zzso and target cell in order for zzso to zzso The role of zzso zzso in determining the sensitivity of a target cell to zzso zzso is zzso
