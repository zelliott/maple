The level of serum zzso zzso is inappropriately decreased in cancer patients and has been advocated as the main cause of their zzso In cancer patients, chemotherapy results in a cumulative anemia severe enough to require zzso We investigated the changes in serum EPO, zzso zzso and copper levels in cancer patients receiving zzso There was a weak but significant inverse relationship between zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso serum EPO ratios decline with repeated chemotherapy indicating inadequate EPO response for the degree of zzso There was no difference in the severity of anemia and in the degree of EPO response between zzso and zzso zzso zzso copper, and zzso levels did not change during zzso Our results suggest that the EPO response is inadequate for the degree of anemia and justifies the use of zzso human EPO in cancer patients receiving zzso
