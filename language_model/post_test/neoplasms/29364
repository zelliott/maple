There are currently no guidelines advising long-term surveillance of patients following an acute pulmonary embolism zzso because long-term outcome studies are zzso We investigated the long-term cardiovascular and zzso mortality of a large patient cohort with confirmed zzso in relation to baseline cardiovascular disease zzso 

Clinical details of all patients presenting with acute zzso to a zzso hospital were retrieved from medical records, and their survival tracked from a statewide death zzso There were zzso zzso zzso patients admitted with confirmed zzso from 2000 to zzso During a mean follow-up of zzso years, zzso patients died zzso of whom only 31 zzso died zzso during the index zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cumulative mortality rates were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Annual mortality did not improve over the zzso zzso The zzso mortality of zzso was zzso that of an zzso and zzso general population, being zzso in the youngest zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the oldest zzso zzso zzso Patients with known zzso at baseline had zzso greater zzso mortality than those without zzso and this effect, although at a lower level of risk, remained significant after zzso zzso Of the 332 deaths occurring zzso zzso were attributed to cardiovascular zzso 

In a contemporary adult population, zzso is associated with a substantially increased long-term zzso of which nearly half is zzso Our study highlights the urgent need to develop long-term surveillance strategies in this zzso
