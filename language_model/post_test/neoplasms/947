zzso interactions zzso have been widely studied to understand the biological processes or molecular functions associated with different disease systems like zzso While focused studies on individual zzso have generated valuable information, global and comparative analysis of zzso from different cancer types has not been zzso In this work, we carried out zzso analysis of zzso corresponding to zzso expressed genes from zzso of various tumor zzso zzso to zzso zzso kidney and zzso zzso and compared their associated biological processes and molecular functions (based on Gene zzso zzso We identified a set of processes or functions that are common to all these zzso as well as those that are specific to only one or partial cancer zzso Similarly, protein interaction networks in zzso acid metabolism were compared to identify the zzso clusters of proteins across different cancer zzso Our results provide a basis for further experimental investigations to study protein interaction networks associated with zzso The methodology developed in this work can also be applied to study similar disease zzso
