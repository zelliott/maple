Most new drug development in zzso is based on targeting specific zzso zzso profiles and zzso drug targets vary from patient to patient making new treatments likely to benefit only a subset of patients traditionally grouped in the same clinical zzso zzso zzso are being developed to identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular zzso however, their biological basis is not always zzso The inclusion of zzso patients in a trial is therefore sometimes necessary for a more zzso evaluation of the zzso In this paper, we present a zzso zzso design that includes both zzso and zzso patients in a clinical zzso We formulate a family of prior zzso that represent the degree of a zzso confidence in the zzso zzso To avoid exposing patients to a treatment to which they may not be expected to benefit, we perform an interim analysis that may stop zzso of zzso patients or zzso of all zzso We demonstrate with simulations that the design and zzso used control type I zzso give adequate power, and enable the early futility analysis of zzso patients to be based on prior zzso on the strength of evidence in the zzso
