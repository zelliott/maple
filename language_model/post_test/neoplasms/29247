Although the expression of the zzso zzso class I zzso zzso was first reported to be restricted to the zzso interface on the zzso zzso the distribution of zzso in normal zzso appears broader than originally zzso zzso expression was found in embryonic zzso in adult immune privileged zzso and in cells of the zzso zzso More interestingly, under zzso conditions zzso zzso may be expressed on various types of zzso cells suggesting that zzso zzso expression is one strategy used by tumor cells to escape immune zzso In this article, we will focus on zzso expression in zzso of distinct zzso and its association with the clinical course of diseases, on the underlying molecular mechanisms of impaired zzso zzso on the immune tolerant function of zzso in tumors, and on the use of zzso and soluble zzso as a diagnostic or zzso zzso to identify tumors and to monitor disease stage, as well as on the use of zzso as a novel therapeutic target in zzso
