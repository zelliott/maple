In the 1960s, almost all patients who developed zzso zzso during zzso died; death occurred before blood culture results were available in about 50% of zzso many patients received antibiotics that were, at best, zzso and frequently inactive against the invading zzso In the early 1970s zzso studies demonstrated that more than 50% of zzso zzso were caused by zzso strains which zzso along the zzso canal and caused infection in a limited number of locations, especially the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Surveillance culture studies have demonstrated that among acquired zzso zzso zzso zzso will almost invariably proceed to zzso if the patient becomes profoundly zzso with zzso coli and zzso zzso leading to zzso in only a moderate number of patients and other zzso zzso rarely progressing to zzso despite zzso zzso the leading causes of zzso in the zzso patient are zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further investigations demonstrated that zzso zzso were acquired from hands, food, and water, thus leading to approaches to infection prevention which included careful zzso zzso diet, and attention to water sources, including ice zzso Another basic approach to infection prevention has been to suppress zzso zzso colonizing the zzso canal with oral zzso antibiotics or, more recently and more zzso with agents such as the zzso which, unlike previous regimens, do not zzso suppress the zzso zzso hence maintaining colonization zzso The third basic approach to infection prevention is to improve the host defense factors, principally by a more rapid return of circulating zzso with the use of zzso factors such as zzso zzso factor or zzso zzso zzso As to therapy, the fundamental approach with presumed zzso zzso is the prompt institution of zzso zzso therapy when fever first develops in the setting of zzso There is a short zzso of zzso after which no therapy will be zzso zzso of antibiotics such as a zzso and an zzso are used for multiple reasons: to afford coverage in the event the zzso proves resistant to one of the agents, to afford a synergistic activity thus improving and zzso the serum zzso activity, and to reduce the development of zzso However, patients can be divided into two risk groups: those with zzso and a zzso bone zzso and those with an zzso zzso who will have persistent, profound zzso 100 zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
