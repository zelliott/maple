Assessment of zzso diffusion imaging as a tool for tumor search in primary zzso staging and follow-up after zzso 

The zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso Imaging with zzso Body Signal zzso developed by zzso zzso et zzso was implemented in zzso zzso zzso After measurement of 8 volunteers with a zzso zzso 47 zzso scans were performed on 38 zzso zzso 70 exams were performed on 62 tumor patients with zzso protocols using parallel zzso A total of 64 patients showed zzso zzso in the zzso zzso These zzso were evaluated in terms of visibility and signal intensity in zzso zzso zzso changes which showed high signal intensity in diffusion imaging were recorded in all zzso 

113 of the 125 zzso examinations were judged as technically zzso zzso imaging showed bright signal in the zzso zzso of 58 of the 64 zzso The tumors of 6 patients showed only moderately bright signal or were not discernible at zzso Although partly performed with free breathing of the patients and limited spatial resolution of the zzso zzso with sizes close to zzso were able to be zzso Some of the patients were seen in follow-up examinations and showed signal decrease of their zzso in case of therapy response and signal increase in zzso zzso 

Introduction of zzso imaging provides a new independent zzso in zzso zzso zzso meets the requirements of a fast, robust zzso zzso fat suppression allows the use of maximum intensity projections which may zzso the spread of the disease at first zzso Most of the tumor entities examined in this study showed a bright signal in zzso zzso were some zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although sensitive, visual evaluation of signal intensity alone showed limited zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso structures may be zzso zzso imaging seems to be a sensitive tool in the search for zzso and gastrointestinal zzso
