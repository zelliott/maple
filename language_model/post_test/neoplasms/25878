zzso immune responses against the zzso zzso zzso zzso are frequently observed in patients with zzso expressing zzso This is in contrast to other known tumor zzso zzso defined by zzso or zzso T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso No zzso zzso has been detected in healthy controls and patients with zzso negative zzso In this study, we have assessed the zzso serum zzso response in patients with zzso positive tumors of different zzso types and stages using Western zzso and an zzso Of the 12 patients zzso 10 had zzso zzso zzso at the start of the zzso All patients were followed for changes in zzso zzso zzso during the course of tumor treatment and clinical zzso In 4 patients, an increase of zzso zzso zzso was observed with progression of disease or extensive tumor necrosis under zzso One patient showed a stable zzso zzso zzso over 3 years along with gradual zzso of a large tumor zzso In 5 patients, a decrease of zzso zzso was zzso in 1 patient after zzso tumor zzso in 3 patients with partial zzso of zzso disease under zzso and zzso and in another patient with a zzso negative tumor zzso Our results indicate that the induction and maintenance of zzso zzso is dependent on the presence of zzso expressing zzso Furthermore, changes in zzso zzso zzso correlate with the evolution of zzso positive zzso
