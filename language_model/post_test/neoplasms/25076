zzso zzso therapy zzso of cancer can be advantageous over conventional tumor cell targeted cancer therapy if an appropriate target is zzso Our hypothesis is that zzso zzso zzso is an excellent target in zzso zzso is selectively expressed on vascular and zzso zzso in zzso This allows us to target both zzso zzso and zzso vessels to suppress tumor growth and zzso zzso is essential for zzso development and a zzso of zzso Our studies of selected zzso zzso zzso zzso in several animal models and in zzso studies support our zzso These zzso and/or their zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso of zzso tumors as well as inhibited formation of new zzso In addition, they suppressed zzso Several mechanisms were involved in the zzso activity of the naked zzso zzso zzso These include direct growth suppression of zzso zzso cells, induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and induction of T cell zzso To facilitate clinical application, we generated a zzso zzso zzso zzso termed zzso and performed studies of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in nonhuman zzso No significant toxicity was detected by several criteria and minimal immune response to the zzso part of zzso was detected after multiple zzso zzso The results support our hypothesis that zzso can be safely administered in cancer zzso This hypothesis is supported by the ongoing phase 1 clinical trial of zzso (also known as zzso in patients with advanced or zzso solid cancer in collaboration with zzso zzso and several zzso zzso
