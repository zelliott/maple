It is well established that the metabolically active form of vitamin D, zzso D3 zzso plays a key role in the establishment and maintenance of the calcium metabolism in the zzso In addition to this classic effect of zzso substantial evidence has emerged demonstrating that zzso is able to regulate cell growth and differentiation in a number of different cell types, including cancer zzso However, the clinical usefulness of zzso is limited by its tendency to cause zzso Much effort has therefore been directed to identifying new vitamin D zzso with potent cell regulatory effects, but with weaker effects on the calcium metabolism than those of zzso One of these new synthetic zzso is zzso zzso zzso Despite being zzso times more potent than zzso with respect to regulation of cell growth and differentiation in zzso as well as in zzso zzso zzso displays a reduced zzso activity in zzso compared to that of zzso zzso These characteristics make zzso zzso a potentially useful compound for the treatment of zzso Recent clinical evaluation of zzso zzso has focused mainly on establishing a maximum tolerated dose in cancer zzso Early results confirm that the low zzso activity observed in animals can be reproduced in the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso has been shown to induce zzso of zzso especially in zzso zzso where complete zzso has been zzso In conclusion, the development of zzso zzso as an zzso drug holds zzso However, its final evaluation must await the completion of ongoing controlled clinical zzso
