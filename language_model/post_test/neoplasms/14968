The zzso zzso zzso plays a significant role in the structure and function of the zzso The zzso is a three-dimensional zzso mesh, comprised of various interconnected and zzso zzso among which are the zzso zzso zzso are long, linear and highly charged, zzso zzso that are composed of a variable number of repeating zzso units zzso zzso and most of them, as their name implies, have a sweet zzso In the zzso zzso support the structure of the zzso the zzso tissue and the zzso walls, and are zzso in the airway zzso Besides maintaining lung tissue structure, zzso also play an important role in lung function as they regulate zzso and water zzso zzso the inflammatory response and influence lung tissue repair and zzso However, depending on their size and/or degree of zzso and their zzso or zzso in the zzso specific zzso in the lung either live up to their sweet zzso supporting normal lung zzso or they are associated to zzso effects, related to lung zzso The present review discusses the biological role of zzso in the lung as well as the involvement of these molecules in various respiratory zzso Given the great structural diversity of zzso understanding the changes in zzso expression that occur in lung diseases may lead to novel targets for pharmacological intervention in order to prevent and/or to treat a range of lung zzso
