zzso infections caused by zzso other than zzso zzso and zzso have been reported sporadically in patients with leukemia and zzso bone zzso transplantation zzso However, the significance of lower respiratory tract cultures that are positive for these zzso zzso in an zzso population of patients with cancer remains zzso 

The authors evaluated the significance of respiratory specimens positive for zzso zzso in patients with cancer using the criteria set by the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer zzso Study Group zzso They included the diagnostic category of indeterminate pulmonary invasive mold infection zzso for cases that met the criteria for probable zzso but had other pathogens zzso isolated from the respiratory zzso 

zzso cases with at least 1 positive culture were identified in 79 zzso Two cases were proven zzso 29 were indeterminate zzso 5 were possible zzso and 49 were no zzso All 38 cases from patients with solid tumors represented colonization compared with only 11 of the 47 cases zzso from high-risk patients zzso zzso zzso The positive zzso value zzso of cultures was zzso in patients with solid tumors and ranged from zzso to zzso depending on the zzso model used, in high-risk patients with leukemia and recipients of zzso zzso positive for zzso zzso had a higher zzso zzso than did cultures positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso criteria may be required for the diagnosis of invasive infections caused by zzso zzso especially zzso zzso in patients with zzso
