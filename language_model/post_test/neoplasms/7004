zzso amplification and zzso zzso which are commonly detected in human zzso have been implicated in the induction of zzso instability in zzso The functions of these two structures are closely related to DNA damage repair machinery, and some factors that operate in the maintenance of zzso also take part in the regulation of zzso status, suggesting they are functionally zzso We report that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso is distributed in the zzso throughout the cell cycle, but its transport into the zzso is increased under some conditions, and its distribution is dependent on its zzso zzso Experimental zzso of zzso expression through zzso zzso expression or depletion affected zzso status and increased abnormalities of cell zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso was also zzso by treatment with zzso agents and experimental zzso dysfunction, accompanying zzso zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that the expression level of zzso is not only closely correlated with zzso amplification in soft tissue zzso but it is also significantly related to tumor zzso zzso Our data confirmed zzso functions as a zzso zzso Its participation in DNA damage response, including zzso dysfunction and zzso indicates zzso is likely to be a factor involved in linking zzso amplification and zzso dysfunction in cancer zzso
