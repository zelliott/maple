This brief overview outlines the fundamental principles of flow zzso with emphasis on DNA zzso and cell cycle analysis in human solid zzso Type of material used, sampling processing procedures and methods of analysis of data are zzso DNA zzso and zzso activity zzso zzso are the two biological parameters commonly measured by DNA flow zzso zzso The prime purpose of most studies in this area is the investigation of the zzso value of DNA flow zzso in addition to the information provided by conventional zzso factors known to affect disease zzso Numerous studies concerning the zzso significance of DNA flow zzso in some types of solid tumors are reviewed in this zzso The general statement, for tumors in the same zzso stage of the disease, is that zzso and/or low zzso tumors have a more zzso prognosis than zzso and/or high zzso tumors, suggesting an important role of DNA flow zzso in the assessment of tumor zzso and in the outcome evaluation of the zzso However, in some studies this association could not be substantiated, and the zzso relevance of DNA analysis has been zzso The potential reasons for conflicting results, namely the zzso pitfalls related to the cell preparation techniques and the zzso interpretation are zzso
