Loss of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been observed in several human zzso The zzso function of zzso has been attributed to its ability to induce growth arrest, cellular zzso and zzso Here we identify zzso as a critical inhibitor of zzso (the formation of new blood zzso in zzso in both zzso and zzso conditions, through the control of protein zzso We demonstrate that in hypoxic conditions zzso acts as a negative regulator of the synthesis rate of zzso factor zzso zzso by zzso zzso target of zzso zzso zzso physically interacts with zzso and zzso regulates its association with the small zzso zzso by zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso display higher sensitivity both in zzso and in zzso to growth zzso by zzso and lack of zzso zzso zzso with zzso of zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso in mouse and human zzso Thus, our findings identify zzso as a novel zzso of zzso and zzso
