Although tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso is a potent zzso with a myriad of innate immune zzso properties, systemic administration of zzso is associated with significant zzso limiting the use of the zzso protein as an zzso zzso On the basis of the knowledge that zzso cells zzso play a central role in initiating zzso zzso immune responses, we hypothesized that zzso administration of low doses of an zzso zzso zzso zzso together with zzso zzso would act zzso to suppress zzso zzso As a model, four different tumor cell lines, all resistant in zzso to the zzso zzso were implanted in zzso mice, and established tumors received zzso zzso alone or in combination with zzso At high doses zzso zzso zzso alone suppressed tumor growth, but was associated with systemic zzso A zzso lower zzso concentration zzso zzso or high doses of the control zzso zzso had no systemic zzso but also minimal suppression of tumor zzso In contrast, local administration of the low dose zzso zzso of zzso in combination with zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso marked tumor suppression without zzso Administration of zzso + zzso into tumors zzso zzso zzso T cells and protected animals against subsequent challenge with the same zzso suggesting that zzso + DC therapy induced zzso zzso immune host zzso zzso with this concept, studies with zzso knockout mice showed that zzso class I molecules on zzso as well as zzso T cells were necessary for the zzso effect of zzso zzso + zzso These data demonstrate that the combination of zzso administration of the zzso zzso together with zzso zzso can evoke tumor suppression without systemic zzso providing a new paradigm for the use of zzso as zzso zzso
