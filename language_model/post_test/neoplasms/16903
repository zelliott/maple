We have treated 14 cancer patients with zzso zzso zzso at doses of 30, 45, 60, and 90 zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were minimal or absent at each dose, but zzso zzso occurred at 90 zzso zzso and/or anemia also occurred in all patients treated at 60 or 90 zzso Complete zzso was seen in one of three cases at 60 zzso and all cases at 90 zzso No zzso zzso or other major organ zzso were zzso Clinical cardiac toxicity did not occur in any patient, but the cumulative zzso doses in 13 cases were less than 400 zzso The plasma elimination of LED out to 24 hours was analyzed in terms of a zzso zzso Depending upon the dose and the infusion time, maximum plasma zzso ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and the area under the plasma concentration zzso time curve zzso values ranged from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso These values are significantly higher than those expected for free zzso zzso zzso of LED was approximately zzso after 24 zzso zzso and zzso appeared at low levels in plasma 12 to 24 hours after zzso LED zzso differ from those of free drug by the higher plasma levels and zzso of zzso zzso and by the low conversion of LED to zzso Overall, LED was well tolerated and produced only moderate zzso and vomiting and little zzso at zzso zzso The study also suggested that LED produces less zzso sclerosis than free zzso but this requires further clinical zzso
