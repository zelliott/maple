zzso cells take up zzso in peripheral zzso process them into zzso zzso and load these peptides onto major zzso complex zzso class I and II zzso zzso cells then migrate to secondary zzso zzso and become competent to present zzso to T zzso thus initiating zzso immune responses, or zzso zzso zzso presentation in zzso cells is finely zzso zzso zzso zzso transport and degradation, and the traffic of zzso molecules are different in zzso cells as compared to other zzso zzso These zzso account for zzso zzso unique role in the initiation of immune responses and the induction of zzso
