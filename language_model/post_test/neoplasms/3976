The zzso of gene function has always been an intensive subject of zzso Recent advances in the synthesis and chemistry of zzso have now made these molecules important tools to study and identify gene function and zzso zzso of gene expression using zzso has been targeted at different levels of the cellular zzso zzso forming zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso have been used to inhibit gene expression at the level of zzso after binding of these specific zzso zzso change of the zzso zzso structure prevents any further zzso interactions necessary for efficient zzso Gene regulation can also be achieved by targeting the translation of zzso zzso zzso have been used to zzso zzso expression by zzso to specific and determined region of an zzso thus zzso its translation by the cellular zzso The exact mechanism of this type of zzso is still under intense investigation and is thought to be related to the zzso of zzso zzso a zzso that is widely available that can cleave the zzso duplex, thus making it zzso Another zzso means of interfering with the translation of zzso is the use of zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that possess both site specificity and zzso capability for an zzso zzso zzso any further protein zzso This review describes how these different zzso can be used to define gene function and discusses in detail their chemical structure, mechanism of action, advantages and zzso and their zzso
