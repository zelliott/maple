zzso recipients, who have a high risk of developing zzso are deficient in natural killer cells which mediate natural zzso against zzso zzso We evaluated the relevance of zzso zzso in transplant patients with regard to the natural zzso of human zzso zzso 

Target cells were ex zzso zzso cells, obtained from solid zzso from kidney transplant patients and zzso zzso zzso blood was extracted from kidney recipients and from normal zzso zzso cells were separated after zzso and zzso zzso to obtain zzso and T cell zzso zzso cells were obtained by in zzso zzso For each zzso natural zzso zzso were performed to compare zzso cells from a kidney recipient with those from a normal zzso zzso solid zzso either zzso or zzso were zzso mainly consisting of zzso zzso and skin zzso 

Natural zzso zzso on zzso targets confirmed the expected zzso zzso in the kidney zzso However, the zzso and zzso cells from the kidney recipients did not kill a smaller number of zzso target cells than the controls, whatever the zzso type, under both the zzso and zzso zzso 

We conclude that natural zzso against human zzso cells cannot be zzso from the zzso zzso with established cell lines, and that natural zzso of ex zzso human zzso cells is not impaired in transplant zzso
