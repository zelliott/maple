We studied several in zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso and soluble zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and in the serum of advanced stage cancer zzso Comparisons were made with zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso zzso were compared with zzso from normal subjects used as zzso zzso were collected from 13 zzso and 18 zzso zzso zzso secondary to primary tumors of different zzso After zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso alpha in culture media of zzso both from zzso and zzso zzso were lower than those of zzso zzso and, similarly, zzso of zzso and zzso in culture media of zzso from zzso zzso were lower than those of zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso and zzso in culture media of zzso from zzso zzso were in the same range as those of zzso zzso On the contrary, zzso zzso and zzso gamma amounts zzso from zzso zzso were significantly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha production from patient zzso was lower than that of control zzso whereas production of zzso zzso and zzso gamma was higher than that of control zzso Both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso were not different from those measured in zzso serum, whereas those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gamma and zzso were significantly zzso The amounts of zzso in zzso zzso were not different from those of zzso serum, but in zzso zzso they were higher than those of zzso zzso The amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso were higher in patient than in control zzso whereas those of zzso zzso and zzso gamma were in the same range in patient and in control zzso Cell cycle analysis of cultured zzso and zzso (from 3 zzso showed a significant zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso cell population compared with zzso zzso
