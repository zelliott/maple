A modified technique has been developed for the zzso of the zzso in human zzso The zzso analysis of 129 zzso human zzso zzso of 6 normal donors showed an zzso of structural and zzso zzso abnormalities of zzso Two out of 129 zzso were zzso zzso The frequency of zzso with zzso aberrations was zzso zzso zzso aberrations were found in 5 out of 129 zzso zzso X to Y ratio did not differ significantly from the expected zzso zzso Twenty-six zzso zzso from a patient zzso months after zzso exposure to 30 zzso were zzso A significant increase of zzso and structural zzso abnormalities was not zzso zzso aberrations were found in two zzso zzso zzso and zzso aberrations in one zzso complement zzso The zzso analysis of 15 human zzso from a cancer patient 26 months after chemotherapy showed an increased frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso One zzso zzso three zzso aberrations zzso and one zzso zzso zzso complement could be zzso The sample size is still too small to answer the question whether chemical zzso may increase the frequency of zzso abnormalities in human zzso
