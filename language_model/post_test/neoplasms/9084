zzso zzso kinetic analysis directly measures molecular interactions at zzso zzso thereby incorporating inherent cellular zzso By comparison, three-dimensional zzso analysis zzso the intrinsic physical chemistry of interacting molecules isolated from the zzso To understand how zzso tumor zzso relates to zzso and zzso binding parameters and to directly compare them, we performed kinetic analyses of a panel of human zzso receptors zzso interacting with a melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso ) bound to zzso zzso complex in the absence and presence of zzso zzso We found that while zzso parameters are inadequate to predict zzso function, zzso parameters zzso do not correlate with their zzso zzso show a far broader dynamic range and significantly improved correlation with zzso zzso Thus, our data support the general notion that zzso parameters of zzso zzso zzso interactions determine zzso responsiveness and suggest a potential zzso strategy to screen zzso for tumor zzso
