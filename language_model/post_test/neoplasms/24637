zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso I inhibitor with broad clinical activity in zzso zzso cancer and other zzso The development of an oral zzso of zzso could enhance convenience and zzso the expense of zzso zzso zzso This phase I study evaluated the zzso zzso zzso maximum tolerated dose zzso and zzso zzso of zzso given as a zzso capsule zzso daily for 5 days every 3 zzso 

Patients with advanced solid tumors received escalating doses of oral zzso daily for 5 days every 3 zzso Plasma samples were collected following the first and fifth doses of zzso during zzso 1 to determine the zzso of zzso and its major circulating zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

20 patients zzso age zzso years, range zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso received oral zzso at dose levels of 30 zzso 40 zzso 50 zzso and 60 zzso zzso Of the eight patients enrolled at 60 zzso three patients experienced zzso zzso or zzso grade 3) consisting of zzso (three zzso vomiting (three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for which all the three patients required zzso Treatment of six patients at the zzso dose level resulted in no zzso Other zzso observed include abdominal pain, zzso zzso and zzso After oral administration, zzso was rapidly absorbed into systemic circulation and converted to the active zzso zzso zzso dose levels resulted in a zzso increase in mean exposure parameters zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso exposure parameters zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso were comparable between days 1 and zzso The extent of conversion from zzso to zzso was approximately zzso higher after the oral administration compared to that previously observed after zzso zzso The exposure parameters of zzso or zzso are of limited value in predicting severity of zzso 1 zzso in the twofold dose range zzso 

Daily oral administration of zzso as the zzso zzso for 5 days every 3 weeks can safely deliver protracted exposure to zzso with the zzso of 50 zzso
