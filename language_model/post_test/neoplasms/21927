Although definitions of zzso care include quality of life as a central concern, little research has been published about both the quality of life of patients with advanced illness and their family members, and particularly the changes in their quality of life over zzso 

The aims of this prospective zzso pilot study were to: zzso establish the reliability of zzso quality of life instruments based on patients with acquired immune zzso syndrome zzso and patients with cancer and zzso zzso identify differences in quality of life between patients with advanced AIDS and cancer, and their family zzso with consideration of zzso attrition, and compliance zzso and zzso examine differences in demographic variables and their potential zzso effect when measuring quality of zzso 

The sample included 101 patients with advanced illness zzso patients with advanced AIDS and 38 with advanced zzso and 81 family zzso zzso zzso for patients with AIDS and 38 zzso for patients with zzso Data collection involved the monthly completion of the McGill Quality of Life zzso zzso for patients, and the Quality of Life zzso zzso for family zzso 

zzso of the zzso and zzso were established for patients with AIDS and patients with cancer and zzso Based on the zzso patients with advanced AIDS reported a lower total quality of life, and lower psychological quality of life, and a higher physical quality of life compared to patients with advanced zzso There were no significant differences between patient groups on the zzso physical well-being zzso or the existential well-being, and support zzso Based on the zzso AIDS zzso reported greater overall quality of life, greater psychological well-being, and greater spiritual zzso zzso than cancer zzso There were no significant differences between AIDS and cancer zzso with respect to physical or social zzso From baseline entry into the study to third month of zzso there were no significant changes in total quality of life scores for patient or caregiver groups, although trends indicated a moderately high total quality of life over time for all patient and caregiver zzso Fourteen of 63 zzso patients with AIDS patients died, while 19 of 38 zzso patients with advanced cancer died after zzso zzso of 63 zzso patients with advanced AIDS withdrew for various reasons other than death at some point during the 12 month time frame of the study, while 15 of 38 zzso patients with advanced cancer zzso There were significant differences on all demographic variables for patients with advanced cancer and zzso Only religious affiliation was significantly related to quality of life for patients with zzso while gender was the only variable associated with quality of life for patients with zzso There were significant differences on all demographic variables between zzso with the exception of gender and living zzso Only the relationship between patients and zzso and marital status were significantly associated with quality of life for cancer zzso 

In zzso care research, the challenge is to design studies that will capture changes in the zzso of quality of life over time, yet will minimize participant burden and subsequent attrition zzso By measuring quality of life as an outcome variable in zzso care, health professionals can identify changes in the zzso of quality of life over time for various patient populations and their family zzso and respond with appropriate interventions, which promote or maintain their quality of life even as death zzso
