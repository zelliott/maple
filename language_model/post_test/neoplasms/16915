Since the zzso a small number of researchers have been quite regularly zzso highly zzso bacteria from the blood and tumors of humans and animals with zzso These bacteria show characteristics of cell wall deficient bacteria, and can apparently be observed regularly in the blood of cancer patients by zzso zzso Cancer appears to be induced by injecting these bacteria into experimental animals, and some forms of cancer can be prevented by zzso with killed bacteria, isolated from experimental animals affected with the specific zzso The bacteria regularly produce a protein zzso zzso zzso hormone, a substance which appears to protect zzso and cancer cells from immune zzso There is some evidence that a zzso may be responsible for this property, and even that these bacteria may in some manner be intimately associated with zzso Further studies are proposed to clarify the role these bacteria play in zzso
