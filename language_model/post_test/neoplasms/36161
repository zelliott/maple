zzso zzso zzso may be a harbinger of zzso zzso zzso disease zzso is known to increase the risk of zzso but it is unclear whether zzso in zzso patients is also a marker for zzso zzso We assessed the risk of cancer after zzso in zzso zzso 

We conducted a zzso cohort study by linking Danish medical zzso during zzso We calculated standardized zzso ratios zzso by comparing observed cancer zzso after zzso in zzso patients with that expected based on national cancer zzso in the Danish zzso 

A total of zzso zzso patients with zzso were followed for a total of zzso zzso During the first year of zzso 28 zzso patients were diagnosed with cancer, corresponding to an zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso colitis or Crohn's disease had similar relative risks zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso patients zzso years the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in patients zzso years the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During the second and subsequent years of follow-up 61 zzso were diagnosed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In patients with zzso a zzso event is not only a consequence of their disease, but might also be a marker of zzso zzso We suggest that zzso patients with zzso should follow the same diagnostic zzso guidelines as zzso zzso zzso
