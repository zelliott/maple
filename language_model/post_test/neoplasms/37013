To diagnose zzso with zzso zzso acid using zzso zzso zzso we have constructed a separation and zzso system for the production of zzso zzso This system could provide zzso and consistent production of zzso zzso was zzso and zzso and the efficiency of the system was zzso The zzso yield of zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 5) based on the zzso trapped in the reaction zzso The zzso purity was greater than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso stability in zzso saline and human plasma was examined and little decomposition was observed by zzso zzso Our results indicate that the separation and zzso system gave simple and quick synthesis of zzso with a large reduction in radiation exposure and consistent production of zzso
