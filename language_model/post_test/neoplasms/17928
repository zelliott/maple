Since the discovery of circulating zzso acids in plasma in 1948, many diagnostic applications have zzso For example, diagnostic and zzso zzso of circulating zzso DNA have been demonstrated for many types of zzso The parallel development of zzso DNA detection in maternal plasma has opened up the possibility of zzso prenatal diagnosis and monitoring of many zzso zzso In this regard, zzso fetal zzso blood group zzso has already been translated to clinical zzso Other applications of circulating DNA in zzso and transplant monitoring have also been zzso The more recent discoveries of circulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso have proven to be equally important as their DNA zzso zzso prenatal diagnosis of zzso syndrome by fetal zzso analysis has recently been zzso However, the zzso origin and release mechanisms of circulating zzso acids have remained incompletely zzso with cell death being suggested to be associated with such zzso acid zzso zzso zzso will become increasingly relevant when comparing data from different zzso In conclusion, studies of circulating zzso acids have promised exciting developments in molecular zzso in the years to zzso
