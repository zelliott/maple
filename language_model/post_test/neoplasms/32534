Four approaches to zzso a zzso model for relative survival using the method of maximum likelihood are described and zzso The underlying model is an additive hazards model where the total hazard is written as the sum of the known baseline hazard and the excess hazard associated with a diagnosis of zzso The excess hazards are assumed to be constant within zzso bands of zzso The likelihood can be zzso directly or in the framework of generalized linear zzso Minor differences exist due to, for example, the way the data are presented zzso zzso or zzso and in some assumptions zzso zzso zzso The four approaches are applied to two real data sets and produce very similar estimates even when the assumption of zzso excess hazards is zzso The choice of approach to use in practice can, therefore, be guided by ease of use and availability of zzso We recommend using a generalized linear model with a zzso error structure based on collapsed data using exact survival zzso The model can be estimated in any software package that estimates zzso with zzso link functions (including zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso the theory of generalized linear models for assessing zzso and studying zzso zzso
