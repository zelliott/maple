zzso 1 zzso is a regulator of the zzso system and is involved in various signaling zzso It interacts with many zzso and nuclear zzso The importance of zzso for human tissue differentiation has been demonstrated by the findings that human cancer cells, expressing conspicuously low zzso levels, adopt a zzso zzso upon raising their zzso zzso In the present study, we characterize the zzso binding site crucial for zzso tumor zzso zzso Starting with zzso a human breast cancer cell line highly zzso in nude mice, we established stable clones that express zzso zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso with reduced binding to either zzso zzso or zzso but with a functional zzso binding site, were normal in growth, zzso and zzso zzso with only a weak tendency to elicit tumors in nude mice, similar to controls expressing zzso zzso In contrast, clones expressing a zzso with severely reduced capacity to bind zzso still behaved like the parental zzso and were highly zzso We conclude that the zzso binding site on zzso is instrumental for normal differentiation of human zzso and the tumor zzso function of zzso
