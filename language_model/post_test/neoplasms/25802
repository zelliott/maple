Published fatigue theories and research describing patients' zzso strategies and the efficacy of interventions for the management of zzso 

zzso is a pervasive problem for patients with zzso Without guidance, patients adopt common-sense strategies that generally prove unsuccessful in alleviating zzso zzso that identify zzso actions that can reduce fatigue are becoming increasingly zzso A small number of strategies, most notably exercise, has been zzso Other zzso zzso and zzso been tested to a lesser zzso The theoretical foundations of these experimental studies frequently are zzso However, primary evidence is favorable and supports further zzso 

zzso approaches frequently fail to reduce fatigue in patients with zzso Alternative approaches based on the growing body of theoretical and research evidence should be zzso 

Patients require guidance in managing zzso zzso Nurses need to develop and evaluate relief zzso zzso research programs based on sound theoretical zzso and previous research will contribute to the growing body of evidence to aid future management of this troublesome zzso
