zzso is vital for solid tumor growth, and its prevention is a proven strategy for the treatment of disease states such as zzso The vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso provides several opportunities by which small molecules can act as zzso of zzso proliferation and zzso Critical to these processes is signaling through zzso or the zzso insert domain zzso zzso upon stimulation by its zzso zzso zzso we report the discovery of zzso as zzso of intrinsic zzso activity zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso and human zzso vein zzso cell zzso proliferation with zzso 50 zzso zzso zzso More specifically, compound 16 was identified as a potent zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso 4 zzso and selective inhibitor that exhibited efficacy in zzso in zzso zzso In addition, this series of molecules is typically zzso orally, further demonstrating the zzso zzso as a promising platform for generating zzso zzso therapeutic zzso
