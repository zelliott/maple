zzso therapy zzso is widely used for controlling zzso symptoms and has also been used for the management and prevention of cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis and zzso in older zzso This is an updated version of a Cochrane review first published in zzso 

To assess the effects of long term zzso on zzso cardiovascular zzso cancer, gallbladder disease, fractures, zzso and quality of life in zzso and zzso women, both during zzso use and after zzso of zzso zzso 

We searched the following databases to February zzso Cochrane zzso Disorders and zzso Group Trials zzso Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We included zzso zzso studies of zzso versus zzso taken for at least one year by zzso or zzso zzso zzso included zzso with or without zzso via zzso zzso subcutaneous or zzso zzso 

Two authors independently assessed study quality and extracted zzso We calculated risk ratios zzso for zzso data and mean differences zzso for continuous data, with zzso confidence intervals zzso Where findings were statistically zzso we calculated the absolute risk zzso in the intervention group (the overall risk of an event in women taking zzso 

zzso studies involving zzso women were zzso zzso per cent of the data were derived from two studies zzso 1998 and zzso zzso Most participants were zzso American women with at least some degree of zzso and the mean participant age in most studies was over 60 zzso None of the studies focused on zzso zzso In relatively healthy zzso women zzso is generally fit, without overt disease) combined continuous zzso significantly increased the risk of a coronary event (after one year's zzso zzso 4 per zzso zzso zzso 3 to zzso zzso zzso (after one year's zzso zzso 7 per zzso zzso zzso 4 to zzso stroke (after three years' zzso zzso 18 per zzso zzso zzso 14 to 23), breast cancer (after zzso years' zzso zzso 23 per zzso zzso zzso 19 to 29), gallbladder disease (after zzso years' zzso zzso 27 per zzso zzso zzso 21 to 34) and death from lung cancer (after zzso years' use plus zzso years' additional zzso zzso 9 per zzso zzso zzso 6 to zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the risk of zzso zzso (after one to two years' zzso zzso 5 per zzso zzso zzso 2 to 10; after 7 years' zzso zzso 21 per zzso zzso zzso 16 to zzso stroke (after 7 years' zzso zzso 32 per zzso zzso zzso 25 to 40) and gallbladder disease (after seven years' zzso zzso 45 per zzso zzso zzso 36 to zzso but did not significantly increase the risk of breast zzso Among women aged over 65 years who were relatively healthy and taking continuous combined zzso there was a statistically significant increase in the zzso of zzso (after 4 years' zzso zzso 18 per zzso zzso zzso 11 to zzso Among women with cardiovascular disease, long term use of combined continuous zzso significantly increased the risk of zzso zzso (at one year: zzso 9 per zzso zzso zzso 3 to zzso Women taking zzso had a significantly decreased zzso of fractures with long term use (after zzso years of combined zzso zzso 86 per zzso zzso zzso 79 to zzso after zzso years' use of zzso zzso zzso 102 per zzso zzso zzso 91 to zzso zzso of fracture was the only outcome for which there was strong evidence of clinical benefit from zzso There was no strong evidence that zzso has a clinically meaningful impact on the zzso of zzso zzso trial zzso zzso of zzso relatively healthy 50 to 59 year old women taking combined continuous zzso and zzso taking zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso The only significantly increased risk reported was for zzso zzso in women taking combined continuous zzso their absolute risk remained low, at less than zzso However, other differences in risk cannot be excluded as this study was not designed to have the power to detect differences between groups of women within 10 years of the zzso 

zzso is not indicated for primary or secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease or zzso nor for preventing deterioration of cognitive function in zzso zzso Although zzso is considered effective for the prevention of zzso zzso it is generally recommended as an option only for women at significant risk, for whom zzso therapies are zzso There are insufficient data to assess the risk of long term zzso use in zzso women or zzso women younger than 50 years of zzso
