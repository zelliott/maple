Since its original cloning by zzso zzso in 2002, it is now evident that zzso elevated zzso zzso is a key contributor to the zzso process in diverse zzso zzso protein expression is elevated in advanced stages of many zzso which zzso with poor zzso In specific zzso such as breast and liver cancer, the zzso gene itself is zzso further supporting a seminal role in zzso zzso and zzso studies both in in zzso and in in zzso models reveal the importance of zzso in regulating multiple zzso and zzso relevant processes including zzso invasion, zzso and gene zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein with multiple nuclear zzso signals and no known zzso or zzso Although pertinent roles of zzso in the zzso process are established, its potential function zzso of zzso only versus functioning as a bona fide zzso as well as zzso zzso surface versus zzso remain areas requiring further zzso The present review critically evaluates what is currently known about zzso and provides new perspectives relative to this intriguing zzso that may provide a rational target for intervening in the cancer zzso
