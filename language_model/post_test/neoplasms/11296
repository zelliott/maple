zzso is a frequent property of cancer cells that arises as a consequence of zzso instability zzso A major safeguard mechanism protecting cells from zzso is the zzso assembly zzso This checkpoint surveys proper attachment of zzso to the zzso zzso and effectively suppresses erroneous zzso segregation by delaying zzso progression until proper zzso interactions have been zzso Several lines of evidence suggest that the development of zzso may be a gradual process that in many cases could result from subtle zzso checkpoint defects that occur during zzso and steadily weaken zzso checkpoint zzso Here we discuss the evidence for this concept and address the question whether normal zzso cells and tumor cells could perhaps exhibit differences in zzso checkpoint regulation that allow the design of more specific zzso strategies that effectively kill tumor cells but spare normal zzso
