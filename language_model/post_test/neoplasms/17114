zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging routinely performed for cancer follow-up provides valuable information on body zzso The influence of body composition on outcomes and the occurrence of zzso can therefore be explored in cancer zzso This review describes recent findings regarding the zzso impact of skeletal muscle mass zzso on chemotherapy zzso 

The higher risk of toxicity associated with low zzso zzso zzso was first described for zzso chemotherapy toxicity in colon cancer patients before being increasingly zzso not only in the case of body surface zzso chemotherapy in breast cancer but also in various zzso treated with targeted zzso The underlying mechanisms are still being zzso zzso could act on zzso parameters and/or zzso patients could be more susceptible to adverse medical events including chemotherapy zzso 

Evidence for a strong link between zzso and chemotherapy toxicity is zzso zzso may not be the only body composition zzso zzso Muscle function assessed by measuring muscle density and the zzso could be of zzso The ultimate purpose is to better identify patients at higher risk of toxicity and to reduce toxicity through body zzso zzso
