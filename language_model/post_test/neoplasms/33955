Due to the optional sampling effect in a sequential design, the maximum likelihood zzso zzso following sequential tests is generally zzso In a typical zzso design employed in a phase II clinical trial in cancer drug zzso a fixed number of patients are enrolled zzso The trial may be terminated for lack of clinical efficacy of treatment if the observed number of treatment responses after the first stage is too zzso Otherwise, an additional fixed number of patients are enrolled to accumulate additional information on efficacy as well as on zzso There have been numerous suggestions for design of such zzso zzso Here we establish that under the zzso design the sufficient zzso zzso stopping stage and the number of treatment responses, for the zzso of the zzso distribution is also zzso Then, based on the zzso zzso we derive the zzso minimum zzso unbiased zzso zzso as the conditional expectation of an unbiased zzso which in this case is simply the maximum likelihood zzso based only on the first stage data, given the complete sufficient zzso Our results zzso to a zzso zzso We will illustrate features of the zzso based on zzso phase II clinical trial design examples and present results of zzso studies on the properties of the zzso in comparison to the usual zzso
