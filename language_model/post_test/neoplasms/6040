The key components of zzso syndrome zzso are waist zzso blood pressure, fast blood zzso high density zzso cholesterol zzso and zzso zzso These components have, separately and zzso been associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular zzso In this study, we aimed to explore the association between zzso components and cancer risk in a zzso cohort in zzso 

We established a zzso cohort with 17 zzso individuals aged 35 and above at baseline in 2004 and 2005 in zzso zzso Province, zzso All participants were face-to-face interviewed to complete a questionnaire and were accepted physical examinations including blood tests for zzso and lipids and physical zzso for obesity and blood zzso In 2009, a total of 16 zzso subjects zzso men and zzso women, zzso attended the zzso interviews and the participants or their family members reported all the zzso and diseases including cancer occurred during the follow-up zzso zzso Cox zzso was used to estimate the hazard ratios zzso of zzso syndrome components and cancer zzso 

There was a zzso association between cancer risk and the number of zzso components presented at baseline zzso for trend zzso zzso and the zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso was zzso zzso - zzso for subjects carrying 3 or more zzso syndrome components after adjustment for possible zzso zzso Specifically, the zzso zzso zzso for cancer risk in subjects with central zzso high zzso zzso low zzso were zzso zzso - zzso zzso zzso - zzso and zzso zzso - zzso zzso 

In this zzso prospective cohort study in China, we found zzso zzso zzso central zzso high zzso zzso low zzso were risk factors for cancer zzso Early intervention of zzso components may be also beneficial to reduce cancer zzso
