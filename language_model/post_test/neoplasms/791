Gold zzso zzso exhibit a unique phenomenon, known as surface zzso zzso which is responsible for their large zzso and scattering zzso which are four to five orders of magnitude larger than those of conventional zzso In addition, their optical properties can be controlled by varying their sizes, shapes and zzso zzso can be easily zzso and zzso with different zzso including zzso Numerous methods have been zzso for detecting zzso such as zzso zzso fluorescence, zzso zzso scattering and zzso zzso These unique aspects have permitted the development of novel zzso zzso for molecular zzso which promise increased sensitivity and zzso zzso zzso and short turnaround zzso zzso zzso zzso in particular show great potential in zzso testing zzso This review discusses properties of zzso and their zzso for the development of novel molecular zzso
