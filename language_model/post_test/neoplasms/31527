This study investigated the associations between specific zzso and occupational exposure to zzso aromatic zzso zzso zzso electromagnetic fields, and heat in a cohort of workers from a Norwegian aluminum zzso 

Cancer zzso between 1953 and 1993 was observed for zzso male short-term workers and 2 zzso of men with at least 4 years' employment zzso production workers and zzso maintenance zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso were calculated from the national male cancer zzso and associations with cumulative exposure were investigated by zzso zzso zzso exposure in 15-year time windows was used as an alternative dose zzso 

Investigation of the a zzso hypotheses in the production cohort revealed a positive association between zzso cancer and zzso exposure 30 years or more before zzso The results also suggested an association between zzso and pancreatic cancer, although not statistically zzso No association was seen between exposure to zzso and zzso of the lungs or between magnetic field exposure and zzso and zzso zzso In the maintenance cohort there was a positive association between employment as an electrician and zzso and zzso cancer and a statistically zzso association between zzso and lung zzso The short-term workers showed a statistically significant excess of lung zzso 

The results support previous findings of an association between exposure to zzso and zzso zzso
