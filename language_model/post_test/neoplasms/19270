In this paper, we focus discussion on testing the zzso of risk difference for sparse data, in which we have few patients in each zzso but a moderate or large number of zzso When the number of patients per treatment within strata is small (2 to 5 zzso none of test procedures proposed previously for testing the zzso of risk difference for sparse data can really perform zzso On the basis of zzso methods, we develop a simple test procedure that can improve the power of the previous test zzso Using zzso Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the test procedure developed here can perform reasonable well with respect to Type I error even when the number of patients per stratum for each treatment is as small as two zzso We evaluate and study the power of the proposed test procedure in a variety of zzso We also include a comparison of the performance between the test statistics proposed elsewhere and the test procedure developed zzso Finally, we briefly discuss the limitation of using the proposed test zzso We use the data comparing two chemotherapy treatments in patients with multiple myeloma to illustrate the use of the proposed test zzso
