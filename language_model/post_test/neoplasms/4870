Spinal zzso body radiation therapy zzso is increasingly used to manage spinal zzso yet the zzso effectiveness in controlling the symptom burden of spinal zzso has not been well zzso We investigated the clinical benefit of zzso for managing spinal zzso and reducing zzso zzso 

149 patients with mechanically stable, zzso spinal zzso (166 zzso were given zzso in a phase 1-2 zzso Patients received a total dose of zzso zzso typically in three zzso zzso were measured before zzso and at several time points up to 6 months after treatment, by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the M D Anderson zzso zzso zzso The primary zzso was frequency and duration of complete pain zzso The study is completed and is registered with zzso number zzso 

Median follow-up was zzso months zzso zzso The number of patients reporting no pain from bone zzso as measured by the zzso increased from 39 of 149 zzso before zzso to 55 of 102 zzso 6 months after zzso zzso zzso pain reduction from baseline to 4 weeks after zzso was clinically meaningful zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso item at zzso zzso zzso at 4 zzso effect size zzso zzso These improvements were accompanied by significant reduction in zzso use during the first 6 months after zzso zzso zzso of 149 patients with strong zzso use at baseline vs 20 zzso of 100 at 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that patients reported significant pain reduction according to the zzso during the first 6 months after zzso zzso and significant reductions in a composite score of the six zzso symptom interference with daily life items zzso Only a few instances of zzso grade 3 zzso zzso zzso (one zzso vomiting zzso zzso zzso fatigue zzso zzso zzso neck pain zzso and zzso zzso pain associated with severe tongue zzso and zzso occurred zzso and zzso chest pain was reported three zzso No grade 4 zzso zzso zzso survival after zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso at 1 year and zzso zzso at 2 zzso 

zzso is an effective primary or salvage treatment for mechanically stable spinal zzso zzso reductions in zzso pain and other symptoms were evident 6 months after zzso along with satisfactory zzso survival and no late spinal zzso zzso
