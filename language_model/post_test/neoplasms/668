Participants were 145 zzso with advanced cancer who were participating in a phase II trial of an zzso zzso care zzso Patients completed our modified zzso measure of patient satisfaction and the Edmonton zzso Assessment zzso a measure of symptom zzso zzso were also assessed for performance status using the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group zzso We conducted an exploratory factor analysis of the patient satisfaction measure and performed correlations of satisfaction with symptom burden as well as with performance zzso
