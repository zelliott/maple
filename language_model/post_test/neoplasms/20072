Our goal was to develop a potent humanized zzso against zzso zzso This report summarized its in zzso and in zzso zzso 

Cell surface binding and cell migration zzso were used to select zzso zzso zzso followed by testing in several animal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was selected for zzso based on its in zzso and in zzso zzso 

zzso a zzso zzso against mouse and human zzso zzso and zzso was shown to zzso block zzso binding to zzso and zzso and zzso zzso cell migration in zzso zzso of primary tumor growth and/or zzso was observed in several zzso zzso alone significantly ameliorated arthritis in a mouse zzso arthritis model zzso Combination with a zzso zzso was zzso In addition, zzso inhibited 50% of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed similar in zzso and in zzso activities as the parental zzso zzso A crystal structure of the zzso zzso complex in combination with zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso around zzso zzso of zzso and part of the zzso region required for zzso binding to zzso and zzso Finally, zzso exhibited fast clearance in zzso monkeys but not in zzso 

zzso is an attractive target for treatment of cancer and zzso diseases; zzso is suitable for testing this hypothesis in zzso
