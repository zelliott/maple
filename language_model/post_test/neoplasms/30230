The therapeutic control of a solid zzso depends critically on the responses of the individual cells that constitute the entire zzso zzso A particular cell's spatial location within the zzso and zzso zzso including the evolution of the zzso within each cell, has an impact on their decision to grow and zzso They are also influenced by external signals from other cells as well as oxygen and zzso zzso zzso it is important to take these into account when zzso zzso growth and the response to various treatment regimes zzso zzso including zzso In order to address this zzso nature of solid zzso growth and its response to treatment, we propose a hybrid, zzso approach that analyses zzso dynamics at the level of cells, linking individual cell zzso with the zzso zzso of cell zzso and the zzso The individual zzso cells are zzso by using a cellular zzso zzso approach, where each cell has its own internal zzso zzso using a system of zzso The internal zzso dynamics determine the growth strategy in the CA model, making it more zzso and biologically zzso It also helps to zzso the cells according to their zzso states and to zzso the effect of various zzso dependent zzso zzso Moreover, we have incorporated the evolution of oxygen dynamics within this hybrid model in order to study the effects of the zzso in zzso regulation and zzso zzso An important factor from the treatment point of view is that the low concentration of oxygen can result in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the cancer cells, making them resistant to key zzso zzso Using this zzso model, we investigate the impact of oxygen zzso on the zzso patterning of the cell distribution and their zzso zzso We demonstrate that oxygen transport limitations result in significant zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso status, and when these are combined with drug transport limitations, the efficacy of the therapy is significantly zzso
