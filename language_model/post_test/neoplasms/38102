zzso zzso or a reduction of the tissue oxygen tension is a key zzso factor for tumor progression and treatment resistance in solid zzso Because hypoxic tumor cells have been demonstrated to be more resistant to zzso radiation, zzso has been a focus of laboratory and clinical research in radiation therapy for many zzso It is believed that proper detection of hypoxic regions would guide treatment options and ultimately improve tumor zzso To date, most clinical efforts in targeting tumor zzso have yielded zzso results due to the lack of appropriate patient zzso However, with improved understanding of the molecular pathways regulated by zzso and the discovery of novel zzso zzso the prospect of targeting zzso has become more zzso This chapter will focus on the development of clinical zzso for zzso zzso
