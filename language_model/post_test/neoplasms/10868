For several decades experimental biology and medicine have both been accompanied by a zzso between zzso and zzso zzso In the present paper it is proposed that this zzso can be overcome if it is accepted that research on different organizational levels of the zzso is zzso The relevance of such an approach becomes much clearer using an appropriate concept of the zzso The proposed concept is called zzso systems zzso and is a compilation of three related theories, which are basically in line with considerations of many other zzso zzso However, it is argued, that this integrated concept is able to clarify basic assumptions of zzso The theories are: the systems approach of Paul Weiss, the zzso systems theory and the theory of increasing autonomy in zzso The hypothesis is that the different levels of zzso functions, which are described by these theories, are necessarily zzso thus generating the autonomy of the zzso This principle of zzso needs to be regarded in scientific reasoning and can be crucial for solving many medical zzso
