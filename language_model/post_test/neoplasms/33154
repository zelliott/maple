zzso is a highly attractive zzso target zzso to increased zzso altered zzso and loss of polarity in zzso of human zzso To exploit this, we have constructed a panel of zzso zzso receptors zzso that bind selectively to zzso zzso Two parameters proved crucial in zzso the zzso zzso First, we observed that the binding of zzso T cells to anchored zzso is subject to zzso zzso independent of zzso zzso This was overcome by zzso of the flexible and zzso hinge found in zzso of the zzso zzso Second, zzso function was highly dependent upon strong binding capacity across a broad range of zzso zzso zzso This was realized by using an zzso zzso variable zzso zzso cloned from the zzso zzso To zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Ultimately, this zzso design process yielded a potent zzso termed zzso that contains a fused zzso zzso zzso T cells zzso vigorously upon repeated encounter with soluble or zzso zzso mediate production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and elicit brisk killing of zzso tumor zzso To test function in zzso a tumor zzso model was derived using zzso cells engineered to zzso zzso and zzso Mice bearing an established tumor were treated zzso with a single dose of engineered T zzso Compared with control mice, this treatment resulted in a significant delay in tumor growth as measured by serial zzso zzso Together, these data demonstrate for the first time that the zzso zzso tumor zzso can be targeted using zzso T zzso
