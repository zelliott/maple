zzso zzso zzso of cancer patients participating in an ongoing Phase I clinical trial with zzso zzso developed zzso serum zzso zzso zzso within 1 month of initiating zzso These zzso could be detected using any of several standard techniques including zzso and zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis and retention experiments with protein zzso indicate that the zzso are specific for zzso The zzso zzso zzso in this clinical trial zzso zzso differs from the major species of the human T zzso zzso in that it lacks the zzso zzso of the native zzso is not zzso and possesses a zzso substitution at position zzso Another zzso zzso identical to the zzso except that it retains the zzso at position 125 zzso zzso strongly competes with the zzso in competitive zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso acid substitution is not responsible for the recognition of the zzso by serum zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso fails to compete in these zzso and is not retained by protein zzso columns when mixed with zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso serum zzso generated in the course of treatment do not react with the zzso zzso but recognize zzso peculiar to zzso forms which are not dependent on the zzso acid substitution at position zzso The failure of the zzso to neutralize the biological activity of zzso zzso zzso in zzso proliferation zzso and to bind to the native zzso suggests that they may not affect zzso cellular immune functions in zzso
