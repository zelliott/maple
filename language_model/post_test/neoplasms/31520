To examine patterns of mortality for specific causes of death with increases in the zzso mortality study to determine if the patterns are related to employment in the petroleum zzso 

zzso patterns by duration of employment in various job groups were examined for zzso zzso lymphoma, multiple zzso cell type specific zzso and brain zzso 

zzso from zzso was examined for the total cohort and for two maintenance groups with the greatest potential for exposure to zzso The zzso group had a zzso mortality ratio zzso of zzso and a larger group consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had an zzso of zzso The zzso from zzso increased with increasing duration of zzso zzso was lower for those first employed after zzso An analysis of all brain zzso for the total cohort and some job and unit zzso resulted in an zzso of 178 for those employed on the units related to motor oil and 166 for those employed as laboratory zzso zzso from brain zzso in both of these job groups was higher for those employed zzso or zzso 5 years in the zzso An analysis of zzso zzso showed no consistent patterns among the various employment zzso zzso from multiple myeloma was zzso increased among people employed on the crude zzso zzso zzso and fluid zzso cracking units zzso zzso zzso zzso mortality was not increased for the total zzso and a cell type analysis of zzso mortality for the total cohort showed no significant increases for the major cell zzso However, there were significant increases for acute unspecified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of unknown cell type zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of specific causes of death by duration of employment in various job and process units did not show any patterns which suggest that, other than for zzso any of these increases in zzso were likely to have resulted from workplace zzso or from employment at one of the places included in the zzso mortality zzso
