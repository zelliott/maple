zzso is zzso in many human zzso and promotes proliferation and cancer cell survival in response to DNA damaging zzso zzso radiation zzso produces DNA double strand breaks zzso and activates zzso however a direct mechanism linking zzso zzso and zzso signaling is zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso is zzso following zzso in benign and zzso cells and, using zzso zzso and in zzso rejoining zzso show that zzso promotes zzso end zzso zzso repair and cell survival following zzso Further studies revealed that zzso but not zzso or total zzso accumulates in the vicinity of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso Based on zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies, we observed that zzso is zzso by a zzso signaling zzso and this is dependent on the zzso sensor zzso zzso zzso zzso did not require the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is also required for zzso zzso and zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso and zzso These data demonstrate that zzso activate a signaling cascade that directly promotes a zzso zzso of zzso zzso that is dependent on zzso zzso Thus, these data directly link the presence of DNA breaks to zzso cell survival and support zzso as a target for cancer zzso
