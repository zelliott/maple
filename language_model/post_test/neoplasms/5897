We tested zzso human tumors for in zzso sensitivity to either a pair of synergistic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the combination zzso With an zzso mixture of the two zzso zzso zzso two prostate tumors showed similar degrees of zzso growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two breast tumors showed more zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso showed the most zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When the zzso were applied together with zzso the zzso for zzso was reduced for all tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was more closely correlated with the relative decrease in zzso zzso density resulting from zzso exposure than with initial zzso zzso The degree of reduction of zzso for zzso resulting from the joint application with the zzso was, however, most closely related to the growth rate of the zzso Since some zzso tumors exhibit sensitivity to the effects of a synergistic pair of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso it appears that further zzso studies with such tumors, especially those with higher zzso zzso would be of zzso
