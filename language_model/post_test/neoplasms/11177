When a wound occurs, growth and repair genes zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso in surrounding cells are activated and zzso of growth and repair factors zzso factors, such as growth, stem cell, and stimulating factors, zzso is induced to heal the zzso However, if the wound is persistent due to chronic physical zzso electromagnetic field, zzso zzso zzso chemical zzso toxic zzso heavy metals zzso or biological zzso free zzso zzso zzso zzso bacteria and virus infections, stress, zzso damage, amplification of zzso gene zzso in surrounding cells may lead to a clinical zzso Based on the zzso between cancer and wound healing, a new hypothesis of cancer is zzso zzso are not passive zzso useless zzso rather, they are functional zzso produced by zzso gene zzso to zzso zzso factors in an effort to heal persistent wounds in the zzso Based on the hypothesis, current cancer treatments aimed at killing cancer cells only may be zzso The logical extension of the hypothesis is that cancer treatment focused on wound healing by limiting causes of persistent wounds, providing repair cells, zzso factors, and zzso required by repair cells may yield more fruitful results than treatments focused on killing cancer cells zzso zzso zzso of cancer, although rare, may be successful examples of serendipitous spontaneous wound zzso Standard therapies aimed at killing cancer cells, should be limited to zzso status for limiting symptoms or buying time for completion of the wound healing zzso Attempts to destroy cancer cells without healing underlying persistent wounds will allow for eventual zzso
