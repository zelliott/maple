zzso the formation of new blood vessels from the zzso of the existing zzso is fundamental in tumor growth, zzso and zzso zzso tumor zzso is a promising strategy for treatment of cancer and has been successfully transferred from zzso to clinical application in recent zzso Whereas conventional therapeutic approaches, zzso chemotherapy and radiation, are zzso on tumor cells, zzso therapy is directed against the tumor zzso blood zzso 

This review will zzso important molecular mechanisms of tumor zzso and advances in the design of zzso zzso Furthermore, clinical implications of zzso therapy in surgical zzso will be zzso 

First zzso drugs have been approved for treatment of advanced solid tumors in several zzso Leading zzso drugs are designed to inhibit vascular zzso growth zzso tumor zzso Combining zzso agents with conventional chemotherapy or radiation is currently investigated clinically with great emphasis to realize a zzso tumor therapy, targeting both the tumor cell and tumor vascular zzso 

zzso tumor therapy represents a promising strategy for treatment of cancer and will most likely exhibit its clinical potential in combination with established standard tumor therapies in the zzso
