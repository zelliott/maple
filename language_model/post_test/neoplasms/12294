In recent years, zzso zzso zzso has been developed as a proliferation zzso Imaging and measurement of proliferation with PET could provide us with a zzso staging tool and a tool to monitor the response to zzso zzso In this review, the basis of zzso as a proliferation zzso is zzso Furthermore, an overview of the current status of zzso research is zzso The results of this research show that although zzso is a zzso that zzso cellular zzso it also has certain zzso In comparison with the most widely used PET zzso zzso zzso zzso is lower in most zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso does not always reflect the zzso cell proliferation rate, for example during or shortly after certain chemotherapy zzso The opportunities provided by, and the limitations of, zzso as a proliferation zzso are addressed in this review, and directions are given for further research, taking into account the strong and weak points of the new zzso
