To examine the hypothesis that elevated zzso fluid pressure zzso is a cause of reduced blood flow in zzso 

A zzso model of tumor blood flow was developed based on a zzso zzso zzso in the center of a zzso zzso The model incorporates the interaction between the tumor zzso and the zzso as zzso by zzso It also incorporates the dynamic behavior of the zzso wall in response to changes in zzso pressure, and the effect of zzso on blood zzso 

The model predicted elevated tumor zzso in the range of 0 to 56 zzso The zzso diameter in the setting of elevated zzso was greatest at the zzso end, and zzso to between zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso zzso This corresponded to a zzso to zzso reduction in diameter along the length of the zzso The zzso exceeded the zzso pressure zzso in the zzso but vascular collapse did not zzso zzso diameter zzso resulted in a zzso to zzso zzso reduction in tumor blood flow relative to a state of zzso zzso 

The results suggest that zzso vascular zzso occurs in the setting of elevated zzso and leads to reduced tumor blood zzso This may in turn contribute to the development of zzso which is an important cause of radiation treatment failure in many zzso
