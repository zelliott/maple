In this article, first, the different stages of acquisition and processing of zzso information from peripheral zzso to brain are reviewed and the plastic changes that accompany tissue injury are zzso For instance, the zzso of peripheral receptors in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso must be understood in the light of peripheral zzso This phenomenon is the probable explanation for primary zzso the decrease in pain threshold at the site of zzso The observation that substance P enhances zzso zzso responses suggests that these two receptors may operate in concert to prolong and amplify the zzso input generated by peripheral tissue zzso Such zzso barrage zzso a state of central zzso Second, the major problems in the management of cancer pain, zzso the development of tolerance to zzso and zzso pain, are zzso The loss of drug effect observed after chronic exposure of the zzso zzso zzso may be the consequence of the zzso or zzso phenomenon (where the total number of receptors coupled to the second zzso is zzso The zzso zzso begins to shift to the zzso The dramatic zzso improvement obtained with zzso doses of zzso an zzso zzso zzso in those of our cancer patients who have become resistant to zzso is zzso As shown for zzso zzso to zzso may represent a rightward shift in the zzso zzso curve and the zzso effect of zzso the reversal of that zzso
