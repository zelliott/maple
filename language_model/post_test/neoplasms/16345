In this study we determined the zzso and direct zzso and zzso costs of systemic zzso infections zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 

Using primarily the National Hospital Discharge zzso zzso for zzso and the Maryland Hospital Discharge Data Set zzso for costs, we surveyed four systemic zzso infections in patients who also had zzso zzso zzso and all other zzso zzso Using a zzso method, we compared the cases with controls zzso without zzso infections with the same underlying zzso to obtain the incremental hospitalization zzso We used the zzso zzso to determine significance of incremental hospital zzso We modeled zzso costs on the basis of discharge status to calculate the total annual cost for systemic zzso infections in zzso 

For 1998, the projected average zzso was zzso per million US population, with zzso accounting for zzso of zzso The estimated total direct cost was zzso billion and the average zzso attributable cost was zzso The most commonly reported zzso diagnoses with zzso infections zzso zzso zzso accounted for only zzso of all zzso 

The cost burden is high for systemic zzso zzso Additional attention should be given to the zzso with zzso disease and other zzso zzso
