The present work shows that stimulation of peripheral blood zzso with zzso or zzso zzso lines leads to a strong induction of zzso zzso cells with spontaneous killer zzso cell zzso apart from the specific response directed against the particular stimulating zzso To demonstrate this we have determined a relative target cell specificity in the SK system, defined by the short-term zzso release zzso and established a relative specificity index zzso Using this approach we have been able to show that killer cells induced during a zzso zzso period with zzso lines have a similar zzso to that of zzso SK zzso In addition, we have shown that such killer cells can be induced from several different zzso zzso and that they, in contrast to SK cells, do not express zzso zzso The implications of these findings in relation to the nature, zzso and biological significance of the SK cell system is zzso
