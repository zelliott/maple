zzso zzso zzso are most successfully being applied today in clinical cancer imaging and zzso zzso of this paradigm to other zzso families has been greatly hampered by the inherent poor zzso stability of zzso administered zzso zzso We hypothesized that the in zzso zzso of specific zzso zzso would improve zzso zzso and hence tumor zzso Through single zzso of the neutral zzso inhibitor zzso zzso we were able to provoke remarkable rises in the percentages of circulating intact zzso zzso and zzso zzso in mouse models, resulting in a remarkable increase in zzso in tumor zzso in zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were labeled with zzso by 20 zzso of heating at an zzso zzso zzso stability was studied with zzso liquid zzso analysis of blood samples collected 5 zzso after the injection of the test zzso alone or with PA into zzso zzso was studied after injection of each zzso zzso alone or after zzso of PA in zzso severe combined zzso zzso zzso 

The amount of intact zzso detected in the mouse circulation at 5 zzso after the injection of PA increased zzso less than zzso to zzso the zzso in zzso zzso rose from less than 1 percentage injected dose per gram of tissue zzso to 14 zzso at 4 h after zzso Likewise, the zzso of PA resulted in a marked increase in the amount of circulating intact zzso zzso to zzso 5 zzso after injection, and zzso zzso in human zzso zzso in zzso mice escalated from less than 4 zzso to greater than 21 zzso at 4 h after zzso In a similar manner, the zzso of PA resulted in an equally impressive increase in intact zzso levels in the mouse zzso less than zzso to zzso 5 zzso after injection, leading to a remarkable increase in zzso zzso 2 zzso to greater than 15 zzso both zzso tumors and zzso tumors zzso tumors induced by zzso cells zzso to zzso express the human zzso zzso 2 zzso in mice at 4 h after zzso This effect was well zzso by zzso imaging of zzso zzso mice at 4 h after zzso 

The results of this study clearly demonstrate that the zzso of key zzso zzso can effectively prolong the survival of zzso peptides in the zzso securing their safe transit to the zzso This strategy clearly provoked an unprecedented increase in zzso zzso in tumor zzso in zzso this increase might translate into higher diagnostic sensitivity or improved therapeutic efficacy of zzso drugs in cancer zzso zzso our findings provide exciting new opportunities for the application of zzso zzso drugs of either natural or synthetic origin as well as for the rationale design of zzso that are stable in zzso
