We have discussed the impact of molecular imaging on clinical and zzso zzso We have presented the potential problems of delivering the effective therapeutic dose and the properties that can help contribute to the drug zzso The rationale for the design of new zzso agents that can be used for imaging and therapy was zzso Finally, results from imaging and targeted zzso based therapies were zzso In zzso imaging of zzso tumors using zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of the zzso zzso zzso attached to zzso labeled with the MR contrast agent zzso in the V2 zzso model in zzso zzso studies using this targeted contrast agent revealed large areas of zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso that conventional zzso failed to zzso Other investigators have used zzso zzso to an zzso targeted against zzso as imaging zzso These materials also show contrast enhancement of tumor zzso undergoing zzso Other zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been shown to be zzso on tumor zzso and associated with zzso but have not been used in imaging zzso Furthermore, by modification of the zzso we were able to use this imaging agent as an zzso gene delivery zzso The results from these studies are very promising and are being further zzso
