The purpose of this study was to evaluate the safety of zzso and thawed peripheral blood stem cell zzso zzso return infusions in zzso 35 children patients with zzso tumors (13 acute zzso 15 zzso and 7 zzso zzso received zzso return infusions of zzso stem cells after undergoing high-dose chemotherapy without or with total body zzso The zzso of 70 return infusions were zzso All patients were mobilized by chemotherapy plus zzso human zzso zzso factor zzso and then zzso were collected by a zzso zzso plus or zzso zzso The zzso were zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and stored in liquid zzso There were totally 70 zzso zzso The total volume of zzso zzso 190 - zzso zzso zzso zzso 73 zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso with a mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso The single zzso 90 - 300 zzso zzso zzso 37 zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso with a mean of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso occurring during the infusions were zzso All patients were monitored for 24 hours after zzso zzso blood pressure, body temperature, and respiratory rate were recorded every 15 zzso At four hours before and 8 hours after infusion, zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso total zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were examined within 24 hours before and after the first zzso The results showed that the zzso observed included zzso in 54 return infusions zzso headache in 28 zzso zzso in 24 zzso vomiting in 17 zzso and abdominal pain in 8 zzso Patients who received a graft zzso 200 zzso tended to have a higher frequency of zzso headache, zzso zzso or abdominal pain zzso and they disappeared quickly, zzso Total zzso increased after the first return infusion zzso and there was a significant correlation between the volume of infusion and the degree of total zzso increase zzso zzso No zzso failure or shock zzso It is concluded that transient zzso headache, zzso zzso and abdominal pain are common zzso associated with zzso zzso and these zzso are related with a single volume of zzso zzso Total zzso increase is correlated with the volume of zzso In a word, the toxicity is less frequent and lower severe in children with zzso infusions of zzso peripheral blood stem zzso
