The zzso peripheral zzso zzso zzso is involved in a functional structure designated as the zzso transition zzso which controls zzso zzso of zzso triggers a zzso zzso zzso Using four different human tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso all of which express zzso and zzso we investigated the potential role of zzso zzso in zzso zzso We show that, in zzso the three zzso zzso tested zzso zzso and zzso enhanced zzso induced by zzso zzso in zzso cells, as demonstrated by zzso zzso potential drop and DNA zzso In contrast, zzso but not zzso or zzso enhanced zzso zzso in all other cell zzso These effects were obtained in zzso zzso cell lines, but not in zzso zzso cell zzso Enhancement of zzso zzso zzso by zzso was characterized by an increased zzso release of zzso c and zzso proteins and an enhanced zzso of zzso 9 and 3, suggesting a zzso zzso zzso of cells with the different zzso zzso or zzso did not affect the levels of expression of either zzso or zzso In zzso we found that the zzso zzso zzso significantly increased the growth zzso induced by two zzso agents, zzso and zzso using two human small cell lung zzso zzso into nude zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may therefore act as zzso agents for the treatment of human zzso
