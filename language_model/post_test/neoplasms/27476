Using data from gene expression databases on various organisms and zzso including zzso zzso human normal and cancer zzso and embryonic stem cells, we found that the zzso of expressed genes exhibit a zzso distribution with an zzso close to zzso zzso they obey zzso zzso Furthermore, by simulations of a simple model with an zzso reaction network, we found that zzso law of chemical abundance is a universal feature of cells where such a network zzso the efficiency and zzso of zzso These findings provide novel insights into the nature of the organization of reaction dynamics in living zzso
