Several models for zzso care are prominent within the cancer zzso however, there is little empirical research that examines what zzso clinicians perceive to be the best approach to caring for cancer survivors, what services zzso programs should include, and how prepared they feel to care for cancer zzso 

An zzso approved zzso survey of all clinical staff was conducted at a zzso designated comprehensive cancer center with a zzso response rate (N zzso zzso Data were summarized using zzso and relative zzso and zzso tests of statistical significance were zzso to evaluate differences between zzso type zzso 

Overall, the largest proportion of respondents preferred a zzso zzso model zzso This preference was specifically observed in zzso physicians and zzso When asked where specific zzso services should be zzso respondents indicated a preference for services directly related to zzso medical treatment zzso information about late zzso to be delivered in a zzso zzso clinic, and ancillary services zzso nutrition and fertility zzso to be housed in a zzso comprehensive zzso zzso Physicians felt that they have significantly more information, training, and resources to care for cancer survivors than did zzso zzso 

These results indicate that zzso clinicians prefer a combination of zzso care delivery models where continuing medical needs are met in zzso clinics, and comprehensive zzso services are offered in a zzso comprehensive zzso zzso zzso also suggest that planning for zzso initiatives should include additional resources, education, and training for clinical zzso 

These findings underscore the need for a universally accepted definition of cancer zzso and support a model for delivering care to cancer survivors that is a blend of the zzso and comprehensive zzso zzso
