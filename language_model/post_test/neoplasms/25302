Human peripheral blood zzso zzso obtained from patients with a variety of zzso when incubated in zzso with zzso zzso zzso fresh zzso tumors during a short-term zzso zzso These zzso killer zzso cells produced maximum zzso of tumor cells by 4 to 8 zzso of zzso zzso incubation induced the generation of cells zzso for zzso and zzso tumors but not zzso or zzso zzso Cold target zzso studies demonstrated that zzso and zzso tumors of various zzso types all shared the zzso recognized by zzso zzso Some adherent cells were necessary for generation of these zzso but higher numbers were zzso zzso of tumor cell zzso was seen when adherent cells were partially removed before zzso zzso The zzso zzso cell was zzso zzso The precursor cell of the zzso was separated from natural killer zzso cells on zzso zzso and was generated from zzso duct zzso a population devoid of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of the majority of the precursor cells was zzso zzso zzso by zzso for 2 days was found to be an efficient and convenient method for generating zzso cells zzso for fresh zzso human zzso The zzso and possible therapeutic role of these cells is currently being zzso
