zzso zzso zzso degrades over zzso of administered zzso zzso thereby regulating the efficacy of this commonly used zzso zzso zzso activity is highly variable zzso and individuals with reduced activity have a high risk of zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso protein and 13 different zzso have been reported in zzso zzso However, the contribution of these zzso zzso to zzso zzso activity in zzso is not zzso The previously described zzso zzso are contained in 10 zzso These 10 zzso were zzso in a cohort of cancer patients with reduced zzso zzso zzso or normal zzso zzso zzso zzso activity to determine the contribution of each zzso zzso to low zzso activity in zzso Eight of the 13 previously defined zzso zzso zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso delta zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso A previously defined zzso 13 zzso zzso was detected in three individuals with reduced zzso zzso An zzso 14 zzso donor site zzso zzso zzso was detected in a normal zzso activity zzso It was demonstrated that zzso zzso and zzso are common zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso was detected in a patient with reduced zzso activity and zzso zzso In addition, three novel common zzso were detected in zzso 10 and zzso Only three patients did not have any zzso and 30 had multiple zzso zzso in the regions zzso However, only zzso zzso of the patients with a low zzso zzso have a molecular basis for reduced zzso Although novel zzso zzso have been identified in this study, the 17 zzso zzso now described do not entirely explain zzso zzso activity and toxic response to zzso These data emphasize the complex nature of the molecular mechanisms controlling zzso zzso activity in zzso
