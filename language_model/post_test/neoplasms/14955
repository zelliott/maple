The zzso of zzso namely zzso zzso zzso and its zzso analog zzso were efficiently zzso using the Julia zzso reaction to connect between the zzso and zzso positions zzso zzso An zzso precursor was prepared from zzso acid as shown in the previous zzso zzso The novel zzso zzso partner with an zzso two carbon unit as a zzso was zzso from zzso zzso zzso in good zzso The subsequent zzso reaction followed by a zzso step afforded a mixture of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso To separate zzso and zzso each primary zzso group was zzso with a zzso group and the resulting zzso zzso and zzso were separated by high performance liquid zzso After the zzso the zzso of each zzso or zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso magnetic zzso studies including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso group was removed under basic conditions to obtain the target molecules of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell differentiation activity, zzso activity in zzso zzso normal zzso cells and zzso activity of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso cell line) cells zzso zzso were zzso In addition, the effects on bone mineral density zzso and the blood and urine calcium zzso of zzso zzso rats were zzso zzso has much greater zzso and cell differentiation activities compared to zzso D3 zzso
