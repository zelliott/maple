zzso of the spatial distribution of diseases provides useful information in zzso research and in zzso of preventive activities in community zzso zzso zzso analysis is one of the various methods that enables to determine spatial zzso of zzso This method has not been applied to zzso stomach and colon cancer in zzso These zzso are frequent and are associated with environmental zzso The objectives of the study are to determine spatial distribution of zzso rates of these cancer sites by sex and to help generate zzso zzso Community health departments zzso of residence are considered as risk markers since their population and environment may be related to the selected cancer zzso Data were obtained from zzso Cancer zzso Rates were standardized by the direct zzso zzso analysis was done through zzso zzso and zzso zzso I for zzso zzso of standardized rates were compared to those of non standardized zzso Rates yielded the same results for the zzso zzso zzso results were quite different for the zzso This implies that results from standardized rates should be kept since the age structure of zzso populations are zzso Important variation in the level of spatial zzso was found among the six zzso cancer zzso For male lung cancer and male stomach cancer zzso zzso zzso showed similar zzso rates according to a geographic zzso Female lung cancer exhibited spatial zzso zzso of spatial zzso for colon cancer suggests that zzso is not the appropriate scale for study of this cancer and allows use of conventional zzso zzso These results are discussed in relation to current zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
