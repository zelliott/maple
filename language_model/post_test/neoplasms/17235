New zzso agents that target a single cell surface zzso zzso or amplified gene product, or zzso zzso have met with some success in treating advanced zzso However, patients' tumors still eventually progress on these zzso If it were possible to identify a larger number of zzso vulnerabilities in an zzso zzso multiple targets could be exploited with the use of specific therapeutic agents, thus possibly giving the patient viable therapeutic zzso 

In this exploratory study, we used next-generation sequencing technologies zzso including whole zzso sequencing zzso and where zzso whole zzso sequencing zzso to identify zzso events and associated expression changes in advanced cancer zzso 

zzso on paired tumor and normal samples from nine advanced cancer patients and zzso on six of these patients' tumors was zzso One patient's treatment was based on targets and pathways identified by zzso and the patient had a short-lived zzso response with a significant reduction in his zzso zzso To design treatment plans based on information garnered from zzso several challenges were zzso zzso reporting delays, communication of results to out-of-state participants and their treating zzso and chain of custody handling for fresh biopsy samples for Clinical Laboratory Improvement zzso zzso target zzso 

While the initial effort was a slower process than anticipated due to a variety of issues, we demonstrate the feasibility of using zzso in advanced cancer patients so that treatments for patients with progressing tumors may be zzso
