This study investigate the use of zzso zzso as a tool for patient zzso and tumor tracking capabilities for image guided particle therapy zzso using zzso Carlo zzso One zzso two lung and one liver cancer patients were considered in this zzso For each patient, 230 and 330 zzso zzso and 500 zzso carbon zzso pencil beams were simulated through their zzso zzso zzso data set using zzso Energy, position and direction zzso of each particle were recorded in front and behind the zzso Ion zzso were subsequently reconstructed using a dedicated in-house zzso The image quality was assessed by evaluating the zzso ratio of the tumor and its surrounding zzso In the lung and liver cases, each CT phase of the breathing cycle was treated individually and dynamic sequences were later produced to appreciate tumor zzso zzso zzso show high spatial zzso This allows for excellent imaging capabilities in pediatric patients, comparable to X-ray imaging at a fraction of the imaging zzso There is clear zzso of the tumor edges in the lung due to the great zzso ratio between the tumor and its surrounding zzso tumor motion is observed and comparable to zzso CT data thus allowing for zzso tumor tracking during zzso zzso zzso tumor edge detection is difficult in liver, and zzso markers are required to attempt indirect tumor tracking for zzso Ion zzso with high spatial resolution can be generated using the zzso software resulting in pediatric patient zzso capabilities at a fraction of the current imaging dose, as well as the capacity to track moving targets in order to achieve zzso
