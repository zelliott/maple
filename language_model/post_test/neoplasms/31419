A simplified zzso technique characterized by high precision and zzso of dose measurement is zzso One hundred zzso zzso zzso rods 1 zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso length as obtained from the manufacturer were zzso for 1 h at 400 degrees C followed immediately by 2 h at 105 degrees zzso After exposure to a dose of 1 zzso of 4 zzso zzso rays, zzso were zzso for 15 zzso at 105 degrees C, then read zzso zzso were then sorted into five groups, ranging from 26 to 50 rods each with approximately equal sensitivity after correcting for the drift in the sensitivity of the zzso reader during the zzso zzso Maintaining group identity, the zzso were again zzso zzso and read zzso Fewer than zzso of the zzso were removed from each group because the corrected readings differed from the respective group mean by more than zzso The standard zzso of the zzso was approximately zzso within each zzso The zzso heater was not zzso with nitrogen zzso Various tests were performed to assess the stability of the group sorting technique and the zzso of zzso dose zzso After zzso five zzso were randomly drawn from one of the zzso groups, and subjected to various dose of 4 zzso radiation over the range from zzso to 1000 zzso This resulted in an average zzso standard zzso of zzso Response per unit dose was almost flat over the range from zzso zzso to 100 zzso and increased by zzso over the range from 100 zzso to 1000 zzso zzso sensitivity was affected by the duration of the zzso but was virtually independent of the various time delays between zzso zzso zzso and zzso The group zzso and sorting zzso procedure provides a simple, reliable, precise, convenient, and accurate method for zzso zzso
