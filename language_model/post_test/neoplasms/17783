What is zzso Cancer is a disease initiated by a series of cumulative genetic and zzso changes that occur in a normal zzso However, in addition to the zzso cell itself, cancer is a disease of zzso and zzso Although genetic and zzso zzso drive cellular zzso zzso zzso and evolution, it has become increasingly apparent that multiple signals delivered within the tumor zzso by modifier zzso zzso and zzso cells, and immune cells are critical factors in determining the progression versus dormancy or destruction of an initiated zzso and also whether zzso may zzso With regard to the important roles of immune cells in cancer, a zzso exists between zzso and zzso although sharing a common disease interest, there is little history for workers to draw on based on shared perspectives or zzso How did this disconnect zzso Here, we look at how these workers became separated in the past and address why it has now become critical to spur greater zzso In particular, we highlight three ideas that we believe are important for discussion and zzso The first idea is that therapeutic strategies that fail to harness the immune system will always be defeated by tumor resistance, due to the large zzso zzso that genetically plastic tumor cells can readily access to evolve resistance zzso Because all therapies drive tumor progression by imposing a selection for resistant cells, harnessing the zzso of the immune system will be indispensable to ultimately stanching the deadly zzso of the tumor zzso The second idea is that using molecular targeted agents to reverse zzso immune suppression may offer a powerful method to leverage the efficacy of most if not all therapeutic zzso We suggest that the mechanisms that support evolution of a zzso inflammatory environment in cancer overlap with those that support evolution of zzso immune zzso If true, zzso immune suppression will switch the inflammatory state from supportive to destructive for the zzso The third idea is that by zzso zzso mechanisms, zzso chemotherapy might zzso with, rather than zzso active zzso zzso zzso studies in this area prompt clinical zzso We believe that increased efforts to zzso the perspectives and work of cancer zzso with cancer biologists and zzso will be needed to realize the National Cancer Institute's goal of managing cancer in the clinic by zzso
