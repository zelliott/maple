Despite progression in zzso drug development and improvements in the clinical zzso of therapies, current treatment regimes are still dependent upon the use of systemic zzso zzso zzso Although these agents are zzso zzso their efficacy is limited by toxicity towards zzso cells and a lack of zzso selective zzso resulting in a therapeutic index which is modest at zzso zzso the development of more zzso selective cancer treatments, with better discrimination between zzso and normal cells is unequivocally an important goal for cancer drug zzso One such strategy is to exploit the zzso zzso as a mechanism for zzso delivery of potent zzso An exciting approach in this area is to develop zzso zzso as zzso which are zzso until activated by zzso localized specifically in the zzso zzso suitable for zzso zzso development must have increased activity in the zzso relative to zzso tissue and an ability to activate the zzso to its active zzso One class of zzso satisfying these criteria are the zzso zzso particularly the zzso and zzso These zzso zzso are essential for zzso zzso invasion and zzso the major defining features of zzso This review describes the concept behind development of zzso activated zzso and discusses the various studies to date that have demonstrated the huge potential of this approach for improvement of cancer zzso
