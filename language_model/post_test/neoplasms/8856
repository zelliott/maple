Several zzso zzso have been devised to zzso patient selection for phase 1 zzso trials with no consensus as to the optimal score and none qualifying as a marker of treatment zzso 

zzso zzso of overall survival zzso were tested on 118 referred patients to develop the zzso zzso zzso The score's ability to predict zzso zzso survival zzso and zzso mortality zzso was compared with other zzso zzso Changes in HS were zzso during zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso emerged as independent zzso zzso These were used with equal weighting to devise the zzso a compound zzso index ranging from 0 to zzso High zzso score predicted worse zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso HS was a more accurate zzso predictor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso under the zzso curve zzso compared with other zzso zzso of the HS during treatment predicted for shorter zzso zzso HS retained zzso and zzso ability following external zzso 

HS is a simple, validated index to zzso patient selection and predict survival benefit from phase 1 zzso zzso Prospective validation is zzso
