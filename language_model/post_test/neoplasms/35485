The goal of this study was to explore living conditions among zzso cancer survivors participating in the zzso force after successful primary zzso Their living conditions were compared with the conditions of matched controls from the general Norwegian zzso 

Living conditions are social indicators that stimulate social inclusion and reduce exclusion such as economy, zzso health, housing and social zzso A questionnaire covering living conditions with established questions from population surveys was mailed to 852 cancer survivors and zzso zzso zzso responses were obtained from 51% cancer survivors zzso women with breast cancer, 49 men with prostate cancer, and 165 with zzso zzso and zzso controls zzso women and 279 zzso 

Compared to their controls cancer survivors showed no difference in work hours or full-time jobs, but reported significantly poorer physical and mental work zzso This was associated with significantly more zzso diseases among survivors and poorer general health status in male zzso The survivors had significantly smaller households and more living space than zzso No significant differences were observed concerning economy or social zzso except that significantly more female survivors than controls stated that they had enough zzso 

In spite of poorer health, zzso survivors after breast, zzso and prostate cancer report mostly equal living conditions compared to matched zzso The protection hypothesis of holding jobs as a precondition for normal living condition was confirmed in our study of a sample of cancer survivors with good zzso
