To compare the accuracy of three zzso tests zzso time zzso activated partial zzso time zzso and zzso zzso performed on blood samples collected through zzso zzso zzso access devices zzso with those from zzso 

zzso comparative with patients serving as their own zzso 

zzso comprehensive care setting for children and adolescents experiencing catastrophic zzso 

53 patients who had zzso had not received zzso during the previous 14 days, and had zzso studies zzso Patients ranged in age from zzso years zzso zzso zzso years, zzso zzso zzso The most common diagnoses were zzso and acute zzso zzso 

Blood was collected through zzso within seconds of collection of the zzso zzso The first 3 zzso of blood from a zzso was zzso the research nurse then drew three sequential samples of 3 zzso zzso Laboratory personnel were blinded to the source of all four samples until all analyses had been zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso 

For all patients, results of zzso zzso and zzso tests on each of the three blood samples obtained through the zzso differed significantly from results of the same tests on blood obtained by zzso 

These findings indicate that neither a 6 zzso 9 zzso nor 12 zzso discard from a zzso zzso is sufficient to yield clinically trustworthy zzso zzso or zzso zzso 

Nurses who have been persuaded by patients or parents to withdraw blood samples for zzso indicators from a zzso rather than from a zzso should have access to this zzso information that the three zzso particularly zzso differ significantly from each other as to make it unreliable and potentially unsafe to sample blood from a zzso to assess zzso
