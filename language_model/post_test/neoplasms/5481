The recently introduced genetic diagnosis of cancer zzso is quite attractive because of its high detection zzso Not zzso however, there are marked discrepancies between genetic and conventional zzso diagnoses, especially concerning zzso zzso from colon zzso zzso Because the zzso approach has long been relied on in the clinic, the reasons for the differences in results need to be zzso 

zzso sections of genetic diagnosis positive but zzso negative zzso zzso of colon zzso patients were prepared for zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the possible zzso influence of DNA sequences derived from zzso zzso cells from the primary site through the zzso the authors also injected zzso DNA of human colon zzso cells zzso into the foot pads of rats and zzso examined zzso zzso using genetic diagnosis zzso 

zzso zzso examination of genetic diagnosis positive, zzso negative zzso zzso of colon zzso patients confirmed the absence of cancer cells, whereas zzso protein was zzso demonstrated to be present in the zzso of zzso zzso In the rat experiment, positive reactions were obtained with the zzso zzso zzso beginning 30 minutes after the injection, and zzso zzso at various sites were subsequently affected, even after a 72-hour zzso 

The current study thus suggests that positive results with genetic diagnosis may simply indicate the presence of tumor DNA and do not necessarily mean that viable cancer cells are zzso Although the genetic approach may still hold promise for the detection of cancer zzso its zzso value should be carefully assessed zzso because its zzso may be associated with a greatly increased zzso zzso
