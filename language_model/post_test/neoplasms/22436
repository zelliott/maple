zzso to high-volume hospitals has been recommended for cancer procedures with a demonstrated zzso zzso However, little is known about the factors associated with use of high-volume hospitals for cancer zzso The purpose of this study was to determine patient characteristics associated with zzso of zzso surgery at high-volume zzso 

Data were obtained from claims submitted to the Korean National Health Insurance zzso We identified patients who underwent the following procedures between 2002 and 2005: zzso zzso zzso zzso lung zzso mastectomy, and zzso Each hospital volume was divided into zzso Patient zzso zzso and clinical variables were investigated as factors that may affect use of zzso or zzso zzso 

A total of zzso patients received one of the seven zzso Trends toward lower operative risks at high-volume hospitals were observed for all zzso Patients who were older zzso ratio zzso zzso lived in a rural area zzso zzso had emergent surgeries zzso zzso and had lower zzso score were less likely to go to high-volume zzso For all procedures, patients having the lowest income level were significantly less likely to be treated at high-volume hospitals, compared with patients having the highest income level zzso zzso 

We identified substantial demographic and socioeconomic disparities in use of high-volume hospitals for the seven procedures zzso The policy for selective referral to high-volume hospitals should include explicit efforts to identify patient and system factors required to reduce current zzso
