The objective of the review is to examine the role of innate and zzso immune cells in zzso 

zzso system functions as a host defensive mechanism protecting against invading pathogens and transformed cells, including zzso However, a body of research carried out over the last few decades has disclosed the unexpected role of immune system in zzso the tumor zzso 

A computer-based online search was performed in the zzso Scopus and Web of Science databases for articles published, concerning natural killer zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso T cells with relevance to zzso After finding relevant articles within these search limits, a manual search was conducted through the references from these zzso 

This review summarizes the role of immune system in zzso and zzso It then focused mainly on role of zzso regulatory T cells zzso zzso cells and on the zzso mechanisms, which facilitate immune evasion of tumor zzso Our results shows that, immune cells, such as zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso T helper zzso cells and zzso cells along with their characteristic zzso zzso zzso function as major zzso zzso zzso Whereas zzso cells, zzso zzso cells zzso and their derived zzso function as dominant zzso zzso In contrast to these cells, zzso zzso and zzso cells show a dual effect in zzso Thus, it appears that most components of the immune system are potentially endowed with dual functions zzso promoting tumor development on the one hand and restraining tumor development on the other and hence immune system can be considered as a double-edged sword in zzso
