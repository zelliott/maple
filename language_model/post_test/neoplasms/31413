A simple zzso was developed for calculation of the zzso output at various zzso distances zzso on the central axis for wedged zzso In the zzso we dealt independently with two effective sources, one for head scatter and the other for wedge zzso zzso zzso with 18 and 8 zzso zzso beams was used to examine this zzso The effective source position for head scatter for wedged fields was assumed to be the same as that for open fields, and the effective source position for wedge scatter was assumed to be a certain distance upstream from the physical location of the zzso The shift of the effective source for wedge zzso zzso was found to be independent of field zzso Moreover, we observed no systematic dependency of w on wedge angle or beam zzso One value, w zzso zzso zzso provided less than zzso difference in zzso zzso through the whole experimental range, zzso 6 zzso 6 to 20 zzso 20 zzso field size (15 zzso 20 zzso for 60 degrees zzso 15 zzso degrees wedge angle, zzso zzso zzso and both 18 and 8 zzso zzso zzso This zzso can handle the case in which use of a zzso zzso with an external wedge makes the field size for the determination of wedge scatter different from that for head zzso In this case, without the zzso method, the maximum of zzso and zzso difference can be given by the inverse square method and zzso method in a 45 degrees wedged field with 18 zzso zzso can be larger for thicker zzso zzso dynamic wedge zzso fields were also zzso It was found that no second effective source is required for zzso zzso
