A cohort of zzso concrete workers was enrolled in the study from zzso The average duration of follow up was zzso years zzso zzso The workers' cancer morbidity was compared with the morbidity of the general zzso 

A total of zzso incident zzso were zzso zzso increased zzso zzso ratios zzso were found for all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 103 to zzso cancer of the lip zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso cancer of the stomach zzso zzso zzso 122 to zzso cancer of the lung zzso zzso zzso 114 to zzso and cancer of the prostate zzso zzso zzso 101 to zzso zzso risk was found for cancer of the large zzso zzso zzso zzso 69 to zzso and cancer of the zzso zzso zzso zzso 26 to zzso Smoking was more prevalent among the concrete workers than in the general population zzso v zzso 

The study has shown a slightly increased overall risk of cancer among concrete zzso The increased risk of lung cancer could entirely be due to differences in smoking habits between concrete workers and the general zzso There is a possibility that the smoking also has contributed to the increased risks of stomach cancer and lip cancer, but occupational factors may have contributed to these cancer zzso
