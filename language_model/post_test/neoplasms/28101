zzso evidence suggests that zzso zzso is a new powerful marker of zzso in solid zzso thus, using breast cancer as a model, we investigated whether targeting of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used for in zzso imaging of solid zzso zzso and flow zzso identified differential expression of zzso on breast cancer and zzso zzso in fact, zzso cells were zzso and rarely stained by zzso zzso which in contrast, strongly and invariably stained blood vessel zzso within the breast zzso investigated and cultured zzso zzso Moreover, in contrast to zzso which currently represents the reference marker to assess zzso activity, zzso expression was highest in zzso and actively zzso zzso cells, and it progressively decreased as cells reached tight zzso and low zzso zzso zzso administration of 18 zzso of zzso zzso zzso efficiently zzso spontaneous zzso zzso in two dogs; the zzso of zzso zzso was rapid and intense because zzso background ratios of zzso and zzso were reached 8 h after zzso administration, in the absence of immediate and/or long-term clinical side zzso Altogether, our present data suggest that targeting of zzso on zzso blood vessels may represent a new strategy for in zzso imaging of solid zzso regardless of their zzso zzso
