zzso of gene expression is a crucial step in the maintenance of cellular zzso The control of gene expression can occur in multiple zzso The overwhelming majority of regulatory events occur at the level of zzso To initiate zzso zzso zzso zzso II requires the close collaboration of a battery of proteins collectively termed zzso zzso zzso factors are generally divided into two groups: zzso the zzso zzso factors which are ubiquitous and recruit the zzso zzso II zzso complex to the minimal zzso zzso zzso zzso factors that activate or repress zzso zzso These proteins bind to regulatory sequences organized in a series of regulatory zzso along the zzso Thus, the molecular basis for zzso regulation of gene expression is the binding of zzso proteins zzso zzso to zzso sequences zzso zzso A growing list of human diseases are due to genetic defects in zzso zzso In most cases, zzso in zzso factors lead to zzso zzso Clinical observations can be explained at the molecular level by the fact that these zzso factors control the expression of many zzso usually in combination with one or more further zzso In addition, many events that lead to the process of zzso in zzso and in solid zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso This review describes human diseases attributable to zzso in the genes coding for zzso factors or zzso in their zzso binding zzso
