The Pennsylvania Cancer zzso zzso is an interactive online zzso to help zzso program managers, and epidemiologists with tasks related to cancer prevention and zzso The zzso includes zzso zzso tables, that are zzso linked to support data exploration and decision-making with zzso cancer zzso Our zzso development process follows a zzso design zzso To assess the zzso of the initial versions of the zzso we developed and applied a novel strategy for soliciting user feedback through multiple distributed focus groups and zzso Our process of acquiring user feedback zzso an online web application zzso In this paper we describe the zzso detail how we have adapted zzso web application to support zzso and utility evaluation of the zzso and present the results of our zzso 

We report results from four sets of zzso Each group provided structured individual and group assessments of the zzso as well as input on the kinds of users and applications for which it is best zzso zzso reactions to the zzso are quite zzso Participants did, however, provide a range of useful zzso Key suggestions focused on improving interaction functions, enhancing methods of zzso analysis, addressing data issues, and providing additional data displays and help zzso These suggestions were incorporated in each design and zzso iteration for the zzso and used to inform a set of zzso design zzso 

For the Atlas, we find that a design that zzso linked map, zzso and table views is understandable to and perceived to be useful by the target audience of cancer prevention and control zzso However, it is clear that considerable variation in experience using maps and graphics exists and for those with less experience, integrated tutorials and help features are zzso In relation to our zzso assessment strategy, we find that our distributed, zzso method for soliciting user input is generally zzso zzso include the ability to gather information from users distributed in time and space and the relative anonymity of the participants while disadvantages include less control over when and how often participants provide input and challenges for obtaining rich zzso
