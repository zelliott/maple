zzso zzso exhibit high affinity for folate zzso zzso positive cells and zzso such as those in tumors, making them attractive candidates and of interest in diagnostic tumor zzso The aim of study was to zzso a novel zzso based folate zzso zzso and to evaluate its efficiency as a targeted agent for imaging tumors that over express zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso methods were used to check and confirm the zzso zzso zzso was labeled with zzso with high labeling efficiency zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was investigated in zzso using two groups of zzso zzso saturated and zzso These experiments showed high zzso of zzso in zzso rich zzso and demonstrated its sensitivity and specificity in imaging zzso and zzso Based on the demonstrated good zzso and zzso properties, the compound zzso may potentially be used as a zzso agent for imaging the zzso zzso
