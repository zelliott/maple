zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso a zzso partner of zzso whose biological functions are not well zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso mouse embryonic zzso zzso proliferated poorly, entered zzso zzso and expressed a zzso gene signature, including elevated levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso genes whose induction by zzso stress requires zzso The zzso activity of zzso required its ability to zzso with zzso zzso linked zzso zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation and zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells, activated zzso gene zzso and recruited the zzso zzso in a zzso manner, whereas zzso zzso lacked these capabilities and efficiently rescued proliferation of zzso zzso zzso depletion partially restored growth of zzso cells, indicating that the increased levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso inhibit zzso The zzso functions of zzso are not restricted to zzso as zzso zzso from zzso bone zzso also displayed impaired zzso Furthermore, high zzso expression correlated with poorer clinical zzso in several human zzso and zzso depletion decreased proliferation and induced zzso in lung tumor zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso through zzso which prevents zzso and suppresses zzso zzso of zzso zzso
