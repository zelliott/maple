zzso between zzso and zzso states have crucial roles in embryonic zzso Emerging data suggest a role for these processes in regulating cellular plasticity in normal adult zzso and in zzso where they can generate zzso distinct cellular zzso contributing to zzso zzso Some of these zzso may exhibit more differentiated features, whereas others have characteristics of stem zzso zzso to the importance of these zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso targeting the products of such cellular plasticity is an attractive but challenging approach that is likely to lead to improved clinical management of cancer zzso
