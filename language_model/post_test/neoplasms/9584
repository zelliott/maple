DNA is the ultimate depository of biological zzso Thus, in order to understand life and gain insights into disease zzso genetic information embedded in the sequence of DNA base pairs zzso zzso should be zzso The stories of investigating the association between zzso and zzso in China and other countries further demonstrate that zzso can serve as a probe for disease zzso We now know that in zzso disorders, one gene is not only a dictator of one zzso but also a dictator of two or more distinct zzso zzso genetic abnormalities of complex diseases, including diabetes, hypertension, mental diseases, coronary heart disease and cancer, may unravel the complicated networks and zzso and help to simplify the complexity of the zzso The zzso and zzso analysis for medicine not only deepen our understanding of disease zzso but also provide novel diagnostic and therapeutic zzso Taken together, zzso research offers a new opportunity for determining how diseases occur, by taking advantage of experiments of nature and a growing array of sophisticated research tools to identify the molecular abnormalities underlying disease zzso We should be ready for the advent of zzso medicine, and put the zzso into the doctors' bag, so that we can help patients to zzso zzso
