The tumor zzso is characterized by regions of fluctuating zzso low zzso and zzso zzso To determine the genetic consequences of growth under these conditions, we used a zzso cell line carrying a zzso zzso based zzso zzso shuttle zzso designed to report zzso without the need for genetic selection of zzso zzso The cells were grown in parallel either in culture or as tumors in nude zzso The frequency of zzso arising in cells within the tumors was found to be zzso higher than that in otherwise identical cells grown in zzso A distinct pattern of zzso was also seen, with significantly more deletions and zzso in the tumors than in the cell zzso Furthermore, exposure of the cultured cells to zzso produced an elevated zzso frequency and a zzso pattern similar to that seen in the zzso These results indicate that the conditions within solid tumors are zzso and suggest that a fundamental mechanism of tumor progression in zzso is genetic instability induced by the tumor zzso
