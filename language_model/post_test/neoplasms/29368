This prospective study is designed to examine the effects of severe zzso failure on the zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in three cancer patients with severe zzso failure zzso clearance zzso zzso 20 zzso who were undergoing dialysis and received 100 zzso zzso as zzso were zzso compared with those in five cancer patients with normal zzso function zzso zzso 60 zzso To ensure that the subjects had similar genetic backgrounds of zzso zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso or zzso were zzso The estimated terminal elimination rate constant of zzso in patients undergoing dialysis was approximately one tenth of that in patients with normal zzso function zzso zzso zzso zzso 50% of zzso was zzso with a zzso dialysis zzso whereas zzso was zzso with a zzso zzso Our results showed that the elimination of zzso was significantly delayed in patients with severe zzso failure compared with patients with normal zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso was partly zzso
