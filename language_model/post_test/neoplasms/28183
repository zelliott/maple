We have previously shown that geographic differences in cancer zzso in Europe are related to (in order of zzso geographic distances zzso environmental zzso zzso distances zzso cultural and genetic zzso and genetic distances of the populations in the areas zzso In this study, we analyzed the relations of the same three factors to European zzso of 45 male and 47 female zzso zzso in cancer zzso are correlated zzso first with geographic zzso and then with genetic zzso but not at all with zzso zzso Comparing these findings to the earlier ones for cancer zzso we note the reversal in the importance of zzso and zzso and the generally lower correlations of zzso differences with the three zzso zzso distance zzso A path zzso combining both studies demonstrates the lack of cultural zzso effects, but suggests cultural influences on procedures such as the registration of deaths in different political zzso Additionally, the relatively large correlation between zzso distances and mortality differences is caused by common factors behind the correlation of zzso and geographic zzso zzso proximity results in similar zzso The direct effects of genetic distances are negligible and only their common effects with geographic distances play a role, accounting for the weak to negligible influence of zzso on zzso and mortality zzso Apparently, the genetic systems available to us do not substantially affect cancer zzso or zzso We present indirect evidence that international differences in the quality of cancer rate data are greater in zzso than in zzso
