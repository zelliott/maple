zzso zzso in tumor cells often lead to the emergence of zzso zzso and zzso signals, involving zzso of zzso zzso growth factors, zzso and zzso Increased levels of these soluble proteins may be exploited for cancer diagnosis and management or as points of therapeutic zzso Here, we combined the use of controlled vocabulary terms and zzso zzso to predict genes zzso zzso proteins from among approximately 12,500 sequences represented on zzso zzso zzso of these genes was zzso in 150 zzso from 10 zzso sites of origin and compared with 46 normal zzso derived from the corresponding sites of tumor origin and other body zzso and zzso Of 74 different genes identified as zzso in cancer zzso several zzso proteins with demonstrated clinical diagnostic application, such as zzso in liver zzso and zzso 6 and 10 in zzso cancer, or therapeutic utility, such as zzso zzso in lung zzso We show that several of the other candidate genes zzso proteins with high levels of zzso expression by zzso on tissue zzso and further demonstrate significantly elevated levels of another novel candidate zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, a distant member of the transforming growth zzso zzso in the serum of patients with zzso zzso breast, and zzso zzso Our results suggest that the combination of zzso sequence analysis, transcript zzso zzso and zzso is a powerful approach for zzso candidate zzso with potential clinical significance and may be broadly zzso to other human zzso
