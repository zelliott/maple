zzso cell zzso in the process of tumor zzso and in various aspects of vascular biology has been extensively zzso However, zzso cells also function in other zzso including in immune zzso Compared to the more traditional immune regulatory populations zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells have received far less credit as being immune zzso Their regulatory capacity is zzso They are critical in both limiting and zzso the trafficking of various immune cell zzso including T cells and zzso cells, out of the zzso and into zzso They also can be induced to stimulate immune zzso or to be immune zzso In each of these parameters zzso immune stimulation and immune zzso their role can be zzso zzso they have an active role in maintaining zzso zzso their role can be zzso zzso they contribute to zzso In theory, zzso cells are in an ideal location to recruit cells that can mediate immune zzso to tumor zzso Furthermore, they can activate the immune cells as they zzso across the zzso into the zzso However, what is seen is the absence of these protective effects of zzso cells and, instead, the zzso cells succumb to the defense mechanisms of the zzso resulting in their acquisition of a zzso zzso To understand the immune regulatory potential of zzso cells in protecting the host versus the zzso it is useful to better understand the other circumstances in which zzso cells zzso immune zzso Which of the multitude of immune regulatory roles that zzso cells can take on seems to rely on the type of stimulus that they are zzso It also depends on the extent to which they can be manipulated by potential dangers to succumb and contribute toward attack on the zzso This review will explore the zzso and pathological roles of zzso cells as they regulate immune trafficking, immune stimulation and immune zzso in a variety of conditions and will then apply this information to their role in the tumor zzso Strategies to harness the immune regulatory potential of zzso cells are starting to emerge in the zzso zzso zzso from such efforts are expected to be zzso to being able to skew zzso cells from having a zzso role to a zzso zzso
