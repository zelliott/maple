zzso devices zzso carry significant risk of zzso zzso infection zzso zzso zzso increases the likelihood of microbial colonization of the zzso and zzso zzso has been studied for the prevention of zzso associated with zzso We undertook a systematic review to determine the efficacy of zzso lock or flush solution compared with zzso alone in preventing zzso zzso 

zzso databases were searched for relevant publications in English from January 1966 to 1 January zzso We identified zzso controlled trials comparing a zzso lock or flush solution with zzso alone for prevention of zzso associated with long-term zzso zzso effect sizes were calculated with assessment of zzso 

Five randomized, controlled trials involving a total of zzso patients being treated with zzso met the inclusion zzso all five studies were conducted among patients with zzso three of these studies were undertaken in children and two in zzso The summary risk ratio with a zzso lock solution for zzso zzso was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the test for zzso were not statistically significant zzso 

Use of a zzso lock solution in high-risk patient populations being treated with long-term central zzso may reduce the risk of zzso However, there are few zzso trials and zzso limitations of these zzso more robust recommendations regarding the use of zzso to prevent zzso Further adequately powered studies should seek to evaluate the efficacy of zzso and zzso dosage and zzso zzso
