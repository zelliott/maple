Three zzso materials have been zzso from a magnetic zzso zzso and a zzso zzso glass zzso The ratios of zzso glass used in this work were zzso zzso and zzso These materials show zzso and magnetic properties and can be used as zzso for zzso treatment of bone zzso The zzso glass content affects the textural properties of the zzso giving rise to zzso which plays a fundamental role in the formation of an zzso layer on the zzso On the other hand, as the zzso glass content increases, the magnetic properties change due to the diffusion of zzso zzso to the glassy zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso nature of these materials allows the changing of both properties, depending on the requirements of the zzso
