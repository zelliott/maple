Cell zzso molecules mediate the interactions of cells with other cells and with zzso zzso zzso Such interactions may be important in the development of tumor invasion and zzso This article describes a new approach to the evaluation of tumor zzso interactions by utilizing zzso aspiration of zzso zzso 

zzso aspiration was performed on 15 fresh surgical specimens of various types of zzso After partial zzso by zzso zzso zzso tumor cell zzso to collagen Type IV, zzso and zzso was evaluated by counting zzso zzso cells adhering to zzso plastic zzso Frozen tissue sections of the corresponding tumors were studied simultaneously for zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso then were compared with the zzso data for particular zzso 

In general, the majority of the tumors exhibited little or no zzso to collagen or zzso but several tumors showed marked zzso to zzso zzso differences were noted between some tumors of the same zzso zzso Competitive zzso studies performed with two of the tumors (a large cell zzso and a zzso cell zzso showed decreased zzso to zzso in the presence of zzso suggesting at least a partial role for the zzso 1 zzso zzso in zzso the zzso of these tumors to zzso All the tumors examined exhibited strong zzso expression of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and all were negative for zzso Three of the tumors showed weak expression of zzso two of which (a zzso cell zzso and a zzso cell zzso were the tumors that showed the greatest zzso to zzso 

zzso zzso data can be obtained using cell suspensions prepared from zzso zzso and there are marked differences in adhesive properties between particular zzso Although two of the tumors showed a correlation between zzso to zzso and zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not necessarily correlate with zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso In the future, this methodology potentially could be of value in determining which patients may benefit from therapies aimed at zzso tumor zzso zzso
