zzso the development of a new blood supply, is an essential process of zzso growth and zzso Over the past few years, this has led to the consideration of the zzso zzso as an optimal target for zzso zzso The process of zzso consists of a series of interactive events: zzso zzso cells are zzso by zzso factors to degrade the underlying basement zzso to migrate within the zzso zzso to zzso and to zzso themselves into zzso structures which become mature blood zzso During zzso the zzso cells undergo functional changes and show molecular features which are different from normal, zzso zzso These differences can be exploited in order to selectively target zzso zzso and to prevent zzso zzso Two main approaches have been zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso process and vessel formation zzso and zzso direct targeting and destruction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of different origin and mechanism of action have the potential to inhibit zzso and hence zzso zzso This review takes into consideration some zzso zzso that are in development and the leader compounds that are under clinical trial for the treatment of zzso
