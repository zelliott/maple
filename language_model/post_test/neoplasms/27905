zzso analysis, a highly sensitive method for the detection and measurement of zzso zzso zzso and other DNA zzso does not require radioactive test substances and, therefore, can be applied to DNA of zzso including humans exposed to low doses of environmental or occupational zzso The basic procedure zzso the zzso incorporation of zzso into zzso products of DNA, followed by zzso mapping and zzso of the zzso zzso products and quantitative zzso zzso zzso amounts of DNA are zzso Thus the zzso is suited for limited amounts of cells or zzso Various versions of the zzso afford different sensitivities of zzso zzso A single aromatic or zzso zzso in zzso zzso can be detected and measured zzso to zzso zzso zzso DNA or zzso zzso zzso zzso In animal models, the zzso has been successfully applied to a variety of zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso In humans, DNA specimens from cigarette smokers, iron zzso workers, and zzso oven workers whose total aromatic zzso levels ranged from 1 zzso in zzso DNA zzso have been examined by zzso The zzso also detects DNA zzso zzso increase with age in zzso zzso zzso profiles and levels are highly zzso zzso zzso and zzso and also depend on diet zzso zzso zzso a highly efficient method for improving resistance to zzso and extending life span, increased rather than decreased zzso levels in various zzso of male zzso zzso zzso reduced levels of zzso in the target zzso Because of the specificity of this effect, reduction of zzso levels appears to represent a novel zzso for the action of zzso zzso DNA from various zzso was found largely devoid of zzso The results support a possible zzso and zzso role of these DNA zzso
