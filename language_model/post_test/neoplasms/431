The common element in the induction and progression of tumors by all types of zzso may be the random zzso of embryonic and zzso genes to produce a cell with characteristics that are not well regulated in differentiated tissue and thus exhibit relatively autonomous zzso The zzso state is zzso in the same manner as any other differentiated zzso zzso act by zzso the structure of the zzso zzso complex and thus changing the differentiation state of the zzso Survival of the zzso cells selects for those gene expressions which aid the autonomous zzso zzso Some zzso may cause zzso that permit zzso of zzso
