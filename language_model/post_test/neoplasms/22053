To date, we have no valid zzso that serve as proxies for zzso disease to test potential reduced exposure zzso This paper represents the deliberations of four zzso that focused on four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pulmonary disease, cardiovascular disease, and fetal zzso The goal of these zzso was to identify zzso that offer some promise as measures of exposure or toxicity and ultimately may serve as indicators for future disease zzso zzso were based on the relationship of the zzso to what is known about mechanisms of zzso zzso the extent to which the zzso differs among smokers and nonsmokers, and the sensitivity of the zzso to changes in smoking zzso Other promising zzso were zzso No existing zzso have been demonstrated to be zzso of zzso disease, which highlights the importance and urgency of conducting research in this zzso
