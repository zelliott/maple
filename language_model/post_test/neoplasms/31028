We evaluated the zzso toxicity and feasibility of two cycles of high-dose chemotherapy zzso each supported with mobilized peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso patients with zzso or high-risk zzso received zzso zzso zzso The first cycle consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso 500 zzso and zzso 1200 zzso zzso some patients received zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso A second cycle was planned zzso weeks later and consisted of zzso 60 zzso with either zzso 140 zzso or zzso 600 zzso zzso were mobilized with either growth factor alone or zzso followed by growth zzso Thirty-four of 96 enrolled patients zzso did not receive the second zzso The reasons were: patient refusal zzso insurance refusal zzso zzso of cycle 1 zzso no response to cycle 1 zzso and inadequate zzso or poor zzso zzso Of the 33 patients who entered cycle 2 with measurable disease, 28 demonstrated further response after cycle 2 (including 10 who entered zzso One patient died of toxicity after each zzso Hematologic recovery was rapid and complete in most zzso zzso cycles of high-dose chemotherapy supported by zzso are feasible and safe, although many patients fail to receive the second zzso zzso evaluation shows evidence of further zzso efficacy following cycle zzso
