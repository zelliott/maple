zzso in zzso zzso and infection of zzso zzso in cancer patients were zzso and trend in organisms in a cancer hospital was zzso 1) zzso in zzso zzso The success rate of zzso therapy for zzso was zzso if the patients were not under zzso therapy when zzso zzso But recovery from zzso was only zzso if the patients were undergoing zzso therapy when zzso zzso Some zzso of zzso patients under zzso who were not under zzso therapy when zzso developed, recovered from zzso if the zzso count increased in the following 5 zzso Change in the zzso count was an important factor determining the success or failure of zzso therapy for zzso The use of zzso zzso factor may prevent zzso zzso Shortening of the period of zzso or preventing its occurrence should reduce the zzso and the severity of zzso 2) zzso of zzso zzso in cancer zzso Thirty-four cancer patients were associated with zzso zzso Eleven of them were patients with zzso zzso and ten of them were patients of breast zzso Most patients were heavily zzso by chemotherapy and/or zzso before the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed at the onset of zzso zzso Absolute zzso count was under zzso in zzso of these zzso Development of zzso zzso in cancer patients was considered to be due to the depression of zzso immunity which was the result of repeated and continued zzso zzso zzso was found to be effective to treat zzso zzso in these zzso 3) Trend of organisms detected in cancer zzso The frequency of organisms isolated from clinical materials in the National Cancer Center Hospital was compared during the period from 1978 to 1982 and the period from 1983 to zzso The most common zzso detected in both periods was zzso zzso and no change in frequency was zzso But the frequency of zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso and zzso decreased significantly in the latter period while the frequency of zzso zzso zzso and zzso increased markedly in the latter zzso The use of zzso of third generation in the latter period could be one reason for the recent change of organisms detected in the zzso zzso therapy for infection based on the latest and accurate information should be zzso
