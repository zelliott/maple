During the last decades a considerable amount of research has been focused on zzso A number of genetic and signaling defects have been zzso This has allowed the design and screening of a number of zzso drugs for therapeutic zzso One of the main challenges of zzso therapy is to specifically target these drugs to zzso zzso Recently, tumor cell metabolism has been considered as a possible target for cancer zzso It is widely accepted that tumors display an enhanced zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it seems reasonable that disruption of zzso might be a promising candidate for specific zzso zzso Nonetheless, the concept of zzso zzso as the paradigm of tumor cell metabolism has been challenged, as some tumor cells use zzso zzso zzso are of special interest in cancer cell energy zzso as their physiology is linked to the Warburg zzso Besides, their central role in zzso makes these zzso a promising zzso hit zzso for selectively eliminate tumor zzso Thus, it is desirable to have an zzso and reliable model in order to do the screening for energy zzso drugs to be used in cancer zzso From a zzso point of view, the zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor cells share several zzso In this paper we will review these common zzso properties and we will discuss the possibility of using zzso zzso as an early screening test in the research for novel zzso compounds used for the zzso of tumor cell zzso
