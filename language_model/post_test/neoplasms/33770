In a prospective study of about 22,000 men attending a screening zzso serum samples were collected and zzso The concentration of vitamin E zzso was measured in the stored serum samples from zzso men subsequently notified as having cancer and from zzso unaffected controls, matched for age, smoking history and duration of storage of the serum zzso The mean vitamin E level of the cancer subjects was not significantly different from that of their matched zzso The mean level in the cancer subjects who were diagnosed as having cancer before the zzso of one year from the date of blood collection was, however, significantly lower than the mean concentration of their matched controls zzso and zzso zzso respectively, P zzso zzso For subjects whose zzso were diagnosed one or more years after blood collection the difference was not statistically significant either for all zzso or for zzso of six sites considered zzso zzso zzso colon and zzso stomach, zzso central nervous system and zzso The most likely explanation for these results is that the low vitamin E levels observed in these subjects were a zzso consequence, rather than a zzso of the zzso This would explain, at least in part, the overall inverse association between serum vitamin E and risk of cancer observed in the published zzso studies on serum vitamin E and zzso
