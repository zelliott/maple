zzso cells zzso are professional zzso cells currently being used as a cellular zzso in cancer zzso zzso Unfortunately, zzso vaccines have not demonstrated spectacular clinical zzso DC loading with tumor zzso and DC differentiation and zzso still require zzso An alternative technique for providing zzso to DC consists of the direct fusion of zzso cells with tumor zzso These resulting hybrid cells may express both major zzso complex zzso class I and II molecules associated with tumor zzso and the appropriate zzso molecules required for zzso zzso zzso tested in animal models, this approach has now been evaluated in clinical trials, although with limited zzso We zzso and discuss the results from the animal studies and first clinical zzso We also present a new approach to inducing hybrid formation by expression of viral zzso membrane zzso
