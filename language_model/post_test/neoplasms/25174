Cancer is a complex, zzso process in which genetic zzso occurring at a zzso level manifest themselves as functional changes at the cellular and tissue zzso The zzso nature of cancer requires mathematical modeling approaches that can handle multiple zzso and zzso factors acting on different time and space zzso zzso models provide a way to integrate both discrete and continuous variables that are used to represent individual cells and concentration or density fields, zzso Each discrete cell can also be equipped with zzso that drive cell behavior in response to zzso zzso Moreover, the individual cells can interact with one another to form and act as an integrated zzso zzso models form part of a larger class of zzso models that can naturally connect with tumor cell biology and allow for the integration of multiple interacting variables both zzso and zzso and are therefore perfectly suited to a systems biology approach to tumor zzso
