Numerous studies have identified an increased risk of cancer in type 2 zzso We explored the association between zzso therapies and zzso mortality in patients with type 2 diabetes, zzso that agents that increase insulin levels might promote zzso 

This was a zzso cohort study using administrative databases from Saskatchewan zzso zzso mortality was compared among inception zzso of zzso users and zzso zzso zzso zzso Cox zzso was used to estimate the hazard ratio zzso of zzso zzso after adjusting for age, sex, insulin use, and chronic disease zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

We identified zzso new users of zzso or zzso with an average follow-up of zzso zzso zzso years zzso zzso zzso The mean age for the cohort was zzso zzso zzso years, and zzso were zzso Cancer mortality over follow-up was zzso zzso of zzso for zzso zzso users, zzso zzso of zzso for zzso users, and zzso zzso of zzso for subjects who used zzso After zzso adjustment, the zzso cohort had greater zzso mortality compared with the zzso cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso use was associated with an adjusted zzso of zzso mortality of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

Patients with type 2 diabetes exposed to zzso and zzso insulin had a significantly increased risk of zzso mortality compared with patients exposed to zzso It is uncertain whether this increased risk is related to a deleterious effect of zzso and insulin or a protective effect of zzso or due to some zzso effect related to both choice of therapy and cancer zzso
