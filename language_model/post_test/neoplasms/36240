zzso is a novel decoy zzso that efficiently zzso circulating zzso A pediatric phase I trial was conducted to define the zzso zzso zzso maximum tolerated dose zzso and zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso of three to six children with zzso solid tumors received zzso zzso over 60 minutes every 14 days, at zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso sampling and analysis of peripheral blood zzso were conducted with the initial zzso 

zzso eligible patients were zzso 18 were fully zzso for zzso One of six patients receiving zzso zzso developed zzso zzso zzso and two of six receiving zzso zzso developed either zzso tumor pain or tissue zzso None of the six patients receiving zzso zzso developed zzso defining this as the zzso The most common zzso were hypertension and zzso Three patients with zzso zzso zzso and clear cell zzso had stable disease for zzso zzso At the zzso the ratio of zzso zzso serum concentration was zzso on day 8 but only zzso by day zzso A rapid decrease in zzso zzso zzso zzso and increase in zzso growth factor zzso P zzso zzso from baseline was observed in response to zzso by day zzso 

The zzso zzso in children of zzso zzso every 14 days is lower than the adult recommended dose of zzso zzso This dose zzso but does not sustain, free zzso zzso in excess of zzso zzso pain and zzso may be evidence of zzso activity but were zzso
