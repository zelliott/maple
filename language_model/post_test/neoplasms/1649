As many as zzso of human zzso appear to be of zzso zzso Of the more than 50 characterized familial cancer zzso most involve disease affecting multiple zzso and many can be traced to one or more abnormalities in specific zzso zzso these syndromes in humans is a difficult task, especially when it comes to genes that may manifest themselves early in zzso It has been made somewhat easier with the development of genetically engineered mice zzso that zzso mimic many of these zzso human zzso The past 15 years has seen the establishment of mouse lines zzso or zzso zzso for genes known or suspected of being involved in human cancer zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These lines not only provide models for clinical disease and pathology, but also provide avenues to investigate molecular pathology, zzso and zzso interaction, and, ultimately, therapeutic zzso Possibly of even greater importance, they provide a means of looking at zzso and fetal zzso where genetic abnormalities are often first detected and where they may be most easily zzso We will review these mouse models, examine their usefulness in medical research, and furnish sources of animals and zzso
