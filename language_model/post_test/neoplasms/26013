To develop a novel method for processing of fine needle zzso subjected to electron microscopic zzso zzso 

Included 70 cases of poorly differentiated zzso tumors in which a definitive diagnosis was not possible on light microscopic zzso examination and that thus required application of an ancillary technique such as zzso for zzso We have established a novel method of processing, a technique of zzso through nylon mesh filters to eliminate red blood cells zzso and zzso debris, followed by zzso well embedding to avoid loss of diagnostic material during processing without zzso at later steps after zzso zzso thus minimizing the time required for zzso It was successfully carried out in 70 zzso 

The combined technique was extremely effective in eliminating zzso and zzso zzso It also avoided further loss of valuable diagnostic zzso An accurate diagnosis was rendered in 70 zzso that was not possible by zzso zzso The whole procedure saves two to three hours of processing as zzso is not required after the zzso embedding zzso 

This technique was found to be zzso and zzso particularly suitable for developing countries, where financial resources are zzso
