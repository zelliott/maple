zzso zzso zzso to zzso tumor cells consist of zzso zzso In this communication, we have presented the results of experiments, in which these zzso zzso cells were classified based on their surface markers and modes of differentiation depending upon culture zzso zzso cells with a typical zzso of zzso zzso were one of major zzso which could respond to zzso and be differentiated into zzso activated killer zzso zzso zzso cells were also induced from a zzso T cell subset by zzso zzso zzso cells with a zzso of zzso zzso which may belong to the T cells at early stages of zzso could also be induced by stimulation of zzso Finally, it was shown that the zzso cells with a typical zzso of zzso T zzso zzso and a zzso zzso were induced by zzso in the tumor zzso zzso
