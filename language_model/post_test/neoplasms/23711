zzso levels mainly depend on a T zzso zzso The mechanisms responsible for the elevated blood zzso of zzso in advanced solid tumors are still zzso To investigate the role played by the zzso system on zzso release, we have evaluated serum levels of zzso in 10 head and neck cancer patients during zzso subcutaneous administration (3 zzso for 11 consecutive zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso both produced by zzso were also zzso zzso mean concentration significantly enhanced in response to zzso and their rise positively correlated to that in zzso and zzso values, while zzso mean number did not increase during the zzso The present results represent the first in zzso demonstration that zzso release is related to zzso zzso rather than to depend only on zzso zzso
