The processes of cellular growth regulation and cellular metabolism are closely zzso The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which controls many aspects of both of these zzso The zzso changes which occur in transformed cells, many of which are driven by zzso zzso are necessary to support the increased need for zzso zzso zzso and lipids necessary for rapid cellular zzso At the same time, zzso zzso results in coordinated changes in level of expression of gene families which result in increased cellular zzso This interesting duality of zzso effects places it in the mainstream of transformational changes and gives it a very important role in regulating the zzso zzso The effects induced by zzso can occur either as a zzso zzso which is activated by amplification or zzso or as a downstream effect of other activated zzso In either case, it appears that zzso plays a central role in sustaining the changes which occur with zzso Although efforts to use zzso as a therapeutic target have been quite frustrating, it appears that this may change in the next few zzso
