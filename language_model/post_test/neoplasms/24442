zzso domain zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso resulting in suppression of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso cell lines, we examined whether or not zzso can regulate gene expression in a zzso zzso When zzso was zzso with a zzso reporter zzso with various zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression was selectively zzso by zzso but not by other zzso with zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso endowed zzso with the ability to enhance the responsive zzso zzso but deletion of the zzso zzso domain zzso rendered the zzso zzso zzso Considering the inability of zzso which is the zzso form of zzso to function, these results indicate that both the zzso and zzso are necessary for zzso to can activate zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso suppressed the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso interferes with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso for zzso zzso reduced the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso indicating that zzso zzso activates zzso as does zzso In addition to the results obtained in the reporter gene zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso to the nucleus and the expression of an zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso zzso can activate zzso
