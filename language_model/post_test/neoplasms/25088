zzso zzso in cancer include changes in DNA zzso and associated zzso modifications that influence the zzso states and impact gene expression zzso Due to recent technological advantages, the scientific community is now obtaining a better picture of the zzso zzso changes that occur in a cancer zzso These zzso zzso are associated with zzso instability and changes in zzso control which influence the overall gene expression differences seen in many human zzso In this review, we will briefly zzso our current knowledge of the zzso patterns and mechanisms of gene regulation in healthy zzso and relate this to what is known for cancer zzso Our focus will be on DNA zzso We will review the current standing of technologies that have been developed over recent zzso This field is experiencing a revolution in the strategies used to measure zzso zzso which includes the incorporation of next generation sequencing zzso We also will review strategies that zzso zzso information for zzso purposes, with a special emphasis on the potential use of DNA zzso marks for early disease detection and zzso The review will close with an outlook on challenges that this field is zzso
