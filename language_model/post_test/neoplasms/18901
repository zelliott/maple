zzso cancer is one of the most common secondary zzso among childhood cancer zzso However, little evidence exists for effective interventions to promote sun safety behaviors within this zzso 

This small-scale zzso controlled trial examined the efficacy of the zzso Health and zzso Education zzso Program intervention, a multiple health behavior change intervention designed to increase sun safety practices among adolescent survivors of childhood zzso Adolescent survivors of childhood cancer zzso zzso were randomly allocated to a zzso behavioral intervention zzso zzso zzso or zzso control zzso zzso zzso zzso sun safety behaviors were assessed using a zzso zzso scale at baseline and zzso zzso 

Controlling for baseline sun safety, zzso and seasonal zzso intervention participants reported significantly more sun safety practices zzso using sunscreen, zzso sunscreen zzso at zzso zzso than control participants zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggest that zzso was zzso in producing improvements in short-term zzso sun safety practices among adolescent survivors of childhood zzso Future research is needed to build upon this work by incorporating objective measures of sun safety behaviors and examining intervention zzso 

zzso interventions addressing lifestyle factors, including sun safety behaviors, among adolescent survivors of childhood cancer should be integrated into long-term care to reduce the risk for secondary zzso and zzso
