zzso zzso data for 226 chemicals unequivocally defined as zzso or zzso in mice and/or rats by the zzso zzso have been standardized to zzso equivalent zzso according to a modification of the methods of Gold et zzso zzso by zzso zzso with chemical structure, zzso to zzso sites of zzso and extent of zzso activity have been zzso The data obtained add further weight to the proposition that two classes of zzso zzso are present in the zzso zzso zzso that occur predominantly in the dose range zzso zzso and putative zzso zzso that are equally distributed over the dose range less than zzso greater than zzso zzso The latter zzso are characterized by the lack of structural alerts to DNA zzso the absence of zzso to zzso an inability to induce zzso in 8 reference zzso and a strong tendency to be tissue and zzso in their zzso Where comparisons can be made, the present findings for the zzso zzso and zzso are consistent with the recent observations by Gold et zzso for a larger group of zzso
