zzso repair genes are not generally altered in sporadic solid zzso However, point zzso are found scattered throughout the zzso of cancer cells indicating that the repair pathways are zzso To address this point, in this work we focus on the expression pathways rather than in the DNA structure of repair genes related to either zzso stability or essential zzso zzso We present here a novel statistical analysis comparing ten gene expression pathways in human normal and cancer cells using serial analysis of gene expression zzso zzso We find that in cancer cells zzso repair zzso and zzso are the most impaired pathways and have a highly altered diversity of gene expression profile when compared to normal zzso We propose that zzso point zzso in sporadic tumors can be explained by a structurally zzso zzso with a functional disorder generated from its entanglement with the zzso gene zzso
