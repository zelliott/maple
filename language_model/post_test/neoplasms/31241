The effects of food and divided dosing on the zzso of a liquid-filled gelatin capsule zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso with broad clinical activity, was evaluated in patients with advanced solid zzso A group of 13 patients were zzso to treatment with the oral zzso at the recommended phase II dose of 80 zzso per week either in the zzso state or after zzso of a standard zzso Patients were treated 1 week later in the alternate state relative to their first zzso The effects of divided dosing were assessed during the 3rd week, at which time zzso was administered in two divided zzso After the completion of zzso and zzso studies, patients received the oral zzso at a dose of 80 zzso per week in two divided doses to evaluate the feasibility of chronic oral drug zzso Both zzso resulted in small, albeit statistically zzso reductions in the relative zzso of this oral zzso The relative zzso decreased by 22 zzso zzso when treatment followed the zzso of a standard zzso possibly due to a delay in gastrointestinal transit zzso The mean time of maximum plasma concentration zzso increased from zzso zzso zzso h in the zzso state to zzso zzso zzso h in the fed state, although this difference was not statistically zzso Similarly, the relative zzso declined by 16 zzso 51% when zzso was administered in two divided zzso An analysis of dose zzso revealed disproportionate increases in zzso zzso and zzso values with single oral doses above 120 zzso which may account for this zzso The high clearance of zzso which approaches zzso blood flow, and the lack of dose zzso after oral administration, indicate that there is a large zzso effect which may be zzso or zzso above single doses of 120 zzso In addition, the zzso and pharmacological characteristics of oral zzso indicate that treatment after a standard meal or on a divided dosing schedule is zzso zzso oral administration of the agent in two divided doses was also well zzso However, the small reduction in the relative zzso following the zzso of a standard meal and with divided dosing suggest the need for further zzso studies to determine if reductions in drug exposure of this magnitude may portend diminished zzso zzso
