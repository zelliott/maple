zzso A zzso a marker of neuroendocrine cells and an indicator for neuroendocrine zzso is associated with a poor prognosis when detected in tumor zzso based on zzso zzso We sought to determine whether it is possible to detect elevated serum zzso in patients with commonly occurring zzso of zzso zzso zzso was measured in both random and serial serum zzso using a serum zzso zzso developed in our zzso zzso levels of serum zzso were detected in patients with zzso of the zzso breast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels in patients with all types of zzso appeared to parallel the changes of serum dominant tumor markers and were found in zzso containing highly elevated tumor zzso Based on these preliminary findings, perhaps we should monitor zzso in addition to the routinely used tumor zzso during the treatment of patients with zzso to determine if zzso is useful as a zzso marker in zzso other than zzso zzso
