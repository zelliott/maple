On the basis of two universal zzso zzso laws, zzso the zzso dynamic zzso in physics and the zzso zzso metabolism in zzso we studied the dynamic response and the evolution of an zzso zzso system subjected to a periodic external intervention, which is equivalent to the scheme of a zzso or chemotherapy, within the framework of the growth dynamics of zzso Under the zzso of either an abrupt or a gradual change external intervention, the population density of tumors exhibits a dynamic zzso to the zzso The area of dynamic zzso loop characterizes a sort of zzso relationship of the dynamic responding of treated tumors with the dose consumption of accumulated external intervention per cycle of zzso Scaling the area of dynamic zzso zzso against the intensity of an external intervention, we deduced a characteristic quantity which was defined as the theoretical therapeutic effectiveness of treated tumor and related with the destructive metabolism of tumor under zzso The calculated zzso profiles, namely the dose zzso per cycle of intervention versus the therapeutic effectiveness, could be well scaled into a universal zzso formula regardless of either an abrupt or a gradual change intervention zzso We present a new concept, zzso the zzso zzso and the dose zzso zzso to zzso the new finding observed in the growth and zzso dynamics of a modulated zzso zzso
