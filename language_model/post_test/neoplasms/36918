zzso zzso zzso is a zzso ubiquitous and zzso active protein zzso that can use both zzso and zzso as zzso donors with specificity for zzso zzso in the vicinity of zzso zzso zzso Recent results show that the zzso is involved in transcription, zzso proliferation and in various steps of zzso The zzso zzso zzso consists of two zzso zzso and two regulatory zzso The structure of the zzso zzso with the fixed positioning of the zzso segment in the active zzso through its own zzso region suggests a regulation at the zzso level making a regulation by second zzso zzso The high conservation of the zzso zzso from zzso to man and its role in the zzso complex supports this zzso The regulatory zzso has been far less zzso throughout zzso zzso the existence of different zzso proteins together with the observation of zzso zzso levels in tumor cells and the reported association of zzso protein with key proteins in signal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are suggestive for an additional zzso role of zzso protein beside being the regulatory compound in the zzso zzso
