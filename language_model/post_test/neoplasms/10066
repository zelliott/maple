zzso and established human zzso cell lines obtained from the same zzso were compared for their capacity to retract a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in normal zzso cells, reduced in established zzso lines, and lost in zzso cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiency seemed to be related to the degree of cellular spreading within the zzso at the end of the zzso Previous works and the present study suggest that zzso zzso zzso is correlated with some steps of cell transformation in zzso
