In most centers treating cancer patients, significant progress has been made in permitting patients to survive even prolonged courses of zzso This has resulted from a better understanding of the epidemiology of infection and the points during the clinical course when they pose a risk for the patient with prolonged zzso zzso benefit has been derived from the availability of more potent zzso zzso agents and from organized strategies for when they should be zzso how and when they should be zzso and for how long they should be zzso The possibility that the duration of zzso might be attenuated in patients receiving chemotherapy now seems real with the ever-expanding repertoire of zzso and other zzso agents that augment the zzso and immune zzso zzso with the use of peripheral stem cell zzso or the zzso of genes into zzso stem cells that might render them resistant to the zzso effects of certain zzso agents, it now seems possible to envision regimens that might alter the consequences of zzso as we have come to know zzso It is zzso therefore, as additional experience is garnered and as chemotherapy regimens are zzso that the optimal approach to the management of the patient with prolonged zzso will include the rational use of antibiotics together with zzso and other zzso zzso such regimens will permit the delivery of chemotherapy in a manner that might enhance its zzso activity and improve the outcome of patients with zzso
