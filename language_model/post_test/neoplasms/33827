The zzso zzso family consists of only two members, namely zzso growth factors zzso and zzso zzso During zzso zzso is highly expressed in the zzso period, whereas zzso expression reaches the maximum level around zzso Both proteins are localized in the zzso zzso processes of the embryonic brain, along which neural stem cells migrate and zzso zzso and zzso zzso can induce neural zzso In addition, deposits of zzso and/or zzso are found in neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease and multiple system zzso Both molecules are induced in zzso zzso by zzso zzso In this context, it is interesting that LDL zzso protein is a zzso for zzso and zzso and this zzso has been implicated in the zzso of Alzheimer's zzso zzso and zzso share zzso and show similar biological activities that include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These activities explain how these molecules are involved in zzso zzso is detected in human zzso specimens from zzso stages to advanced zzso Strong expression of zzso is also detected in several zzso although, in general, zzso is expressed more intensely and in a wide range of zzso than zzso The blood zzso level is frequently elevated in advanced human zzso decreases after surgical removal of the tumors, and is correlated with zzso zzso Thus, it is a good market for evaluating the progress of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso show zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are candidate molecular targets for therapy for human zzso
