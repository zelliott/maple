zzso zzso of zzso suspensions prepared by zzso zzso from zzso zzso tissue suffers from several major zzso The most important factors that influence the results are the high and unpredictable zzso of variation zzso of the zzso peak in the DNA zzso and reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso with DNA, resulting from protein zzso by zzso 

In this study we introduce a heating step (2 h incubation in zzso solution at 80 degrees zzso prior to a brief zzso zzso of tissue sections in the protocol for DNA content analysis of zzso and zzso zzso This new method is compared with established methods for the preparation of cell suspensions from frozen and zzso zzso with respect to cell yield, DNA zzso resolution, DNA dye zzso zzso cell cycle zzso and zzso retrieval in various zzso and zzso zzso 

The recovery of single cells from the zzso sections was doubled by the heat treatment step, while the limited time of zzso resulted in decreased cell zzso Furthermore, an increased fraction of cells became zzso while these zzso stained cells also exhibited a higher mean zzso zzso The DNA zzso prepared from cell suspensions obtained according to this new protocol showed a significantly improved resolution, leading to a better identification of zzso cell zzso Heat zzso of zzso archival tissue sections showed zzso zzso zzso similar to, or even better than, those of fresh zzso zzso independent of duration of zzso 

This new method, making use of routinely available zzso retrieval principles, thus allows high-resolution DNA analysis of routinely fixed and zzso tissue zzso Using external reference cells, zzso and zzso zzso of DNA zzso can be zzso
