To determine whether zzso agents given zzso or zzso decrease morbidity and mortality in patients with cancer complicated by zzso 

zzso of zzso trials of zzso B, various zzso soluble zzso of zzso B (for example, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso compared with zzso or no zzso 

Trials conducted anywhere in the zzso 

Patients with cancer complicated by zzso 

zzso invasive zzso infection zzso as positive blood culture, zzso zzso or lung or deep tissue zzso and zzso 

24 trials with zzso zzso patients were zzso the total number of deaths was zzso zzso or empirical treatment with zzso as a group bad no effect on mortality zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso to zzso zzso B decreased mortality significantly zzso zzso to zzso but the studies were small and the difference in number of deaths was only zzso zzso treatment decreased the zzso of invasive zzso infection zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso For every 73 patients treated zzso confidence zzso to 48 to zzso one case of zzso invasion was prevented in surviving zzso 

There seems to be no survival benefit of zzso agents given zzso or zzso to patients with cancer complicated by zzso These agents should be restricted to patients with proved infection and those in zzso zzso A large, definitive zzso controlled trial of zzso B is zzso
