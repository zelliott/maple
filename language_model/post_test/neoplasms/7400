In view of the historic importance of zzso workers in the field of occupational medicine, it is surprising that until very recently little data was available on the mortality experience of these zzso The problem in most studies lies in identifying the zzso workers, because zzso strictly speaking, refers to the melting of zzso for the purposes of recovering metals, whereas smelters sometimes perform the operations of roasting, zzso zzso zzso and zzso These distinctions are not made in most mortality zzso Most mortality studies of zzso workers conducted to date have shown some excess in lung zzso For lead, copper, cadmium, and zzso smelters a different zzso agent has been proposed for zzso These different explanations arise partly from different initial perspectives in conducting the zzso In this paper, data are presented on a current zzso study of males who worked a year or more during the period January 1, 1940 to December 31, 1964 at a copper zzso in Tacoma, zzso This zzso (and zzso handled a copper ore with a relatively high zzso content and produced zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso of the original study population was traced through zzso Of the zzso who were found to have died, death certificates were obtained for zzso or zzso For all causes of death, the mortality rates in this zzso expressed as a zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso higher than that expected based on the United States white male mortality zzso A total of 104 respiratory system zzso were observed compared to zzso expected zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso Respiratory cancer rates were found to be elevated in both smokers and zzso Overall, a gradual rise in zzso for respiratory cancer was observed with increasing duration of exposure but not with an increasing zzso from onset of zzso This observation is consistent with the notion that the effects of zzso on cancer zzso disappear with zzso This phenomenon has also been observed for cigarette smokers and zzso zzso Additional analyses are planned for the Tacoma zzso which will examine mortality according to process as well as by exposure to zzso and other zzso The importance of studies of workers at other kinds of smelters and zzso is zzso
