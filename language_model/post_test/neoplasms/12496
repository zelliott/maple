We have developed an zzso platform which combines heat shock proteins zzso with protein zzso such as viral or cancer targets, into a single zzso fusion zzso zzso data demonstrate the ability of zzso fusion proteins to induce zzso zzso T zzso Type 1 zzso and zzso zzso One zzso fusion zzso zzso is now in clinical development for therapy of diseases caused by human zzso zzso zzso infection is associated with development of zzso zzso zzso or zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been shown in efficacy trials to be active against zzso warts and zzso zzso and a trial is zzso in another zzso indication, zzso respiratory zzso Having observed therapeutic activity for our lead product zzso in humans, we are currently developing zzso fusion proteins as therapeutic vaccines for other chronic viral zzso Potential targets include zzso B, zzso zzso zzso C, and human zzso zzso
