For the zzso of cancer risks from environmental zzso knowledge of the target dose is essential, dose being defined as the time integral of concentration in target zzso In zzso doses from chronic or intermittent zzso are best determined from established zzso levels of zzso zzso of zzso compounds or zzso For dose monitoring, zzso zzso is preferred to DNA for several reasons: accessibility in large zzso availability of methods for chemical zzso and zzso life span due to absence of zzso For these reasons, and because of the zzso of rates of DNA and zzso zzso formation, zzso zzso levels give better information on cumulative DNA zzso levels than do direct measurement of DNA zzso The scientific background of zzso zzso zzso target dose determination, and risk zzso based on the relative zzso zzso with zzso as reference standard, is reviewed and zzso The sensitivity of the method for zzso zzso measurement permits determination of zzso where the associated annual cancer risk is less than 1 per zzso Besides application for studies of metabolism by determination of in zzso doses in exposed animals and humans, as a basis for risk zzso zzso zzso measurement is used for hygienic surveillance of occupational zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso techniques gives a tool for identification of zzso zzso not only in individuals with known exposure, but also for characterization of zzso to zzso from compounds acting as zzso zzso in the background zzso This is the large fraction of the total number of cancer cases that occur among individuals without known zzso
