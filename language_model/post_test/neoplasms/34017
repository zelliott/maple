The zzso zzso zzso are a new class of zzso agents that inhibit the proliferation of tumor cells in culture and in zzso by inducing cell cycle arrest, differentiation and/or zzso zzso zzso and zzso play important roles in the zzso of zzso zzso and the regulation of gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso core zzso in most regions of zzso but affects the expression of only a small subset of zzso leading to zzso zzso of some zzso but repression of an equal or larger number of other zzso zzso proteins such as zzso factors are also targets for zzso with varying functional zzso zzso enhances the activity of some zzso factors such as the tumor zzso zzso and the zzso differentiation factor zzso but may repress zzso activity of others including T cell factor and the zzso zzso Recent studies in our laboratory and others have shown that the zzso zzso alpha zzso can be zzso in response to zzso zzso zzso suppressing zzso sensitivity and regulating zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso Conservation of the zzso zzso motif in other nuclear receptors suggests that zzso may play an important regulatory role in diverse nuclear zzso signaling zzso A number of structurally diverse zzso zzso zzso have shown potent zzso efficacy with little toxicity in zzso in animal zzso Several compounds are currently in early phase clinical development as potential treatments for solid and zzso zzso both as zzso and in combination with zzso and differentiation zzso This report reviews the biology and clinical development of zzso zzso zzso for cancer zzso
