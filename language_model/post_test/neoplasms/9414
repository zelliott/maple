zzso ultrasound zzso achieves high-resolution images of the zzso duct and zzso while avoiding the risks of zzso zzso retrograde zzso It appears comparable to zzso zzso resonance zzso although its use is less widely zzso We aimed to zzso zzso test performance in suspected zzso disease with zzso 

zzso search (January zzso zzso selected reference lists, external experts, and manual search of abstracts were zzso Studies permitting zzso of 2 zzso 2 tables for zzso versus a gold standard were zzso zzso models were used to estimate pooled sensitivity and specificity after adjusting for a number of potential zzso zzso receiver operating characteristic analysis, with the sensitivity corresponding to the point on the receiver operating characteristic curve where sensitivity equals specificity zzso and area under the curve, was zzso The effects of sample size, quality, disease prevalence and spectrum, zzso zzso type, and zzso era on diagnostic performance were zzso Performance regarding presence of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso 

zzso eligible, zzso studies met inclusion criteria zzso zzso zzso had a high overall pooled sensitivity zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and specificity zzso zzso for zzso obstruction zzso under the curve zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had higher sensitivity zzso zzso and specificity zzso zzso for zzso than for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Smaller studies and ones mainly studying patients with suspected strictures were associated with lower test zzso 

There is excellent overall accuracy for zzso in diagnosing zzso with less impressive results for zzso (when zzso aspiration is not zzso
