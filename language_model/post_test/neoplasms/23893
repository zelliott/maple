In zzso trials, it is not uncommon to compare the survival of the patients who responded to therapy to the survival of the zzso while choosing the beginning of therapy as time zzso This comparison is biased because part of the survival time of the zzso is the time between the start of therapy and response, which is guaranteed by the observation of the zzso The survival experience of zzso must be studied starting from the observation of zzso A significant difference between the survival experiences of zzso and zzso is often considered as evidence of a zzso relation between response and better survival, or even as demonstrating the efficacy of the zzso A zzso relation between response and survival is certainly biologically plausible but the response may as well be associated with some zzso factors, the selection of zzso leading to the selection of patients with a better zzso independently of the zzso The conclusion that the efficacy of the treatment is demonstrated assumes that the non responders, which represent treatment failures, are a control group which can be compared to the zzso This is absolutely untenable, because the two groups are likely to be very zzso
