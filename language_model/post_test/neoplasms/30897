In zzso particular emphasis is placed on the zzso fluctuation of dose in small target volumes such as individual cell zzso or zzso zzso and their relevance to zzso zzso Thus zzso is intimately associated with models of radiation zzso There are three principal areas where zzso has been zzso zzso radiation protection, zzso high LET zzso zzso zzso therapy, and zzso incorporated zzso and in this latter category the importance of zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso is becoming increasingly zzso The objective of zzso is the complete characterization of energy deposition within all target volumes throughout the tissue of zzso The importance and relevance of this pursuit will depend upon the properties of the zzso emissions and the spatial distribution of the zzso relative to the target zzso If the distribution of internal zzso within both zzso and normal tissue is uniform, the application of zzso to zzso zzso is limited to zzso and zzso zzso Under such circumstances the traditional zzso zzso for the evaluation of tumor and tissue doses from the commonly used zzso is entirely zzso This, however, is rarely the zzso When the distribution of zzso zzso is zzso techniques of dose averaging over volumes greater in size than the individual target volumes can become inadequate zzso of the biological zzso The concepts, methods, and realm of zzso of zzso within the field of zzso are emphasized in this zzso
