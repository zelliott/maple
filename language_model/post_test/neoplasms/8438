zzso regulation is defined as a mechanism of self-control in growth and zzso this mode of regulation among zzso zzso cells is zzso zzso zzso mechanisms zzso zzso zzso controlled production and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Distribution of zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso by cells of functional receptors for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso integration of signals zzso by zzso zzso zzso Growth zzso zzso Maintenance of autonomous control of growth and/or differentiation state in the progeny zzso and biological evidence for most of these steps in various transformed cells makes it possible to analyze zzso control as a multifaceted zzso This process depends on tumor zzso and zzso on time and on external influences on zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso breast zzso We review the quantitative aspects of experimental evidence for zzso control in tumors and examine the zzso and some zzso concepts in creating zzso zzso and zzso verifiable mathematical models of zzso zzso
