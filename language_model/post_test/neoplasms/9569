A study was conducted to evaluate zzso the correlation between zzso clearance and zzso of zzso previously obtained in 21 zzso 

zzso zzso were performed in 17 patients 24 h before zzso treatment as zzso zzso and zzso plasma zzso were determined by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso fraction in plasma was performed using zzso zzso 

zzso correlation was observed between observed plasma zzso zzso zzso and values predicted from zzso plasma clearance zzso zzso plasma zzso fraction estimated from serum zzso zzso level zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, after splitting of the prospective data set according to zzso no correlation was observed for males zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), then strong correlation was observed for females zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis was performed from data obtained in the women included in the first study and those of this prospective study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was significantly correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso according to the relationship (with zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso may be used to predict zzso zzso in zzso but not in zzso
