Cell death plays an important role in cancer growth and zzso as well as in the efficiency of zzso Although zzso is commonly regarded as the principal mechanism of programmed cell death, it has been increasingly reported that several zzso agents do not only induce zzso but other forms of cell death such as zzso zzso and zzso catastrophe, as well as the state of permanent loss of zzso capacity known as zzso A deeper understanding of what we know about zzso death is rather relevant considering the emerging knowledge of zzso cell death signaling zzso and the fact that many tumors have the zzso zzso seriously zzso In this review we examine the effects that various zzso agents have on pathways involved in the different cell death zzso Novel and specific zzso agents directed toward members of the cell death signaling pathways are being developed and currently being tested in clinical zzso If we precisely activate or inhibit molecules that mediate the diversity of cell death zzso we might succeed in more effective and less toxic zzso
