It is well known that zzso aromatic zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso have zzso properties and may cause many types of zzso in human zzso zzso zzso might be due to variation in genes zzso for zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso Our study aimed to investigate the effect of genetic zzso of zzso zzso and zzso on genetic damage in 115 zzso workers exposed to zzso in their work zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso were determined by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to evaluate genetic damage among 115 coal zzso workers and 105 control zzso 

Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso individually as well as zzso showed significant association zzso with genetic damage as measured by tail moment zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in control and exposed zzso 

In our study we found significant association of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with genetic damage suggesting that these zzso may zzso the effects of zzso exposure in occupational zzso
