During an investigation into the apparent natural zzso of normal zzso zzso toward the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells in zzso it was found that the zzso zzso from nine different zzso strains of mice, as well as zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso target zzso However, zzso target cells were actively zzso under the same zzso zzso of target cells occurred independently of the zzso event, as measured by counting residual tumor cells at intervals or by pulsing cultures with zzso zzso zzso zzso both of which parameters were relatively the same in the presence or absence of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso of zzso cells was not confined to tumor cells since adherent labeled zzso zzso zzso cells, mouse zzso zzso and suspended zzso zzso zzso were also induced to release zzso faster in the presence than in the absence of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were not zzso by normal zzso zzso zzso treatment of resident zzso zzso did not induce a stronger zzso effect than that induced by zzso zzso but it did result in zzso zzso of DNA synthesis by tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a higher specific zzso release from tumor cells than the release from zzso zzso zzso target cells zzso with the less zzso zzso were also more predisposed to the zzso action of normal zzso while zzso target cells were relatively unaffected by the presence of zzso Thus certain types of normal and zzso cells may become highly susceptible to zzso or their products after the target cell DNA had incorporated radioactive zzso
