An zzso molecular dynamics simulation of a zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso block zzso was performed in zzso solution at zzso K and 1 zzso Such zzso have received considerable attention as carriers in drug delivery zzso In this study, we used zzso consisting of 11 zzso units and 9 zzso units as zzso Starting from the zzso arranged zzso the calculation predicted an equilibrium state consisting of a slightly elliptical zzso structure with a zzso zzso inner core and a zzso zzso outer zzso The zzso structure was zzso stable during the zzso with the zzso blocks showing a compact zzso zzso and the zzso blocks an zzso zzso Multiple hydrogen bonds with zzso water molecules stabilized the zzso zzso of the zzso blocks, leading to their zzso as shown by longer residence times of water molecules near the zzso zzso oxygen atoms compared with that of bulk zzso Some water molecules have also been found distributed within the zzso zzso they showed continuous exchange with bulk water during the zzso Those molecules existed mostly as a cluster in spaces between the zzso forming hydrogen bonds among themselves as well as with the zzso core through zzso groups such as zzso and zzso The water molecules forming hydrogen bonds with the zzso may play an important role in the stabilization of the zzso zzso
