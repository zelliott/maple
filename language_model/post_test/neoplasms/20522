In zzso zzso optical zzso provides a tool to assess tissue architecture and zzso with contrast and resolution similar to that provided by standard zzso need for physical tissue zzso In this article, we focus on optical imaging technologies that have the potential to dramatically improve the zzso zzso and therapy of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are associated with a variety of zzso zzso and molecular changes, which currently can be assessed only through zzso painful zzso zzso imaging is zzso suited to detecting zzso zzso because it can detect zzso and zzso zzso with zzso resolution throughout the entire zzso zzso zzso techniques can be implemented zzso in real time, and at low cost to survey the tissue surface at zzso Our manuscript focuses primarily on zzso that currently are the most developed: zzso zzso zzso zzso and optical zzso zzso zzso However, recent advances in zzso zzso zzso also are reviewed zzso We discuss the basic principles of these emerging technologies and their current and potential applications in early cancer zzso We also present research activities focused on development of zzso contrast agents that can enhance the zzso features important for cancer detection and that have the potential to allow vital molecular imaging of zzso zzso In conclusion, we discuss future improvements to the technology needed to develop robust clinical zzso
