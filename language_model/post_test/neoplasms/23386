zzso cancer patients who are most at risk for zzso zzso zzso is essential to improve timely delivery of zzso Several studies have been performed to identify novel candidate zzso but no agreement has yet been zzso In this light, we sought to analyze whether a dynamic evaluation of early changes of activated protein C zzso function during chemotherapy could be zzso of a first zzso episode in cancer zzso thus improving risk zzso 

A retrospective zzso pilot study was conducted to investigate the zzso of a dynamic evaluation of a novel zzso zzso generation zzso zzso zzso zzso in predicting zzso in 208 ambulatory cancer patients, enrolled on the basis of tight inclusion criteria, prior to start and before the second cycle of a new chemotherapy zzso 

zzso analysis of samples showed the occurrence of an acquired zzso resistance during chemotherapy, which was zzso of zzso zzso Cox zzso hazards survival analysis showed that early zzso changes predicted zzso zzso zzso decreasing zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso which was confirmed in the zzso model zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso of patients according to a risk assessment model showed a zzso zzso for stable zzso decreasing zzso zzso results in an intermediate risk zzso 

We may thus conclude that early changes of zzso zzso in patients on active chemotherapy enhance zzso risk stratification, helping in identifying a population of cancer patients who might benefit from zzso
