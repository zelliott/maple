This is the second updated version of a Cochrane review first published in zzso 4, 2003 of The Cochrane Library and first updated in zzso zzso has been used for many years to relieve zzso zzso zzso in either immediate release or modified release form remains the zzso of choice for moderate or severe cancer zzso 

To determine the efficacy of oral zzso in zzso cancer pain, and assess the zzso and severity of adverse zzso 

We searched the following zzso Cochrane zzso zzso and zzso Care Group Trials Register (June zzso Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso (The Cochrane Library zzso zzso 5, zzso zzso zzso to June zzso and zzso zzso to June zzso 

Published zzso controlled trials zzso using zzso or active zzso reporting on the zzso effect of oral zzso in adults and children with cancer zzso Trials with fewer than ten participants were zzso 

One review author extracted data, which were checked by another review zzso There were insufficient comparable data for zzso to be undertaken or to produce numbers needed to treat zzso for the zzso zzso We extracted any available data on the number or proportion of participants with zzso worse than mild zzso or treatment success zzso satisfied, or very good or excellent on patient global impression zzso 

Ten new studies zzso zzso were identified for this update, bringing the total of included studies to 62, with zzso zzso zzso studies used a zzso design ranging from one to 15 days, with the greatest number (11) for seven days for each arm of the zzso studies compared oral zzso modified release zzso preparations with zzso immediate release zzso Fourteen studies compared zzso in different zzso six of these included 24-hour modified release zzso Fifteen studies compared zzso with other zzso Six studies compared zzso with other zzso Two studies compared oral zzso with zzso zzso Three studies compared zzso with zzso by a different route of zzso Two studies compared zzso with zzso at different times and two compared zzso with zzso given at a different zzso One study was found comparing each of the zzso zzso tablet with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso with zzso and oral zzso with zzso zzso this update a standard of zzso worse than mild zzso was set equivalent to a score of zzso zzso or less on a visual analogue pain intensity scale zzso or the equivalent in other pain zzso zzso studies achieved this level of pain relief on average, and no study reported that good levels of pain relief were not zzso Where results were reported for individual participants in 17 studies, zzso worse than mild zzso was achieved by zzso of participants zzso and an outcome equivalent to treatment success in zzso zzso is an effective zzso for cancer zzso zzso relief did not differ between zzso and zzso zzso release versions of zzso were effective for 12- or 24-hour dosing depending on the zzso Daily doses in studies ranged from 25 zzso to 2000 zzso with an average of between 100 zzso and 250 zzso zzso zzso was undertaken with both instant release and modified release zzso A small number of participants did not achieve adequate analgesia with zzso zzso effects were common and approximately zzso of participants discontinued treatment because of intolerable adverse zzso 

The effectiveness of oral zzso has stood the test of time, but the zzso trial literature for zzso is small given the importance of this zzso Most trials recruited fewer than 100 participants and did not provide appropriate data for zzso Only a few reported how many people had good pain relief, but where it was reported, over zzso had no worse than mild pain within a reasonably short time zzso The review demonstrates the wide dose range of zzso used in studies, and that a small percentage of participants are unable to tolerate oral zzso The review also shows the wide range of study designs, and inconsistency in zzso zzso Trial design was frequently based on zzso of zzso or zzso to achieve adequate zzso then crossing participants over in zzso design zzso It was not clear if these trials are sufficiently powered to detect any clinical differences between zzso or zzso zzso New studies added to the review reinforce the view that it is possible to use modified release zzso to zzso to zzso zzso There is qualitative evidence that oral zzso has much the same efficacy as other available zzso
