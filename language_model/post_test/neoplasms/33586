The cellular interactions and the surface molecules involved in the generation and the expression of zzso zzso zzso activities in zzso in blood zzso cells zzso from cancer patients and healthy individuals against zzso and zzso tumors were zzso The depletion of a zzso zzso from zzso at the initiation of in zzso cultures in zzso zzso zzso markedly zzso with the generation of zzso zzso zzso of the same number of zzso zzso zzso cells to the zzso population restored the generation of zzso The requirement of the zzso zzso in in zzso induction of zzso activities was observed only in zzso zzso Furthermore, selective zzso of zzso and zzso receptors on zzso with the appropriate zzso zzso zzso during the induction zzso of zzso responses profoundly inhibited the generation of zzso Thus, zzso expression of zzso molecules and zzso molecules were necessary for the maximum zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells in short-term cultures in zzso
