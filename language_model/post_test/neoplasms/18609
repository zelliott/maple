To create and validate a specific tool to evaluate the pressure zzso risk in cancer zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso in Oncology zzso was developed and subsequently validated against the Norton and Braden scales in order to efficiently and reliably evaluate the pressure zzso risk in adult cancer patients, with various sites and stages of the illness (both zzso and zzso zzso Two series of prevalence surveys (three surveys over two days, at two-month zzso were conducted in one and then two French Cancer zzso in 2002 and 2009, zzso The surveys investigated a total of 933 zzso 

zzso zzso zzso analysis identified three key items as being zzso of the development of pressure zzso in cancer patients zzso zzso and zzso all with similar odds ratio zzso A score was defined using this zzso model, the zzso score zzso + zzso + zzso 

The extreme simplicity of this scale may appear zzso but the zzso is a simple, reliable and validated zzso which allows zzso evaluation of each patient's risk and, zzso rapid introduction of appropriate zzso
