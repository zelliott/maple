This article describes a method of assessing the zzso consequences of zzso dose zzso produced in tumors by biologically targeted zzso zzso The analysis is based on a simple mathematical model that assumes all tumor cells are zzso zzso 

Using the zzso zzso model, it is possible to represent an absorbed dose distribution by a biologically effective dose zzso volume zzso zzso The zzso transform of the zzso yields an equivalent uniform biologically effective zzso This is a zzso value that fully describes the zzso effect of a zzso absorbed dose zzso In this article, for the purposes of zzso zzso zzso zzso are represented by normal zzso 

zzso absorbed dose zzso are inefficient in zzso tumors and become zzso less effective as the mean dose zzso The loss in effectiveness is most severe for zzso zzso 

Several approaches may alleviate the consequences of zzso zzso These include the use of smaller targeting zzso zzso with longer zzso zzso zzso administration of biologically targeted zzso therapy and combined zzso zzso
