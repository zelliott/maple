The expressed sequence tag zzso databases are an attractive starting point for gene discovery for diseases like zzso zzso of gene targets from these sequences (both known and zzso in zzso requires a comprehensive expression zzso We identified from the Cancer Gene Anatomy Project database zzso a hit called zzso zzso zzso that was expressed in the pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso a neuroendocrine zzso exerts zzso effects in zzso and stimulates the growth of zzso cell lines in zzso High affinity zzso receptors zzso are expressed in zzso cell lines and in some primary zzso To date, a comprehensive expression profile of the zzso in diverse zzso and normal zzso has not been zzso A zzso expression of zzso if zzso may provide a basis for a diagnostic and potential therapeutic zzso We demonstrate that the zzso is expressed in a variety of zzso cell lines as well as primary tumors, but only in a select few normal zzso The expression of zzso on the other hand, was detected in many normal zzso but not in the zzso cell zzso The zzso expression however, was detected in the primary zzso We further demonstrate that zzso expression is zzso by zzso deprivation in the prostate cancer zzso These results demonstrate the usefulness of a panel of zzso zzso for rapid validation of potential cancer zzso
