The zzso an isolated, agrarian people from southern China, migrated to the mountainous regions of what are today Vietnam, zzso and zzso Minnesota has the second largest zzso population in the United zzso The authors compared zzso of common genetic zzso believed to influence risk of zzso to determine whether zzso in the zzso are different from those in other Asian populations and in white zzso 

zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso X-ray repair cross zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso 280 zzso and zzso 399 zzso zzso was performed by zzso analysis using DNA isolated from newborn zzso spots provided by the Minnesota Department of zzso 

The zzso had significantly higher zzso of the zzso T zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso and had significantly lower zzso of the G zzso in zzso zzso and the T zzso in zzso zzso compared with white zzso The zzso also were significantly more likely to lack the zzso and zzso genes compared with whites zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were similar for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at these zzso also were compared with those reported for other Asian populations and showed notable differences between the zzso and zzso zzso and Japanese zzso 

The genetic differences identified have implications for both cancer zzso and prognosis in this unique zzso
