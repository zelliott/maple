The potential of zzso zzso radiation therapy to improve the efficacy of zzso is one of the most important technical advances in recent zzso The potential benefit of improved local control from dose escalation must be weighed against the potential cost of increased complications to normal zzso 

We evaluated the cost-benefit of zzso zzso radiation therapy in terms of the benefit to tumor cure weighed against the cost of complications to normal zzso Assessment of current data shows that problems remain in adequately defining variables that contribute to both the tumor cure probability zzso and normal tissue complication probability zzso For tumor cure zzso identifying the dose escalation needed for cure for the most tumor sites as well as precisely defining tumor volume remain zzso For normal tissue complication zzso inadequate clinical data on toxicity to normal tissue for different tumor sites continue to make it difficult to use methods that estimate zzso such as zzso zzso as proposed by Lyman, to the clinical zzso 

zzso zzso radiation therapy is a promising new technology that may substantially improve the efficacy of radiation zzso More clinical research, however, is needed to recognize the costs and benefits of this new zzso zzso zzso control zzso More information is needed on the accurate definition of the target volume as well as on the amount of radiation necessary to cure different tumor zzso zzso zzso tissue complication zzso zzso for determining toxicity to normal tissue are zzso Current calculations based on various models are zzso
