The high and low molecular mass forms of human zzso zzso Mr zzso and low Mr zzso were zzso to zzso and the human vascular zzso zzso was partially zzso The zzso molecules were zzso with zzso and zzso of zzso binding and zzso of binding were carried zzso The high Mr form was almost as good an inhibitor as the low Mr form in the binding reaction between zzso low Mr zzso and specific zzso indicating that the low Mr zzso is a part of the high Mr zzso This zzso could be only partly zzso indicating that the high Mr zzso has zzso zzso which are not present on the low Mr zzso The human vascular zzso zzso preparation partly inhibited the zzso binding zzso zzso proteins could be responsible for this zzso zzso Various human zzso inhibited the binding reaction between the two forms of zzso and zzso indicating that normally either zzso or an zzso zzso zzso is present in human zzso The zzso capacity of zzso from patients with zzso disease was not different from that of other zzso
