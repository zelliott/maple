In a recent paper zzso zzso zzso 38, zzso zzso the authors presented a zzso system which combines the zzso ease of the zzso zzso with additional information provided by zzso for use with zzso zzso In addition to the absorbed dose zzso specific zzso to the targets zzso zzso this system gives the spread zzso zzso in values of this specific energy received by individual zzso It also gives the fraction of targets receiving zero (or any number zzso zzso In this paper, input quantities are presented for zzso energies and cell and nuclear sizes appropriate for the zzso being zzso The quantities include S values for the usual determination of the absorbed dose along with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso the average and average square, respectively, of the zzso specific zzso Using zzso procedures described previously zzso zzso 19, zzso zzso the zzso zzso of specific energy are determined for the given zzso zzso source locations, and target zzso From these zzso the values for the input quantities are zzso Sources considered are zzso those located inside and on the surface of the target cell and an zzso source in the medium external to the zzso zzso those distributed zzso on either side of a plane boundary or on the surface of the plane with a zzso target at various distances from the zzso and zzso those located either inside or on the surface of a zzso boundary centered zzso to the zzso Examples show how the input quantities are used to provide the spread in zzso values and the probability of any number of hits for zzso of cells exposed to these zzso Thus a complete zzso analysis involving the calculation of zzso specific energy zzso is not necessary to provide this zzso Such information may be useful in interpreting the biological response due to zzso zzso
