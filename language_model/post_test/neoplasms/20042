The concept of zzso has recently evolved and has been described as zzso zzso zzso or zzso consisting of multiple and different cell types interacting with each other under closely controlled conditions, grown in a zzso zzso and mimicking the complex structures and cellular interactions in and between different cell types and zzso in zzso enabling the real time monitoring of cellular zzso In combination with the emerging zzso zzso zzso stem zzso field this development offers unprecedented opportunities to develop human in zzso models for healthy and diseased organ zzso enabling the investigation of fundamental mechanisms in disease development, drug toxicity zzso drug target discovery and drug development, and the replacement of animal zzso zzso the genetic background of the zzso donor in the organ or disease model carries the promise to move towards zzso zzso clinical zzso reducing costs for drug development and zzso the concept of personalized medicine and companion zzso During the zzso workshop zzso September zzso an international multidisciplinary group of experts discussed the current state of the art, available and emerging technologies, applications and how to proceed in the zzso zzso platform technologies are expected to revolutionize cell biology in general and drug development in zzso
