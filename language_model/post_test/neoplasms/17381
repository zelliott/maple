The purpose of this study was to compare and correlate standardized zzso values zzso derived from magnetic resonance zzso correction zzso with those derived from zzso zzso zzso correction zzso in an zzso patient zzso 

The zzso study was approved by the Internal Review Board and all subjects gave written informed consent prior to inclusion in the zzso Forty patients zzso age zzso 20 zzso referred for clinically indicated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scans also underwent a zzso resonance imaging zzso zzso zzso was performed using an automatic zzso zzso zzso of interest were drawn over eight normal structures in order to obtain zzso and zzso zzso zzso rank correlation zzso zzso were calculated and zzso paired zzso tests were performed to compare the zzso and zzso values obtained from zzso with those from zzso 

The mean time after zzso injection was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso values were significantly lower than the zzso zzso values in zzso blood pool zzso for both zzso and zzso and liver zzso for zzso The zzso zzso values were significantly higher in bone zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso major muscle zzso for zzso and left zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso For the other normal structures, no significant difference was zzso When comparing zzso values generated from zzso versus zzso high correlations between zzso and zzso were observed in zzso zzso for zzso liver zzso for zzso bone zzso zzso for zzso lung tissue zzso for zzso and zzso blood pool zzso for zzso zzso correlations were found in lung tissue zzso for zzso zzso liver zzso for zzso fat zzso for zzso zzso major muscle zzso for zzso and zzso muscle zzso for zzso Low correlation was found in zzso muscle zzso for zzso 

Using the automatic zzso model, our study showed high correlation for measurement of zzso values obtained from zzso compared to those from zzso as the reference zzso zzso observed between zzso and zzso derived zzso values may be attributed to the zzso between the zzso and zzso scans or zzso clearance of zzso Further studies are required to assess zzso zzso when performing different MR zzso correction zzso
