Controlled experiments have shown that more than one mechanism leads to the zzso of zzso cell killing by zzso and that this zzso is not zzso expressed among different cell zzso A firm investigative base for the design of clinical trials using zzso and radiation has not been zzso zzso with this zzso of experimental guidance, the independent clinical investigator has developed an array of therapeutic strategies applying different doses and sequences of zzso and radiation to a variety of tumor zzso zzso of clinical studies zzso zzso and radiation that can be judged for perceived survival benefit are evaluated in comparison with existing zzso zzso Both the clinical and zzso results lead to similar conclusions at this zzso zzso that are relatively sensitive to the zzso action of zzso alone would best be considered for combined treatment with zzso Large and zzso rather than small and zzso individual administrations of zzso are better used with radiation for enhanced therapeutic zzso Administration of zzso close in time to radiation is best for therapeutic response, although perceived efficacy follows from rather flexible zzso of these two zzso It is not possible to know if clinical efficacy results from radiation zzso as opposed to some degree of zzso of the two zzso It is nonetheless useful to anticipate strategies that might lead to radiation zzso by zzso in therapeutic zzso Two general mechanisms by which zzso zzso zzso cell killing are zzso One mechanism of zzso is free zzso at least in part leads to an active zzso species following zzso reduction of zzso and is more readily expressed with bacterial cells than with zzso cells in tissue zzso A second mechanism of zzso is zzso in nature, involves an effect of zzso on cellular components in ways that inhibit the recovery of zzso damage, and likely applies more to the zzso of zzso zzso cells than bacterial zzso The latter mechanism is not universally supported in the zzso However, a unifying hypothesis, and one in need of confirmation at this time, is that the zzso mechanism of radiation zzso by zzso operates in zzso zzso cells that are inherently sensitive to the zzso action of zzso This hypothesis ostensibly applies to tumor cells that are responsive to chemotherapy with zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
