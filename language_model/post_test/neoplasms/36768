zzso gene therapy faces many zzso Lack of tissue targeting and low in zzso zzso efficiency represent some of the limitations for a successful therapeutic zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso virus has been shown in marker studies to replicate selectively in tumor tissue in animal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli, converts the nontoxic zzso zzso zzso zzso to the toxic zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the zzso properties of zzso expressed by an zzso synthetic zzso promoter in a zzso virus zzso In zzso zzso of zzso zzso (1 zzso of zzso 4 zzso of zzso zzso zzso at the maximum tolerated dose zzso of zzso zzso zzso reduced cell viability by day 3 to zzso At an zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso caused reduction of cell viability to zzso within 4 zzso Furthermore, there was complete zzso of viral replication after zzso conversion of zzso into the active zzso The potency of such a system was similar among all zzso zzso Finally, the zzso efficacy has been shown to be more rapid and complete than that of zzso zzso zzso a more established zzso zzso When virus was delivered zzso into zzso mice with zzso zzso followed by administration of zzso there was a significant zzso of survival and a zzso cure zzso In zzso zzso to its zzso capabilities, high zzso efficiency, and high gene zzso a zzso virus expressing zzso could prove to be a potent and valuable zzso for zzso gene zzso
