To determine the extent of evidence for a zzso health differential in cancer and cancer risk in South zzso 

Secondary analysis and synthesis of data available between 1977 and 2000 from the publications of the South Australian Cancer zzso and reports of population health surveys carried out by the South Australian Department of Human zzso 

The mean annual zzso zzso of all forms of cancer combined was about zzso lower for rural residents zzso per 100,000 zzso zzso per zzso Of 31 types of cancer zzso the zzso of three was significantly higher among rural residents, the zzso of eight was significantly higher among urban residents and for 20 types there was no significant zzso Five year case survival for all zzso combined was zzso in both urban and rural zzso zzso survival differences were identified for only 10 zzso and survival for each was higher among urban zzso zzso were diagnosed in zzso more often in the country, but invasive cases tended to be zzso There was no zzso difference in early detection rates for breast cancer or zzso zzso There were no substantial reported differences in major risk factors and early detection experiences apart from higher rates of smoking in the zzso 

There is little evidence for substantial or systematic differences in risk factors for, and zzso and early detection of zzso between urban and rural South zzso However, the apparent consistently poorer survival among rural residents warrants further zzso 

It is widely reported that the health status of rural Australians is worse than that of their urban zzso There is an apparent increasing zzso in mortality from urban to remote areas of zzso However, this apparent zzso is not evident for all zzso This paper seeks to answer the question: is there any difference in the cancer disease experience zzso survival and early zzso and cancer risk factors between residents of rural and urban South zzso Cancer registry data indicate that overall, the zzso of cancer is similar in rural and urban South zzso The findings on survival differentials are of zzso While overall survival rates are very similar in country and city, and this is encouraging, analysis of individual types of cancer raises some zzso The registry reports that significant differences in survival were only measured for 10 zzso and for all of these rural residents experienced higher mortality zzso
