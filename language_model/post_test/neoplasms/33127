zzso with zzso syndrome zzso have an inherited cancer predisposition to a diverse array of zzso beginning early in life; survivors of one cancer have a markedly elevated risk of additional primary zzso The underlying genetic zzso in the majority of the families is a zzso zzso in the zzso tumor zzso zzso The diversity of tumors and rarity of families have contributed to the difficulty in devising effective screening recommendations for members of zzso zzso 

To gather preliminary data with which to evaluate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging as a potential surveillance zzso to detect early zzso in zzso members of zzso zzso 

Members of zzso families with documented zzso zzso zzso or zzso carrier status, no history of cancer within 5 years of enrollment, and no symptoms of cancer or zzso were offered zzso scanning as a screening test in a comprehensive US cancer center from 2006 to zzso zzso were initially reviewed zzso then centrally reviewed by an expert zzso 

The primary outcome was the detection of new primary zzso using zzso zzso 

Of 15 individuals, baseline zzso scan identified zzso zzso in 3 zzso Two individuals had zzso zzso zzso zzso II and stage zzso and one individual had stage II zzso zzso 

These preliminary data provide the first evidence for a potential cancer surveillance strategy that may be worthy of further investigation for patients with zzso Concerns about radiation exposure and other challenges inherent in screening high-risk patients will require further zzso
