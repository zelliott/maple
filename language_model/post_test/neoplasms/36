The zzso of zzso cells are composed of an ordered array of lipids and zzso the latter containing zzso zzso directed towards the exterior and important in the interaction of cells with each other and with external zzso This external zzso membrane and other more simple zzso within the cell are damaged in all diseases which compromise the integrity of the zzso However, in many cases, chemical or functional changes in these zzso are central to the zzso of the zzso These processes are zzso and a zzso of zzso diseases is zzso This includes: zzso diseases such as type II familial zzso zzso disease, some zzso storage diseases and some forms of diabetes and zzso structural instability as zzso by red cell abnormalities and multiple zzso changes in zzso state as in muscular zzso and multiple zzso altered zzso or transport as in zzso fibrosis, diseases associated with specific transport zzso and the action of many bacterial zzso and zzso of the zzso interface as in zzso disease and some diseases associated with red cell zzso Different mechanisms can contribute to the membrane disorder in a single disease state and many of these are described to illustrate this zzso
