We have reviewed the experimental results which indicate that zzso type I zzso zzso present either zzso or possibly induced by the tumor plays an important role in limiting the development of zzso tumors in zzso Thus, treatment with potent zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso markedly enhanced the subcutaneous growth, zzso and zzso of zzso tumor cells zzso or infected with zzso or DNA zzso in zzso nude zzso enhanced the zzso zzso of six different zzso zzso tumors in three strains of zzso zzso and completely zzso the resistance of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso mice to the zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso in the liver and zzso resulting in the death of most zzso The mechanisms by which mice respond to the injection of relatively few tumor cells appear to be zzso to depend on the site of tumor growth, to occur early and prior to an zzso zzso zzso type I zzso appears to constitute an essential component of these defense mechanisms enabling the host to restrict tumor zzso
