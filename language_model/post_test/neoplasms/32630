Based on the role of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in recruitment of DNA repair and checkpoint proteins to the sites of DNA damage, we have investigated zzso as a reporter of tumor zzso and a potential target to enhance the effectiveness of radiation zzso zzso relevant zzso radiation zzso doses induced similar patterns of zzso focus formation or zzso in zzso and zzso human tumor cell lines and zzso zzso However, zzso tumor cells and zzso retained zzso for a greater duration than zzso cells and zzso These results suggest that persistence of zzso after zzso may predict tumor response to zzso We zzso zzso mimics of the zzso zzso tail to test whether zzso zzso function affects tumor cell survival following zzso The peptides did not alter the viability of zzso tumor cells, but both blocked induction of zzso zzso by zzso and enhanced cell death in zzso zzso tumor zzso These results suggest that zzso is a potential molecular target to enhance the effects of zzso
