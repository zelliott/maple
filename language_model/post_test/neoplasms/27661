Human cancer risks from zzso exposure have previously been estimated by regulatory agencies based primarily on zzso data, with supporting evidence provided by animal zzso zzso This paper zzso the zzso risk assessments for zzso using zzso zzso zzso models of zzso metabolism in animals and zzso It demonstrates that internal doses zzso as total zzso zzso zzso from oral zzso experiments in mice are well predicted by a zzso model developed by Travis et zzso Both the data and the model zzso can also be accurately described by the simple zzso zzso model total zzso zzso zzso + zzso where zzso zzso administered dose in zzso Thus, zzso modeling zzso the use of such zzso zzso models, previously used by zzso and zzso An important finding is that zzso the zzso zzso zzso model family to internal doses and observed responses changes the zzso estimate zzso zzso curve for mice from zzso to zzso leading to zzso risk estimates smaller than in previous risk zzso This is consistent with the conclusion for mice from the zzso and zzso zzso An innovation in this paper is zzso of internal doses for humans based on a zzso model (and the zzso model zzso it) rather than on zzso dose zzso Estimates of human risks at low doses are reduced by the use of internal dose estimates when the estimates are obtained from a zzso model, in contrast to zzso and zzso findings based on zzso dose zzso zzso analyses and comparisons with zzso data and risk models suggest that our finding of a zzso zzso zzso curve at low doses is robust to changes in assumptions and more consistent with zzso data than earlier risk zzso
