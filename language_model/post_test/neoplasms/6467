In order to screen human tumor cells for putative cell surface marker zzso the zzso composition of in zzso cultivated human tumor cell lines of different origin (12 zzso one zzso one melanoma and one zzso was analyzed by metabolically zzso the cells with zzso zzso and zzso and subsequently separating the zzso material by zzso The cell lines expressed their specific zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins of apparent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were shared by nearly all zzso cell lines zzso Apart from these zzso zzso a great diversity was observed between tumor cell lines derived from the same zzso Three zzso zzso cell lines had a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso expression of these cell lines remained constant during 1 zzso of in zzso zzso zzso these zzso patterns seem to be useful for monitoring the zzso stability of cell zzso A zzso cell line was deficient in incorporating zzso and showed zzso different zzso patterns compared to the other cell lines zzso The zzso zzso procedure revealed a wide zzso zzso of the human zzso cell lines concerning zzso zzso This method contributes another zzso to map the major zzso species of various types of zzso
