zzso repair zzso proteins contribute to zzso integrity by correcting replication zzso In higher zzso zzso proteins also regulate the cellular response to DNA zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso zzso Previous studies have linked zzso proteins to the zzso of zzso through zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells exhibit variable defects in the induction of zzso and its related zzso which are zzso of zzso However, the specific role of each zzso protein in the regulation of zzso has not been zzso Here, we describe an interaction between zzso an zzso zzso and zzso This interaction causes the stabilization of zzso and the zzso of zzso to the nuclear zzso Exposure to zzso enhances the association between zzso and zzso Moreover, stimulation of the zzso zzso function by zzso requires zzso These results suggest that zzso contributes to zzso integrity not only through DNA repair but also by enhancing DNA zzso zzso
