zzso in DNA zzso in cancer include global zzso and zzso zzso It is not clear whether these two zzso errors are mechanistically linked or occur zzso This study was performed to determine the relationship between DNA zzso zzso and zzso instability in zzso 

We examined 61 cancer cell lines and 60 zzso zzso and their adjacent zzso using zzso zzso as a surrogate for global zzso zzso zzso with sporadic zzso instability zzso most of which are due to a zzso island zzso zzso zzso and associated zzso promoter zzso showed in average no difference in zzso zzso between normal adjacent and cancer zzso Interestingly, some tumor samples in this group showed increase in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso a significant decrease in zzso zzso between normal adjacent and cancer zzso zzso zzso analysis of repetitive element zzso confirmed this observation and showed a high degree of zzso in zzso between zzso Additionally, zzso zzso zzso identified a group of highly zzso tumors, composed mostly of tumors without zzso zzso We extended zzso analysis to cancer cell lines from different zzso and found that zzso were zzso compared to peripheral blood zzso and normal colon zzso Interestingly, these cancer cell lines also exhibited a large variation in zzso which was zzso and thus unlikely to be zzso from a zzso zzso 

Global zzso is partially reversed in zzso with zzso instability and also shows high zzso in cancer, which may reflect alternative progression pathways in zzso
