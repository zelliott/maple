zzso zzso responses to shared tumor zzso have been characterized for several tumor types, and the zzso peptides that comprise these zzso have been defined at a molecular zzso These provide new tools to determine whether immune responses can be generated with these tumor zzso and there are data to suggest that such immune responses can be zzso However, it is also clear that tumor cells can evade immune responses directed against some shared zzso by zzso expression of zzso or of the zzso zzso as well as by more active methods such as zzso of zzso zzso Awareness of these mechanisms of immune escape will help to direct development of the next generation of tumor zzso zzso unique zzso and modulating the zzso environment likely will be critical to comprehensive vaccine systems in the zzso
