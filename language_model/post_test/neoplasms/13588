A major problem in manned space flight is the impact of zzso radiation, especially that of heavy charged particles since they have an elevated biological efficiency zzso The zzso zzso determines the potential exposure for zzso It is one of the limiting factors for space flight and should be known very zzso The same is true for zzso tumor therapy where beams of carbon zzso are used to treat zzso zzso There, zzso values determine the dose distribution and are estimated using the Local Effect Model zzso The clinical results confirm the correctness of zzso and suggest to use the same theoretical approach to assess the impact of zzso zzso
