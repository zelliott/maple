zzso therapy zzso is a relatively new protocol for cancer treatment which has recently been approved for limited clinical zzso Traditionally, the success of treatment with zzso has been compared on the basis of total light zzso Using the mathematical model of Henning et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we have determined that when oxygen is not depleted from the zzso the concentration of zzso oxygen that is generated is directly zzso to the product of the light zzso rate zzso and the concentration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is an appropriate zzso for comparing the potential success of zzso protocols under these zzso For a treatment of time zzso the observed zzso effect resulting from zzso oxygen exposure should be directly related to zzso For high zzso the model predicts that oxygen depletion occurs within the tumor zzso As a result, the zzso effect is no longer zzso to zzso We have expanded the model of Henning et zzso to include the changes in oxygen concentration which occur within the zzso as blood flows through the zzso Our new predictions with the mathematical model for optimal zzso treatment conditions are significantly different from those predicted by the previous zzso zzso of the model are given using parameters relevant for treatment of solid tumors with zzso
