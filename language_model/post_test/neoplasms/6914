zzso cells may constitute a zzso intermediate between normal zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells are relatively more resistant against DNA damaging agents and are genetically zzso due to their tendency towards zzso zzso zzso zzso it is important to develop strategies for the selective removal of zzso zzso Here, we show that targeting the zzso zzso zzso (also known as zzso zzso zzso zzso by a small interfering zzso zzso or by the pharmacological inhibitor zzso zzso kills zzso tumor cells more efficiently than their zzso zzso Cell death occurs after an attempt of zzso zzso that, in zzso cells, is followed by a prolonged zzso arrest and zzso zzso to the zzso with a zzso DNA zzso In contrast, zzso zzso cells exhibit a shorter zzso arrest, bipolar or zzso zzso followed by zzso of the daughter cells, as assessed by zzso zzso of cells that express a zzso zzso fusion construct to monitor their zzso Cell death occurred with hallmarks of zzso namely loss of the zzso zzso potential and terminal zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso cells are particular vulnerable to undergo zzso catastrophe after genetic or pharmacological zzso of zzso
