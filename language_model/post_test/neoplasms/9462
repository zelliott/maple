We conducted three zzso zzso studies to evaluate the risk of breast, zzso and prostate zzso developing in patients exposed to zzso zzso compared with other zzso zzso 

Cancer cases were matched to five controls by age, zzso calendar year, and time in the database from a cohort of 1 26 zzso diabetic patients taking zzso medication in the US Integrated Healthcare Information Services zzso Five hundred thirteen breast cancer cases were matched with zzso controls, zzso cases of colon cancer were matched with zzso controls and zzso cases of prostate cancer were matched with zzso zzso Exposure to an zzso agent within 90 days preceding the index date was defined as recent exposure and at any time during the follow-up was defined as ever zzso 

The adjusted odds ratios and zzso of cancer from ever exposure to zzso compared to oral zzso oral dual therapy, oral triple therapy, insulin zzso insulin and oral therapy and all zzso zzso agents were, respectively for breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for colon zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and for prostate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for exposure within 90 days of the date of the cancer were zzso 

Our findings suggest that the effect of zzso on the likelihood of development of the zzso studied zzso prostate and zzso appears to be neutral and do not support a beneficial or deleterious effect of zzso on the zzso zzso
