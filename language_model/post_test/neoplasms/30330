The zzso community has been seriously concerned about the zzso pandemic of zzso Here, we report on the evaluation of the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso vaccines in young patients with cancer during this zzso 

Between December 7, 2009 and February 26, 2010, 20 children receiving chemotherapy for solid tumors at the Institute of zzso and zzso Oncology of Lyon, were zzso by 2 doses of either zzso or zzso zzso The level of specific zzso was assessed at zzso and zzso 

zzso was observed in 13 of the 20 cases zzso and 18 of 20 cases zzso had protective zzso after the 2 zzso zzso zzso analysis failed to show a significant influence of zzso zzso counts on zzso zzso 

These data suggest that zzso zzso vaccines were well tolerated by young cancer patients while on chemotherapy and achieved protective immune response in most zzso
