A common form of human zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso as well as some sporadic human zzso has been shown to exhibit frequent zzso in zzso zzso This zzso was ascribed to a zzso in replication error zzso and indeed several zzso derived cell lines are deficient in mismatch zzso To date, four zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been linked with genes designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which zzso proteins that display an extensive degree of sequence similarity to zzso involved in zzso mismatch correction in zzso coli and zzso zzso We have recently identified a new zzso zzso that is essential for mismatch repair in human zzso zzso zzso are not associated with the profound zzso commonly encountered in zzso colon zzso The roles of the proteins zzso by the individual mismatch repair genes in zzso mismatch correction and zzso instability are discussed, with a view to assessing the potential utility of these findings in diagnosis of cancer predisposition and zzso
