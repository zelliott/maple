Recent clinical trials of cancer gene therapy have shown encouraging results for controlling localized zzso However, to control zzso or zzso tumor cells, further modification of zzso is required to enhance specificity and zzso against zzso We investigated whether zzso of the zzso zzso system contributes to enhanced zzso effects together with minimal adverse reactions in specific gene therapy against zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer cells in the zzso cavity of zzso zzso cancer would be a good therapeutic target because it is found in zzso stomach and colon sites, which account for most zzso We constructed a pair of zzso zzso zzso zzso one of which expresses the zzso gene under the control of the zzso promoter zzso the other expresses the zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso gene zzso or the zzso gene zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso into mice with zzso zzso by zzso tumor cells showed selective expression of the zzso gene in tumor zzso zzso of zzso and zzso followed by zzso zzso administration significantly suppressed the total tumor weight in the zzso cavity of the mice to zzso of that of the zzso mice and zzso of that of the mice treated with zzso an Ad that expressed the zzso gene driven by the zzso promoter zzso Moreover, treatment with zzso and zzso completely suppressed tumors in 4 of 10 zzso mice without significant weight loss, although 2 of 10 mice treated with zzso an zzso zzso that strongly but zzso expressed the zzso zzso died due to severe side effects including zzso weight loss and liver zzso These findings suggest that cell zzso gene therapy using the zzso system is effective against zzso cancer cells without significant side zzso
