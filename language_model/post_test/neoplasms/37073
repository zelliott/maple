We infused peripheral blood stem cells zzso into 51 patients with various zzso disorders, after zzso zzso zzso patients also received zzso bone zzso zzso + zzso In a zzso analysis, the only statistically significant zzso of zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the number of prior chemotherapy regimens zzso zzso zzso The factors predicting zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso + zzso infusion zzso zzso zzso and the absence of zzso bone zzso involvement zzso zzso zzso Seven patients remained zzso and/or red cell zzso for 100 days or more zzso after good zzso zzso Six of these seven long-term zzso failures, as well as five additional patients, received zzso zzso zzso Of the 11 patients who received zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seven were zzso recipients, of whom six were long-term zzso zzso In contrast, there were no long-term zzso failures among the four zzso zzso zzso zzso This difference in long-term zzso failure rate was significant zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso patients all had a diagnosis of zzso with bone zzso zzso The zzso zzso + zzso group was more heterogeneous, but no patient had zzso involvement of the zzso The zzso zzso patients had also received significantly more prior chemotherapy regimens than the zzso zzso + zzso patients and a significantly higher proportion received total body zzso zzso as part of their conditioning zzso We conclude that zzso damage resulting from a combination of zzso zzso chemotherapy and zzso may result not only in low zzso yields but also in an impaired capacity of the zzso zzso to support transplanted stem zzso
