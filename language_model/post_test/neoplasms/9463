A total of five zzso were developed, three for zzso zzso of the colon zzso one for zzso type 2 zzso and one for inherited breast and zzso cancer caused by zzso zzso Eleven clinical cycles were performed, resulting in the birth of an unaffected zzso For one of the couples undergoing zzso for zzso a spontaneous pregnancy zzso after five unsuccessful zzso zzso The couple underwent zzso zzso sampling zzso and the application of the same protocol as used during zzso showed an unaffected zzso 

In this work, we present the development and clinical application of zzso for three cancer predisposition zzso
