zzso zzso small zzso molecules of approximately 22 zzso have been shown to be zzso or zzso in specific cell types and disease zzso These molecules have become recognized as one of the major regulatory zzso of coding genes in the human zzso 

We review the structure, zzso mechanism of action, technologies used for zzso zzso and associations of zzso with human zzso zzso are produced in a zzso manner, and changes in zzso within a tissue type can be correlated with disease zzso zzso appear to regulate zzso translation and degradation via mechanisms that are dependent on the degree of zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be detected via several methods, such as zzso zzso zzso and quantitative real-time zzso The tissue zzso of specific zzso have been associated with tumor zzso zzso potential, and other clinical characteristics for several types of zzso including chronic zzso zzso and breast, zzso zzso zzso zzso and prostate zzso 

By targeting and controlling the expression of zzso zzso can control highly complex zzso pathways and other biological zzso The zzso roles of zzso in cancer suggest a correlation with prognosis and therapeutic zzso Further investigation of these roles may lead to new approaches for the zzso diagnosis, and treatment of human zzso
