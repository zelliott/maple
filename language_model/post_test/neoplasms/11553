This phase I study was conducted to determine the zzso zzso and recommended doses of zzso in cancer patients with normal and impaired zzso zzso 

Patients received a 10-minute infusion of 150 to 600 zzso of zzso every 3 zzso Patients were zzso for independent dose escalation by measured zzso zzso rate zzso into four zzso ranging from zzso or zzso 80 to less than 20 zzso zzso plasma and urine zzso were evaluated for the first zzso Patients enrolled after December 1999 were supplemented with oral zzso acid and intramuscular vitamin zzso 

zzso patients were treated with 167 cycles of zzso Hematologic zzso zzso occurred in zzso patients zzso zzso and zzso patients zzso zzso and included zzso zzso (four zzso and grade 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso included fatigue, zzso and zzso and did not correlate with zzso zzso zzso was discontinued in patients with zzso less than 30 zzso after one patient with a zzso of 19 zzso died as a result of zzso zzso zzso plasma clearance positively correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in increased drug zzso in patients with impaired zzso zzso With vitamin zzso zzso 600 zzso was tolerated by patients with a zzso zzso or zzso 80 zzso whereas patients with a zzso of 40 to 79 zzso tolerated a dose of 500 zzso 

zzso was well tolerated at doses of 500 zzso with vitamin supplementation in patients with zzso zzso or zzso 40 zzso Additional studies are needed to define appropriate dosing for zzso impaired patients receiving higher dose zzso with vitamin zzso
