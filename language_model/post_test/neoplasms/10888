To determine the recommended phase II dose and evaluate the safety and toxicity profile and zzso zzso and zzso zzso effects of zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso that has vascular zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso was administered as a 10-minute infusion on days 1 and 8 of a zzso cycle in a zzso phase I zzso A dynamic accelerated dose zzso method was used for dose zzso Plasma zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso assessments were carried out using dynamic contrast enhanced zzso and analysis of a zzso zzso 

zzso subjects with advanced solid tumors were enrolled on 6 dose levels zzso zzso zzso The recommended dose level was 16 zzso and was well zzso zzso zzso rapidly converted to zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso Plasma zzso of zzso generally increased in proportion to dose with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso active plasma levels were obtained with a dose zzso reduction in the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso being observed in zzso zzso also indicated blood flow changes in the tumor zzso of a number of zzso 

zzso has a favorable toxicity profile at the recommended dose of 16 zzso and is associated with zzso changes consistent with its known mechanism of zzso Phase II studies in zzso cancer and zzso have zzso
