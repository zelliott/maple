zzso deletions of zzso the human zzso of a mouse gene zzso that acts to suppress zzso cell growth, were reported in human breast zzso We screened zzso for zzso zzso in DNA and zzso samples isolated from a variety of common human zzso zzso zzso and normal lung zzso zzso zzso deletions in zzso transcripts were frequently found in all types of zzso Analysis of DNA failed to show zzso zzso corresponding to transcripts containing deletions in the same zzso The zzso of most transcript deletions coincide with genuine or cryptic zzso site zzso suggesting that they result from alternative or zzso zzso A similar spectrum of transcript deletions has previously been described in the putative zzso zzso gene zzso We zzso zzso in the same series of zzso samples and detected truncated zzso transcripts frequently in both zzso and normal zzso In addition, transcripts from zzso zzso and seven other genes were zzso in zzso isolated from normal peripheral blood zzso Large zzso and zzso zzso transcript deletions were detected and these appeared to be the zzso transcript in zzso zzso Similar zzso were not detected in transcripts of the other genes which were zzso Our findings demonstrate that truncated zzso and zzso transcripts are commonly detected in both normal and zzso zzso and that a significant fraction of these are likely to be the result of zzso zzso While we cannot exclude that zzso in zzso and zzso occur during cancer development, our data indicate that in this context the commonly observed transcript abnormalities are zzso
