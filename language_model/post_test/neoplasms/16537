The primary objectives of this trial were to define the maximum tolerated dose zzso and to characterize the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso given on a zzso and zzso schedule every 21 zzso A secondary objective of the trial was to seek evidence of zzso zzso 

Patients with advanced or zzso zzso received zzso by a zzso zzso infusion on days 1 and 5 of a zzso zzso On the basis of zzso data suggesting that zzso may have significant cardiac zzso patients were treated while receiving continuous cardiac monitoring and were followed with serial cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso zzso The starting dose of the trial was 1 zzso and dose zzso proceeded through a total of eight dose levels to a maximum of zzso zzso zzso were graded using the National Cancer Institute common toxicity criteria, and zzso were determined using a liquid zzso mass zzso zzso 

Patients zzso received a total of 88 cycles of treatment on study zzso one to eight zzso zzso toxicity zzso was observed, and the zzso exceeded at a dose of zzso zzso The zzso included zzso fatigue (3 zzso zzso zzso and vomiting (1 zzso zzso zzso (2 zzso and zzso cardiac zzso (1 patient, zzso zzso The zzso was defined at the seventh dose level zzso zzso zzso zzso changes and mild zzso zzso were observed on the zzso zzso There were no clinically significant changes in left zzso ejection zzso One patient achieved a partial zzso The plasma disposition of zzso was well described by a zzso zzso zzso The mean volume of distribution, zzso zzso and zzso at a dose of zzso zzso was: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The mean maximum plasma concentration at the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Biological zzso showed that the serum levels achieved could cause the characteristic cell cycle effects of this agent when serum was added to zzso cells in culture, as well as increased zzso zzso in zzso peripheral blood zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso given on a zzso and -5 schedule every 21 days is zzso zzso The zzso are fatigue, zzso zzso and transient zzso and zzso Whereas cardiac toxicity was anticipated based on zzso data, there was no evidence of zzso zzso However, zzso zzso changes with zzso wave zzso were regularly zzso zzso active serum zzso were zzso and 1 patient obtained a partial zzso The recommended Phase II dose is zzso zzso administered on day 1 and 5 of a zzso zzso
