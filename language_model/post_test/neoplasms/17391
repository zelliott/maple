One of the most important zzso hallmarks of cancer cells is enhanced zzso Depending on the tumor type, tumor cells zzso up to zzso of saturated and zzso fatty acids zzso de zzso in spite of sufficient dietary zzso zzso This zzso conversion starts early when cells become zzso and further expands as the tumor cells become more zzso It is suggested that zzso of zzso synthesis is required for zzso and for tumor cell zzso These observations suggest that the zzso involved in zzso synthesis would be rational therapeutic targets for cancer zzso However, several recent reports have shown that the zzso effects, following zzso of zzso zzso synthesis in cancer cell lines may be zzso by adding zzso zzso Additionally, high intake of dietary fat is reported to be a potential risk factor for development and poor prognosis for certain zzso Recently it was reported that breast and zzso tumors are equipped for both de zzso fatty acid synthesis zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso acquired zzso may provide an additional source of zzso for zzso This review focuses on our current understanding of zzso and zzso pathways in cancer cell zzso
