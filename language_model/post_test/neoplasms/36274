For normally distributed data analyzed with linear models, it is well known that measurement error on an independent variable leads to zzso of the effect of the independent variable on the dependent zzso However, for zzso variables such as zzso survival zzso the effect of the measurement zzso in the underlying zzso defining the event is less well zzso We conducted a simulation study to evaluate the impact of measurement zzso in tumor assessment on the treatment effect hazard ratio for zzso and on the median zzso time, for different tumor assessment zzso Our results show that scan measurement zzso can cause zzso of the treatment effect zzso the hazard ratio is closer to one) and that the extent of zzso may be increased with more frequent scan zzso This zzso leads to inflation of the type II zzso zzso scan measurement zzso should be minimized as far as possible in order to reveal a treatment effect that is closest to the zzso In disease settings where the measurement zzso is shown to be large, consideration may be given to inflating the sample size of the study to maintain statistical zzso
