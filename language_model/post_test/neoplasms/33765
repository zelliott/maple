A method is described for the preparation of zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso are suitable for automated image analysis and DNA zzso while still allowing interpretation of nuclear zzso The proposed technique uses zzso treatment and zzso for cell zzso The preparation of cell zzso is performed by zzso After zzso the specimens with zzso nuclear DNA can be zzso zzso DNA zzso using the zzso Television Analysis System zzso showed zzso of variation of zzso for the zzso cell population of suspended benign zzso After DNA zzso the specimens are zzso using orange G and zzso Since zzso has spectral properties similar to those of zzso the obtained end product is comparable to specimens stained according to the routinely used zzso zzso Using this technique, image zzso can be applied to zzso tissue in combination with conventional zzso study of the zzso
