A review of the literature on the application of scanning electron zzso zzso and transmission electron zzso zzso to zzso of zzso cells in zzso fluid reveals a lack of consensus as to which of the techniques is most beneficial to a zzso for a satisfactory zzso The purpose of this study is therefore to critically evaluate the relative merits of zzso zzso and zzso zzso techniques in enhancing the diagnostic zzso of zzso zzso Two cases of zzso one case of zzso and one case of small cell zzso zzso of the lung were studied in detail by zzso zzso and zzso zzso A comparative analysis of the results demonstrates that zzso is a rapid and useful technique where the zzso on the zzso cell surface is the most prominent feature especially in zzso The major handicap of zzso becomes evident in cases where the extreme zzso of the surface zzso amongst zzso cells makes it difficult to establish a diagnosis with zzso zzso along with light zzso zzso of zzso blue sections gives us the most comprehensive method for zzso and is particularly useful in cases where zzso zzso alone is zzso It has the added advantage of revealing zzso significant nuclear and zzso features which are helpful in zzso a benign from a zzso cell and in some instances the probable site of the primary zzso zzso technique, though not conducive to a routine diagnostic situation, is of benefit in demonstrating the organization of zzso zzso From preliminary studies it appears that the tight junctions in zzso are different from those seen in small cell zzso In zzso gap junctions are invariably present, but they are not seen prominently in zzso or small cell zzso Thus in poorly differentiated zzso where zzso and zzso are inconclusive, zzso may prove zzso It is concluded that such coordinated studies in the future have the potential to better our understanding of the nature and zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso
