To test the influence of changes in membrane fatty acid composition on the radiation response of zzso cells, human zzso cells were cultured in medium containing zzso serum supplemented with either zzso or zzso zzso Analysis of zzso extracts of the cells by gas liquid zzso showed that, after 3 or more days growth in zzso or zzso acid supplemented media, there were substantial overall increases in the proportion of zzso and zzso respectively, in the cellular zzso Smaller absolute changes were measured in nuclear zzso which was found to be low in zzso zzso compared to the rest of the zzso Fluorescence polarization zzso using zzso indicated an increased membrane fluidity in cells grown in the presence of excess zzso acid and to a lesser extent for zzso zzso The zzso capacity of the cells after zzso in air or nitrogen was not altered by any of these membrane compositional zzso The lack of effect on radiation sensitivity, in contrast to that reported for bacteria zzso coli zzso is consistent with the fact that little or no change was brought about in the nuclear membrane zzso since evidence from partial cell zzso experiments indicates that the cell nucleus is the sensitive target for cell killing by zzso zzso The ability of the cell to maintain a low level of zzso zzso in its nuclear membrane may be an important general zzso mechanism against free radical damage to zzso zzso by zzso zzso
