zzso are zzso zzso proteins with a zzso zzso backbone combined with a zzso six zzso zzso They have a range of biological activities, including zzso and zzso activity, which have attracted attention to their potential pharmaceutical zzso Furthermore, their unique structures and high stability make them appealing as zzso templates for drug design zzso zzso have been developed for their production, including solid phase zzso synthesis as well as zzso zzso 

This article reviews the recent literature associated with therapeutic applications of naturally occurring and zzso modified zzso It includes applications of zzso and zzso molecules as zzso drug leads and diagnostic zzso 

The zzso zzso are promising templates for drug development applications and are currently being assessed for the potential breadth of their zzso For synthetic versions of zzso to enter human clinical trials further studies to examine their zzso properties and zzso are zzso However, several promising zzso studies have established that zzso relevant zzso zzso sequences can be grafted into zzso zzso and thereby zzso while maintaining biological zzso These studies include examples directed at cancer, cardiovascular disease and infectious zzso Solid phase zzso synthesis has been the preferred approach for making zzso modified zzso so far, but promising progress is being made in biological approaches to zzso zzso
