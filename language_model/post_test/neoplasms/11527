DNA zzso has a role in the regulation of gene expression during normal zzso development but can also mediate zzso zzso of zzso island genes in cancer and other zzso Many individual genes (including tumor zzso have been shown to undergo de zzso zzso in specific tumor types, but the biological logic inherent in this process is not zzso To decipher this zzso we have adopted a new approach for detecting zzso island DNA zzso that can be used together with zzso zzso zzso analysis by this technique demonstrated that zzso zzso genes belong to distinct functional categories, have common sequence motifs in their promoters and are found in clusters on zzso In addition, many are already zzso in normal zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso de zzso zzso may come about through an zzso zzso
