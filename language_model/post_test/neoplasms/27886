We have developed and evaluated a sensitive zzso directed against the zzso part of zzso zzso protein zzso which is involved in the syndrome of zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso levels were studied in 41 consecutive zzso with zzso and zzso 32 zzso patients with zzso 21 patients with primary zzso 34 patients with zzso failure, and 87 zzso 

The zzso used an zzso against the zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso and zzso as label and zzso zzso zzso was stable in serum and plasma and could be measured directly without sample zzso 

zzso plasma zzso ranged from zzso zzso 5 zzso to 21 zzso In zzso failure, zzso was positively correlated with serum zzso but zzso zzso of up to 30 zzso were found only in severe zzso dysfunction with zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso caused by solid zzso zzso zzso was elevated in zzso zzso of zzso of patients, ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso 40 zzso In these patients serum calcium correlated positively with zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso levels were indistinguishable in zzso with and without zzso skeletal zzso The mechanism of zzso in 14 patients with zzso zzso was apparently different, since all but one had normal or only marginally elevated zzso zzso In 21 patients with primary zzso zzso zzso was normal in zzso The zzso was therefore especially useful in distinguishing the latter condition from zzso zzso of zzso as the second major cause of zzso zzso was normal in all 32 patients with zzso zzso 

This zzso of zzso zzso provides high diagnostic sensitivity in the identification of zzso zzso of zzso caused by solid zzso The zzso should therefore be useful in the differential diagnosis of zzso
