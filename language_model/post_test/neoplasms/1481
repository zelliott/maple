The process of cell loss and cell gain is zzso balanced in order to not only generate and maintain the complex dynamic architecture of zzso but also to allow adaptation to changing zzso zzso cells survive only by virtue of zzso that allow them to zzso and to evade death zzso In fact, defects in the zzso cell death inducing pathways contribute to zzso zzso progression and zzso by creating a zzso environment for genetic instability and zzso of gene zzso Resistance to zzso can also enhance the escape to tumor cells from surveillance by the immune zzso Moreover, because chemotherapy and zzso act mostly by inducing zzso zzso in the zzso zzso can make cancer cells resistant to zzso This review gives an update on the key players involved in zzso as well as how zzso zzso in each step of zzso pathways are involved in the entire progression of zzso zzso how impaired zzso affects therapy and how direct targeting zzso the zzso regulators could lead to more effective treatment of zzso
