Over the past 40 years considerable emphasis has been placed on the development of accurate and sensitive methods for the detection and zzso of DNA zzso The formation of DNA zzso resulting from the zzso interaction of zzso zzso with DNA, derived from zzso and zzso sources, either directly or following zzso zzso can if not repaired lead to zzso in critical genes such as those involved in the regulation of cellular growth and subsequent development of zzso The major zzso challenge has been to detect levels of DNA zzso at the level of zzso zzso per zzso unmodified DNA bases using only low zzso amounts of DNA, and with high specificity and zzso in humans exposed to zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso dietary and zzso zzso In this review we will highlight the merits as well as discuss the progress made by liquid zzso coupled to zzso zzso mass zzso as a method for DNA zzso zzso
