zzso targeting of zzso DNA was achieved through the zzso of zzso derivatives with zzso zzso based on metal zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were chemically introduced to the zzso groups of zzso to obtain zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso coordination decreased the apparent size of the zzso DNA, depending on the zzso zzso The negative zzso potential of zzso DNA became almost 0 zzso after zzso zzso with zzso When the zzso zzso DNA zzso with zzso coordination were zzso injected zzso into mice bearing zzso zzso the zzso DNA zzso significantly enhanced the level of gene expression in the zzso in contrast to the zzso of other zzso derivatives and free zzso zzso The enhanced gene expression produced by the zzso zzso DNA zzso was specific to the zzso whereas a simple mixture of zzso and zzso DNA was not zzso The level of gene expression depended on the percentage of zzso zzso introduced, the mixing weight ratio of the zzso zzso zzso used for zzso preparation, and the zzso DNA zzso A fluorescent microscopic study revealed that zzso of zzso DNA in the tumor tissue was observed only after injection of the zzso DNA zzso with zzso zzso In addition, the gene expression induced by the zzso lasted for more than 10 days after the zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso is a promising way to enable zzso DNA to target the tumor in gene expression as well as to prolong the duration of gene zzso
