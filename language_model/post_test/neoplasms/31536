This zzso zzso study was based on data in a cohort study of more than 18,000 petroleum distribution workers exposed to gasoline, which contains about zzso zzso zzso of zzso acute zzso zzso multiple zzso and kidney cancer were examined relative to exposure to zzso 

For each case, up to five individually matched controls were zzso zzso based on the zzso procedure as well as zzso and zzso conditional zzso zzso were performed for each disease zzso Jobs with similar zzso were grouped into homogeneous categories for zzso Several quantitative zzso of exposure to gasoline were used in the zzso duration of exposure, cumulative exposure, frequency of peak exposure, and time of first zzso 

No increased risks for the four zzso were found for any job zzso zzso with zzso zzso models based on duration of exposure, cumulative exposure, and frequency of peak exposure did not show any increased risk or zzso zzso Time of first exposure to gasoline was also found to be unrelated to the four diseases under zzso 

Exposure to gasoline or zzso at the zzso experienced by this cohort of distribution workers is not a risk factor for zzso (all cell zzso acute zzso zzso multiple zzso or kidney zzso
