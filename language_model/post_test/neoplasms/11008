zzso zzso zzso zzso have been proposed as DNA and drug delivery carriers, as well as efficient tools for fluorescent cell zzso The major limitation is that zzso enter cells regardless of a zzso zzso Here we show that non zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso synthesis zzso do not enter cells, while a highly specific, zzso zzso cellular zzso of zzso acid zzso grafted zzso zzso occurs exclusively in folate zzso zzso expressing zzso Neither the classical zzso zzso nor zzso is involved in the MSN zzso process, while fluorescent zzso zzso enter cells through zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso particles seem to be mostly zzso from cells within 96 zzso Finally, zzso zzso loaded zzso were tested on zzso zzso zzso or normal zzso zzso zzso A strong growth arrest was observed only in zzso cells treated with zzso The results presented here show that our zzso zzso do not enter cells unless zzso zzso suggesting that they could represent a promising vehicle for drug targeting zzso
