Across two general population zzso zzso and two cancer zzso zzso samples, we evaluated the zzso of zzso fatigue as measured by the zzso Assessment of zzso Illness zzso zzso zzso After evaluating zzso of the zzso we compared the zzso distinct fatigue experience versus fatigue impact scores in each zzso zzso factor analysis of the zzso scale showed very good fit to a single dimension zzso model for each sample zzso fit index zzso Using a zzso model to compare the loading of each item with the general fatigue factor versus the identified zzso zzso or zzso we found the zzso loading to be higher than that of the zzso factor in 52 of 52 comparisons (13 items; four zzso When scored zzso experience and impact scores were correlated highly zzso yet their difference relative to one another was significant zzso zzso across samples, experience scores were systematically higher (more zzso than impact scores, by a margin of zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the fatigue experience and the impact of fatigue upon function are reported along a single zzso zzso but that experience is more likely than impact upon function to be endorsed at lower levels of zzso zzso as an outcome or trial zzso can be expressed as a single number, and the experience of the symptom is more likely to be endorsed at mild levels of fatigue, presumably before the symptom exerts an adverse impact upon zzso
