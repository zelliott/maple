zzso zzso are small, single strand DNA viruses which zzso replicate in transformed and tumor cells, causing cell death by expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Several zzso of the zzso group, including zzso efficiently zzso human transformed cell zzso The potential for systemic use of these viruses in targeting zzso might be enhanced if zzso expression and viral replication could be controlled by an innocuous drug such as zzso We therefore zzso zzso zzso operator sequences for part of zzso of zzso the promoter responsible for zzso of the zzso for zzso zzso The resulting construct unexpectedly showed zzso expression in zzso zzso cells, as indicated by efficient zzso and amplification of viral zzso form zzso zzso This was apparently due to zzso zzso zzso by zzso This problem was overcome by zzso with a zzso expressing a zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso These conditions allowed efficient control of zzso and zzso amplification by the zzso zzso zzso These observations form a basis for developing a therapeutic agent based on a zzso zzso
