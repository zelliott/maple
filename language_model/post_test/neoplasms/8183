According to present concepts, innate immunity plays an important role in tumor surveillance and immune zzso The state of zzso cells depends on the balance between zzso and zzso signals from corresponding zzso As one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso some self zzso such as zzso in human and zzso in mice, which is dissimilar to those zzso receptors that zzso some zzso zzso zzso is expressed not only on zzso cells, but on zzso T cells, zzso zzso T cells in normal individuals and zzso zzso T cells in zzso arthritis patients and plays a different role on respective zzso Whereas zzso can only function as a zzso zzso on zzso zzso T cells under the domination of zzso zzso in spite of a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso can directly activate zzso cells even in the presence of zzso signals from zzso and corresponding zzso zzso zzso in mice have identified that alternative zzso produces two distinct zzso zzso that associate zzso with the zzso and zzso signaling zzso and that differential expression of these zzso and of signaling proteins determines whether zzso only functions as a zzso zzso in the zzso immune system zzso T zzso or as both a primary recognition unit and a zzso zzso in the innate immune system zzso killer cells and zzso This review summarizes the research achievements in a new zzso family zzso binding zzso of zzso in human and shows the possible prospects of zzso function and zzso
