DNA replication has a finite measurable error rate, net of repair, in all zzso zzso proliferation of cancer cells leads therefore to zzso of random zzso A proportion of these zzso events can create new zzso zzso that, if processed and presented by an zzso zzso may be recognized by the zzso immune zzso Here, we use probability theory to analyze the zzso and zzso composition of a tumor mass in successive division cycles and create a double zzso model for calculating the number of truly zzso zzso I zzso in a human zzso We deduce that depending upon tumor size, the degree of zzso instability and the degree of death within a zzso human tumors have several tens to low hundreds of new, truly zzso zzso zzso cancer stem cells, due to the asymmetry in their zzso properties, shall harbor significantly fewer zzso and therefore significantly fewer zzso zzso As the overwhelming majority of the zzso in cancer cells are unrelated to zzso the zzso zzso shall be specific for each individual zzso and constitute the zzso fingerprint of each zzso These calculations highlight the benefits for zzso of zzso of human cancer, and in view of the substantial pre-existing zzso repertoire of tumors, emphasize the enormous potential of therapies that zzso the zzso immune response by liberating it from zzso zzso
