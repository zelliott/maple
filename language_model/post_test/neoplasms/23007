The development of a new zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has provided an opportunity to reassess the value of this protein as a zzso zzso zzso samples from 800 healthy individuals and patients with various benign and zzso diseases were zzso There was a very wide range of alpha zzso levels in normal females zzso greater than 100 zzso and although the levels found in normal males were lower and better zzso this intrinsic variation between individuals makes a single determination in a zzso patient zzso Also, the levels of alpha zzso in patients with advanced cancer were not significantly different from levels in localized cancer, benign disease or even healthy controls, and zzso levels before and after successful cancer treatment did not show a significant zzso Our results therefore indicate that alpha zzso is zzso for use as a zzso marker as there was no apparent relationship between the levels of alpha zzso and either zzso burden or response to zzso
