One hundred two zzso nutritionally supported patients were studied to determine the effect of age on the response to nutritional support and outcome of hospital zzso The patients were divided into two groups: group 1 zzso zzso zzso consisted of all patients under 65 years of age, and group 2 zzso zzso zzso consisted of patients 65 years of age and zzso All patients underwent a complete nutritional assessment prior to the initiation of nutritional support and weekly zzso The patients' zzso compartments were assessed using weight, arm muscle zzso zzso height index, and zzso zzso zzso The visceral compartments were assessed using serum zzso level, zzso total iron binding capacity zzso level, and total zzso zzso zzso balance was evaluated and zzso immunity was determined using a standard battery of zzso The patients' nutritional assessment parameters at the start of therapy were compared with those at discharge or death and correlated with outcome of hospital zzso The difference in crude mortality rates between the two groups was statistically zzso however, there was no significant difference between the type and degree of nutritional depletion and mean length of nutritional therapy between the two zzso There was also no significant difference between the degree of improvement or maintenance of zzso or visceral zzso nitrogen balance, or zzso immunity between the two zzso It is therefore concluded that age alone is not a deterrent to the use of aggressive nutritional support in the zzso
