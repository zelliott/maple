zzso have diverse biological functions including zzso of immune system zzso These molecules are zzso expressed on zzso cells compared with the corresponding normal ones and are involved in cancer progression zzso in different ways, the zzso zzso specific immune zzso Although in humans the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is almost exclusively expressed in zzso zzso the significance of this zzso for zzso cell biology remains obscure, while for zzso strong immune zzso effects have been zzso The present work zzso for the first time, the capacity of zzso zzso to zzso zzso expression in zzso and human T zzso especially in zzso T zzso Thirty and tenfold reductions in zzso expression were induced by zzso zzso zzso in zzso and human T zzso zzso The zzso complete recovery in these cells occurred after 48 h of zzso zzso due to zzso Restored T cells kept similar sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso after a new zzso In addition, a clear association between zzso zzso in zzso plasma zzso and the zzso zzso effect was zzso zzso a possible role of this zzso in zzso zzso taking advantage of the zzso myeloma model, was also zzso The relevance of these findings, characterizing zzso as a possible zzso zzso inhibitor and supporting the reason for its zzso in certain human zzso is contributing to this unique zzso zzso validation as target for cancer zzso
