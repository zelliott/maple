To determine the safety and efficacy of zzso zzso for pain relief in cancer patients and to compare the effects on patients according to whether they had previously received strong zzso weak zzso or zzso zzso 

Cancer patients requiring strong analgesia were recruited into an zzso zzso study, conducted in eight zzso Patients received zzso zzso treatment for 28 zzso zzso severity, overall satisfaction with pain control, convenience of use of patches and treatment preferences were recorded zzso 

Of the zzso participants, 135 had previously received a strong zzso 84 had previously received a weak zzso and 73 had received no regular zzso zzso patients did not complete the study, mainly due to adverse zzso For all groups the proportion of patients with zzso to zzso pain control increased after zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was well zzso with the most common zzso adverse events being zzso vomiting and zzso The percentage of zzso patients with zzso decreased following zzso zzso treatment and increased slightly in the zzso zzso Most patients rated the convenience of the patches as zzso to zzso and most preferred zzso zzso to their previous zzso 

zzso zzso is an effective and zzso treatment for zzso pain for patients regardless of whether they have previously received zzso Previous guidelines have often advocated initial dose finding with zzso zzso but this study demonstrates that such a complex zzso and conversion schedule may not be zzso that treatment may be initiated directly with zzso zzso such as zzso zzso when previous zzso therapy fails to provide adequate zzso
