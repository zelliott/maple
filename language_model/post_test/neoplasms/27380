The data considered in the paper indicate that a tumor clone resulting from cell zzso in order to zzso should overcome a zzso zzso This destroys zzso contacts and cell interactions with zzso zzso required for induction and maintenance of zzso zzso The possible reasons for this lie in zzso of genes that control cell zzso molecules and zzso as well as zzso zzso by a zzso These events lead to partial loss of differentiation zzso by a cell or to their incorrect zzso in a zzso zzso the expression of zzso genes is zzso leading to zzso of embryonic zzso and their abnormal zzso into blood, which results in appearance of zzso markers in zzso zzso from this point of view are zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso which are used as tumor zzso
