Much of the focus in understanding the molecular zzso of tumors has centered on zzso that are activated in zzso However, zzso driven by a diversity of activated zzso may have very similar pathological and clinical zzso This likely relates to the fact that the biological characteristics of a tumor are driven by the pattern of gene expression in that zzso and that a wide spectrum of zzso events at the cell surface and in the zzso zzso on a relatively small number of zzso factors that regulate the expression of key target zzso One zzso factor that has been found to be activated inappropriately in a wide range of human zzso is zzso zzso target genes are involved in fundamental events of tumor development including zzso survival, zzso invasion, and zzso Furthermore, there is strong evidence that zzso is critical for these zzso in that zzso of zzso by a variety of means can exert an zzso zzso Since normal cells are relatively tolerant of interruption in zzso zzso these findings suggest that zzso may also be an excellent target for the molecular therapy of zzso
