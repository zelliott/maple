zzso fatigue zzso is a zzso zzso phenomenon experienced by the majority of persons with zzso It has negative consequences on the zzso physical functioning and quality of zzso An array of zzso zzso and functional mechanisms contributes to its zzso A relatively large number of studies have examined the effect of physical exercise on zzso over the past few zzso Most of these studies did not specifically examine the effect of physical exercise on the zzso mechanisms underlying zzso For the most part, these studies have not been guided by a consistent theoretical zzso zzso the mechanisms by which exercise may zzso zzso are not fully zzso A theoretical model incorporating zzso zzso variables that could be affected by physical exercise will allow for effective knowledge development in this area and could lead to the development and refinement of exercise protocols that specifically target these zzso Thus, the purpose of this paper is to present a comprehensive theoretical model to guide future research on the effectiveness of exercise interventions in zzso The proposed model incorporates the zzso zzso and functional variables implicated in the induction of zzso
