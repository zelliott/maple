In the 1990s, based on the results of studies using zzso zzso or zzso knockout mice, several groups reported that the main zzso cells responsible for skin or organ zzso rejection were zzso zzso zzso Similarly, we demonstrated that in an animal model of transplantation of zzso zzso skin onto or zzso A zzso tumor cells into zzso zzso mice, zzso which expressed zzso zzso and zzso were the main zzso cells and also that they were zzso against zzso tumor zzso Here, we examined whether the same population of zzso could react with two distinct types of target zzso When zzso skin or zzso A tumor cells were transplanted into zzso mice, zzso activity against the zzso was induced in the transplantation site on days zzso and was recovered in zzso cells after a zzso incubation in a zzso dish, suggesting the induction of a type of zzso zzso in the transplantation zzso The zzso receptors for zzso zzso had no zzso activity against zzso tumor zzso In contrast, zzso which were recovered in the fraction adherent to the zzso dish, exhibited zzso activities against various types of tumor cells, whereas they were inactive toward zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that after zzso two distinct types of zzso zzso were induced in the transplantation site, one against the zzso skin or tumor zzso and the other against zzso or zzso tumor cells zzso
