zzso zzso T cells play a role in innate immunity and exhibit zzso toward a large range of tumor zzso Recent studies have shown that zzso may be applied to a culture in which a large number of zzso T cells are proliferated ex zzso We carried out a clinical study of 25 patients with various solid tumors to determine further the safety, zzso effect and feasibility of zzso zzso T zzso zzso No severe toxicity was zzso In the cells used for the first treatment, the total cell number, frequency and number of zzso zzso zzso T cells were 409 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, 56 zzso zzso and 255 zzso 242 zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso therapy or chemotherapy resulted in the suppression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The numbers of zzso T cells, zzso zzso zzso T cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso in peripheral blood were significantly lower in patients than in healthy subjects zzso zzso zzso From such an impaired zzso condition, the numbers and zzso of zzso zzso zzso T cells and zzso zzso zzso significantly increased in patients treated with this zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso that restores the number of zzso T cells in cancer patients may provide another mode of adoptive zzso
