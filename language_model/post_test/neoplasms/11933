We describe a sensitive, simple, and rapid method for measuring zzso and zzso in zzso with zzso as zzso The zzso can be done within 1 zzso Plasma is diluted zzso with buffer and zzso zzso (5 zzso of original zzso is incubated for 5 zzso at 37 degrees C, with or without 400 units of zzso Then zzso zzso of zzso solution is added, the mixture again incubated zzso degrees C, 5 zzso and the reaction zzso The amount of zzso liberated from the zzso is measured and is related to zzso This method is suitable for routine clinical work if the same batch of zzso is zzso
