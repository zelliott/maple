In patients with cancer treated with zzso zzso or zzso zzso clearance calculated using the zzso formula was compared with measured clearance and with the zzso zzso zzso In 106 patients the average squared difference for calculated and 24 hour urine zzso clearance was zzso zzso zzso zzso and for calculated zzso clearance and zzso zzso rate zzso using zzso acid, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso On 35 of 606 occasions zzso in 18 patients zzso the calculated clearance overestimated the 24-hour urine zzso clearance when it was less than 1 zzso In all but one patient, this was explained by factors leading to zzso impairment zzso zzso or zzso of clearance zzso in two zzso or by an isolated low value of 24-hour urine zzso clearance zzso zzso zzso zzso function with increasing total dose of zzso was detected by both calculated and 24-hour urine zzso clearance in patients with germ cell zzso zzso of an equation to predict zzso clearance showed a linear association with plasma zzso zzso patient age, weight and zzso zzso in cancer patients was similar to that in the original zzso zzso zzso of zzso clearance can be used in cancer patients to monitor treatment with zzso chemotherapy zzso
