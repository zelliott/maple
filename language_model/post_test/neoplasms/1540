The study of the influence of zzso on drug activity and efficacy zzso and the zzso approach to drug discovery and interpretation of complex pharmacological responses zzso are gaining momentum in current molecular zzso The reasons of the variable activity and zzso of cancer chemotherapy are being unraveled by the discovery of zzso zzso affecting zzso and zzso of zzso Indeed, genetic zzso may alter drug zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso Moreover, increased expression of zzso systems zzso the zzso binding cassette (ABC) zzso is associated with reduction of the zzso levels of drugs which may be unable to exert a zzso zzso Additional systems could protect tumor cells from drug zzso including the DNA repair machinery zzso zzso repair zzso and DNA zzso and zzso systems zzso zzso Finally, zzso of drug targets may be associated with a decrease in the effectiveness of chemotherapy zzso zzso affecting zzso and zzso I for zzso and zzso respectively, and increased expression of zzso zzso for zzso zzso genetic analysis has the potential to predict treatment efficacy and zzso However, major problems encountered in zzso and zzso studies are the need of extensive validation of available technology, the difficulties in obtaining a suitable amount of tissue from patients during the course of their disease and the extremely complex regulation of gene zzso From this perspective, the evaluation of the cellular effect of drugs in relation to protein expression and function zzso may be able to overcome these obstacles, and allow the zzso of cancer chemotherapy in association with a zzso zzso
