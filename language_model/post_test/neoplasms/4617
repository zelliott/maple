The destruction of the zzso in solid tumors can cause the death of tumor cells resulting from the lack of oxygen and zzso zzso of the tumor zzso however, also position zzso zzso cells as obvious targets to address zzso drugs into the zzso In particular, the identification of a zzso acids zzso zzso zzso as a fundamental recognition site for zzso zzso attachment to the zzso zzso leads to the development of zzso zzso for zzso The zzso zzso can target the zzso zzso zzso by the tumor zzso and thereby increases the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso may thus zzso more efficiently and enter the tumor via the enhanced zzso and retention zzso zzso This combination of active and passive processes leads to the penetration of zzso into the tumor zzso followed by cellular zzso and zzso delivery of the zzso zzso Since cancer cells may also express zzso zzso the zzso of zzso into the tumor zzso fluid may yet be facilitated through direct binding to cancer zzso Here, we describe methods used for the preparation of zzso and for the validation of their potential of tumor zzso targeting both in zzso and in zzso We also illustrate how zzso may be more suited than zzso zzso for the tumor delivery of poorly soluble and/or highly zzso drugs, using different mouse tumor zzso zzso
