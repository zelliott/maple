Common fragile sites zzso are large regions of profound zzso instability found in all zzso They are biologically significant due to their role in a number of zzso zzso that are frequently found in many different types of zzso The first zzso to be cloned and characterized was zzso the most active zzso in the human zzso zzso within this region extends for over zzso zzso and contained within the center of this zzso is the zzso gene spanning zzso zzso of zzso zzso There are frequent deletions and other zzso within this gene in multiple tumor types and the protein zzso by this gene has been demonstrated to function as a tumor zzso in zzso and in zzso In spite of this, zzso is not a traditional zzso target in cancer and many tumors have large zzso deletions without any zzso zzso There are several other very large genes found within zzso regions including zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso and zzso zzso zzso within zzso These genes also appear to function as tumor zzso but are not traditional zzso targets in zzso Each of these genes is highly zzso and the regions spanning them are zzso in zzso We have now examined lists of the largest human genes and found zzso that span over one zzso Many of these are derived from zzso bands containing zzso zzso within these genes are being zzso as FISH zzso to determine if these are also zzso zzso Thus far we have identified the following as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso these genes are also not traditional zzso targets in cancer they do exhibit loss of expression in multiple tumor types suggesting that they may also function as tumor zzso Many of the large zzso genes are involved in neurological zzso zzso is zzso in zzso zzso juvenile zzso and deletions in mice are associated with the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso in zzso and zzso are associated with zzso and zzso zzso In humans, zzso in zzso cause zzso mental zzso and loss of zzso is associated with zzso zzso We propose that the zzso zzso in these genes contribute to cancer development in a zzso zzso zzso zzso will primarily occur within zzso regions, as these genes are greater than zzso zzso These are not zzso Instead, they alter the repertoire of transcripts produced from these zzso As cancer zzso deletions will begin to zzso zzso resulting in gene zzso These two types of zzso occurring in multiple large zzso genes may contribute significantly to the zzso observed in zzso There are also important potential linkages between normal neurological development and the development of cancer zzso by zzso in these zzso
