This zzso emphasizes a zzso zzso perspective of the hypothesis that stress and surgical zzso of the primary tumor can promote tumor zzso It first establishes the empirical and theoretical basis for control of zzso by zzso immunity zzso as well as the interactive role of zzso risk zzso It then describes the various aspects of surgery that suppress zzso and the neuroendocrine mechanisms zzso suppression by stress and zzso zzso it briefly reviews the empirical evidence, from animal and human studies, for the promotion of zzso by stress and surgery, with specific reference to the zzso role of zzso It is concluded that: zzso zzso mechanisms most likely play a role in limiting zzso in patients with solid zzso zzso zzso can be zzso especially when surgery is conducted early, before the tumor develops insurmountable mechanisms to escape immune zzso zzso The most sensitive period for the establishment of zzso is the immediate aftermath of zzso zzso aiming at reducing stress and zzso should thus strive to start zzso zzso zzso and zzso insults activate similar neuroendocrine mechanisms of zzso zzso a zzso therapeutic approach should be used to prevent tumor zzso during the zzso zzso zzso Studies employing interventions aimed at reducing the surgical stress response should preferably assess zzso zzso with an established clinical zzso and follow up long-term recurrence provided sample size assure statistical zzso zzso The progress toward earlier detection of cancer, and our growing understanding of zzso continuously improves the chances for successful zzso zzso
