Cancer zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by liver zzso zzso zzso to yield zzso active, zzso zzso The effective use of these zzso is limited by host toxicity associated with the systemic distribution of zzso zzso formed in the zzso This problem can, in part, be zzso by zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso zzso a zzso zzso strategy for cancer treatment that zzso tumor cell exposure to zzso drug zzso generated locally by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been exemplified in zzso zzso and human tumor models, where zzso to a zzso zzso can be greatly increased by introduction of a zzso zzso zzso Further enhancement of the efficacy of zzso gene therapy can be zzso by zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso which provides electrons required for zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso scheduling of the zzso by localized delivery of the zzso to the zzso and by combination with zzso factors, which slow the death of the zzso zzso cells and thereby enhance the bystander zzso zzso zzso zzso has several important features that make it a clinically attractive strategy for cancer zzso These include: the substantial bystander zzso of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso the ability to use human zzso genes and thereby avoid an immune response to the therapeutic zzso the use of well-established conventional zzso zzso as well as zzso drugs activated by zzso zzso in a hypoxic tumor zzso and the potential to decrease systemic exposure to active drug zzso by selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso Recent advances in this area of research are zzso and two zzso clinical trials that highlight the utility of this strategy are zzso
