zzso zzso particles are generated in the welding of stainless zzso These particles have zzso a zzso action in bacterial test systems and produced zzso aberrations in cultured Chinese zzso zzso A cohort consisting of 234 zzso working on stainless steel and exposed to high levels of zzso was zzso According to an earlier survey the zzso zzso exposure of such zzso was often above 20 zzso Another cohort consisting of 208 railway track zzso exposed to low levels of zzso was also zzso The participants of both zzso had welded for at least five years some time between 1950 and 1965 and were followed for mortality until December zzso Among the zzso exposed to high zzso levels five deaths occurred due to pulmonary zzso This number is significantly greater than the one death that occurred among the zzso exposed to low levels of zzso but not significantly greater than the corresponding mortality of the general zzso Thus exposure to stainless steel welding fumes might be associated with an increased zzso of pulmonary zzso
