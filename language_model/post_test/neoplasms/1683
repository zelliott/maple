In zzso trials, zzso variables such as compliance, prescription of alternative treatments and so on are usually ignored to compare treatment zzso zzso zzso analysis is a standard approach but it does not adjust for those zzso However, we may need to evaluate treatment arm effects that have the desired zzso zzso Previously proposed methods such as zzso Cox model may not properly adjust for zzso variables and may produce biased zzso zzso we propose to use two zzso models, structural zzso models and marginal structural zzso The two models appropriately adjust for such zzso We apply these models to adjust for differential proportions of zzso zzso treatment in cancer clinical zzso With sufficient care to several zzso these methods, especially structural zzso failure time models with zzso zzso are useful to take the influence of zzso treatment into account and to test and estimate the direct treatment arm zzso
