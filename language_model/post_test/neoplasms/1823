The purpose of this paper was to determine the cardiac status in children 15 years or more after zzso therapy for a solid zzso Of the zzso zzso 229 zzso were fully studied and 218 were zzso The following cardiac evaluations were proposed to all the zzso consecutive patients zzso zzso cardiac zzso US by one of two expert zzso zzso cardiac rhythm and zzso abnormalities including 24-hour zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum brain zzso zzso levels at zzso zzso an exercise test with zzso max zzso The radiation doses delivered to 6 points in the heart were estimated for all patients who had received zzso zzso heart failure was diagnosed in 24 of 229 zzso evaluated zzso with a median zzso of 15 years zzso zzso from the first symptom after zzso zzso Among the 205 remaining zzso 13 zzso zzso zzso had severe zzso zzso or marked zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso In the 192 others, the median zzso zzso wall stress was 91 zzso and it exceeded 100 g zzso in 52 zzso Using a Cox model, only the cumulative dose of zzso and the average radiation dose to the heart, were identified as risk factors for a pathological cardiac zzso In conclusion, the risk of cardiac failure or severe abnormalities increases with zzso treatment, zzso and time since treatment, even after a follow-up of 15 years or zzso In our series, after an average follow-up of 18 years, zzso of the children had a severe cardiac dysfunction or major zzso overload zzso The risk increases with the dose of zzso and radiation received to the heart, without evidence for zzso
