For the first time, the development of next-generation sequencing technologies has brought about tools to investigate zzso zzso in an zzso yet zzso zzso The importance of this innovative technology is undeniable since it has already been established that changes in DNA zzso play an important role in cancer initiation and zzso The first zzso maps have already been created, and it is only a matter of time until the complete zzso maps of healthy and diseased human zzso are zzso In this review, we zzso the use of next-generation sequencing for diverse zzso technologies, give an overview of the status quo and outline future perspectives for its application in zzso and basic zzso
