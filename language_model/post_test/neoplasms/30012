zzso therapy zzso provides an effective option for treatment of tumors and other diseases in superficial zzso and attracts attention for in zzso study with zzso In this study, we present a significantly improved model of in zzso cell killing through zzso zzso for simulation of the molecular interactions and cell killing in time domain in the presence of oxygen transport within a zzso zzso The zzso of the approach is examined by determination of conditions for obtaining positive definitive solutions of molecular zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso receptors are extracted as the key zzso of molecular zzso with different oxygen diffusion zzso and zzso at the cell zzso By zzso the molecular zzso to cell killing, we develop a modeling method of zzso zzso caused by zzso oxygen and obtain the cell survival ratio as a function of light zzso or initial zzso concentration with different zzso density or zzso of incident light and other parameters of oxygen zzso The results show that the present model of zzso zzso yields a powerful tool to zzso various events underlying zzso at the molecular and cellular levels and to interpret experimental results of in zzso cell zzso
