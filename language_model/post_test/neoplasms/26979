zzso vessels are thought to contribute to zzso primarily by serving as a transportation zzso It is widely believed that tumor cells enter zzso zzso passively by the flow of zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso control tumor cell entry into the zzso zzso which requires active tumor cell zzso In human and mouse zzso zzso protein is detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso but not in the peripheral zzso zzso the zzso for zzso is strongly expressed by human zzso zzso zzso cell migration to zzso zzso cells zzso in zzso is inhibited by blocking zzso or zzso and zzso zzso promotes migration of zzso tumor zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso increase zzso production by zzso and tumor cell migration to zzso In a mouse model, blocking zzso with the soluble zzso or zzso with zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso led to the arrest of tumor cells in the collecting zzso vessels at the junction with the zzso zzso zzso zzso These data identify a novel function for zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso as a critical checkpoint for the entry of zzso into the zzso zzso
