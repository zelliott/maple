The final goal in magnetic zzso research is to use zzso in the form of a zzso suspension injected into human beings for a therapeutic zzso Therefore the challenge is not only to develop magnetic zzso with good heating zzso but also with good zzso properties, long blood circulation time and with grafted zzso able to facilitate their specific zzso in zzso zzso zzso advances have been achieved zzso the properties of the magnetic zzso showing extremely large specific zzso rate values that will contribute to a reduction in the concentration of the magnetic fluid that needs to be zzso In this review we show the effect of different characteristics of the magnetic zzso such as size, size distribution and shape, and the zzso properties of their zzso suspensions, such as zzso size and surface zzso on the heating capacity of the magnetic zzso
