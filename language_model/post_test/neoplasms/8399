The silver zzso of zzso organizer regions zzso was evaluated in a total of zzso zzso from ten different zzso By means of qualitative light zzso type, duration and delay of fixation proved to be influential in determining the zzso zzso For zzso of the zzso technique, zzso time series in 30 tissue blocks of the ten types of tissue were evaluated using digital image zzso The silver incubation time which rendered the most distinct diagnostic difference in the zzso content of benign and zzso tissue varied zzso zzso zzso time has to be adjusted to the individual zzso of each tissue block or tissue section, for which the use of internal zzso standards such as zzso or zzso tissue was found to be zzso For routine purposes, the appropriate silver incubation time is achieved if zzso are visible as black dots mainly within the zzso of zzso zzso
