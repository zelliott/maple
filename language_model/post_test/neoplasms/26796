The way in which energy is used in cells is determined under the influence of environmental factors such as nutritional zzso zzso adaptation is mainly achieved through the zzso of zzso gene zzso and may also involve zzso mechanisms that enable long-term zzso Recent studies have identified that nutrients and their zzso exert an important influence on the zzso as they serve as zzso and/or zzso for zzso zzso Some zzso factors have been shown to regulate zzso genes leading to a shift in energy zzso These findings suggest the concept of zzso zzso that may contribute to the formation of a long-term zzso zzso This is particularly relevant to the zzso of obesity and associated zzso disorders, in which zzso and zzso nutritional conditions affect disease risks in zzso Moreover, most cancer cells exploit zzso pathways for their zzso activity, while zzso zzso leads to zzso zzso regulation in some zzso This review explores the possible mechanisms of zzso zzso that may facilitate our understanding of physiology and zzso
