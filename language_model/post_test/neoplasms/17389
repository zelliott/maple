Blood zzso in tumors can be significantly lower than that in the surrounding normal tissue zzso to the zzso and/or zzso of tumor blood zzso zzso zzso reduces oxygen supply and results in a hypoxic zzso zzso promotes tumor progression and zzso and enhances the invasive and zzso potential of cancer zzso Furthermore, poor zzso lowers the delivery of zzso administered zzso zzso strategies to improve zzso include reduction in vascular zzso by vascular zzso and vascular zzso by alleviating physical forces zzso zzso inside zzso Both strategies have shown promise, but guidelines on how to use these strategies zzso are zzso To this end, we developed a mathematical model to guide the optimal use of these zzso The model accounts for zzso zzso and zzso fluid and drug transport as well as the diameter and zzso of tumor zzso Model simulations reveal an optimal zzso region when vessels are zzso but not very zzso Within this region, zzso distribution of drugs is zzso particularly for drugs 10 zzso in diameter or smaller and of low binding zzso zzso treatments should modify vessel diameter and/or zzso such that zzso is zzso zzso zzso is more effective for zzso but largely zzso vessels zzso zzso whereas solid stress zzso is more beneficial for compressed but zzso vessels zzso pancreatic zzso zzso In the case of tumors with zzso and compressed vessels zzso subset of zzso zzso the two strategies need to be combined for improved treatment zzso
