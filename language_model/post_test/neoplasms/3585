The purpose of the present study was to zzso in conjunction with the National Cancer Institute, the feasibility of using two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso 

The in zzso distribution and DNA incorporation of zzso zzso and zzso (as a zzso were studied in zzso mice bearing human zzso of zzso leukemia zzso zzso of zzso zzso in blood, tumor and normal zzso including liver, zzso heart, zzso zzso brain, and skeletal muscle were zzso 

At 1 h after zzso zzso from all three compounds was distributed in a generally zzso manner, except that zzso and tumor tissue had relatively high zzso of zzso from zzso At 4 h after zzso the zzso of zzso from zzso and zzso were relatively high in zzso and tumor zzso and that from zzso was highest in tumor zzso The zzso muscle concentration ratios were zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso At 24 h after zzso only zzso and tumor zzso contained appreciable amounts of zzso from either zzso In tumor zzso the levels of zzso from zzso were two- to zzso greater than those from zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA from zzso liver, zzso brain, and skeletal muscle showed that, at 24 h after zzso only DNA from tumor tissue contained appreciable zzso of zzso zzso from zzso in tumor DNA was zzso greater than that from zzso and about zzso greater than that from zzso 

The extent of zzso of zzso in tumor tissue and incorporation into tumor DNA indicate that zzso could be useful as a functional PET zzso zzso
