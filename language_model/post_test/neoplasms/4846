In zzso zzso zzso are accepted when the difference between measured and calculated dose is under zzso A statistical analysis has been conducted to determine whether this tolerance matched the clinical practice for the studied zzso zzso zzso head and neck, zzso 

The technical characteristics of the detectors were checked before being used in clinical zzso Then an automatic statistical analysis was implemented using the zzso in zzso zzso zzso obtained during 1 zzso 

The global average is zzso the standard zzso zzso and the percentage of out of level zzso zzso By distinguishing the zzso the zzso tolerance appeared to be too narrow for the breast zzso 

Several investigations were initiated to justify the modification of the tolerance for the breast zzso They highlighted an zzso of the calculated dose when high beam angles are zzso a new correction factor was defined to take account this zzso A specific tolerance was also specified for the breast zzso
