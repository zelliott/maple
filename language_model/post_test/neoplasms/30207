zzso and zzso are small zzso that support zzso development and progression in experimental models of zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, demonstration of their clinical relevance in human tumors remains zzso Here, we developed tools to evaluate Ral protein zzso zzso and zzso output and evaluated their association with zzso parameters in common human tumor zzso To evaluate the relevance of Ral zzso and zzso zzso we correlated zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso status of key human zzso cancer zzso We also identified and evaluated a zzso signature of genes that zzso with depletion of zzso and zzso in zzso The Ral zzso signature score, but not protein expression as evaluated by zzso predicted disease stage, progression to muscle invasion, and survival in human zzso zzso and zzso and stem cell zzso in zzso cancer zzso In prostate cancer, the Ral zzso signature score was associated with seminal zzso invasion, zzso zzso and reduced zzso In zzso cell zzso this score was decreased in cancer zzso compared with normal zzso zzso the experimental findings that Ral acts as a tumor zzso in this tumor zzso Together, our findings show the clinical relevance of Ral in human cancer and provide a rationale for the development of zzso zzso
