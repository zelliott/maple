The zzso of childhood zzso is largely zzso Studies have suggested that birth characteristics may be associated with zzso Our goal was to evaluate the risk of childhood zzso in relation to fetal zzso 

We conducted a zzso study zzso within zzso birth zzso The study included cancer cases diagnosed in Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden among children born from 1967 to 2010 and up to 10 matched controls per case, totaling zzso cases and zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso were derived from conditional zzso zzso 

zzso of all childhood zzso increased with increasing birth weight zzso trend zzso zzso zzso of acute zzso leukemia and zzso tumor were elevated when birth weight was zzso g and of central nervous system tumors when birth weight was zzso zzso zzso large for zzso age were at increased risk of zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tissue tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the risk of acute zzso leukemia was increased among children born small for zzso age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Children diagnosed with central nervous system tumors at zzso year of age had elevated risk with increasing head circumference zzso trend zzso zzso Those with head circumference zzso zzso had the highest risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

In this large, zzso zzso study, increased risks for several childhood tumors were associated with measures of fetal growth, supporting the hypothesis that zzso zzso in childhood is initiated in zzso
