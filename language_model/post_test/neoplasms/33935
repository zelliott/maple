The frequency of cells with structural zzso aberrations zzso in peripheral blood zzso is the first zzso zzso that has shown an association with cancer zzso zzso are usually divided into zzso zzso and zzso aberrations zzso with different mechanisms of zzso From a zzso point of view, it is of interest to clarify whether the cancer zzso of zzso is different with respect to zzso and zzso We report here cancer risk for zzso tested, healthy subjects with respect to frequency of zzso zzso and zzso in peripheral blood zzso using zzso zzso subjects with CA data, zzso subjects with zzso zzso and Italian zzso subjects with CA data, 877 subjects with zzso zzso zzso with a median follow-up of 17 zzso High levels of zzso at test were clearly associated with increased total cancer zzso in the zzso zzso and increased total cancer mortality in the Italian zzso In the zzso zzso significantly elevated cancer risks were observed for subjects with both high zzso and high zzso at test, and these variables showed equally strong cancer zzso The results of the Italian cohort did not indicate any clear-cut difference in cancer zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso There was no significant effect modification by age at test, zzso country, or time since zzso The results suggest that both DNA zzso breaks and other initial DNA zzso responsible for zzso and zzso are associated with cancer zzso
