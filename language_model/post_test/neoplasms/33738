The zzso complex method zzso of zzso employs the sequential application of the zzso complex zzso and the zzso complex (ABC) zzso To assess the efficacy of zzso in the detection of cellular zzso and to compare its utility with that of zzso zzso zzso the authors studied zzso zzso zzso in six examples each of zzso zzso and breast cancer and zzso zzso in five zzso breast zzso ABC, zzso and zzso were applied to these cases alone and in combination with prior zzso zzso of zzso zzso With respect to the number of cells that stained and their intensity in each case, there was significant enhancement of zzso and zzso zzso with zzso as compared with ABC and zzso when zzso zzso was not zzso Further, zzso provided zzso zzso zzso results comparable to those seen with the use of ABC or zzso with zzso zzso zzso treatment was zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso regardless of the method zzso In zzso zzso was clearly superior to ABC and zzso in all settings zzso It may prove to be useful adjunct in the zzso zzso of tissue zzso when more routine zzso yield zzso zzso
