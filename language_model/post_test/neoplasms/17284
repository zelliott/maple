A variety of zzso including multiplex suspension zzso array have been developed for tumor marker zzso however, these zzso could be compromised in their sensitivity and specificity by well-known zzso zzso interference and hook zzso 

Using zzso multiplex suspension zzso zzso we modified protocols with two zzso solutions that can identify zzso zzso interference and zzso hook zzso zzso of the two solutions was assessed in serum samples from zzso 

zzso of 9 tumor markers in zzso zzso positive samples zzso with zzso A, containing zzso zzso zzso and mouse serum, were significantly reduced when compared with those false high signals zzso without zzso A (all zzso With incorporation of zzso H zzso beads linked with zzso zzso a new strategy for identification of zzso hook effect was established, and with this strategy zzso hook effect was identified effectively in serum samples with very high levels of zzso 

Two proprietary solutions improve the identification of zzso zzso interference and zzso hook zzso With these solutions, multiplex suspension zzso zzso provide more reliable testing results in tumor marker detection where complex clinical serum samples are zzso
