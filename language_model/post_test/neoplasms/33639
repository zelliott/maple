Multiple zzso zzso type 2A zzso is one of several kinds of zzso that appear to be inherited in an zzso dominant zzso We have assigned the zzso locus to zzso 10 by linkage with a new DNA marker zzso The linkage led us to investigate other zzso 10 markers and demonstrate linkage between the disease locus and the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso The zzso locus was zzso to zzso by zzso in zzso and the zzso gene to zzso with a secondary site at zzso The linkages were established using zzso members of five families, three different restriction zzso length zzso zzso at zzso and two zzso recognized by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso from zzso linkage analysis between the disease and two marker zzso zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso with maximum zzso scores of zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the three zzso by zzso analysis placed the zzso gene approximately midway between the disease and zzso zzso
