The steroid hormone receptors zzso are zzso zzso zzso factors that are known to influence the development and growth of many human zzso zzso pass signals from a zzso to the target genes by interacting with specific response element DNA sequences and various zzso proteins that consists of zzso and/or zzso zzso in zzso functions of zzso leads to several types of zzso such as breast cancer, leukemia and lymphoma, prostate cancer, zzso cancer, and lung cancer among zzso zzso and their zzso have opened up a unique window for novel zzso targeted therapies for zzso Thus, zzso of zzso signaling in zzso compared with normal zzso can be exploited to target drugs that prevent and treat human zzso In recent years, hormonal therapy has made a major contribution to the treatment of several zzso including reduced recurrence rates and longer survival zzso Development of various steroid zzso zzso and their potential therapeutic zzso has provided us a great opportunity to effectively manage diseases like cancer in zzso In this review article, we have summarized up-to-date knowledge of the role of zzso in the development and progression of zzso and potential zzso therapeutic approaches to tackle these zzso
