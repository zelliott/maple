zzso fresh zzso of human zzso have been cultured in zzso in an attempt to predict their sensitivity to subsequent zzso zzso Only zzso solid zzso zzso were cultured successfully although 12 of the 23 which failed to grow proved later to have benign zzso Of 10 solid zzso from other sites, only zzso zzso zzso and one melanoma were successfully grown and tested in zzso A higher success rate was achieved in zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso and breast zzso origin from zzso and zzso zzso Using increase in cell number after 7 days' growth in zzso as the biological zzso zzso of zzso drugs which are achievable in patients produced significant effects on some zzso zzso zzso studies of serial subcultures in zzso from an zzso zzso showed that large changes in zzso occur within about 2 passages, in zzso so that sensitivity testing can only be carried out using fresh zzso or their first subcultures if any possible correlation between in zzso zzso and in zzso response is to be zzso Clinical effectiveness and in zzso zzso are compared for a limited number of patients with zzso and breast zzso for whom follow-up information was zzso no useful correlation was zzso
