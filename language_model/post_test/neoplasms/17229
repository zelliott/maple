zzso zzso zzso have substantial therapeutic effects in patients with zzso zzso However, only rarely do tumors zzso completely, and the therapeutic effects are often zzso Several mechanisms of resistance to zzso zzso have been zzso The majority of these cause zzso signaling to become insensitive to treatment with zzso zzso by increasing the amount of zzso zzso in cells, whereas others bypass the dependence of the tumor on zzso zzso One motivation for studying mechanisms of drug resistance is that such efforts may suggest new therapeutic targets or rational combination strategies that delay or prevent the emergence of drug-resistant zzso Here, we review the current model of zzso inhibitor resistance with a focus on the implications of this model on ongoing laboratory and clinical efforts to develop more effective therapeutic strategies for patients with zzso zzso
