zzso of cellular zzso zzso enhances the efficacy of many zzso agents in zzso zzso Limited published data showing depletion of zzso in zzso and in patients by zzso and/or zzso provided the rationale for a Phase I zzso zzso and zzso were infused over 24 and 36 zzso respectively, at equal daily zzso zzso was given after zzso to a target plasma area under the curve of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Plasma and peripheral zzso zzso were zzso by zzso liquid zzso The dose of zzso was escalated from 2 to 8 zzso the maximum tolerated dose was 6 zzso zzso depletion in plasma zzso and homocysteine, precursors for zzso zzso was observed zzso zzso to zzso at 8 zzso Plasma zzso and zzso homocysteine levels were zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso were maintained for several hours after zzso infusion had stopped and while zzso infusion was zzso In zzso zzso experiments confirmed that zzso reduces these zzso from zzso to zzso which are readily zzso as evidenced by the significantly increased rate of zzso of zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso treatment caused a moderate depletion of plasma zzso in only zzso of the patients, with a zzso at 24 h and recovery immediately after the end of zzso zzso The zzso depletion in these patients was not dose zzso The profile of zzso recovery in plasma after zzso and the fact that zzso could not reduce zzso zzso in zzso suggest that the observed zzso depletion in plasma in zzso of the patients may be related to direct reactions of zzso with zzso zzso and/or zzso Our results indicate that zzso is a zzso of zzso precursors and that a prolonged infusion of zzso may be required to achieve zzso precursor zzso and the zzso zzso depletion in zzso
