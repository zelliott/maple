This study is based on the zzso theory, radiation being considered as composed of a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso For average zzso parameters zzso zzso the zzso will reach a maximum when single doses of 5 to 6 zzso zzso radiation are zzso Here I assume that hypoxic tumor cells can be eliminated by means of selective zzso The previously zzso zzso zzso and zzso have now practically been given zzso The enhancement in cell sensitivity was too low and they were too zzso Newer drugs based on blocking the zzso zzso zzso zzso of hypoxic cells seem to be very zzso they have no serious side zzso Special zzso supporting the killing of tumor cells with normal oxygen supply could improve radiation zzso The drug zzso 159 zzso zzso zzso reduces the zzso number for zzso tumor zzso An example shows that therapy with 10 X 6 zzso single doses of zzso electrons might reduce the number of tumor cells to about zzso with radiation only to nearly zzso if zzso is given twelve hours before radiation zzso
