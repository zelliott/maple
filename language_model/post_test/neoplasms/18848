The vascular and nervous systems are organized with well defined and accurate networks, which represent the anatomical structure enabling their zzso In recent years, it has been clearly demonstrated that these two systems share in common several mechanisms and zzso For instance, the networking properties of the nervous and vascular systems are governed by common cues that in the brain regulate zzso connections and in the zzso zzso the primitive zzso towards the vascular zzso Here, we zzso the role of zzso as a zzso example of the role of zzso guidance molecules in zzso and pathological zzso Finally, we discuss the presence in blood vessels of zzso and zzso two proteins that finely zzso synaptic activity in the zzso This observation is suggestive of an intriguing new class of molecular and functional parallels between zzso and vascular zzso
