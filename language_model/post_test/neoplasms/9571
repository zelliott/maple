As targeted therapies for cancer become increasingly integrated into standard practice, appropriate selection of the patients most likely to benefit from these therapies is now receiving critical zzso Early experience with therapies directed at targets that are definitively zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso targeted by zzso or zzso zzso the human zzso growth factor zzso 2 zzso targeted by zzso has generated the perception that zzso target assessment is a zzso for therapy with all targeted zzso However, emerging evidence suggests that this is not presently feasible for zzso zzso Despite considerable evidence for the association of zzso and/or plasma vascular zzso growth factor zzso levels with tumor progression and/or poor zzso zzso zzso levels do not appear to be zzso of response to zzso zzso This may possibly be due to the complexity of the zzso pathways and the limitations associated with current methods of zzso detection and zzso zzso low zzso sensitivity and lack of standardized methods could prevent detection of very small increases in zzso which may be clinically important in patients with tumors that are highly dependent on this growth zzso In addition to a general lack of agreement as to the relative clinical relevance of circulating versus tumor zzso levels, the absence of a zzso zzso zzso detection zzso and the lack of a zzso clinically relevant zzso pose a significant hindrance to the clinical utility of zzso zzso for therapy zzso Given the fundamental importance of zzso for tumor growth and zzso and the key role of zzso in these zzso presently it seems appropriate to view zzso agents such as zzso zzso as having potential utility, independently of zzso zzso Further research is needed to define the relationship between potential surrogate markers of zzso zzso activity and clinical zzso
