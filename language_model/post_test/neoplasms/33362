Patients with advanced cancer receiving zzso care often experience severe physical and zzso zzso However, there are limited resources for psychological and emotional zzso zzso writing has shown decreased anxiety level in young and healthy people suffering from a number of zzso 

The purpose of this study was to determine the feasibility of expressive writing in patients receiving zzso care and the most suitable outcomes of expressive writing in this patient zzso 

In this pilot study, patients were randomly assigned to either the expressive writing group zzso or the neutral writing group zzso zzso level before and after the writing session was compared between the two zzso Writing materials were content analyzed using standard qualitative research zzso 

A total of 24 patients (12 in zzso and 12 in zzso were enrolled in the study between October 2006 and January zzso Although the majority of patients zzso were able to complete all baseline zzso poor adherence was observed during the zzso Only zzso of patients completed the zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scores at zzso before and after each writing session between the zzso and zzso zzso 

Our rapid zzso suggests that zzso care patients are interested in participating in studies such as expressive zzso The high level of adherence to the baseline assessments indicates that these assessments were not particularly difficult for our patients to zzso Future studies may need to include patients with better performance status, better patient education, means of emotional expression zzso audio recording, telephone zzso and improved zzso 

We conclude that clinical trials of expressive writing in the zzso care setting are not feasible unless they undergo major modification in methods compared to those previous reported in other patient zzso Our findings will hopefully assist researchers considering similar zzso
