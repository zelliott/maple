The purpose was to compare differences in the depiction of small vessels in tumors seen on zzso from a conventional soft zzso system with those from a zzso radiation system and to evaluate the zzso of these tumors and the growth of zzso 

zzso zzso transplanted to the zzso of 15 rabbits zzso into three groups were investigated after 1, 3, and 7 zzso Five normal rabbits were the zzso zzso zzso to which sufficient gelatin had been added, was injected into the zzso zzso zzso of zzso specimens were obtained with both a conventional soft zzso system and a zzso radiation zzso 

The conventional zzso system could detect vessels with diameters of approximately 100 zzso whereas the zzso zzso radiation system could detect small vessels with diameters of less than 25 zzso On day 1, there was moderate zzso and zzso vessels were present in the transplantation zzso On day 3, zzso vessels were present in the peripheral areas of the tumors and tortuous vessels in the central zzso On day 7, zzso areas had increased in the central zzso 

The zzso radiation system confirmed the growth of zzso in the zzso This system should provide a useful tool for evaluating the zzso of zzso
