A simple zzso zzso model was coupled to a zzso routine and applied to a clinical situation in radiation zzso The dose zzso resulting from various settings of two radiation fields, as well as the zzso response under various assumptions regarding sensitivity and distribution of zzso cells, were calculated zzso The probability of zero surviving zzso cells after 30 zzso was taken as a measure of goodness of the dose zzso and was found to vary rather smoothly over the zzso intervals zzso For some parameters a distinct optimum was found, rather insensitive to different assumptions regarding cell zzso A tolerance factor for healthy zzso based on a zzso relationship, was also zzso It is concluded that a cell kinetic approach to automatic zzso of field parameters in external radiation therapy might be realistic both from zzso and economic points of zzso
