The nuclear exporter zzso zzso plays a key role in normal cell zzso zzso the zzso transport of cargo zzso zzso zzso expression has recently been identified in various zzso however, the mechanisms driving its expression have not been investigated to zzso In this study we identified the zzso promoter and factors associated with its elevated expression and with its repression under conditions of DNA zzso The zzso to zzso zzso promoter region was found to be significantly more active in cancer and transformed cells compared to normal, and the zzso to zzso region identified as responsible for the differential zzso zzso of two zzso boxes and a zzso box within this region significantly diminished zzso promoter activity and zzso analysis revealed binding of zzso and zzso to these sites, with increased binding in transformed and cancer zzso In addition, zzso was found to repress zzso promoter activity, after induction with zzso with zzso zzso blocking the zzso zzso promoter zzso with zzso zzso boxes were significantly less responsive to zzso repression, and in zzso binding of zzso to the zzso boxes was diminished upon zzso zzso suggesting that zzso mediates repression of the zzso promoter via interfering with zzso This was confirmed using zzso zzso cells, in which zzso promoter activity was significantly less responsive to zzso In zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso bind the zzso boxes as a single complex under conditions of DNA zzso In zzso this study is a first to zzso zzso promoter regulation and reveals zzso and zzso as contributors to zzso zzso in zzso In addition, this study reveals that zzso zzso is inhibited by DNA damage and that the mechanism of zzso involves zzso interfering with zzso zzso
