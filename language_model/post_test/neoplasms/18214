zzso zzso peptides show high therapeutic potential as zzso and zzso zzso Some of these peptides carry a zzso zzso zzso which has been shown to be required for zzso zzso However, whether this is a general requirement or whether zzso zzso is required for the zzso activity of zzso peptides is zzso In response, this study analyses the toxicity of a series of zzso zzso zzso peptides and their zzso zzso to normal zzso cells, a variety of zzso cells and bacterial zzso The zzso of these peptides to microbial and cancer cells were generally zzso zzso zzso were either unaffected by zzso zzso or showed up to zzso decreases or increases in zzso However, these peptides all showed toxicity to normal zzso cells with levels zzso zzso zzso that were comparable to those of their zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to previous claims which have been based on analysis of single zzso events, the results of this study clearly show that the zzso zzso of zzso peptides has a variable effect on their zzso and zzso efficacy and no clear effect on their selectivity for these cell zzso
