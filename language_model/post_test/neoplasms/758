DNA zzso zzso pathways in zzso diversification zzso and zzso immunity zzso Here we show how a zzso bacterial zzso zzso can be used to screen for AID zzso with increased zzso zzso The zzso focus on a small number of zzso some highlighting regions implicated in zzso zzso zzso Many of the zzso bring the sequence of AID closer to that of zzso AID zzso can yield increased zzso diversification, raising the possibility that modification of zzso specific activity might be used to regulate zzso diversification in zzso However, zzso of AID also led to an increased frequency of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso specific activity may have been limited by the risk of zzso zzso
