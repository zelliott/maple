A large number of zzso tumor zzso zzso and signal zzso pathways have been zzso Currently, a framework that allows prediction of tumor behavior based upon zzso tumor zzso and signal zzso pathways is zzso In zzso zzso published a periodic table of elements which allowed prediction of properties of elements based upon atomic weights that allowed prediction of chemical and physical properties of elements yet to be zzso In this paper, I will discuss zzso patterns of zzso found in the literature and our laboratory between tumor zzso zzso zzso and signaling pathways that allows one to predict the signaling zzso in a given tumor based upon the zzso of a tumor zzso zzso These patterns can be found in multiple different human zzso zzso one can predict the zzso of a tumor zzso based upon the zzso status of a signaling zzso This knowledge can be used by a zzso or pathologist with access to zzso to make predictions based upon simple technologies and determine the signaling pathways involved in a patient's zzso These strategies may be useful in the design of prevention and treatment strategies for zzso
