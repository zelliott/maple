The influence of surgical stress on the natural killer zzso activity of peripheral blood zzso in patients with zzso of the lung or gastrointestinal system was zzso The peripheral blood zzso of the patients showed a marked decrease in zzso activity against zzso cells as target cells 1-2 days after zzso The activity remained lowered for 2 weeks after zzso and for 1 week after zzso No appreciable suppression of zzso activity was observed with normal human peripheral blood zzso zzso with zzso patient zzso zzso blood zzso cells obtained zzso from patients lost zzso activity after ultraviolet zzso without any zzso loss of zzso Such zzso zzso cells showed zzso of zzso activity after a 24-hour zzso with peripheral blood zzso from normal zzso Similar zzso activity was zzso in a fraction of zzso cells with zzso to plastic zzso dishes, while zzso cells had no such zzso When added immediately to the zzso zzso system without the 24-hour zzso patient zzso cells caused no zzso of zzso activity, whereas adherent cells from normal subjects enhanced zzso zzso The findings seems to indicate that, following surgical stress, plastic zzso peripheral blood zzso cells become deprived of zzso helper activity and exert suppression, thus causing zzso depression of zzso zzso
