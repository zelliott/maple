Many studies utilizing combined zzso zzso and radiation therapy zzso in the treatment of advanced or zzso zzso have reported a correlation between some measure of the minimum temperature achieved and zzso Previous reported studies at Stanford have demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the duration of local control and zzso the mean over treatments of the zzso of zzso measured zzso temperatures in fields which contained diffuse or zzso zzso or zzso measured zzso temperatures in fields treated for microscopic residual zzso Recently, zzso the mean of the temperatures above which zzso of all measured zzso temperatures fall, has been proposed as an alternative characterization of the efficacy of the zzso treatment that reportedly has a superior correlation with zzso To test this hypothesis, zzso was zzso by two different methods for three groups of patients treated at Stanford with zzso for zzso located tumor zzso zzso was found to be strongly correlated with zzso calculated by both zzso All three zzso parameters correlated with complete response at 3 weeks and with local control, although zzso usually demonstrated the strongest zzso
