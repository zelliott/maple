The majority of zzso appear to arise from gene zzso induced by chemicals in the zzso Although the resulting zzso changes which zzso the zzso zzso are still poorly zzso considerable progress has been made in identifying the genes zzso In addition, there have been significant advances in identifying the genes important in determining the sensitivity of cells to zzso zzso Animal studies clearly demonstrate that individual differences in their expression can lead to profound differences in cancer zzso There is a growing body of evidence that zzso in certain of these genes are also involved in cancer zzso in zzso This article describes the identification and role of specific zzso pathways in the zzso initiation and how zzso in their function could relate to cancer zzso
