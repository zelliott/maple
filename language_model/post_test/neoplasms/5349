Two pediatric zzso 

Twelve children with cancer admitted to the zzso unit for zzso zzso treatment of zzso zzso and 16 hospitalized patients receiving zzso therapy 

Patients received zzso suspension either as a single dose or daily dose every morning for 5 consecutive zzso zzso blood samples were collected up to 120 hours after a single dose or during and after multiple doses to characterize the zzso parameters estimated for a zzso zzso zzso 

All 28 patients were zzso for zzso zzso was well tolerated except in one patient with cancer who experienced abdominal zzso and withdrew from the zzso zzso results were not determined in five patients because of insufficient zzso zzso The mean zzso zzso estimates of oral zzso terminal zzso maximum concentration in serum zzso and time to achieve zzso in the 23 zzso patients were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hours, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso hours, zzso These estimates did not differ between zzso zzso zzso and zzso (9 zzso zzso zzso parameters were not different between the 11 children with cancer and the 12 without zzso 

zzso 12 zzso results in zzso higher serum zzso than previously published results for lower doses (5 zzso zzso in concentration profiles among patients is substantial, and age or other yet unidentified clinical factors may explain some of the differences zzso
