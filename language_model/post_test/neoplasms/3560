zzso of zzso factors is one of the mechanisms by which tumors evade zzso zzso factors zzso zzso cell zzso development have recently been identified in culture zzso derived from tumor cell zzso In this study, we investigated the presence of such factors in zzso culture zzso from freshly excised solid human tumors zzso breast, zzso cell zzso and zzso While primary zzso zzso zzso profoundly hampered the in zzso DC differentiation from zzso zzso zzso or zzso precursors (based on zzso and zzso zzso the effects of tested tumor cell zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso present in the primary zzso were found to be solely responsible for the observed hampered differentiation of zzso DC zzso In contrast, both zzso and zzso were found to contribute to the zzso zzso of DC differentiation from zzso precursor zzso While the addition of zzso during differentiation zzso with the ability of zzso DC to stimulate a primary zzso T cell response, it actually increased this ability of zzso These opposite effects were correlated to different effects of the zzso on the expression levels of zzso and zzso on the DC from the different precursor zzso Although zzso increased the T zzso capacity of zzso zzso inhibited the zzso production and increased the zzso production of zzso thus skewing them to a zzso T zzso zzso In conclusion, this study demonstrates that primary tumors zzso impact DC development and function through zzso and zzso regulated factors, whereas zzso cell lines may lose this ability upon in zzso zzso
