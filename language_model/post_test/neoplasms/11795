zzso cultured cell lines of diverse human tumor origins, including 25 melanoma cell lines, were zzso zzso with the use of a modified zzso zzso zzso test in combination with zzso and zzso zzso zzso In 10 cases (1 zzso cell zzso line and 9 melanoma cell zzso the cell line donors had been zzso typed a few years before the cell zzso project had started and in 13 cases (1 zzso cell zzso line and 12 melanoma cell zzso the cell line donors were currently available for comparative typing of zzso zzso results suggested that most cell lines expressed genetically appropriate zzso zzso although 1 cell line had more than two zzso zzso for one zzso locus and 2 cell lines lacked expression of one or more zzso zzso in comparison with donor zzso One zzso cell line, 1 of 2 of the zzso zzso cell lines tested, and 17 of the 25 melanoma cell lines expressed DR zzso in addition to their zzso B, and C locus zzso For 9 of the melanoma cell lines, comparisons with donor DR zzso could be made, and all these cell lines had exactly the same DR zzso as those found on donor zzso zzso typing of cell lines can be used as an adjunct to zzso zzso marker tests to verify their patient source and lack of contamination by another cell line, and zzso typing should be used to determine the zzso composition of cells used in the preparation of zzso for zzso or in studies of zzso zzso
