We have investigated the action of zzso treatment on zzso zzso tissue sections prior to zzso with a variety of commercially available zzso and zzso zzso commonly used in surgical zzso Although zzso zzso often markedly reduced the background and enhanced the zzso for certain zzso false negative zzso or no enhancement of the zzso was observed with other zzso We conclude that the indiscriminate practice of zzso in zzso procedures could be a significant cause of false negative results and of discrepancies between zzso zzso each laboratory must develop its own quality control program for variables such as zzso zzso
