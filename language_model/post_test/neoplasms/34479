All known zzso acids contain varying amounts of modified zzso In contrast to the standard zzso the modified zzso and their zzso as minor zzso acids components cannot be zzso Only part of them can be zzso zzso many modified zzso of zzso acids are enriched in zzso They can be measured at the zzso level by zzso exchange zzso zzso against age, the zzso zzso of the modified zzso are in accordance with the shape of the known growth zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns are found in very young children, probably resulting from a specific zzso acids equipment as well as from different relative growth zzso of different zzso In the urine of patients with zzso often extremely disturbed zzso zzso patterns are found which can be zzso by successful zzso zzso From the published and our own results it is concluded that modifications of zzso acids should play an important regulatory zzso zzso the analysis of modified zzso zzso patterns will open new diagnostic zzso
