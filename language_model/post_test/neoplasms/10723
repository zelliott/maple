Changes in the structure and/or the expression of protein coding genes were thought to be the major cause of cancer for many zzso The recent discovery of zzso zzso zzso transcripts zzso zzso suggests that the molecular biology of cancer is far more zzso zzso zzso have been under investigation due to their involvement in zzso often taking up roles of tumor zzso or zzso Due to the slow nature of experimental identification of zzso zzso zzso procedures have been applied as a valuable complement to zzso Numerous zzso tools, implemented to recognize the features of zzso zzso have resulted in the prediction of novel zzso zzso zzso approaches provide clues as to which are the dominant features that characterize these regulatory units and zzso act by narrowing down the search space making experimental zzso faster and zzso In combination with large scale, high zzso methods, such as deep sequencing, zzso methods have aided in the discovery of putative molecular signatures of zzso deregulation in human zzso This review focuses on existing zzso methods for identifying zzso zzso provides an overview of the methodology undertaken by these tools, and zzso their contribution towards unraveling the role of zzso in zzso
