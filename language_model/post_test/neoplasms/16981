Over the last 15 years, discovery of key growth factors and specific molecular markers for zzso vessels has enabled a new era of molecular research on the zzso vascular zzso As a result, it has been found that zzso the expansion of existing zzso vessels, plays an important role in tumor progression and in the control of chronic zzso At the same time, technical zzso have been made to improve the zzso of the zzso zzso We have recently developed zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso imaging zzso for the zzso quantitative in zzso imaging of zzso vessel zzso Using these zzso a zzso zzso system allows imaging of initial and collecting zzso vessels with high spatial and zzso resolution in zzso In addition, we have developed a new method, using zzso to a zzso specific marker and zzso zzso zzso to sensitively detect zzso expansion in zzso zzso as the earliest sign of cancer zzso These imaging methods have great potential to provide zzso measures to assess the functionality of the zzso system and to assess the efficiency of zzso drug zzso
