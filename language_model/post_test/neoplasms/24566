zzso arise from stem cells in adult zzso and the cells that make up a cancer reflect the same stem cell zzso progeny zzso differentiation progression observed in normal zzso All adult zzso are made up of lineages of cells consisting of tissue stem cells and their progeny zzso cells and terminally differentiated zzso the number of new cells produced in normal tissue lineages roughly equals the number of old cells that zzso zzso result from maturation arrest of this process, resulting in continued proliferation of cells and a failure to differentiate and zzso The biological behavior, zzso appearance, and clinical course of a cancer depend on the stage of maturation at which the genetic zzso is zzso This review makes a comparison of cancer cells to embryonic stem cells and to adult zzso sue stem cells while addressing two basic questions: zzso Where do zzso come zzso and zzso How do zzso zzso The answers to these questions are critical to the development of approaches to the zzso zzso and treatment of zzso
