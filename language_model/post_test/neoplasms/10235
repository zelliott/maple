Conventional cancer treatments mediate their effects via the direct elimination of tumor zzso Nonetheless, recent evidence indicates that zzso and some zzso agents can also induce specific immune responses that contribute to therapeutic zzso Two major zzso changes that determine the immune response against tumors have been zzso the zzso of zzso to the plasma membrane and the release of zzso group box 1 zzso Together, these changes improve zzso and processing of zzso bodies by zzso cells, which are involved in the zzso of zzso T zzso in zzso We review these two molecular mechanisms that dictate the zzso zzso immune response and discuss how this knowledge can be clinically exploited to predict and also zzso the success of zzso
