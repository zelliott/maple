The purpose of this study was to measure zzso prescription zzso rates in elderly cancer zzso around the time of assessment for pain and to evaluate factors associated with receiving zzso for those with severe zzso 

The zzso cohort includes all patients with cancer in Ontario older than age 65 years who completed a pain assessment as part of a provincial initiative of systematic symptom zzso Patients were assigned to mutually exclusive categories by pain score zzso 0, 1 to 3 zzso 4 to 6 zzso and 7 to 10 zzso We linked multiple provincial health databases to examine the proportion of patients with an zzso within 7 days after or 30 days before the assessment zzso We examined factors associated with zzso for patients with pain scores of 7 to zzso 

The proportion of patients with an zzso increased as pain score severity zzso zzso of those with no pain, zzso of those with mild pain, zzso of those with moderate pain, and zzso of those with severe zzso More specifically, for those with severe pain, zzso filled an zzso within 7 days of assessment for pain, and zzso had an zzso from the 30 days before assessment for pain, leaving zzso without an zzso In multivariable analysis, factors associated with zzso are younger age, male sex, zzso illness, cancer type, and assessment at zzso 

Despite a generous time window for capturing zzso the proportion of patients without an zzso seems zzso Further knowledge translation is required to maximize the impact of the symptom screening initiative in Ontario and to zzso management of zzso zzso
