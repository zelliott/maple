The biological effect of zzso zzso is most commonly assessed in terms of the absorbed radiation zzso In zzso conventional zzso methods assume a uniform zzso and calculate a mean dose throughout the zzso However, the zzso of solid tumors tends to be highly irregular and the systemic delivery of zzso is therefore zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the viable, zzso parts of the tumor whereas zzso zzso can penetrate into the necrosis where the dose is zzso As a result, the observed biological effect can be very different to the predicted effect from conventional dose zzso The purpose of this study is to assess the potential for zzso the biological effect of zzso by matching the zzso with tumor structure through the selection of appropriate zzso and zzso Storage zzso plate technology was used to acquire images of the zzso distribution in serial tumor zzso Images of the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso were zzso These images were registered with corresponding images showing tumor zzso zzso images were reconstructed to form zzso maps of the zzso distribution and tumor zzso zzso of the image of zzso distribution with beta dose point zzso generated zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso These were statistically compared with the tumor zzso The highest correlation was obtained for the zzso zzso combined with zzso due to specific retention in viable areas of tumor coupled with the fact that much of the dose was zzso zzso With decreasing zzso the correlation also decreased and with the zzso zzso this correlation was negative, indicating higher zzso in the zzso zzso In conclusion, the dose distribution can be zzso in tumor by selecting the appropriate zzso and zzso This has the potential to lead to a considerable enhancement of the efficacy of zzso in the zzso
