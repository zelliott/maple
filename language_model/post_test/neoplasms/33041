zzso C zzso is a toxic zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso To evaluate its potential to kill cancer cells, the toxin was zzso to the zzso zzso against zzso B which zzso upon binding to zzso B, an zzso zzso on the plasma membrane of cancer zzso A zzso zzso of zzso possessing the same biological activity as the native zzso was reacted with zzso to form a zzso zzso In conditions of the zzso zzso potential, zzso was gradually released from the zzso due to reduction of the zzso bond in the zzso arm of the zzso The zzso activity of the preparation reached maximum in zzso and then decreased zzso As demonstrated by zzso zzso the zzso targeted zzso colon zzso cells but was very slowly zzso the likely reason of only slight zzso being zzso Despite the lack of a clear zzso effect of zzso zzso on zzso cells, we demonstrated in this work a new methodology for the targeted delivery of zzso zzso into cells, promising in research or zzso
