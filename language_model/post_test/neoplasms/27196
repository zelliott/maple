zzso agents are notoriously known to have a narrow therapeutic range that often results in life-threatening zzso zzso it is clinically important to identify the patients who are at high risk for severe toxicity to certain chemotherapy through a zzso zzso In this study, we carried out multiple zzso association studies zzso of 13 122 cancer patients who received different chemotherapy regimens, including zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso treatment, zzso agents zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as combination therapy with zzso and zzso to identify genetic zzso that are associated with the risk of severe zzso in the Japanese zzso In addition, we used a weighted genetic risk scoring system to evaluate the cumulative effects of the suggestive genetic zzso identified from zzso in order to predict the risk levels of individuals who carry multiple risk zzso Although we failed to identify genetic zzso that surpassed the zzso significance level zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ) through zzso probably due to insufficient statistical power and complex clinical features, we were able to shortlist some of the suggestive associated zzso The current study is at the relatively preliminary stage, but does highlight the complexity and problematic issues associated with retrospective zzso zzso However, we hope that zzso of these genetic zzso through local and international zzso could improve the clinical outcome for cancer zzso
