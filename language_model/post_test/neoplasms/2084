The role of oxygen in influencing the zzso and zzso relaxation mechanism in liquids has been known for zzso However, no concerted effort has been made to find a correlation between relaxation rates and oxygen dissolved in cell zzso A procedure has been developed that allows both in zzso and in zzso measurement of oxygen tension in tumors and helps to calculate zzso relaxation zzso
