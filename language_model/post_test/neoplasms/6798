zzso zzso are newly identified small zzso zzso molecules that play important regulatory roles in many biological zzso Changes in zzso expression are associated with a variety of normal zzso processes as well as with human diseases including zzso Thus, one important way to characterize zzso function is to identify changes in zzso expression zzso To date, zzso are the most widely used technique for zzso expression profiling zzso However, there are major limitations when zzso are applied to zzso profiling zzso Here we report a new zzso zzso platform for zzso expression profiling zzso The zzso associated with these zzso zzso were designed using a novel zzso zzso that has incorporated many primer selection features for improved zzso zzso sensitivity, and zzso The primer design zzso has been extensively validated zzso and has been shown to have robust performance for the measurement of zzso expression in a variety of biological samples at a low zzso
