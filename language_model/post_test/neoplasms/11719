The primary prevention of specific human zzso must take into account the likelihood that most zzso result from a complex interaction between multiple environmental zzso and host zzso zzso In addition, the zzso process often proceeds via multiple steps, including zzso promotion, and zzso zzso zzso are required that detect not only initiating zzso but also tumor zzso hormones, and various zzso The known zzso and zzso properties of initiating zzso are reviewed and contrasted with those of tumor zzso The implications of these differences with respect to the detection and zzso of these agents are zzso At present, the zzso for tumor induction in zzso represents the major laboratory approach to zzso zzso The advantages and limitations of such studies are zzso Certain recently developed short-term tests for detecting initiating zzso are critically zzso Progress has also been made in the development of short-term zzso for tumor promoters and in zzso systems that demonstrate synergistic interactions between initiating chemical zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso encountered in zzso findings from zzso zzso and from short-term tests to the assessment of human risks are zzso Much more emphasis must be given to studies that integrate human clinical, laboratory and zzso approaches, if we are to achieve more rational approaches to cancer zzso
