The development of zzso and benign tumors in patient with zzso type 1 zzso was investigated in a long term follow-up study of 70 adult zzso patients living in zzso Sweden, on January 1, zzso Their mean age at that time was 44 years zzso zzso zzso The 70 zzso patients had previously been investigated in a zzso zzso 

The first part of this study involved a cancer registry zzso The authors compared the number of tumors in the 70 zzso patients reported to the Swedish Cancer zzso during the period zzso with the number of tumors expected in the general population by matching the zzso rates of the two populations specific to age, time of zzso and zzso The zzso confidence zzso for the risk zzso between the risk to the patients and the risk to the general population was zzso The second part of the study was a clinical zzso follow-up zzso All living patients were offered a clinical zzso in zzso All hospital records for all the zzso patients were zzso and death certificates were also reviewed when zzso 

zzso tumors were reported to the Cancer zzso four times as often in the zzso patient group as in the general population zzso confidence zzso zzso during the follow-up period zzso Before 1978, 5 of 70 patients zzso had 6 zzso zzso these patients were not included in the Cancer zzso zzso Using all available clinical data on the 70 zzso patients from their birth up to 1990, the authors found that 17 of 70 patients zzso had developed a total of 19 zzso tumors, zzso 5 zzso (in zzso of zzso 13 zzso (in zzso and 1 zzso melanoma (in zzso Four zzso (in zzso of zzso 2 zzso and 1 zzso zzso were zzso Five gastrointestinal zzso tumors (in zzso of zzso were also zzso 

zzso tumors were reported to the Swedish Cancer zzso significantly more often in the zzso patients than was expected in the general population matched for age, zzso and time of zzso The development of tumors is part of the zzso disease process, and this deserves attention both in the clinical setting and in family counseling dealing with complications of zzso in zzso
