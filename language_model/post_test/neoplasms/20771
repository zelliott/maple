zzso is a key zzso in zzso zzso and represents a marker of zzso zzso We previously generated zzso a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso This study was performed to evaluate zzso as a diagnostic zzso zzso for use on zzso zzso pathological zzso We analyzed the specificity of the zzso on a panel of normal and zzso zzso and we assessed its sensitivity in a large number of zzso and primary zzso zzso zzso three zzso and two zzso zzso zzso revealed intense zzso on zzso zzso zzso was limited to cells of zzso differentiation and no zzso was present in unrelated normal zzso and zzso zzso percent of zzso zzso zzso were zzso with zzso and showed predominantly a homogeneous expression zzso However, in primary zzso of the zzso cell type, zzso revealed a poor zzso zzso showed intense zzso at the zzso zone, while the zzso component revealed decreasing zzso towards deeper zzso Only one zzso was zzso zzso with zzso zzso specimens were zzso We conclude that zzso is a specific and sensitive marker for the detection of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and a useful zzso zzso for diagnostic zzso
