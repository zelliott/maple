In this study, limited sampling models for zzso human zzso zzso zzso were developed to predict the area under the concentration time curve from timed serum zzso Patients were administered 15 minute infusions of 25 zzso (11 zzso 100 zzso (15 zzso and 250 zzso (2 zzso A detailed zzso analysis zzso time points) was performed to obtain the area under the curve for each of the 28 patients using a zzso model with the values zzso to a dose of 100 zzso Various models were then developed to estimate the area under the curve from one and two timed zzso using zzso analysis zzso Of these models, four were determined to be of interest with zzso of zzso ranging from zzso to zzso They performed quite well in predicting the area under the curve values with relative root mean squared zzso error of zzso to zzso and relative mean zzso error of zzso to + zzso These models should be extremely useful in larger scale, Phase zzso studies of zzso in zzso the estimated area under the curve with various demographic data, zzso and zzso
