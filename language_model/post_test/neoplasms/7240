A large collection of cultured human tumor cell lines was characterized for the zzso of 16 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso primarily to detect and monitor against cell line zzso Among 100 highly characterized cell lines, 59 lines from different patients and 6 pairs of lines (each pair from the same patient's zzso had unique zzso combinations and were therefore presumed to be authentic, zzso cell zzso Besides these 71 lines, the remaining 29 lines consisted of several small groups of two to three lines, each group having a different combination and being among the more frequent in the normal zzso The 29 lines, therefore, were not suspected to be zzso Among unusual findings were the zzso 1 plus 2 zzso determined for two zzso tumor lines, a zzso A zzso found in a line of Caucasian origin determined not to be a zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in several zzso Except for kidney tumor lines, there was no correlation of zzso zzso tissue zzso between tumor lines and normal zzso of zzso For several zzso significant zzso were found in proportions of the zzso observed in Caucasian cell lines from expected proportions on the basis of normal population data, indicating possible natural selection among these lines in tissue culture or among the patients of zzso
