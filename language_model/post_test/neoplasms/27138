Several zzso zzso and zzso are currently considered as cancer targets based on their critical role during the cell division cycle and their significant level of expression in human zzso Yet, their use is limited by the lack of selectivity against tumor cells, the low percentage of zzso cells in many human tumors, and zzso zzso As a consequence, initial clinical trials have shown limited zzso Despite these zzso zzso zzso is a promising strategy that deserves further zzso Future advances will benefit from more specific zzso with better zzso properties, a clear zzso characterization and zzso requirements of old and new zzso targets, and rational strategies based on synthetic lethal interactions to improve selectivity against tumor zzso
