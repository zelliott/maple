Strategies for cancer reduction and management are targeted at both individual and area zzso zzso strategies require careful understanding of geographic differences in cancer zzso in particular the association with factors such as socioeconomic status, ethnicity and zzso This study aimed to identify the complex interplay of zzso factors associated with high zzso zzso of Australian priority zzso using a zzso and zzso tree zzso zzso 

zzso smoothed zzso zzso ratios were estimated for zzso zzso across zzso statistical local areas in Queensland, Australia zzso zzso zzso zzso For those zzso with significant spatial variation, zzso models were used to identify whether zzso accessibility, socioeconomic status and ethnicity were associated with high zzso zzso 

The accessibility of a person's residence had the most consistent association with the risk of cancer diagnosis across the specific zzso Many zzso were likely to have high zzso in more urban areas, although male lung cancer and cervical cancer tended to have high zzso in more remote zzso The impact of socioeconomic status and ethnicity on these associations differed by type of zzso 

These results highlight the complex interactions between accessibility, socioeconomic status and ethnicity in determining cancer zzso zzso
