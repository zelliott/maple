This study was undertaken to investigate the treatment schedules used clinically for highly zzso zzso particularly with reference to the effects of fraction size, fraction number and treatment zzso The linear zzso model (with time zzso is used here to compare zzso treatment regimens zzso accelerated and zzso zzso currently the focus of zzso trials, with each other and some common zzso zzso To ensure easy interpretation of results, two parameters known as zzso standard effective dose one zzso and zzso standard effective dose two zzso have been calculated for each zzso zzso of zzso and zzso versus potential doubling time zzso have been generated for a range of zzso regimens which are currently under trial in various zzso zzso From these zzso it can be seen that the highly accelerated schedules (such as zzso only show advantages for zzso with very short potential doubling zzso zzso for most of the schedules considered showed at least equivalent zzso control expected for the trial schedule compared with the control arm used and these values agree quite well with clinical zzso These calculations are in good agreement with clinical results available at zzso The greater the zzso or zzso for the schedule considered the greater the zzso control, which can be zzso However, as has been seen with clinical trials, this higher cell kill also results in higher acute effects which have proved too great for some accelerated schedules to zzso
