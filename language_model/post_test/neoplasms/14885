The zzso zzso zzso family is almost universally zzso across all three zzso of life: zzso zzso and zzso zzso organisms possess one zzso zzso whilst zzso possess zzso Gene zzso through evolution has been accompanied by structural and functional zzso Many zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but some more recently evolved members lack zzso zzso activity and/or display other functions, for instance, acting as protein zzso or zzso zzso These members display overlapping but distinct expression patterns during zzso zzso In this review, we describe the functional differences and similarities among various zzso family zzso Moreover, we establish zzso relationships through a zzso analysis of zzso members across zzso species, including zzso zzso and zzso primitive zzso and several zzso of zzso Finally, we zzso the involvement of zzso proteins in development, in particular neural zzso zzso is a process of zzso development, and zzso was initially implicated as a zzso zzso A more detailed understanding of the evolution of the family and its role in zzso development will facilitate zzso of the mechanism of zzso involvement in human zzso
