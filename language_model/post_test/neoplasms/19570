The zzso zzso of zzso play an important role in the design of radiation therapy treatment zzso The purpose of this work is to explore their influence on external beam zzso for fast and slowly zzso tumors and develop an zzso framework for zzso specific zzso zzso The linear zzso model is used to describe radiation response of zzso in which the time dependence of zzso damage repair and the zzso and zzso effects are zzso The optimum zzso strategy is defined as the treatment scheme that zzso tumor biologically effective dose zzso while keeping normal tissue zzso zzso The influence of different model parameters on total dose, overall treatment time, fraction size, and intervals is also zzso The results showed that, for fast zzso tumors, the optimum overall time is similar to the assumed kickoff time zzso and almost independent of zzso zzso zzso increase in tumor control can be achieved using accelerated schemes for the tumors with doubling time smaller than 3 days, but little is gained for those with doubling time greater than 5 zzso The incomplete repair of normal zzso between two consecutive zzso in standard zzso has almost no influence on the fractional doses, even for the zzso with an zzso time of 8 zzso However, when the zzso effect is included, the fractional doses at the beginning and end of each zzso week become obviously higher than others in the optimum scheme and the zzso scheme has little advantage over the standard or zzso zzso For slowly zzso tumors, provided that the zzso ratio of the tumor is comparable to that of the normal zzso a zzso is more zzso The overall treatment time should be larger than a zzso which is predominantly determined by the zzso zzso The proposed technique provides a useful tool to systematically zzso zzso for fast and slow zzso tumors and sheds important insight into the complex problem of zzso zzso
