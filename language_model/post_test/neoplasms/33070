Clinical development of zzso the active zzso of zzso zzso has been hampered due to its poor zzso We have developed a novel zzso zzso zzso made by linking zzso with a zzso zzso zzso via a zzso zzso 

The in zzso zzso of zzso was tested using the zzso zzso The therapeutic efficacy of zzso was evaluated in various zzso including an in zzso zzso zzso zzso and blood concentration of zzso zzso and zzso was determined by zzso liquid zzso 

In zzso zzso was zzso to zzso more potent than zzso in a panel of human tumor cell zzso In zzso models of zzso breast, zzso zzso or zzso colon zzso treatment with either a single dose or multiple injections of zzso was more zzso (and in some cases produced tumor zzso for zzso weeks) compared with zzso at their respective maximum tolerated doses or corresponding dose levels zzso zzso zzso Most interestingly, zzso showed marked zzso activity in animals that developed resistance to an zzso course of zzso treatment, as well as outperformed zzso as second-round therapy in mice initially sensitive to zzso zzso had prolonged circulation in the blood compared with zzso resulting in high tumor zzso This resulted in higher and zzso tumor exposure of free zzso in mice given zzso compared with those given zzso 

zzso data suggest that zzso may be a promising zzso agent in a wide variety of clinical settings, including tumors zzso to zzso zzso
