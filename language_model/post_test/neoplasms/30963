The zzso death rate is a commonly used indicator in the assessment of progress against zzso However, since the cause of death is often not substantiated and complete medical information is zzso the zzso of zzso mortality rates is being zzso 

We investigated the zzso of the zzso death rate by examining zzso deaths of cancer patients in a large patient zzso 

Data were obtained from the National Cancer Institute's zzso zzso and End zzso zzso Program on cancer patients diagnosed between 1973 and 1987, with follow-up complete through December zzso The zzso database consists of zzso million records from nine zzso zzso covering nine geographic regions of the United zzso Rates of zzso deaths in the zzso population were obtained from the National Center for Health zzso Cancer mortality rates were zzso from overall mortality rates to obtain zzso death rates by sex and the zzso age group for each calendar zzso Excluded from the study were patients of races other than White and those diagnosed at age 85 years or more due to absence of zzso death rate zzso Also excluded were cancer cases discovered at autopsy and in persons less than 20 years of zzso The statistical analysis employed a zzso zzso 

The ratio of zzso zzso death rates, as calculated by dividing the number of patient zzso deaths per year by the number found in the matched zzso population data and referred to as the zzso relative zzso is considered significant with values greater than 1 for those with all zzso combined and for the common solid tumors zzso Of the 12 leading causes of death other than cancer in the patient population, the most common causes were circulatory and respiratory zzso The zzso relative risk of death decreased rapidly after diagnosis and also decreased with the patient's age at zzso It increased slightly with the calendar year of zzso 

Because more zzso deaths occurred shortly after diagnosis, it appears that this excess was caused by treatment of the zzso Generally, zzso death rates underestimate the mortality associated with a diagnosis of zzso zzso because the degree of zzso changes with time, an examination solely of zzso mortality in assessing progress against the disease is zzso
