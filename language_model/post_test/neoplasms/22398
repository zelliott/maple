We conducted a feasibility study of zzso zzso for breakthrough cancer pain, to determine whether a larger, zzso trial was warranted, and to identify a study design that would be likely to zzso From approximately 1930 patients in the initial pool, nine patients were zzso Five patients completed the study, generating data on 83 discrete episodes of breakthrough cancer pain at optimal zzso Mean pain intensity dropped by zzso points (on a 10 point zzso zzso within 10 zzso of zzso zzso administration, and by zzso points after 15 zzso No serious or severe toxicity was zzso Based on the results of this feasibility study, a larger zzso clinical trial of zzso zzso for breakthrough cancer pain using this trial model would not be zzso zzso information obtained from small numbers of carefully studied patients provides proof of concept that zzso zzso is effective, safe, and well zzso
