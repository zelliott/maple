The screening of zzso expression libraries derived from human tumors with zzso zzso zzso is a powerful method for defining the structure of tumor zzso recognized by the zzso immune zzso zzso distinct zzso zzso to zzso zzso with zzso zzso were identified by zzso analysis of 4 zzso cancer patients and were characterized in terms of zzso zzso zzso expression pattern, and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have a known association with human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso map to the small cell lung cancer tumor zzso gene locus on zzso zzso zzso is equivalent to zzso a gene that is defective in zzso syndrome and zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso gene involved in the zzso zzso zzso Genes zzso 3 of the zzso in the series showed differential zzso zzso zzso displays a pattern of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso are expressed at a high level in zzso in comparison to 15 other normal zzso The other 62 zzso were broadly expressed in normal zzso With regard to zzso 20 of the 65 zzso reacted only with zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted with zzso from normal donors, indicating that their zzso is not restricted to zzso The remaining 12 zzso reacted with zzso from zzso of the cancer patients but not with zzso from normal zzso zzso percent of the zzso cancer patients had zzso directed against one or more of these 12 zzso Our results demonstrate the potential of the zzso approach for the analysis of the zzso immune response against human zzso
