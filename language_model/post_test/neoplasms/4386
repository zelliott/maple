To estimate the risk of zzso in a cohort of patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso from a university medical zzso 

The cohort consisted of patients with lupus who were residents of zzso County and who were seen at the University of Pittsburgh, zzso Cases of cancer were identified by a postal survey and review of medical zzso The expected number of zzso in the lupus cohort were estimated from age, sex, and race adjusted census and cancer zzso data from zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios and zzso confidence intervals for all zzso were zzso 

Six zzso zzso were observed in the 219 lupus patients from zzso County during the observation zzso zzso and after the first visit at the University of zzso The expected number of zzso was zzso The standardized zzso ratio for cancer in the lupus cohort from zzso County was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso The frequency of zzso was not increased in the small number of patients who had received zzso drugs before the diagnosis of zzso zzso zzso occurred in one patient, who also had zzso syndrome, and in one patient before entry into this study who was treated with zzso following zzso zzso No zzso zzso were observed during the study zzso 

The overall frequency of zzso was not increased in this medical center cohort of patients with lupus during a mean followup zzso of zzso zzso zzso followup and a zzso effort is needed to refine risk estimates of cancer in patients with zzso
