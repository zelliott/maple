Advances made in the area of zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso have enabled the interrogation of the entire zzso at a previously unattainable zzso This has lead to the discovery of a novel class of alternative entities called large-scale copy number variations zzso These zzso are often found in regions of closely linked sequence zzso called zzso that are thought to facilitate zzso zzso in some classes of zzso Recently, it was proposed that zzso located near the zzso zzso break points on zzso 9 and 22 in chronic zzso leukemia zzso may facilitate this zzso zzso Furthermore, approximately zzso of zzso patients also carry a zzso on the zzso 9 zzso zzso and these patients have a poor zzso It has been zzso that zzso deletion patients have increased levels of zzso zzso 

In this study zzso was performed and identified a zzso zzso zzso called zzso that was present as a zzso gain or loss in zzso of control DNA samples derived from zzso normal zzso zzso was the same clone identified by zzso et zzso as a zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was used to determine the relative frequency of this zzso in DNA from a series of 16 zzso patients (both with and without a zzso zzso together with DNA derived from 36 zzso solid tumors in comparison to the zzso of zzso in control zzso zzso was present in approximately 50% of both tumor and zzso DNA, but was found in zzso of zzso bearing a zzso zzso Chi square analysis found a statistically significant difference zzso zzso zzso between the zzso of this zzso in cancer and normal DNA and a slightly increased zzso in zzso with deletions in comparison to those zzso without a zzso zzso 

The increased zzso of zzso in tumor samples suggests that either acquired or inherited zzso variation of this new class of variation may be associated with onset or progression of zzso
