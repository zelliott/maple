The zzso of human zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in various types of cancer and has been zzso as an zzso target in zzso zzso In view of the low zzso of this zzso we designed a method based on the zzso technique to generate 14 tandem repeats of the zzso sequence X of zzso zzso These zzso repeated copies were then combined with zzso zzso 37 peptides zzso and finally fused to zzso zzso protein 65 zzso to construct a fusion protein zzso as an zzso In this study, zzso female mice were zzso via subcutaneous injection of the designed zzso zzso immune and cellular immune responses were effectively zzso A high zzso of zzso zzso was detected in zzso mice zzso by zzso zzso zzso and verified by Western zzso zzso The fusion zzso zzso effectively inhibited the growth of zzso zzso zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso may be an effective tumor zzso and the use of multiple tandem repeats of a certain zzso is an effective method to overcome the low zzso of zzso zzso
