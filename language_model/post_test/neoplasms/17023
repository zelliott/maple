DNA mismatch repair zzso maintains zzso stability primarily by correcting zzso zzso zzso in zzso lead to several human zzso characterized by frequent zzso in simple repetitive DNA zzso a phenomenon called zzso instability zzso In most zzso zzso genetic or zzso changes that alter the function or expression of an essential zzso protein have been zzso However, in a subset of zzso zzso zzso or genetic changes have not been found in known zzso zzso such that the molecular basis of the zzso zzso in these cells remains zzso A possible answer to this puzzle emerged recently when it was discovered that zzso a well-studied zzso zzso modification or zzso mark, plays a role in regulating human zzso in zzso In this review, potential roles for this zzso mark to zzso zzso stability and cancer zzso in human cells are zzso
