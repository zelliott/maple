To identify zzso markers with consistent effect on tumor dynamics across multiple cancer series, discrimination zzso based on zzso hazards models can be used since they do not depend heavily on the sample zzso However, the underlying assumption of zzso of the hazards does not always hold, especially when the studied population is a mixture of cured and zzso patients, like in zzso zzso We propose a novel index that zzso the capability of a zzso marker to separate zzso patients, according to their zzso zzso It allows to identify zzso markers characterizing tumor growth dynamic across multiple zzso zzso results show that our index performs better than classical zzso based on the Cox zzso It is neither affected by the sample size nor the cure rate zzso In a zzso of zzso breast zzso the index allows to select zzso markers with a potential consistent effect on tumor growth zzso
