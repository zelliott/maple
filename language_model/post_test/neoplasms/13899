It has recently been shown that the relative risks of the order of 2 to 4 that are frequently found for cancer among relatives of affected cases are unlikely to be zzso by shared environmental risk zzso Classical methods of zzso analysis are not well suited to such analysis because they assume that the outcomes of each individual are zzso Classical methods of genetic analysis, on the other hand, are limited in their handling of environmental factors and variable ages of zzso The recent development of random effects models for survival analysis, however, appears to bridge this zzso Specifically, a zzso hazards model is zzso for the effects of measured zzso and of one or more components of frailty that are zzso but assumed to have some common distribution and known zzso structure within each zzso From these zzso the zzso expectation of the hazard for each individual can be zzso given the zzso value and the observed and expected disease history of the zzso These are then treated as known in a standard partial likelihood zzso this is essentially a form of zzso zzso However, this does not provide a valid estimate of the zzso zzso because it fails to take account of the zzso in the estimates of the zzso an alternative approach using the zzso zzso is zzso This paper describes extensions of this approach to zzso frailty zzso modifications for application to pedigree and zzso studies, some simulation results, and applications to studies of breast cancer in twins and of lung cancer in relation to family smoking zzso
