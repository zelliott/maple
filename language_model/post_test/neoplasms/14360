zzso metallic zzso was developed to prevent tumor zzso However, procedural accidents due to its zzso often occur and migration after long-term zzso causes zzso The zzso partially covered zzso zzso with reduced zzso force enables zzso along the zzso zzso We examined the usefulness of zzso placement in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We examined procedural zzso zzso obstruction rate, and zzso period caused by zzso zzso 

zzso patients were zzso procedural accidents caused by zzso zzso occurred in 8 patients zzso composed of acute zzso in 3 patients zzso acute zzso in 2 patients zzso acute zzso in 1 patient zzso and other in 1 patient zzso The zzso obstruction rate was zzso (19 zzso and obstruction cause includes sludge in 9 patients zzso migration in 4 patients zzso food zzso in 3 patients zzso zzso in 1 patient zzso overgrowth in 0 patients zzso and unknown in 2 patients zzso The mean zzso zzso period was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso has less procedural accidents when inserted into zzso zzso zzso obstruction patients with reduced migration rate after a long period and low obstruction zzso
