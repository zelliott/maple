zzso with direct current delivered through implanted zzso is used for local control of solid tumors in both zzso and clinical zzso The aim of this research is to develop a solution method for obtaining a three-dimensional zzso expression for potential and electric current density as functions of direct electric current intensity, differences in zzso between the tumor and the surrounding healthy zzso and zzso number and polarity of zzso The influence of these parameters on electric current density in both media is zzso The results show that the electric current density in the tumor is higher than that in the surrounding healthy tissue for any value of these zzso The conclusion is that the solution method presented in this study is of practical interest because it provides, in a few minutes, a convenient way to zzso in zzso the electric current zzso generated by a zzso zzso array by means of the adequate selection of direct current intensity, zzso number, and polarity of electrodes, and the difference in zzso between the solid tumor and its surrounding healthy zzso
