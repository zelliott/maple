The excess mortality following zzso psychosis is well zzso However, the causes of death in a complete zzso cohort and mortality patterns over time compared with the general population are zzso 

All zzso patients who presented for the first time with psychosis in three defined zzso areas of the zzso in London zzso zzso Nottingham zzso zzso and zzso and Galloway zzso zzso were traced after a mean of zzso years follow-up and death certificates were zzso Data analysis was by indirect zzso 

The overall standardized mortality ratio zzso for zzso psychosis was 184 zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso Most deaths zzso zzso were from natural causes, although suicide had the highest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Diseases of the respiratory system and infectious diseases had the highest zzso of the natural causes of death zzso zzso zzso zzso The risk of death from diseases of the circulatory system was also elevated compared with the general population zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas there was no such difference for zzso zzso 111, zzso zzso zzso There was strong evidence that the mortality gap compared with the general population for all causes of death zzso and all natural causes zzso increased over the four decades of the zzso There was weak evidence that cardiovascular deaths may be increasing relative to the general population zzso 

People with zzso psychosis have an overall mortality risk that is nearly double that of the general zzso Most excess deaths are from natural zzso The widening of the mortality gap over the last four decades should be of concern to all clinicians involved in delivering zzso
