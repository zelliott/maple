zzso zzso peptides zzso are a new class of promising molecular imaging zzso for the zzso of zzso in zzso The zzso function of a zzso zzso is efficiently blocked by zzso zzso interactions with a zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso present between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and enables the activated zzso zzso to enter zzso Here, we aimed to develop an zzso sensitive to zzso zzso and -9 zzso for nuclear imaging zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides zzso were prepared by zzso zzso zzso synthesis and labeled with zzso or zzso for zzso zzso The in zzso zzso of these zzso was assessed in zzso zzso mice zzso zzso 6) and healthy mice zzso zzso 4) using zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso serving as a positive control was evaluated in zzso mice zzso zzso zzso 

zzso studies showed a zzso retention of zzso in tumor than in muscle zzso zzso zzso and a zzso tumor retention relative to zzso zzso zzso zzso supporting earlier studies on zzso labeled zzso proposing zzso by zzso zzso Surprisingly, however, the zzso of zzso was significantly higher than that of zzso in almost all zzso zzso zzso zzso To unravel the zzso process of zzso in zzso we developed zzso zzso zzso zzso that allowed us to discriminate between zzso zzso and activated zzso In zzso zzso of zzso indicated that the zzso counts originated from activated zzso Interestingly, zzso administration to healthy mice, compared with zzso zzso mice, resulted in a similar zzso zzso Furthermore, a zzso zzso zzso showed zzso ratios equal to those found for zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This study demonstrates that the tumor targeting of zzso zzso zzso is most likely caused by the zzso in the vascular compartment rather than zzso zzso as suggested zzso The results in the present paper indicate that different and more zzso zzso combinations are needed to unleash the full potential of the elegant zzso concept in living zzso
