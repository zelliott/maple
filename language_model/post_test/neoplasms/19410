The role of adult stem cells in tissue zzso has attracted much interest because of its enormous therapeutic zzso Adult stem cells reside in every tissue of the body and have the ability to zzso and to give rise to a high number of differentiated zzso These are indeed the essential steps in tissue zzso which in some cases occurs zzso whereas in other cases happens in response to an zzso The identification of the key factors involved in zzso and differentiation pathways is at the top of the agenda of stem cell zzso Interestingly, a number of factors that govern the fate of adult stem cells also play a role in zzso cell zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, rare zzso of cancer stem cells were identified for leukemia and other solid zzso These rare zzso of cancer stem cells are in large part responsible for maintaining the tumor mass, as they have the capacity to zzso and to generate a high number of progeny via differentiation zzso These findings can be considered a major breakthrough in cancer zzso Currently, zzso and stem cell biologists have two main zzso zzso the assessment of the consistency of the line that divides adult stem cells and zzso zzso to better characterize the biology of cancer stem zzso This new line of investigation may allow for the development of novel zzso and cancer zzso
