In an attempt to gain insight into the mechanism of zzso transformation by BK virus zzso a human zzso we have zzso for zzso sequences in transformed zzso cells in which zzso transformation had occurred as a result of zzso by human tumor DNA positive for zzso zzso Even though the sources of the zzso DNA contained zzso zzso the transformed zzso cells which arose from the zzso for the most part did not retain zzso zzso In only one barely zzso case was zzso DNA found associated with zzso DNA, and in only a small minority of the transformed cells was zzso DNA detected in the zzso zzso indicating an zzso zzso Even in these few cases where zzso sequences were present in an zzso form, altered migration on gels of some zzso bands zzso to bands derived from cloned viral zzso suggested deletions and zzso of zzso zzso We employed several different probe zzso for these studies, including zzso random primer and a zzso zzso probe which gave a sensitivity that could detect better than zzso copy of viral zzso per zzso zzso We conclude that transformation by zzso with human tumor DNA does not require persistence of the zzso viral zzso suggesting that either zzso virus was irrelevant to original zzso in zzso with models proposed by others for zzso zzso
