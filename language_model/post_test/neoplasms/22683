Patients with solid tumors zzso to standard therapy, or for which no standard therapy is available, were zzso zzso was administered as a 30-minute infusion every 3 zzso The starting dose was 2 zzso as zzso zzso and an accelerated zzso schedule was zzso zzso analysis was conducted in cycles 1 and zzso 

zzso patients were enrolled in the zzso No zzso zzso patients were zzso zzso toxicity was zzso zzso zzso especially zzso was mostly grade 1 or 2 during study zzso Two of nine patients had zzso during cycle 1 at the 28 zzso dose zzso zzso were mostly zzso or a related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso released from zzso were slowly eliminated from the zzso with a zzso zzso of approximately 140 and 210 hours, zzso zzso exposure to both zzso zzso and zzso increased in proportion to the zzso A zzso zzso cancer patient and a lung zzso tumor patient had an objective response and continued the study treatment for 5 and 12 months, zzso 

zzso was well tolerated and showed zzso activity including partial responses and several zzso of prolonged stable disease across a variety of advanced zzso zzso Phase II studies are zzso
