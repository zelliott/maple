Group sequential testing procedures have seen wide use in Phase II clinical zzso The sample proportion p of zzso is the commonly used zzso for the zzso response probability zzso It can be shown that p is the maximum likelihood zzso zzso of zzso It is well known that zzso can be in general zzso and p in particular zzso biased zzso if zzso zzso follows a group sequential zzso In this paper we zzso investigate the bias of zzso We find that the magnitude of the bias of p is less than zzso in all cases we zzso We apply the idea in zzso to propose a zzso zzso that reduces the bias substantially and reduces the mean square error as well in a certain range of zzso We also evaluate the zzso minimum zzso unbiased zzso zzso If one does not mind a bias of zzso one may find the sample proportion a suitable zzso for p because of its simplicity and easy zzso If one is concerned with bias, the zzso zzso may be a good zzso
