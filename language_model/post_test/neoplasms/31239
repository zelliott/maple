We have studied the zzso patterns of zzso zzso during the first 24 h at 5 zzso before and 5, 15, 180, and zzso zzso after zzso bone zzso transplantation zzso in 14 patients with cancer (6 with zzso 5 with zzso zzso 2 with zzso and 1 with Ewing's zzso using zzso flow zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso Although the great majority of the injected cell populations were zzso 5 zzso after graft infusion, the number of zzso T zzso increased at 5 and 15 zzso and again at 24 h zzso In contrast, the number of zzso natural killer zzso cells decreased rapidly after zzso to remain low throughout the observation zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso by their expression of zzso and zzso zzso were present before, as well as after zzso in numbers indicating that they were probably of zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were identified in a zzso flow zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso and tended to increase during the first 15 zzso after zzso Finally, when zzso were followed zzso they were found to be practically absent before zzso but were clearly zzso in 12 of 14 patients throughout the observation zzso We conclude that zzso zzso exhibit different zzso patterns after zzso and in light of the increased knowledge about zzso zzso these data could provide a platform for attempts to control zzso zzso during stem cell zzso
