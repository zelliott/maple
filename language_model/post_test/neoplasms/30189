To evaluate the effects of zzso Character zzso zzso on the automatic cancer zzso of pathology zzso 

zzso images of pathology reports were converted to electronic zzso using a commercial zzso zzso A state-of-the-art cancer zzso system, the Medical zzso zzso zzso system, was used to automatically zzso the zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso on the zzso versions of the reports were compared with the zzso from a human amended version of the zzso zzso 

The employed zzso system was found to zzso scanned pathology reports with up to zzso character accuracy and up to zzso word zzso Errors in the zzso processing were found to minimally impact on the automatic zzso of scanned pathology reports into zzso zzso However, the impact of zzso errors is not negligible when considering the extraction of cancer notification items, such as primary site, zzso type, zzso 

The automatic cancer zzso system used in this work, zzso has proven to be robust to errors produced by the acquisition of zzso pathology reports from scanned images through zzso zzso However, issues emerge when considering the extraction of cancer notification zzso
