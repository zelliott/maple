This paper proposes the use of zzso designs in phase II zzso clinical trials and evaluates their statistical properties in terms of power recovery and zzso A zzso phase II design for a new cancer treatment for a specific zzso zzso zzso consists of random allocation of patients to receive either the zzso treatment or a standard treatment known to have activity at a certain level in phase II trials zzso 5 zzso expected response proportion zzso zzso Patients assigned to the standard treatment form the zzso zzso The zzso group is not a control group in the traditional sense and one does not conduct a formal efficacy comparison between the zzso treatment group and the zzso zzso Instead, one uses the zzso group to evaluate whether the sample of patients who receive the zzso treatment has the capability of showing a zzso If the data do not support the hypothesis that the expected response proportion prevails in the zzso group, one declares the zzso group results suspect and recommends a second zzso Assuming acceptable results of the second trial, we use zzso calculations to find the effect of the zzso design on power recovery and relative zzso We show that when an zzso sample occurs, zzso designs generally recover 90 per cent or more of nominal power at a cost of three to fivefold increase in sample zzso We recommend for zzso phase II trials a zzso zzso approach in which several zzso treatment arms share one concurrent zzso zzso
