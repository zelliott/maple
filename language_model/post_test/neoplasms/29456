To assess the association between serum zzso levels and cancer zzso 

The zzso syndrome and cancer project zzso includes zzso from Norway, Austria, and zzso the current study included data on zzso men and zzso zzso The mean age at study entry was zzso years for men and zzso years for zzso The mean follow-up time was zzso years zzso zzso zzso for men and zzso years zzso zzso zzso for zzso Excluding the first year of zzso zzso men and zzso women were diagnosed with zzso Cox zzso models were used to calculate relative risk zzso of cancer for zzso levels in zzso and as a continuous zzso zzso were corrected for random error by use of zzso dilution zzso 

Relative risk for top zzso versus bottom zzso of zzso of overall cancer was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso in men and zzso zzso in zzso For specific zzso significant increases for top zzso versus bottom zzso of zzso among men were found for zzso of the zzso respiratory zzso the zzso melanoma and zzso and among women, for zzso zzso and zzso skin zzso 

Data from our study provided evidence for a possible role of serum zzso in cancer zzso
