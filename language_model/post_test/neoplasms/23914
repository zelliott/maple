Parallel zzso zzso studies and zzso analysis were performed on 15 various human solid zzso The zzso of DNA by image analysis was carried out on zzso imprints of fresh zzso and on zzso obtained after cell zzso The results obtained by both sets of calculations were compared with each other and with the zzso zzso 6 cases zzso showed zzso between the 3 zzso One case was zzso for both DNA image analysis zzso but the zzso data showed only a zzso stem zzso In 3 cases out of 15 zzso zzso DNA analysis and zzso results were zzso in 2 zzso the culture step failed to preserve zzso stem lines that were present in the imprint zzso In the third one, a minority zzso peak observed after culture was absent on the imprint zzso zzso between imprints and zzso data and zzso with zzso analysis was observed in 3 cases zzso These 3 cases were zzso or near zzso but the DNA analysis on the zzso after culture showed an zzso stem line in each zzso The last 2 cases showed a total disagreement between the 3 zzso By measuring the DNA content with an image zzso the observer can ensure that only zzso cells are taken into zzso The present study revealed that zzso data represent only about zzso of the population that is effectively present in the culture dish and that the cultured population represents only zzso of the population present on the fresh zzso zzso
