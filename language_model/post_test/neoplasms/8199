A significant zzso activity of the naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso has been reported against numerous cancer zzso Since tumors require zzso for growth and zzso we zzso that zzso reduces tumor growth by zzso zzso Because zzso depends on the interaction between zzso and tumor cells, we investigated the effect of zzso on zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation and induced the differentiation of zzso cells in zzso the growth of bovine zzso zzso cells zzso evaluated by zzso proliferation zzso was inhibited in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso a zzso zzso with zzso activity, was zzso superior in growth zzso than either zzso zzso inhibited human zzso vein zzso cell zzso tube formation (in zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso and disrupted zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced basic zzso growth factor zzso vessel formation zzso zzso zzso in zzso in zzso plug zzso Exposure of zzso a human zzso cell line, to zzso for 8 zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in the zzso levels of vascular zzso growth factor zzso as assessed by zzso zzso treatment of zzso cells for 24 h also significantly reduced the zzso protein levels in zzso zzso in a zzso manner zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso has an zzso effect on induced zzso
