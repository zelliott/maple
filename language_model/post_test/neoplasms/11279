We have developed a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso construct designated zzso zzso redirected zzso human peripheral T cells to induce the specific zzso of every zzso tumor cell line zzso zzso induced a zzso independent zzso zzso of zzso and zzso T cells as seen by de zzso expression of zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso 2, 4 and zzso zzso T cells made the major contribution to redirected tumor cell zzso by zzso With a zzso zzso cells could also contribute presumably as consequence of a dramatic zzso of zzso B zzso zzso was highly zzso in a zzso mouse model with zzso growing zzso human colon cancer zzso Five daily doses of 1 zzso zzso on days zzso completely prevented tumor outgrowth in all mice zzso The zzso zzso construct also led to a durable zzso of established tumors in all mice treated with 1 zzso doses of zzso on days 8-12 after tumor zzso Finally, zzso could eradicate zzso zzso zzso cancer tissue growing under the skin of zzso zzso zzso appears as an attractive zzso zzso candidate for treatment of human zzso zzso
