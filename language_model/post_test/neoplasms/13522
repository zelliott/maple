zzso are the terminal portions of zzso and consist of the repeated zzso sequence zzso zzso lose a small amount of zzso zzso acid zzso after each cell zzso A hypothetical function of zzso DNA is to allow for a finite number of cell divisions without loss of functional zzso A second proposed function of zzso DNA is to prevent zzso interactions between zzso ends and cellular repair zzso In cells that maintain a zzso capacity, such as stem cells and cancer cells, zzso length is maintained by the reverse zzso zzso Virtually every major human zzso has been evaluated for zzso activity and approximately zzso to zzso have demonstrated the presence of zzso In this article we review the current zzso available for zzso detection and discuss their relative strengths and zzso
