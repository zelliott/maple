A better knowledge of patient zzso dose and the associated radiation risk in pediatric zzso zzso is warranted in view of the extensive use of zzso and the higher zzso of zzso In the present study, zzso zzso were used as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso dose was assessed and radiation risks were estimated according to the zzso model, commonly used in radiation protection, and the zzso zzso zzso 

In 49 pediatric patients zzso age, zzso zzso with zzso heart disease who underwent cardiac zzso procedures, blood samples were taken before and shortly after the zzso zzso zzso were determined in peripheral blood T zzso In each patient, a net increase in zzso zzso representing DNA zzso breaks induced by zzso zzso was zzso In addition, a zzso zzso Carlo simulation of the procedure was performed, resulting in individual blood, organ, and tissue zzso zzso of zzso zzso versus blood dose indicated a zzso zzso Median effective doses calculated according to the International Commission on zzso Protection 60 and 103 publications are zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso risk of cancer mortality was calculated from the zzso model and the zzso zzso zzso This resulted in zzso risk values of zzso and zzso respectively, for the patient population under zzso 

zzso zzso as a zzso for DNA damage indicate that radiation risk estimates according to the zzso hypothesis are possibly zzso Great care should be taken to minimize and zzso patient radiation zzso
