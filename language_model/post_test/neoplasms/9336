The primary objectives of this phase I study were to define a tolerable dose and to describe the toxicity of zzso administered as a daily oral dose for 4 weeks followed by a zzso rest period zzso zzso in patients with solid tumors that were zzso to standard zzso The secondary objective was to document any zzso zzso 

Key eligibility criteria included a performance status of 0-2 and acceptable zzso zzso and zzso zzso The dose was escalated from 5 to 10 to 25 zzso Nine cycles (54 weeks) were planned unless the patient developed intolerable toxicity or experienced tumor zzso zzso toxicity was defined as zzso toxicity of grade 3 or higher and zzso toxicity of grade 4 or higher occurring in cycle zzso 

Overall, 20 patients were zzso One patient was ineligible due to a zzso event within the preceding 6 months, but this was not known at enrollment and this patient was included in the zzso Three, five, and 12 patients were treated with 5, 10, and 25 zzso zzso One patient on 25 zzso developed grade 3 motor zzso in cycle 1, and this was the only zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso toxicity was zzso The zzso zzso were otherwise mild to moderate over multiple cycles of zzso One patient had a partial response, and three patients had stable zzso three of these patients had zzso cell lung zzso 

The recommended dose of zzso for further studies in patients with solid tumors is 25 zzso for 4 weeks followed by a zzso rest zzso
