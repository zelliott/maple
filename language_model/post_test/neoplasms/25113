The 90 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family is a group of highly zzso zzso zzso that promote cell zzso growth, zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression or activity has been associated with several human diseases, including zzso zzso lies downstream of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and is directly zzso by the zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso zzso advances in the field of zzso zzso have occurred in the past few years, zzso novel zzso cellular zzso and biological functions as well as new zzso regulatory zzso Together, these findings suggest that zzso may be a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of cancer, particularly those characterized by zzso zzso in components of the Ras zzso zzso This article briefly describes our current knowledge on the impact of zzso on cell growth and zzso as well as zzso mechanisms associated with zzso The potential of targeting zzso in cancer is discussed in light of available data on the biological functions of each zzso family zzso zzso zzso with small zzso zzso appears to be a promising path for cancer therapy, but several considerations need to be evaluated and will be discussed in zzso
