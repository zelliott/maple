The zzso zzso zzso is zzso in various human zzso however, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso tumor progression remain zzso Here we show that zzso of zzso zzso is tightly associated with tumor progression via zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and human cancer cells that zzso zzso zzso is substantially zzso and the zzso expression of zzso suppresses tumor zzso We identified the zzso zzso zzso as a zzso target of zzso zzso zzso promotes cell zzso and invasion by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso pathway, and can also contribute to tumor growth via the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression is zzso by the zzso of zzso signaling zzso including zzso growth factor zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso In human colon cancer zzso zzso of zzso is significantly correlated with the zzso of zzso and zzso Our results suggest that the novel zzso circuit plays a crucial role in controlling tumor zzso
