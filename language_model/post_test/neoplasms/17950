It is hypothesized that the many human cell types corresponding to multiple states is supported by an underlying zzso zzso system zzso of zzso regulatory network zzso zzso This hypothesis is validated for zzso cells whose zzso is found to support an extremely complex array of states that we term a zzso zzso for which we introduce a quantitative measure of zzso The zzso used is constructed and analyzed by zzso a database of zzso information, zzso zzso data zzso zzso zzso a zzso kinetic model, and zzso analysis zzso zzso of this zzso approach suggest that a cell can be induced to persist in one state or to transition between distinct zzso apparently irreversible transitions can be reversed when the high zzso space of zzso and zzso parameters is zzso As conditions change, certain cellular states zzso zzso are no longer supported, new ones emerge, and transitions zzso differentiation or zzso zzso The zzso of simulated point zzso zzso changes which individually are zzso lead to occasional dramatic zzso The zzso scope of many of these transitions is shown to arise from the zzso zzso zzso These notions imply that studying individual zzso may not be sufficient to understand zzso rather, zzso zzso of strongly coupled genes supporting multiple cell zzso should be zzso Our approach reveals several zzso zzso each involving zzso and zzso and supporting zzso
