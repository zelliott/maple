Current investigation of cancer progression towards increasing zzso focuses on the molecular pathways that produce the various zzso traits of zzso Their acquisition is explained by the zzso zzso zzso tumor progression is the result of a zzso evolution in the zzso zzso cells are the units of zzso Random genetic zzso permanently affecting these pathways create zzso cell zzso that are selected for in the disturbed zzso However, could it be that the capacity of the zzso and its gene regulatory network to generate the vast diversity of cell types during development, zzso to produce zzso zzso changes without zzso is harnessed by zzso to propel a directional change towards zzso Here we take an encompassing perspective, zzso the zzso of molecular zzso and review mechanisms of zzso evolution beyond the zzso zzso We discuss the central concept of zzso zzso - the hidden stable states of gene regulatory networks normally not occupied by zzso zzso transitions into such zzso provide a source for randomness zzso and regulatory constraints zzso in the acquisition of novel expression profiles that can be inherited across cell zzso and zzso can be selected zzso But zzso can also be reached in response to environmental signals - thus offering the possibility for inheriting acquired traits that can also be selected zzso zzso we face the possibility of zzso zzso zzso to both zzso and zzso evolution which may jointly explain the zzso of change pointing toward increasing zzso
