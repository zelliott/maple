The three closely related human Ras zzso zzso zzso and zzso are all widely zzso engage a common set of downstream zzso and can each exhibit zzso zzso However, the vast majority of zzso Ras zzso in human tumors involve zzso Moreover, zzso zzso are most frequently seen in tumors of zzso derived zzso zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that activated zzso may affect an zzso zzso to initiate zzso Using a culture model of zzso acid zzso stem cell differentiation to zzso we determined that while activated zzso promotes differentiation and growth arrest in these zzso zzso zzso promotes their zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso fail to differentiate upon zzso treatment and continue to zzso and maintain stem cell zzso zzso neither promotes nor prevents zzso A zzso analysis demonstrated that these distinct effects of the Ras zzso involve their variable zzso zzso implicating zzso zzso and revealed a requirement for several established Ras zzso These findings indicate that activated Ras zzso exert profoundly different effects on zzso zzso and that zzso zzso may initiate zzso by expanding a susceptible zzso cell zzso These results potentially explain the high frequency of zzso zzso in tumors of zzso zzso
