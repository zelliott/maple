zzso are molecular indicators of a biological status, and as zzso species can be zzso to evaluate the presence of cancer and therapeutic zzso Through a variety of mechanisms cancer cells provide the zzso material for their own zzso zzso may be zzso in the blood, other body zzso or zzso The expectation is that the level of an zzso zzso is related to the specific type of disease present in the zzso zzso have potential both as diagnostic indicators and monitors of the effectiveness of clinical zzso zzso are also able to zzso cancer patients to the most appropriate zzso zzso zzso for the early detection of cancer should provide a patient with a better outcome which in turn will translate into more efficient delivery of zzso Technologies for the early detection of cancer have resulted in reductions in zzso zzso from zzso that are otherwise deadly if allowed to zzso Such screening technologies have proven that early detection will decrease the morbidity and mortality from zzso An emerging theme in zzso research is the expectation that panels of zzso zzso rather than single markers will be needed to have sufficient sensitivity and specificity for the zzso detection of zzso zzso may provide zzso information of disease enabling interventions using targeted therapeutic agents as well as zzso in cancer zzso Novel zzso zzso and zzso technologies are being used to discover and validate tumor zzso individually and in zzso
