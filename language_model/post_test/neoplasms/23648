Properties of procedures for zzso zzso of the maximum tolerable dose zzso in a Phase I clinical trial are zzso using a zzso zzso sampling scheme zzso zzso as a paradigm for zzso Although the likelihood function for the data arising from such a scheme is identical to one arising under a conditional zzso sampling zzso intervals based on the exact distribution of the usual zzso statistics under this assumption do not offer improvement over zzso zzso However, consideration of the distribution of these statistics based on the true zzso sampling scheme can lead to the construction of intervals with correct coverage probabilities that do not depend on the true values of the model zzso Membership in the confidence set can be evaluated by zzso Carlo simulation at a restricted maximum likelihood estimate of the nuisance slope zzso despite upward bias in its zzso from the up-and-down sampling zzso The lack of information in the zzso setting is reflected in a large proportion of confidence intervals that include infinite values for the zzso especially when the zzso curve is zzso zzso based on a likelihood ratio criterion perform best in this zzso
