The usefulness of the zzso artery zzso as zzso zzso in coronary artery bypass zzso zzso has been studied zzso We report our experience performing abdominal surgery after zzso using zzso zzso 

The subjects were eight patients who underwent abdominal surgery after zzso with an in zzso zzso zzso The surgical indications were zzso tumors in five patients, an zzso abdominal zzso aneurysm in two patients and a zzso zzso in one zzso The zzso from the zzso to the abdominal surgery ranged from 3 to 19 zzso 

Operations included zzso zzso in two cases, total zzso in one case, local zzso of the stomach in one case, and zzso of the zzso colon in one zzso zzso artery bypass was performed in two cases, and the zzso zzso was reconstructed using standard zzso When the zzso method has been used to harvest the zzso zzso zzso were easily identified during a zzso and the abdominal procedure was performed using routine zzso One patient died of cancer, and the other patients are alive 1 year 2 months to 4 years 5 months after zzso No patient reported recurrence of zzso 

The risk of abdominal zzso should be considered when using the in zzso right zzso for zzso We recommend the zzso method for zzso harvest to decrease the difficulty during second abdominal zzso
