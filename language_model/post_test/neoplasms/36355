zzso zzso in zzso zzso are associated with numerous zzso A large number of single zzso zzso zzso in the zzso gene have been reported to associate with cancer zzso However, the results are zzso The aim of this Human Genome zzso zzso review and zzso was to zzso the evidence for zzso 

Studies focusing on the relationship between zzso gene zzso and zzso to cancer were selected from the zzso Cochrane library, zzso Web of Science, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Data were extracted by two independent zzso and the zzso was performed with Review Manager zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso with zzso confidence intervals zzso were zzso 

According to the inclusion criteria, zzso studies with a total of zzso cancer cases and zzso healthy controls, were included in the zzso The results showed that there was a positive association between zzso zzso of zzso and cancer risk zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, we found that zzso zzso of zzso might be a protective factor for cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, the G zzso and G carrier zzso + zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso had negative associations with cancer risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

This zzso suggests that zzso gene zzso are involved in the zzso of various zzso The zzso zzso of zzso in zzso gene might increase the risk while the zzso zzso of zzso G zzso and G carrier zzso + zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso might be protective zzso
