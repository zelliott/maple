zzso targeting zzso has been considered as an important strategy for cancer zzso zzso is known to possess zzso and zzso activity, but its roles in tumor zzso the key step involved in tumor growth and zzso and the involved molecular mechanism is still zzso zzso we examined its zzso effects and mechanisms in zzso and in zzso 

We used zzso and analyzed its zzso effects on human zzso vein zzso cells zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor in zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited a series of zzso zzso processes including zzso migration, and tube formation of zzso zzso Besides, it directly inhibited zzso zzso zzso activity and its downstream signaling pathways including zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso we demonstrated that zzso inhibited zzso inflammatory responses including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and NO zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso in sponge implant zzso zzso and also inhibited tumor zzso and tumor growth in zzso zzso zzso simulation indicated that zzso could form hydrogen bonds and aromatic interactions within the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso exerts zzso effects via zzso signaling zzso thus, may be a viable drug candidate in zzso and zzso zzso
