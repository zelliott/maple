zzso DNA damage gives rise to zzso and skin zzso We have previously reported that treatment of skin cells in zzso with zzso zzso zzso activates zzso and increases the ability of cells to repair subsequent zzso DNA damage by enhancing zzso DNA repair zzso Here we show that topical zzso zzso enhances the rate of DNA zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso and reduces zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso partially zzso mice, both transgenic for the zzso zzso zzso These data support the existence of zzso zzso DNA damage responses that increase DNA repair capacity after DNA damage and hence reduce the impact of future zzso to environmental zzso The ability of zzso applied zzso to induce protective zzso responses that normally result from DNA damage suggests a previously zzso means of reducing skin cancer in high-risk zzso
