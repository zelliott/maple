Several findings suggest that the patient's hormonal context plays a crucial role in determining cancer zzso The exact nature of zzso hormone action on zzso growth has not been established yet, in fact contrasting data show zzso hormones have a zzso or an zzso action on cancer cell proliferation depending on the zzso We hypothesized that not only tissue zzso but also specific zzso occurring during zzso development in different zzso hormone cellular targets are responsible for this dual zzso To test our hypothesis we zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso hormone effects on the proliferation of six cancer cell lines originating from the same tissue or organ but carrying different zzso (in zzso 3 zzso or zzso zzso The data obtained in this study show how zzso that affect the balance between degradation and stabilization of zzso assume a remarkable importance in determining the zzso zzso hormone effect on cell zzso
