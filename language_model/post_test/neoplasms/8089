Since every cell of a zzso zzso contains the same zzso it is intriguing to understand why genetically zzso cells are different from each other and what controls zzso Several observations indicate that DNA zzso has an essential regulatory function in zzso development, which is to establish the correct pattern of gene zzso and that DNA zzso pattern is tightly correlated with zzso zzso Various zzso processes are controlled by specific DNA zzso patterns including zzso zzso zzso of the X zzso regulation of zzso gene expression and repression of zzso Moreover, zzso zzso could zzso a selective advantage to cells, leading to zzso zzso In this review we focus on the zzso molecular mechanisms during normal development and discuss how DNA zzso could affect the expression of genes leading to cancer zzso
