In zzso cells, there are two zzso of DNA zzso II, designated alpha zzso zzso and beta zzso zzso Previous studies using cell lines have shown that the zzso zzso and beta zzso are zzso regulated during the cell cycle and in response to changes in growth zzso Moreover, both zzso can act as targets for a range of zzso zzso Here, we have zzso the normal tissue distribution in humans of zzso zzso and beta using zzso zzso In addition, we have studied expression of these zzso in 69 primary zzso zzso representative either of zzso that are responsive to zzso zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso and zzso or of those that show de zzso drug resistance zzso zzso zzso was expressed exclusively in the zzso compartments of all normal zzso and was zzso in both the cell nucleus and zzso In biologically aggressive or rapidly zzso zzso zzso high-grade zzso and zzso there was a high level of zzso zzso although expression was still zzso in colon zzso indicating that expression of this zzso is not sufficient to explain the intrinsic drug resistance of colon zzso zzso zzso was expressed zzso in zzso and was localized in both the zzso and the zzso This zzso was present in zzso cell zzso but was expressed at a generally higher level in all zzso and zzso cells than in normal zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso is a strict proliferation marker in normal and zzso cells in zzso but that zzso zzso has a much more general cell and tissue distribution than has zzso zzso The apparent zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells has implications for the response of patients to zzso therapies that include zzso zzso zzso
