To investigate how zzso bone zzso zzso biopsy examinations could help in the diagnosis of clinically unknown zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso biopsy sections were zzso zzso In the analysis we focused on the following aspects: zzso the frequency of zzso involvement arising from clinically unknown zzso zzso zzso the clinical indication for zzso biopsy examination in cases with tumor zzso zzso zzso the primary sites of the zzso tumors, and zzso the advantage of zzso biopsy sections over zzso samples and the zzso of biopsy with aspiration zzso 

Of the zzso zzso samples zzso 101 zzso were interpreted as being zzso tumor zzso In cases with zzso tumors, the zzso changes, such as skeletal pain zzso and bone destruction zzso were considerably higher than in those without zzso zzso and zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso were documented zzso in 50 of the 101 zzso cases zzso the most frequent being in the zzso gastric zzso and zzso Using this zzso a higher zzso of zzso tumors was detected when compared with previously reported zzso zzso The frequency of zzso tumors based on aspiration zzso when the positive results for biopsy sections were used as a reference was zzso All the 101 sections with zzso tumors showed various degrees of zzso 

We concluded that the routine zzso biopsy examination is helpful in detecting insidious zzso zzso zzso zzso pain and bone destruction are critical indications for susceptible patients to undergo zzso zzso Plastic embedding of biopsy sections appears to be more sensitive than the zzso embedding of samples and is an excellent zzso to isolated aspiration zzso
