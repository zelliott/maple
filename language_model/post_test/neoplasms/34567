In this paper we summarized the current knowledge about the new mechanism of zzso in cancer zzso the lately discovered zzso zzso cells zzso zzso are produced in bone zzso under the influence of tumor cell derived zzso zzso show negative effect on T zzso function through zzso depletion and zzso oxide zzso In mice zzso are characterized by zzso and zzso zzso however in human there are no definitive markers of this zzso Some laboratory experiments in turning back the negative influence of zzso on zzso system are zzso mainly through the administration of zzso zzso against zzso or drugs which block their zzso The zzso of zzso characteristics can allow us to build new zzso protocols in the zzso
