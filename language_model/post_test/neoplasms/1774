zzso also known as zzso or zzso is an important zzso in embryonic differentiation and has recently been identified to be strongly zzso by zzso Its distribution in normal human zzso and most zzso types is zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso to a zzso acid zzso from zzso has been zzso Using this zzso zzso was shown to be widely expressed in most normal human zzso but usually only in a proportion of cells and typically with a nuclear zzso In zzso expression was either zzso (the zzso zzso or occasionally zzso Similarly, in most normal zzso low or absent expression was observed in zzso cells, whereas in many zzso samples zzso was usually strongly zzso In zzso there was a striking pattern of zzso seen in connection with areas of zzso with absence of zzso expression within a zone of zzso viable cells immediately adjacent to the zzso zzso This suggests that while zzso may be zzso by zzso in cancer, in more extreme zzso it may have a role in cell zzso Its zzso with other zzso regulated zzso such as the zzso factors or zzso zzso IX, and differentiation of zzso now requires further zzso
