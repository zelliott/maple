Consideration of the human epidemiology of diseases arising from exposure to naturally occurring and man-made mineral fibers encompasses the several forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso other naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and man-made mineral fibers zzso continuous filament, zzso insulation zzso ceramic and other zzso zzso and glass zzso The diseases arising from zzso to some of these fibers include zzso zzso zzso diffuse zzso zzso and zzso pulmonary fibrosis, lung zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso and other zzso zzso factors important in assessing these diseases include assessment of zzso duration of exposure, cumulative exposure, fiber origin and characteristics zzso and zzso other possible zzso occupational or environmental zzso and zzso zzso issues commonly presenting problems in evaluation of these data include assessment of the zzso of environmental zzso particularly in regard to fiber zzso distribution, and concentration over the duration of exposure, and the zzso of study design to detect health effects zzso frequency, zzso and cohort zzso Research priorities include further assessment and zzso of zzso zzso relative to fiber exposure, uniform zzso zzso further zzso assessment of certain zzso and man-made mineral fiber zzso with emphasis given to assessment of zzso and small diameter glass and ceramic zzso Further assessment of possible health risks of the general public should await improved definition of relevant fiber exposure in ambient zzso
