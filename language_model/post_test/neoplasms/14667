zzso is a trace element required for the growth of normal and zzso zzso in a variety of zzso zzso zzso is associated with zzso in the activity of zzso zzso essential for cell zzso zzso zinc zzso also increases the zzso of certain tumors while decreasing the zzso of zzso The mechanism by which zinc zzso alters zzso is not fully zzso Among those tumors whose zzso is increased by dietary zinc zzso are zzso induced by zzso This class of zzso requires zzso zzso zzso zzso to be zzso zzso zzso is known to increase the zzso zzso metabolism of zzso zzso an zzso zzso of this zzso zzso of the zzso of this reaction reveals zinc to be a direct zzso inhibitor of the zzso metabolism of zzso Thus the lower rate of zzso metabolism by zzso versus zzso zzso may be due to normal tissue zinc acting as a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso activity in zzso This effect of zinc on zzso metabolism may explain the increased zzso of zzso zzso observed with dietary zinc zzso
