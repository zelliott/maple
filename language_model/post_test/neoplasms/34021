zzso zzso targeting is a novel approach for the design and administration of therapeutic agents wherein the agent is rationally designed to zzso and restrict zzso expression to the site of disease in a zzso manner, usually via exploitation of unique zzso and genetic properties specific to the diseased zzso The zzso of zzso native Ad zzso coupled with active targeting zzso has demonstrated that innate gene delivery efficiency may be retained while zzso Ad dependence on its primary cellular zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso to achieve zzso zzso zzso zzso we describe advances in Ad targeting that are predicated not only on fundamental understanding of zzso zzso but also on the specific zzso profiles of target zzso Further, targeting is discussed in the context of improving the safety and efficacy of clinical approaches utilizing zzso zzso and replication competent zzso zzso In zzso existing results suggest a critical linkage between targeted agents and increases in therapeutic zzso
