zzso zzso is a ubiquitous environmental contaminant that is produced inadvertently during the synthesis of some zzso compounds, such as the zzso zzso zzso It is biologically and ecologically persistent, with an estimated zzso of 7 years in zzso It possesses high acute toxicity in zzso and is a zzso zzso and zzso In chronic zzso for zzso zzso at a dose of 10 zzso increases the zzso of liver tumors in female rats, making it one of the most potent animal zzso ever zzso A recent study in humans has shown an increase in the zzso of respiratory tract tumors in workers in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso controversy and uncertainty remain, however, concerning its zzso potency in humans and the reliability of using animal data to predict human zzso It is generally accepted that most, if not all, of the effects of zzso require its binding to the zzso zzso In addition to its toxic effects, zzso produces a number of zzso effects, such as induction of zzso zzso of binding activity of the zzso and zzso growth factor zzso zzso and changes in zzso zzso These effects suggest that the zzso zzso plays an important role in regulating the cell zzso A number of structural zzso of zzso such as the zzso zzso also interact with the zzso zzso and they produce the same spectrum of responses as zzso in animal and cell zzso The potency of these compounds is strongly correlated with their binding affinity to the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
