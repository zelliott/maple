Because zzso is a zzso zzso drug, its degree of zzso likely relies on duration of cell exposure to a specific zzso We investigated the maximum tolerated duration of oral zzso treatment at doses of 100, 75, and 50 zzso in previously treated patients with zzso advanced zzso zzso zzso was defined as tumor progression or zzso toxicity (World Health Organization zzso grade zzso or zzso zzso The maximum tolerated duration in 19 patients given 100 zzso was zzso or zzso 21 days, since this was the predetermined zzso zzso 3 patients discontinued zzso because of early tumor zzso and 6 others had developed zzso or zzso zzso grade zzso 2) by day zzso The maximum tolerated duration in 13 patients given 75 zzso was a median of 11 weeks zzso 2 to zzso 6 patients developed tumor progression and 6 others zzso zzso grade zzso or zzso 2) requiring zzso of zzso Ten patients given 50 zzso tolerated therapy for a median of 13 weeks zzso 3 to 26 zzso treatment was halted in seven patients because of tumor zzso two because of zzso zzso grade zzso or zzso zzso and one because of zzso The data from this study and others suggest that above a certain minimal plasma level, zzso zzso zzso cumulative zzso What remains to be determined is the minimal plasma level per tumor zzso It will also be interesting to see whether zzso zzso and zzso have differential sensitivity to zzso since zzso did not occur using daily zzso doses of 50 and 75 zzso whereas at the same doses 10 of 23 patients required zzso zzso
