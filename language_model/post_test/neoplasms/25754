Over the past 10 years or so, a considerable literature has focused on the circulatory and migratory properties of zzso with regard to the immune zzso It has become zzso however, that molecular events that regulate zzso interactions link the immune response to a number of zzso mechanisms, and it is now abundantly clear that a relatively small number of zzso receptors govern broad cellular zzso In particular, some families of molecules have been described which, although different in structure from each other, control in concert the zzso of a cell to another cellular or zzso zzso and thus promote communication between zzso signals and the zzso zzso The present review outlines some aspects of the recent explosion in scientific knowledge in this zzso zzso attention is zzso on the zzso receptors that zzso interactions between circulating blood cells and the vascular zzso zzso these zzso zzso have been grouped into families, based on zzso zzso and molecular zzso Their discovery is challenging the commonly accepted view of medical practice, and their identification and zzso are leading to significant advances in the diagnosis and therapy of a wide spectrum of human zzso In the current zzso fundamental structural and functional relationships are zzso and prospects for future developments, especially with regard to laboratory diagnosis and patient management, are zzso There can be little doubt that further advances in this field will have a major impact on biomedical and clinical zzso
