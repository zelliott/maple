An important milestone in medical science is the recent completion of a zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso The identification of all human genes and their regulatory regions provides the framework to zzso our understanding of the molecular basis of zzso This advance has also formed the foundation for a broad range of zzso tools that can be applied to medical zzso These developments in global gene and gene product analysis as well as targeted molecular genetic testing are destined to change the practice of modern zzso Despite these exciting advances, many practicing clinicians perceive that the role of molecular zzso especially that of zzso is confined primarily to the research arena with little current clinical zzso The aim of this article is to highlight advances in zzso methods of zzso zzso disease diagnosis and zzso and prediction of treatment outcome in regard to both drug toxicity and response as they apply to various areas of clinical zzso
