Cancer survival is a key measure of the effectiveness of health-care zzso zzso largest cooperative study of zzso cancer survival in zzso shown persistent differences between countries for cancer survival, although in general, cancer survival is zzso Major changes in cancer diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation occurred in the early zzso zzso zzso their effect on cancer survival in 29 European zzso 

In this retrospective zzso study, we zzso data from 107 cancer zzso for more than 10 million patients with cancer diagnosed up to 2007 and followed up to zzso Uniform quality control procedures were applied to all zzso For patients diagnosed zzso we calculated zzso relative survival for 46 zzso weighted by age and zzso We also calculated zzso and zzso survival for ten common zzso together with survival differences between time periods (for zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso relative survival generally increased steadily over time for all European zzso The largest increases from zzso to zzso were for prostate cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso zzso vs zzso zzso Survival in eastern Europe was generally low and below the European mean, particularly for zzso with good or intermediate zzso Survival was highest for zzso central, and southern zzso Survival in the UK and Ireland was intermediate for zzso cancer, breast cancer, prostate cancer, skin melanoma, and zzso lymphoma, but low for zzso stomach, zzso zzso and lung zzso Survival for lung cancer in the UK and Ireland was much lower than for other regions for all zzso although results for lung cancer in some regions zzso and eastern Europe) might be affected by zzso Survival usually decreased with age, although to different degrees depending on region and cancer zzso 

The major advances in cancer management that occurred up to 2007 seem to have resulted in improved survival in zzso zzso explanations of differences in survival between countries include: differences in stage at diagnosis and accessibility to good care, different diagnostic intensity and screening approaches, and differences in cancer zzso Variations in zzso lifestyle, and general health between populations might also have a zzso Further studies are needed to fully interpret these findings and how to remedy zzso
