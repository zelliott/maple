Most zinc zzso are zzso in tumor cells and play a critical role in the zzso development, and zzso of zzso Novel zinc binding groups zzso represent a novel strategy to obtain optimal potency and selectivity for zinc zzso zzso Here we described the design, zzso and biological studies of novel zzso derivatives as zzso N zzso zzso The results demonstrated that some compounds exhibited moderate to good zzso activities against zzso with compound zzso being the most zzso suggesting that zzso could serve as new lead for the future zzso inhibitor zzso The results further confirm our design rationale of zzso zzso as a new zzso which may provide a new direction for the design and discovery of zinc zzso zzso as new zzso zzso
