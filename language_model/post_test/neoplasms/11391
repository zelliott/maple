zzso which has been suggested to be involved in cell migration, was identified as a zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso Treatment of cultured cells with zzso zzso or small interfering zzso zzso for zzso and zzso inhibited their zzso The zzso activity of zzso was required for the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso was localized to focal zzso and the zzso for zzso or zzso delayed the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso of focal zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso were suppressed in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suppressed the zzso of zzso and the zzso of zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso was highly expressed in zzso and pancreatic zzso and the zzso of the zzso expression was correlated with tumor zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso regulate the zzso of focal zzso to promote cell migration and that zzso is useful as a marker for tumor zzso
