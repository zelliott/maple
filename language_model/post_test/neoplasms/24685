zzso zzso repair zzso acts on a variety of DNA zzso including damage induced by many zzso zzso Cancer therapy with such drugs might be improved by reducing the zzso capacity of zzso It is not known, however to what extent any individual zzso protein is zzso for any step of the repair zzso We studied sensitivity to zzso radiation and repair of DNA damage with regard to zzso one of the core factors in the zzso incision zzso About zzso molecules of zzso protein are present in zzso zzso human cell lines, and no zzso protein in the zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso cell lines expressing 50,000 or more zzso zzso showed zzso resistance similar to normal zzso zzso of zzso protein to approximately 10,000 zzso in a zzso system modestly but significantly increased sensitivity to zzso zzso No removal of zzso zzso zzso was detected in the zzso immortalized cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells expressing 150,000 molecules of zzso removed zzso zzso from the zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso in which zzso protein was reduced to about 10,000 zzso removed zzso zzso more slowly, with a zzso of zzso A reduced rate of repair of zzso zzso thus results in increased cellular sensitivity towards zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso levels must be reduced to zzso of that present in a normal cell to render zzso a limiting factor for zzso and zzso cellular zzso To inhibit zzso it may be more effective to interfere with zzso protein function, rather than reducing zzso protein zzso
