The term gene amplification refers to the selective increase of the gene copy number and is better designated as DNA zzso It should not be confused with elevated gene zzso although amplification generally does result in enhanced levels of the products zzso by the amplified zzso zzso is one of the mechanisms by which cells can meet the demand for synthesis of specific gene products in amounts exceeding the zzso capacity of a single copy zzso zzso studies of human and animal tumor cells have provided evidence for mysterious zzso abnormalities including double minutes zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso regions zzso diagnostic for amplified zzso zzso has been the first zzso found amplified in direct preparations of solid tumors, the group of zzso undergoing amplification has considerably expanded zzso Today amplification of zzso is recognized as a major player in the development of many solid tumors in humans and at the same time is a reflection of the genetic instability of solid tumor zzso
