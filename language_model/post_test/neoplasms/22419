With recent advances in the design and delivery of zzso zzso there has been a growing interest on the use of peptides in vaccine zzso Moreover, functional dissection and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso of proteins from zzso zzso zzso and zzso targeted by zzso responses, have broadened the range of target zzso and given clues to enhancing zzso zzso zzso with these zzso peptides can be zzso with defined chemical modifications to mimic natural zzso and/or deliberately introduce zzso resistant zzso bonds to regulate their processing independent of tissue specific zzso and to stabilize these compounds in zzso We discuss the potential of zzso vaccines for the treatment of chronic viral diseases and cancer and review recent developments in the field of zzso discovery and zzso zzso
