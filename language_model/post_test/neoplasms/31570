zzso zzso zzso have been recognized as key regulators of cell cycle zzso zzso and deregulation of zzso activity are zzso hallmarks of zzso zzso zzso or zzso would be of interest to explore as novel therapeutic agents in cancer, as well as other zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that emerged from an empirical screening program as a potent zzso agent that zzso studies demonstrated to directly inhibit zzso 1, 2, and 4 as a competitive zzso site zzso zzso clinical trials have shown that zzso that inhibit cell proliferation and zzso activity in zzso can be safely achieved in humans, and additional clinical trials will establish its clinical zzso To address the need for additional zzso that may serve as lead structures for drugs that would not have the zzso associated with zzso compounds with a similar pattern of cell growth zzso activity in the National Cancer Institute's in zzso zzso drug screen have been recognized by the zzso pattern recognition zzso zzso and then screened for zzso activity in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was revealed by that approach as a moderately potent zzso zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso which in initial experiments shows evidence of causing cell cycle zzso in living zzso zzso zzso is, therefore, a candidate for further structural zzso guided in part by understanding of the zzso site in zzso This approach represents one way of combining empirical screening information with zzso design to derive novel candidate therapeutic agents directed against an important cellular zzso
