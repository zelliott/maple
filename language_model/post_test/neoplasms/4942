zzso viruses are generally designed to be cancer selective on the basis of a single genetic zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso virus expressing zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso zzso that is designed to destroy cancer cells through zzso cell zzso and stimulation of zzso zzso zzso has demonstrated a favorable safety profile and zzso tumor necrosis in a variety of solid cancer types in clinical zzso However, the zzso responsible for its zzso have not yet been well zzso We analyzed the replication of zzso in three model zzso primary normal and cancer cells, surgical zzso and zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso effects were highly zzso and broad spectrum activity was zzso zzso zzso was zzso replication was activated by zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso levels, and cancer cell resistance to zzso zzso zzso These findings confirm a large therapeutic index for zzso that is driven by common genetic abnormalities in human solid zzso This appears to be the first description of multiple selectivity mechanisms, both inherent and zzso for an zzso zzso These findings have implications for zzso viruses in general, and suggest that their cancer targeting is a complex and zzso zzso
