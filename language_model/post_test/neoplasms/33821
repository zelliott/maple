Cancer is a growing problem for human health zzso zzso breakthroughs have increased our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the process of zzso allowing us to develop more refined zzso treatments, expanding the repertoire of available zzso drugs, and increasing the efficiency of their delivery to zzso zzso Nevertheless, even with improved understanding of the complex origins of cancer cells, there is a dearth of efficient and above all specific zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 3 - zzso a gene product derived from the Chicken zzso zzso zzso represents a novel zzso zzso It appears to have innate zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, and hence may be of great utility in the zzso to achieve specific and efficient elimination of cancer cells, particularly in cases of drug resistance through zzso zzso of zzso function zzso This review will examine the unique aspects of zzso properties, and in particular, its ability to zzso specifically in the nucleus of transformed but not normal zzso The latter ability, importantly, appears to be zzso related to its zzso zzso zzso
