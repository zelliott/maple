This study assessed the daily exposure to zzso using comparable approach methods in order to predict the human health risks of zzso on the general adult population and zzso workers in zzso The health risk assessment of zzso involved four scenarios zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The risks were described in terms of the excess cancer risk and the zzso zzso for cancer, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The adult daily intake zzso of zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso in the environmental media and foods in zzso The average zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso fat, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The lifetime average daily doses zzso of zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were estimated to be zzso zzso day, zzso zzso day, and zzso zzso day, zzso Although the estimated risks of cancer and zzso zzso were not unusually high in any of the four scenarios, the zzso values for the zzso effects on infants were not sufficiently high to guarantee the safety against this zzso
