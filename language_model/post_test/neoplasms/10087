The underlying mechanism regulating the expression of the cancer stem zzso cell marker zzso in cancer cells remains largely zzso although knowledge of this mechanism would likely provide important biological information regarding cancer stem zzso Here, we found that the zzso of zzso signaling zzso zzso expression at both the zzso and protein levels in a zzso cancer cell zzso This effect was canceled by a zzso zzso and was not modified by conventional zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso a downstream zzso in the zzso signaling pathway, might regulate zzso zzso we therefore investigated the relation between zzso and zzso zzso zzso conditions zzso zzso alpha expression and zzso zzso zzso expression at both the zzso and protein zzso Similarly, the zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso consistent with the effects of hypoxic zzso Finally, the correlations between zzso and the expressions of zzso alpha and zzso beta were examined using clinical gastric cancer zzso A strong inverse correlation zzso zzso zzso was observed between zzso and zzso zzso but not between zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, these results indicate that zzso alpha zzso zzso expression and suggest that zzso signaling is involved in the expression of zzso in cancer zzso Our findings provide a novel insight into the regulatory mechanisms of zzso expression via zzso signaling and zzso alpha in cancer cells and might lead to insights into the involvement of the zzso signal and zzso zzso pathways in the maintenance of zzso in cancer stem zzso
