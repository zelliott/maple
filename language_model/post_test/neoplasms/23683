zzso estimates of cancer risk generally involve zzso zzso based on an exponential zzso model for zzso response zzso Frequently more than one data set is zzso If a careful analysis of the biological issues indicates that more than one of the available data sets could be used in the quantitative estimate of cancer risk, it is reasonable to think of combining the zzso Before combining data, however, it would be prudent to test whether the data sets are compatible with a common zzso zzso If they are not, it could be concluded that an underlying biological factor is zzso If they are statistically zzso the decision to combine data sets based on biological issues would be zzso A statistical test based on the generalized likelihood ratio method is proposed for evaluating the zzso of different data sets with a common zzso zzso This method of constructing a statistical test and the associated zzso theory is consistent with the approach used by zzso zzso zzso Howe, zzso zzso Crump, and zzso Van zzso zzso A Computer Program to zzso zzso Animal zzso Data to Low zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso the confidence limits that are used as a basis for quantitative zzso
