Our knowledge on zzso related to drugs remains zzso Among the different zzso approaches assessing this risk, analysis of reports to zzso zzso system is zzso 

To review zzso registered as adverse drug reactions zzso in the French zzso Database zzso

Cancer zzso in a zzso database, although usually considered as poorly zzso to the general population, appears to be useful in the surveillance of cancer risk associated to zzso It allows both confirmation of already known data and detection of new zzso Combination of present data with zzso studies and zzso with cancer zzso would allow better identification of these risk zzso
