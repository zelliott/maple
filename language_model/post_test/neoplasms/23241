Clinical imaging in zzso zzso zzso zzso is often performed using zzso estimates of zzso zzso or zzso imaging that provides a spatial map of regional zzso zzso However, dynamic zzso imaging can provide considerably more information about in zzso biology by zzso both the zzso and spatial pattern of zzso zzso In addition, several potential sources of error that occur in zzso imaging can be zzso This review focuses on the application of dynamic PET imaging to measuring regional cancer zzso features and especially in using dynamic PET imaging for quantitative therapeutic response monitoring for cancer clinical zzso Dynamic PET imaging output zzso particularly transport zzso and overall zzso rate, have provided imaging end points for clinical trials at zzso institutions for zzso However, dynamic imaging poses many challenges for zzso clinical trial zzso from zzso zzso to the zzso of a common zzso zzso zzso principles and methodology of PET dynamic imaging are first zzso followed by an examination of current approaches to dynamic PET image analysis with a specific case example of dynamic zzso imaging to illustrate the zzso
