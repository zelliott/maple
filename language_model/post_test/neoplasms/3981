The zzso growth factor zzso zzso is zzso in a significant percentage of zzso and contributes to the zzso zzso zzso is a directly acting inhibitor of human zzso zzso zzso with an zzso of 2 zzso and reduces zzso zzso in intact tumor cells with an zzso of 20 zzso This zzso is selective for zzso zzso zzso relative to other zzso zzso we have zzso both in zzso of isolated zzso and whole zzso At doses of 100 zzso zzso completely prevents zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso tumors growing as zzso in zzso mice and of the zzso zzso of the treated zzso zzso zzso the proliferation of zzso human colon tumor cells at zzso zzso in cell culture and blocks cell cycle progression at the zzso zzso This inhibitor produces a marked zzso of zzso protein in its zzso form and zzso of zzso in zzso cells, which may contribute to the cell cycle zzso zzso of the zzso also triggers zzso in these cells as determined by formation of DNA fragments and other zzso These results indicate that zzso has potential for the treatment of tumors that are dependent on the zzso zzso for proliferation or zzso
