zzso of this article is to examine the possibilities and the limits of MR imaging in zzso with special regard to the tissue characterization of zzso Basic information is given on the fundamental parameters of zzso and the concept of image contrast is discussed, with a comparison between the image in conventional zzso and in zzso zzso affecting MR parameters and influencing the image contrast are zzso they are classified as zzso or connected to the patient's conditions and to technical zzso and as intrinsic or inherent to biological zzso zzso factors are scheduled in three groups: a) tissue zzso zzso b) functions or zzso zzso c) pathological zzso One of the most important factors related with the first group is water zzso The possible influences of water content on the measurement of the zzso MR relaxation times are numerous and zzso As a first zzso relaxation times are directly related to water zzso nevertheless many experimental results show that this statement is not sufficient to explain the observed variations of relaxation times in different zzso and zzso Some other data are accounted for the presence of different relaxation times of water in the same sample, and for the zzso structure of the zzso In normal zzso and structures, further elements are explained on the basis of simple zzso zzso In tumors the increase of zzso and zzso observed in experimental evaluations performed on samples of zzso was largely confirmed in the zzso To an equal extent failure of specificity of the increase of relaxation times of tumors is well documented in experimental research and in clinical zzso In experimental research a strict comparison was made between the tumor and the tissue of zzso zzso of relaxation parameters appears related to the presence of larger zzso areas, to the diminution of average cell size, and to reduced amount of rough and smooth zzso zzso In clinical experiences good results are obtained in the zzso of the tumors zzso and zzso zzso aspects connected to the zzso structures, zzso and necrosis are well zzso New data are acquired in the study of early and late effects of radiation in patients submitted to zzso for various types of zzso
