zzso cells zzso are zzso old cells which are distributed throughout the human zzso and, on the whole, occupy roughly the volume of the zzso zzso have long been recognized as key cells of type I hypersensitivity zzso Several lines of evidence, however, indicate that they not only express critical zzso functions in classic zzso allergic disorders, but also play important roles in host zzso against zzso bacteria and perhaps even zzso Indeed, it is now clear that zzso can contribute to host zzso in the context of either acquired or innate immune responses through the release of a myriad of zzso and zzso molecules and the expression of a wide spectrum of surface receptors for zzso and zzso Moreover, there is growing evidence that zzso exert distinct zzso functions, playing a relevant role in tissue zzso zzso and zzso as well as in the processes of tissue zzso In this review, we provide a small insight into the biology of human zzso and their potential implications in clinical zzso
