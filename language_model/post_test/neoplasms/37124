To calculate the cancer zzso in the region surrounding zzso 

zzso zzso study based on cancer registry zzso 

Comprehensive Cancer Centre zzso The zzso 

Using noise levels expressed as zzso zzso of the air traffic around zzso zzso International zzso as well as zzso postal code areas, two study areas were zzso a central area and an adjacent zzso All cancer cases diagnosed in zzso in the study areas were selected from the zzso Amsterdam Cancer zzso zzso numbers of cancer cases were compared with expected numbers on the basis of national and regional cancer zzso zzso 

Cancer zzso zzso zzso in zzso in the zzso region was slightly higher than national zzso rates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and almost equal to regional zzso This was largely due to relatively high rates for breast zzso zzso zzso and prostate zzso zzso zzso cancer in the zzso region as well as in the total area covered by the Amsterdam Cancer zzso In addition, zzso zzso myeloma and zzso cancer were more zzso the zzso especially in zzso The zzso of cancer of the respiratory tract was not the same in the central area and the adjacent zzso As compared with national rates, it was increased in the central area zzso zzso zzso while it was decreased in the adjacent zone zzso zzso zzso The zzso of cancer of all sites zzso zzso zzso was also increased in the central area, largely due to smoking related zzso 

During zzso cancer zzso in the area surrounding zzso was a little higher than the national zzso rates and almost equal to the regional zzso We could not demonstrate an association between air traffic and increased cancer zzso It is most likely that the differences for certain types of cancer as well as those between the two study areas were due to differences in lifestyle, such as smoking zzso
