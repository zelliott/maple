To zzso evaluate zzso zzso in major zzso in a large series of zzso corrected partial body and whole body zzso scans, and to determine the frequency and intensity of zzso 

354 consecutive PET zzso and whole body zzso corrected scans of patients obtained for tumor staging were examined with respect to zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was graded using a zzso scale from 0 (no zzso to 4 zzso strong zzso comparable to brain zzso 

Joint activity of grade 1-2 was noted zzso while grade 3 was rare, occurring only in the knee and shoulder zzso and grade 4 was zzso The 43 patients with grade 3 zzso or with at least 4 zzso showing grade 2 zzso were zzso but all denied pain specifically referred to a zzso Joint zzso were seen in 50% of the zzso zzso in the zzso 50% in the zzso zzso in the knee and zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso of joint zzso correlated positively and significantly with patient age, ranging from r zzso zzso and p zzso zzso in the knee to r zzso zzso and p zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso in the zzso in whole body zzso scans are frequent and are very likely not related to zzso As there is a strong age zzso and zzso is known to accumulate in inflammatory zzso the findings are most likely a result of zzso inflammatory zzso proliferation or other chronic inflammatory processes occurring in aging zzso
