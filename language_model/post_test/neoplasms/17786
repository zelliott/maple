zzso cell lines are used as in zzso cancer models, but their ability to accurately reflect the zzso and zzso of the parental zzso remains questionable, given the prevalence of documented cell zzso zzso zzso We have addressed the issue of whether copy number zzso seen in zzso cell lines reflect those observed in studies of fresh tissue by carrying out a zzso of zzso comparative zzso zzso data that considers both copy number zzso zzso and the occurrence of cancer gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlation comparisons between the data sets of seven zzso matched tumor and cell line groups indicate that the trends in aberration zzso are highly correlated between tumors and cell line sets of matched cancer zzso relative to zzso zzso Despite their similarities, cell lines showed zzso higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and several recurring cell zzso zzso zzso These include the previously documented losses of zzso and zzso and gains of zzso as well as additional zzso cell zzso gains of zzso zzso and zzso and losses of zzso and zzso These results indicate that, on average, cell lines preserve in zzso the genetic aberrations that are unique to the parent zzso from which they were derived while acquiring additional zzso zzso These data may enable a more zzso understanding of individual cell lines as in zzso models of cancer biology and zzso
