The zzso vascular architecture in solid tumors is the key limiting factor known to zzso zzso and increase circulating zzso drugs, thus resulting in resistance to zzso and chemotherapy in tumor zzso Previous experiments have reported zzso oxygen carriers zzso that are effective to improve tumor zzso thereby serving as potential agents zzso to the hypoxic zzso zzso we draw the hypothesis that zzso combined with an zzso drug may increase oxygen zzso and zzso drug retention in solid tumors and in turn contribute to enhanced sensitivity of zzso and zzso This novel drug will bring a new breakthrough in the field of the development of zzso drugs and reveal the alternative clinical use of zzso in tumor zzso
