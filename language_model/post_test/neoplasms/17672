To improve the quality of digital nuclear medicine images, we have developed a new zzso of the Wiener restoration zzso The Wiener filter uses as its zzso criterion the zzso of the zzso error between the zzso image of the object and the filtered zzso In order to form this zzso the object and noise power zzso are zzso The noise power spectrum for the zzso zzso noise of nuclear medicine images is shown to have a constant average magnitude equal to the total count in the zzso The object power spectrum is taken to be the image power spectrum minus the total count, except in the noise dominated region of the image power spectrum where a zzso exponential is zzso zzso time is kept to a clinically acceptable time frame through use of an array zzso zzso noise suppression and detail enhancement are noted with use of this filter with clinical zzso
