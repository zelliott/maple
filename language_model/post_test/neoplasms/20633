The zzso growth factor zzso zzso plays a crucial role in growth, differentiation and zzso of normal as well as tumor zzso The zzso of zzso signals to the zzso via the zzso not only depends on zzso zzso but is also determined by the zzso density on the cell zzso zzso with regard to cancer diagnosis and therapeutic approaches targeting zzso it is important to know how the expression level of zzso is zzso We found that zzso activity declines with increasing numbers of CA zzso of a highly zzso CA repeat in the first zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso In zzso data from cultured cell lines support these findings, although other regulation mechanisms can compensate this zzso In addition, we showed that zzso zzso zzso at a site closely downstream of the simple sequence repeat zzso and that there are two separate major zzso start zzso Model calculations for the zzso DNA zzso revealed a high zzso in the zzso zzso region, especially if the CA stretch is zzso These data suggest that the zzso can act like a joint, bringing the promoter in proximity to a putative zzso protein bound downstream of the zzso The data indicate that this zzso may be a marker for cancer, linking genetic and zzso risk zzso Furthermore, in breast cancer, zzso tumors with short zzso showed an elevated zzso in contrast to zzso with longer zzso zzso with loss of zzso in zzso 1 of zzso revealed an increased zzso expression if the longer zzso was zzso Moreover, decreased zzso gene levels were significantly correlated with poor prognosis in breast zzso
