In reviewing abnormal growth, we may distinguish autonomous and zzso growth zzso The highest diversification is reached in the autonomous zzso zzso the zzso zzso which, if not treated, are characterized by extensive growth and zzso In their development these processes exhibit autonomy on one hand and zzso on the zzso zzso and related diseases are extremely zzso It is unacceptable to view them exclusively as genetic or zzso diseases, or merely as the tumor itself, including its progressive zzso as evidenced in zzso zzso All these characteristics appear in the different types of zzso zzso zzso genetic variations in the zzso cells from the normal cells of the parent zzso Included here are tumor progression and cloning of the zzso cells, zzso development of host metabolism and of tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso syndromes as well as zzso syndromes and zzso zzso zzso as observed in the zzso zzso derives from the cells of the primary zzso In contrast, multiple primary tumors originate from different host zzso whereas the syndromes themselves constitute a symptom complex developing in a zzso host and cannot be assigned to local or distant spread of zzso The only possible explanation for these apparently contrasting processes lies in the interaction of tumor and host zzso which seemingly varies in zzso hosts and in those cases where the tumor has been surgical zzso zzso and other compounds again show an increase with the usually ensuing secondary tumor spread, a course which provides the basis for most deaths from zzso
