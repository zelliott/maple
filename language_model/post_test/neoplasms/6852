As more people survive cancer, it is necessary to understand the long-term impact of zzso We investigated whether cancer survivors are at increased risk for hospitalization for zzso 

We linked data on all zzso persons living in Denmark on January 1, 1973, or born thereafter to the Danish Cancer zzso and identified zzso adults with a diagnosis of zzso zzso for hospitalization for depression in the Danish Psychiatric Central Register from 1973 through 2003 yielded zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso The relative risk zzso for depression among cancer survivors relative to the zzso population was estimated by zzso zzso analysis with adjustment for age and period and zzso by sex, site of cancer, and extent of zzso 

The risk for depression in the first year after a cancer diagnosis was increased, with zzso ranging from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in women with zzso cancer to zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in men with brain zzso zzso but still significant excess risks during subsequent years were observed for most specific zzso The risk remained increased throughout the study period for both men and women surviving zzso zzso for women surviving zzso zzso and for men surviving zzso and zzso zzso 

This study confirms an increased risk for depression in patients facing a disruptive event like zzso Early recognition and effective treatment are needed to prevent admission of cancer survivors for zzso
