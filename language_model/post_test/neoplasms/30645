The skyrocketing cost of medical care in the United States has resulted in multiple efforts in cost zzso The present work offers a rational computer-based cost accounting approach to determine the actual use of resources in providing a specific service in a radiation zzso zzso 

A zzso cost accounting system was developed by using recorded information on actual time and effort spent by individual staff members performing various radiation zzso procedures, and analyzing direct and indirect costs related to staffing zzso facilities and equipment, supplies, zzso zzso were classified as direct or indirect and fixed or zzso A relative value unit was generated to allocate specific cost factors to each zzso 

Different costs per procedure were identified according to zzso Whereas there was no significant difference in the treatment time between low-energy (4 and 6 zzso or zzso (18 zzso accelerators, there were significantly higher costs identified in the operation of a zzso linear zzso a reflection of initial equipment investment, quality assurance and zzso procedures, maintenance costs, service contract, and replacement zzso zzso of resources was related to the complexity of the procedures performed and whether the treatments were delivered to zzso or zzso In analyzing time motion for physicians and other staff, it was apparent that a greater effort must be made to train the staff to accurately record all times involved in a given zzso and it is strongly recommended that each institution perform its own time motion studies to more accurately determine operating zzso zzso percent of our zzso global costs were for labor, zzso for other operating expenses, zzso for space, and zzso for zzso zzso differences were noted in the cost allocation for professional or technical functions, as labor, space, and equipment costs are higher in the zzso External beam zzso procedures accounted for more than 50% of all technical and professional revenues, simulation for zzso to zzso and other zzso procedures for zzso to zzso of zzso Some discrepancies were identified between the actual cost and level of reimbursement of various zzso Details are described in the zzso 

It is imperative to develop an equitable reimbursement system for radiation zzso services, based on cost accounting and other measures that may enhance productivity and reduce the cost per procedure unit, while at the same time preserving the highest quality of service provided to zzso
