Acute kidney injury zzso is a common complication in critically ill patients with zzso The zzso criteria define three levels of zzso based on the percent increase in serum zzso zzso from zzso risk zzso or zzso zzso injury zzso or zzso zzso and failure zzso or zzso zzso or requiring zzso The utility of the zzso criteria in critically ill patients with cancer is not zzso 

To examine the zzso zzso and costs associated with zzso in critically ill patients with zzso 

We zzso analyzed all patients admitted to a zzso zzso over a zzso period with a baseline zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso estimates for survival by zzso category were zzso zzso zzso was used to determine the association of zzso on zzso zzso A zzso zzso model was used for economic zzso zzso were assessed by hospital charges from the provider's zzso 

For the risk, injury, and failure categories of zzso zzso rates were zzso zzso and zzso zzso survival estimates were zzso zzso and zzso and adjusted odds ratios for zzso mortality were zzso 3, and zzso respectively zzso zzso or zzso zzso compared to patients without zzso Hematologic zzso and zzso cell transplant were not associated with mortality in the adjusted zzso Hospital cost increased by zzso per zzso increase in zzso and by zzso for patients requiring zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso No adjustment by zzso zzso 

zzso is associated with higher mortality and costs in critically ill patients with zzso
