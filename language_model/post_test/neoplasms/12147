The translation machinery of a zzso cell produces errors in decoding zzso that may give rise to alternative reading frame zzso zzso We predicted these putative zzso translation products from the zzso of three zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso of the class I zzso zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of mice with zzso zzso zzso presenting cells zzso generated potent in zzso immune protection against tumors expressing respective zzso zzso zzso T cells from mice zzso with zzso derived protective zzso peptides specifically recognized zzso zzso tumor zzso The strategy described here has potential for designing highly efficient novel vaccines for zzso zzso of human zzso
