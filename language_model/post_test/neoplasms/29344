To determine the maximum tolerated dose zzso safety, zzso zzso zzso and preliminary zzso activity of zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor and the first human zzso zzso targeted zzso zzso to enter clinical zzso 

Patients with advanced solid zzso were treated with escalating doses of zzso zzso zzso weekly zzso or biweekly zzso Plasma samples were zzso for zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso and antidrug zzso 

Thirty-nine patients completed 105 cycles of zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso either zzso or zzso The most common zzso grade 1/2 zzso were fatigue, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Grade 3/4 zzso were zzso zzso zzso retinal artery, and vein zzso left zzso dysfunction, and zzso zzso zzso syndrome were dose limiting at zzso zzso The zzso was 2 zzso zzso or zzso zzso plasma zzso increased dose zzso Plasma zzso levels increased with dose and zzso at 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso developed without effects on zzso zzso levels, or zzso Minor decreases in tumor zzso occurred in 4 of 34 zzso patients and 24 patients had stable zzso 

zzso can be safely administered at 2 zzso zzso zzso or zzso and exhibits promising zzso activity in patients with advanced solid zzso The absence of severe zzso at the zzso demonstration of plasma drug zzso active in zzso models, and clinical zzso evidence of zzso zzso warrant further development of zzso and suggest strong potential for zzso targeted zzso
