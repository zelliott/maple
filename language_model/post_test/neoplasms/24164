zzso hormone therapy has both benefits and zzso including decreased risks of osteoporosis and cardiovascular disease and an increased risk of breast zzso 

We examined the relation between the use of zzso hormones and mortality among participants in the zzso Health zzso who were 30 to 55 years of age at base line in zzso Data were collected by zzso questionnaires beginning in 1976 and continuing through zzso We documented zzso deaths from 1976 to zzso Each participant who died was matched with 10 controls alive at the time of her zzso For each death, we defined the zzso hormone status according to the last zzso questionnaire before her death or before the diagnosis of the fatal zzso this reduced bias caused by the zzso of hormone use between the time of diagnosis of a potentially fatal disease and zzso 

After adjustment for zzso zzso current hormone users had a lower risk of death zzso risk, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso than subjects who had never taken zzso however, the apparent benefit decreased with long-term use zzso risk, zzso zzso to zzso after 10 or more zzso because of an increase in mortality from breast cancer among long-term hormone zzso Current hormone users with coronary risk factors zzso percent of the zzso had the largest reduction in mortality zzso risk, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso with substantially less benefit for those at low risk (13 percent of the zzso relative risk, zzso 95 percent confidence zzso zzso to zzso 

On average, mortality among women who use zzso hormones is lower than among zzso however, the survival benefit diminishes with longer duration of use and is lower for women at low risk for coronary zzso
