zzso zzso central zzso access devices zzso zzso allow better treatment of cancer patients, with safe administration of zzso agents, and are well accepted by the zzso The aim of the present paper is to analyze the complications of the different implant techniques on the basis of a personal experience of 92 central zzso access zzso 

A total of 92 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been implanted in 88 patients between August 1992 and June 1995 for cancer zzso Age ranged between 19 and 79 years zzso 52 zzso 56 were male and 32 zzso zzso have been implanted by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso technique, in 34 zzso by zzso zzso respectively on the zzso vein in 46 cases, the jugular vein in 7 cases, the zzso vein in 4 and the zzso vein in 1 zzso Four patients experienced a double zzso In 84 cases the implant was done under local zzso while in 8 required general zzso during operation for the primary zzso 

A total of 7 complications were experienced zzso zzso 4 zzso and 3 zzso No cases of zzso were zzso zzso occurred after 29, 45, 64, 401 days of zzso respectively, and culture demonstrated zzso zzso in 2 cases, and zzso coli and zzso zzso in 1 case zzso Mechanical complication zzso 2 cases of zzso zzso and 1 case of port zzso No complications were noticed in case of implant during surgery for primary cancer (8 zzso In 7 cases the procedure has been converted from zzso vein zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso vein due to zzso reasons zzso zzso Five zzso have been zzso for zzso 

On the basis of the personal experience we think that zzso are of easy zzso with few complications and of good acceptance from the zzso We prefer zzso zzso on zzso vein as implant technique because of avoidance of zzso or bleeding zzso zzso puncture of zzso vein is useful for zzso during major surgery, because less time zzso and in case of anatomical anomalies zzso the zzso zzso zzso vein zzso has been zzso exclusively for zzso reason in young people, to avoid the zzso in the upper zzso zzso Alternative implant techniques has been employed in special conditions, such as zzso position in the inferior zzso or early in our experience zzso jugular zzso A total of 7 complication have been reported zzso 4 zzso and 3 mechanical (2 zzso 1 zzso zzso were not related to implant technique, presenting on day 29, 45, 64 and 401 zzso all required the zzso of the zzso as a zzso Mechanical complications are related to surgical zzso all required zzso with 1 zzso and 2 zzso of the zzso In zzso positioning during surgery for primary cancer (8 zzso no morbidity has been zzso All but the 5 zzso zzso were functioning until patient's zzso maximum length reported is 42 zzso
