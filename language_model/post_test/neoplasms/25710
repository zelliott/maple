The zzso comprise a family of structurally zzso highly zzso zzso zzso originally isolated from calf zzso Recently, we have demonstrated the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in rat zzso transformed cell lines and in human zzso zzso zzso and cell zzso To verify whether zzso zzso is a general event in the process of zzso we have analyzed zzso zzso levels in human colon zzso germ cell tumors of different zzso types, breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso colon and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso gene was detected in all of the zzso zzso and cell lines compared to the respective normal zzso Moreover, the mouse model of skin zzso induced by the combined action of chemical zzso and zzso zzso was used to identify the stage of zzso gene zzso The expression was almost zzso in normal zzso its induction occurred even at the zzso stage, however a further increased expression was observed in the zzso derived cell zzso Finally, zzso analysis of some breast, colon and zzso zzso samples by using specific zzso zzso revealed the presence of the zzso protein in all of the zzso zzso but not in the respective normal zzso Therefore the zzso detection may be considered a potential tool for the diagnosis of several human zzso
