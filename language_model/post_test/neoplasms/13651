zzso plays a central role in a variety of zzso and zzso disease zzso Because the growth and zzso of zzso zzso require the presence of an adequate blood supply, zzso zzso of zzso zzso represents a promising target for zzso zzso A number of approaches to such zzso are therefore under active zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso are among the best characterized of the various key elements in benign and zzso zzso In 1997, clinical trials were initiated to evaluate an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso as therapy for patients with different types of solid tumors and zzso zzso zzso selection for these zzso agents requires translation from zzso models, as these agents are likely to require chronic dosing at an optimal biological dose, rather than a zzso tolerated zzso For example, zzso a novel zzso inhibitor of zzso administered at 145 zzso zzso twice weekly, is well tolerated and achieves the concentration levels required to inhibit zzso cell proliferation in zzso zzso Because the mechanism of action of zzso zzso is complementary to that of classic zzso chemotherapy, zzso models and subsequent clinical trials frequently explore combinations of these agents with zzso chemotherapy, hoping to achieve additive or synergistic zzso zzso It is hoped that the combination of zzso zzso with zzso zzso agents will significantly improve survival and quality of life for cancer zzso As a result of favorable results from Phase 1 and 2 studies, randomized, zzso clinical investigations of zzso zzso are zzso
