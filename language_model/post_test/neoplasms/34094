In this report, we review studies of human zzso regulatory T cells zzso Although lagging a few years behind the discovery of these cells in the zzso the equivalent population of zzso regulatory T cells has also been isolated from human peripheral blood, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In general, the characteristics of this T cell subset are zzso similar between mouse and zzso In the recent explosion of research reports on human zzso cells, although the majority of the characteristics ascribed to these cells appear to be consistent, contrasting results have been found primarily in regards to potential involvement of zzso and production of zzso One explanation for this zzso may reside in the fact that markedly different techniques are used to isolate human zzso zzso cells and thus may result in the comparison of zzso populations that differ in cellular composition and/or zzso zzso Another potential explanation for differences in human zzso function may rest on the extreme zzso of the culture conditions and zzso stimuli that have been used to test the functional properties of these cells in zzso The strength of the zzso signal provided to the culture greatly affects the functional outcome of the zzso and can result in the difference between suppression and full zzso Surprisingly, it appears that stronger stimulation has a greater and more rapid effect on the zzso cell than on the zzso cell as it causes zzso cells to quickly become resistant to zzso Thus, the details of in zzso culture conditions may at least partially account for disparate findings in regard to the functional characterization of human zzso zzso Here we review the evidence regarding the identification of human zzso regulatory T cells and their possible zzso of zzso
