Bloom syndrome zzso displays one of the strongest known correlations between zzso instability and an increased risk of zzso at an early zzso The prevention of zzso instability and cancer depends on a complex network of pathways induced in response to DNA damage and stalled replication zzso including zzso zzso DNA repair, and zzso Several studies have demonstrated that zzso is involved in the cellular response to DNA damage and stalled replication zzso zzso interacts physically and functionally with several proteins involved in the maintenance of zzso integrity and zzso is redistributed and/or zzso in response to several zzso zzso The data concerning the relationship between zzso and these cellular pathways are summarized and the role of zzso in the rescue of arrested replication zzso is zzso Moreover, I speculate that zzso zzso is zzso and that zzso cells escaping zzso death do so by zzso inducing a bacterial zzso response including the induction of alternative replication zzso dependent on zzso contributing to the zzso and zzso zzso characteristic of zzso zzso This mechanism may be dependent on the zzso gene family, and involved in zzso in the general zzso
