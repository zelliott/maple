In recent years, there has been an unprecedented expansion in the field of zzso with the development of new zzso for the diagnosis and treatment of zzso zzso have unique biological properties given their small size and large surface zzso ratio, which allows them to zzso zzso and carry compounds such as small zzso drugs, DNA, zzso zzso and zzso with high zzso Their zzso size, shape, and surface characteristics also enable them to have high stability, high carrier capacity, the ability to incorporate both zzso and zzso substances and zzso with different administration routes, thereby making them highly attractive in many aspects of zzso This review article will discuss how zzso are able to function as carriers for zzso drugs to increase their therapeutic zzso how they can function as therapeutic agents in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and how zzso can be used as molecular imaging agents to detect and monitor cancer zzso
