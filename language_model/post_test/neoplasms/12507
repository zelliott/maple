zzso and zzso are zzso by many mobile and stationary sources and secondary zzso are zzso in the zzso of organic compounds in the zzso These zzso are zzso indoors by many materials such as furniture, carpets, heating and cooling systems, an by zzso zzso mainly zzso and zzso have been studied because of their adverse health zzso In addition, zzso is a suspected zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso were determined to assess the inhalation exposure doses to zzso for people who work in a zzso building and in order to evaluate the cancer zzso 

zzso compounds in indoor and outdoor air were measured at a zzso building located in Mexico zzso The zzso fifth and tenth floors, and the third zzso garage were selected for zzso zzso were collected in two sampling zzso the first from April 20 to 29, 1998 and the second from December 1 to 20, zzso zzso were sampled by means of zzso cartridges at a flow rate of 1 zzso zzso from 9:00 to zzso hours, during zzso time intervals and analyzed by zzso with hours, during zzso time intervals and analyzed by zzso with zzso zzso 

Mean zzso zzso were highest in the 3rd zzso garage, with the zzso concentration being the highest ranging from 108 to zzso zzso zzso In working areas, the highest zzso zzso mean zzso zzso were observed on the 5th zzso zzso and zzso zzso were highest in April ranging from 161 to 348 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and from 157 to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were present in smaller zzso ranging from 2 to 25 and 1 to 28 zzso zzso respectively, considering all the zzso Mean zzso ratios of zzso ranged from zzso to zzso A reduction of inhalation exposure doses of zzso and zzso was observed in the fifth floor air after the air conditioning systems had been zzso zzso and zzso zzso were higher in smoking zzso 

Indoor zzso zzso were significantly greater than outdoor zzso zzso smoke seems to be the main indoor source of zzso After the air conditioning system was maintained and repaired (as was zzso an important reduction in the zzso of zzso and zzso was achieved on all floors, except for the 3rd level parking garage, thereby reducing the inhalation exposure zzso 

The results obtained in this research demonstrated that maintenance of air conditioning systems must be carried out regularly in order to avoid possible adverse effects on zzso Additionally, it is mandatory that isolated smoking areas, with air extraction systems, be installed in every public zzso
