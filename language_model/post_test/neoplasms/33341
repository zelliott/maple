zzso techniques are a potentially valuable diagnostic tool to support zzso diagnosis in zzso However, detailed studies of zzso patterns and intensity in zzso specimens of zzso tumor types are zzso 

The aim of this study was to evaluate commercially available zzso against human proteins for use in the characterization of canine tumors of zzso origin in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was performed on zzso imprint specimens of zzso obtained from 103 zzso zzso and 14 zzso zzso from 98 zzso All specimens were stained with zzso zzso and zzso Based on the zzso diagnosis, tumors of muscle, zzso zzso and zzso origin also were stained with zzso zzso zzso intensity was zzso graded and the percentage of positive tumor cells was zzso 

All zzso tumors and zzso with the exception of zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso were positive for both zzso and zzso zzso of muscle zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso origin stained moderately to strongly positive in a majority of tumor cells with zzso von zzso factor, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had variable zzso and a variable percentage of positive cells with zzso and zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso zzso of canine zzso specimens is a reliable and sensitive technique that may be of benefit for the differentiation of poorly differentiated zzso tumors and zzso Additional study is needed to assess the specificity of zzso zzso in zzso zzso
