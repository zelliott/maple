zzso specific methods have been developed that allow quantitative zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso and of DNA and protein zzso in humans exposed zzso environmentally and zzso to zzso zzso The zzso between exposure to zzso host risk factors and the responses of zzso has been examined in zzso ecological and zzso studies which provided new insights into the causes of cancer and the mechanisms of zzso The identification of zzso unknown zzso chemicals formed in the human body from dietary precursors and of zzso components of complex zzso has increased the possibility of establishing zzso relationships in zzso The identification of individuals and zzso heavily exposed to zzso has led to the development of measures for avoiding or decreasing exposure to zzso risk zzso zzso zzso methods for measuring DNA zzso allow the zzso and structural zzso of specific DNA damage in humans arising from zzso stress and zzso zzso zzso which have been found to be the driving forces in several human zzso zzso DNA damage in zzso individuals has been shown unequivocally to be due to zzso products, and a significant zzso variation in zzso levels has been shown in individuals with comparable exposure to zzso Thus, zzso zzso with higher zzso to zzso zzso due to genetic zzso in zzso zzso have been characterized by a combination of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been used in human studies to evaluate the efficacy of interventions with zzso agents like zzso acid, dietary zzso and green zzso Advances in the application of selected zzso in human studies are reviewed and illustrated by examples from the author's research conducted during the past two zzso
