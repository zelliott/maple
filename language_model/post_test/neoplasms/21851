We investigate the effect of zzso zzso in the context of the linear transformation model for censored survival data in the clinical trials zzso The zzso zzso is represented by a frailty term, with unknown distribution, in the linear transformation zzso The bias of the estimate under the assumption of no zzso zzso when it truly is present is zzso We also derive the zzso relative efficiency of the estimate of treatment effect under the incorrect assumption of no zzso zzso zzso we investigate the loss of power for clinical trials that are designed assuming the model without frailty when, in fact, the model with frailty is zzso zzso studies under a zzso odds model show that the loss of efficiency and the loss of power can be substantial when the zzso as embodied by a zzso is zzso
