zzso zzso zzso zzso have shown promising clinical activity in the treatment of zzso zzso but their activity in solid tumor indications has been zzso Most zzso zzso in clinical development only zzso induce zzso zzso in tumor zzso Here, we sought to identify a zzso class I zzso inhibitor with prolonged zzso response in zzso to assess whether this results in superior zzso zzso 

To identify novel zzso zzso with superior zzso properties, we developed a zzso in zzso tumor model, in which tumor cells have been engineered to express fluorescent protein dependent on zzso zzso thereby allowing zzso real-time evaluation of the tumor response to zzso zzso 

In zzso zzso analysis of 140 potent zzso acid zzso resulted in the identification of zzso Once daily oral administration of zzso induced continuous zzso zzso zzso The prolonged zzso response translated into complete tumor growth zzso in Ras zzso zzso colon zzso zzso whereas zzso was less zzso zzso also fully inhibited the growth of zzso zzso liver zzso whereas again zzso showed modest zzso Further characterization revealed that zzso is a zzso inhibitor with marked potency toward zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The potent zzso activity as a single agent in zzso models combined with its favorable zzso profile makes zzso a promising zzso zzso zzso The compound is currently in clinical studies, to evaluate its potential zzso in a broad spectrum of both solid and zzso zzso
