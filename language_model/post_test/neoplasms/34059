Over the past three decades, zzso zzso zzso has proven to be central in imaging zzso zzso technology continues to drive practice patterns by combining fast scanning with high quality data zzso This has resulted in new applications as well as improved use in traditional zzso With this recognition has also come the realization that there are potential costs of zzso One major cost is the radiation zzso zzso in order to begin to assess benefits (which are relatively familiar to zzso versus costs (which are less zzso the issues related to CT radiation need to be zzso zzso with measures of CT radiation and the actual doses delivered by CT are important issues as they provide a basis for understanding the potential cancer risks from CT zzso Moreover, these justify development of strategies to minimize radiation zzso Strategies include obtaining only necessary CT examinations and adjusting the examinations based on scan indication, region zzso and patient zzso These strategies must also be combined with efforts by manufacturers in development and zzso of technology aimed at radiation dose management, as well as efforts in research, education, and CT standards and zzso This article reviews the subject of radiation dose with zzso CT technology, including measures of CT radiation, the dose that can result from CT zzso the risks of this amount of radiation, and strategies for minimizing CT radiation zzso
