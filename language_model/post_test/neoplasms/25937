zzso zzso levels are elevated in cancer patients and are used as a tumor marker in different zzso We have measured zzso levels in different blood compartments in cancer patients and healthy volunteers in order to assess the most suitable way of processing blood for measuring zzso as a marker of zzso 

zzso zzso were analyzed by an zzso zzso zzso in serum zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso plasma zzso zzso zzso zzso poor plasma zzso zzso rich plasma after induction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by measuring zzso zzso in different plasma zzso 

We observed higher zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso levels in cancer patients than in zzso zzso zzso showed no significant difference zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the correlation between zzso and zzso in cancer patients showed a similar correlation in a comparable zzso concentration range as in the zzso When comparing zzso to zzso we find significantly higher zzso and zzso levels in zzso plasma zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

It is likely that zzso in cancer patients zzso zzso zzso and zzso from other sources, notably from zzso in zzso zzso The best discrimination between volunteers and cancer patients was observed in zzso As generating plasma can induce zzso zzso with zzso zzso release from zzso we suggest that to assess free circulating zzso zzso plasma should be zzso
