zzso zzso was characterized in zzso human colon zzso cells and its distribution in other human cell types was zzso Several zzso species ranging from 800 to zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso with the smallest being the major zzso zzso This transcript was detected in tumor cells of diverse cellular zzso zzso of zzso zzso is not limited to zzso cells and is detected in normal zzso cells, zzso and peripheral blood zzso The latter, when induced by zzso expressed more zzso than did zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso did not contain higher levels of zzso zzso than their normal counterparts, demonstrating that increased zzso zzso expression does not necessarily occur upon zzso zzso This study demonstrates that zzso zzso is expressed in a wide spectrum of cells and is not correlated to a particular cell zzso
