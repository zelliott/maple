In an open, controlled study 34 patients with tumor zzso of different origin were treated with zzso The initial dosage was 300 zzso zzso zzso After achieving zzso treatment was continued orally using zzso zzso depending on serum calcium zzso Most patients showed zzso within 1 week of treatment - only few of them needed a longer zzso Fifteen of 34 patients died within the observation time of up to 24 weeks, some being zzso However, a zzso in plasma calcium during treatment was an indicator of zzso zzso of plasma zzso hormone zzso using an intact zzso zzso zzso showed depressed levels before zzso treatment started, but zzso rose after achieving normal and especially low normal calcium zzso Starting zzso zzso values were decreased or in the lower normal range in the majority of patients, but in zzso patients plasma zzso was in the upper normal range or elevated despite zzso After lowering plasma calcium the zzso levels zzso However, there was no significant correlation between zzso and zzso Therefore we assume that in some patients additional stimulation of zzso 1 zzso by tumor products is zzso
