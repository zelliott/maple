Although current cancer treatment strategies are highly aggressive, they are often not effective enough to destroy the collectivity of zzso zzso The residual tumor cells that survived the zzso treatment may continue to zzso or even zzso zzso the development of novel more effective strategies to specifically eliminate also single cancer cells is urgently zzso In this respect, the development of zzso zzso in particular example zzso has attracted broad zzso Since the zzso of zzso is essential for their zzso zzso it is of crucial importance to study their zzso behavior to assess the potential for their therapeutic zzso In this study, we determined the zzso behavior of four different zzso fragments variable zzso when binding to the corresponding target zzso as expressed on solid or zzso tumor cell zzso The zzso were zzso fused to the zzso an engineered zzso of the human repair zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso with zzso zzso Since a large number of highly sensitive organic fluorescent zzso are already available or can easily be zzso to react with the zzso zzso this system provides versatile applications for imaging of zzso zzso compartments of living zzso The fusion proteins were coupled to zzso Alexa zzso zzso or zzso Alexa zzso zzso and binding as well as zzso was monitored by flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso Depending on the respective target zzso we could distinguish between slow and rapid zzso zzso Moreover, we detected increased zzso rate for zzso zzso zzso Our approach allows for rapid and early stage evaluation of the zzso characteristics of new zzso designated for further therapeutic zzso
