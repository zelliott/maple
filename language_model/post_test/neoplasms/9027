In this article, we address statistical techniques appropriate for examining zzso changes in cancer symptom zzso When the cluster structure is not zzso researchers may examine symptom clusters either at each time point or use composite scores to examine the symptom clusters across time zzso When the cluster structures are zzso the statistical techniques depend on the research assumptions or zzso zzso zzso generalized zzso zzso zzso growth curve zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso are good choices for exploring whole cluster changes over zzso zzso zzso factor analysis and path analysis are appropriate techniques for examining changes in symptom relationships within clusters over zzso Each technique is zzso with examples and strengths and zzso
