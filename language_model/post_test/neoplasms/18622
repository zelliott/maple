The clinical effect of surgical delay in older patients with hip fracture is zzso zzso among study findings may be due to zzso that is caused by the reason for the delay or a differential effect on patient risk zzso 

To assess the effect of surgical delay on hospital outcomes according to the cause of zzso 

Prospective cohort zzso 

A hip fracture unit in a university hospital in zzso 

zzso consecutive elderly patients with hip zzso 

Time to surgery, reasons for surgical zzso adjusted zzso death, and risk for zzso 

Median time to surgery was 72 zzso Lack of operating room availability zzso and acute medical problems zzso were the main reasons for delays longer than 48 zzso Overall, rates of hospital death and complications were zzso and zzso respectively, but were zzso and zzso in clinically unstable zzso zzso delays were associated with higher mortality rates and rates of medical zzso After adjustment for age, zzso chronic zzso conditions, and zzso this association did not persist for delays of 120 hours or less but did persist for delays longer than 120 hours zzso zzso zzso for overall time effect on death and zzso for zzso The risks were attenuated after adjustment for the presence of acute medical conditions as the cause of the delay zzso zzso zzso for time effect on mortality and zzso on medical zzso zzso for urinary tract infection remained elevated zzso ratio, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso No interaction between delay and age, zzso or functional status was zzso 

This was a zzso study without zzso zzso 

The reported association between late surgery and higher morbidity and mortality in patients with hip fracture is mostly explained by medical reasons for surgical zzso although some association between very delayed surgery and worse outcomes zzso
