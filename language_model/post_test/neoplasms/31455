The refinement of high frequency zzso has improved the ability of ultrasound zzso to detect fine textural abnormalities of zzso and nerves and to identify a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns, closely resembling the zzso ones, are typically depicted in these structures using high US zzso In zzso imaging, US can identify zzso zzso degenerative changes, differentiate partial from complete tears and determine whether the patient has to be treated surgically or zzso A spectrum of findings in inflammatory conditions, including zzso and zzso and zzso tumors also can be zzso In nerve imaging, US can support clinical and zzso testing for detection of zzso zzso caused by nerve zzso in a variety of zzso tunnels of the limbs and zzso Nerve tears and tumors also can be zzso Overall, US is an effective technique for imaging zzso and zzso
