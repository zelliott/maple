The zzso growth factor 1 zzso zzso plays crucial roles in tumor cell growth and is zzso in many zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling pathways have been well zzso Very recently, we showed that zzso mediates nuclear zzso of the zzso and that nuclear zzso zzso binds to zzso regions and activates zzso We identified three zzso zzso in the zzso of the zzso and that zzso of these blocks nuclear zzso and gene zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso was proven strongly dependent on the specific zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso originates solely from the cell membrane and that zzso of the core zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is crucial for nuclear zzso We also compared the levels of zzso measured as zzso ratios, in tumor and normal zzso We found that the breast cancer cell line zzso has zzso higher amounts of zzso than breast zzso cells zzso which showed only a small amount of zzso In comparison, the total expression of zzso was only zzso higher in zzso zzso of several other tumor and normal cell lines showed similar tumor cell zzso of zzso exceeding the total zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso increased zzso in zzso cells but not to that high level as in wild type zzso The levels of zzso were higher in all tumor cell lines, compared to the normal cells, and this probably contributes to zzso of zzso zzso of zzso may contribute to zzso gene expression and zzso play a zzso role in cancer zzso
