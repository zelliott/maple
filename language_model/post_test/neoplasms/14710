zzso zzso have been detected in approximately zzso of all human tumors, and have been shown to predict response to some targeted zzso The most common zzso zzso strategy consists of conventional zzso and direct zzso This approach has a zzso detection sensitivity depending on whether zzso or zzso sequencing is zzso To improve detection sensitivity, we compared our conventional method with the recently described zzso zzso zzso zzso method, which selectively zzso minority zzso In zzso the critical zzso temperature is lowered to 80 degrees C zzso 94 degrees C in conventional zzso The sensitivity of zzso was determined by assessing serial zzso Fifty clinical samples were used, including 20 fresh bone-marrow zzso specimens and the zzso zzso zzso tissue of 30 solid zzso Implementation of zzso was straightforward and required no additional cost for zzso or zzso The method was specific and zzso zzso successfully detected zzso in all samples that were positive by conventional zzso and enhanced the zzso ratio by zzso increasing the zzso detection sensitivity to zzso The enhancement of zzso detection by zzso zzso correlated with the zzso percentage in a zzso In conclusion, we validated the utility and superior sensitivity of zzso for detecting zzso zzso in a variety of zzso and solid tumors using either fresh or zzso zzso zzso
