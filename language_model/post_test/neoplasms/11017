zzso zzso often shows pronounced zzso forcing cells to adapt their zzso towards enhanced zzso induced by altered cellular zzso and zzso zzso In the presents study mechanisms and potential consequences of the zzso between zzso and zzso pH zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso Data were obtained mainly in zzso zzso prostate zzso cells, but the principle importance was confirmed in 5 other cell zzso zzso zzso leads to a rapid and sustained decrease of zzso in parallel to zzso zzso in all cell types and to zzso zzso in 3 of 6 cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was zzso by sole zzso zzso at normal zzso zzso of zzso zzso during zzso led to zzso cell zzso No evidence for the involvement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso nor changes in cell volume in zzso zzso zzso was zzso However, our data reveal that zzso enhances the formation of zzso oxygen species zzso probably originating from zzso which subsequently trigger zzso zzso zzso of zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso whereas addition of zzso enhanced zzso Finally, zzso increased zzso of the zzso factor zzso via zzso leading to increased zzso activity of a zzso even 24 h after switching the cells back to a normal environmental zzso Thus, an zzso tumor zzso can induce a longer lasting zzso change in the zzso program, which may maintain the altered zzso even when the cells leave the tumor zzso
