zzso is a growth factor in zzso In this function, zzso is taken up into the zzso zzso zzso The zzso loss of circulating zzso results in a zzso which zzso with tumor mass and proliferation zzso The cellular zzso of iron into the zzso precursors depends on the presence of zzso zzso Thus, iron zzso for the zzso synthesis zzso with the zzso concentration in zzso In 256 patients with zzso of different zzso types and different tumor extension a strong correlation was found between the degree of zzso zzso and zzso This correlation between zzso concentration and zzso concentration could be demonstrated in the different zzso tumor zzso zzso progression was accompanied by a progressive fall in zzso concentration and zzso zzso By contrast, tumor zzso achieved by an effective zzso therapy resulted in an improvement of zzso and zzso These variations in the two parameters were found to be strongly zzso We conclude from our data that zzso loss of zzso is one of the most important factors responsible for the development of anemia in zzso
