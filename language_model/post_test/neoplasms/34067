zzso consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables, and zzso in the detoxifying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and other zzso genes have been shown to zzso cancer risk at some zzso We have shown recently that DNA zzso a reliable indicator of zzso damage and, zzso of cancer risk, are modulated by plasma levels of selected zzso Here we further investigate the association between DNA zzso levels and consumption of major food groups and foods, and the estimated dietary intake of zzso taking into account the possible zzso effect of zzso zzso in a larger sample of zzso healthy adults enrolled in a prospective study in zzso DNA zzso and five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined in peripheral zzso by using zzso technique and zzso zzso DNA bulky zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were detected in zzso samples zzso Overall, DNA zzso levels were significantly and zzso associated with the intake of raw leafy vegetables zzso zzso zzso zzso fruits zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso No association was evident with the five zzso zzso by zzso zzso showed strong inverse associations of DNA zzso levels with increasing consumption of all vegetables combined zzso zzso zzso leafy vegetables zzso zzso zzso raw leafy vegetables zzso zzso zzso and fish zzso zzso zzso among 307 zzso zzso strong inverse associations also emerged with estimated dietary zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso vitamin E zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, no association emerged among 295 subjects with a zzso zzso Overall, statistically significant interactions in predicting DNA zzso levels were observed between the zzso zzso and consumption of leafy vegetables zzso zzso zzso white meat zzso zzso zzso and intake of vitamin C zzso zzso zzso vitamin E zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that the role of a diet rich in antioxidants in preventing or reducing DNA zzso formation is restricted to subjects lacking the detoxifying activity of zzso zzso zzso 50% of the general zzso
