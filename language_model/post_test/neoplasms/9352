During zzso selective pressure drives tumor cells to develop several strategies that enable growth and zzso zzso cells produce or elicit factors that provide growth signals, nutrients and a favorable tumor zzso In addition, tumor cells can evade elimination by the immune system by several mechanisms, including developing resistance to T zzso zzso or the local expression of zzso molecules and zzso Recently, we described a role for the zzso zzso zzso in promoting tumor zzso and zzso In addition, zzso not only stimulates zzso and zzso zzso but also promotes zzso and inflammatory zzso in the tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso both of which are essential zzso for zzso immune responses, and controls the influx and activity of zzso zzso zzso We suggest that zzso zzso a repurposing of the zzso zzso zzso response away from zzso immunity zzso and towards zzso and zzso zzso pathways that nourish the tumor zzso zzso zzso enables the persistence of the recognized tumor cells, accompanied by zzso zzso This concept can explain tumor growth in the presence of large quantities of zzso T zzso
