There is no consensus in the zzso community about the optimal model for zzso management of ambulatory cancer zzso To understand zzso preferences regarding zzso management, we compared the characteristics of patients referred to an zzso zzso management service with zzso zzso patients managed by the patient's primary zzso 

We performed a retrospective medical record review of ambulatory zzso patients' zzso care at a comprehensive cancer zzso We examined the characteristics of 33 patients zzso before zzso of a dedicated zzso zzso management zzso We compared this group with 33 patients managed by the zzso management service and with 39 usual care patients managed by the primary zzso after the zzso management service was zzso We also examined differences in laboratory test zzso time in the therapeutic range (for patients zzso with zzso and zzso adverse events during a zzso assessment zzso 

zzso management service patients were more likely to be treated for zzso zzso use zzso stimulating agents, and require zzso management for previous zzso zzso disease compared to usual care zzso In contrast, zzso were more likely to manage zzso care of patients with advanced solid tumors undergoing active zzso zzso management service and usual care patients on zzso therapy had comparable time in the therapeutic range and complication zzso 

zzso selectively referred patients to the zzso management zzso zzso management service patients' zzso control and complication rates were comparable to care provided by the primary oncologist, suggesting that an zzso zzso management service may be a feasible and effective option for zzso management of ambulatory zzso zzso
