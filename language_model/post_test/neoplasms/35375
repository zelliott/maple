To evaluate zzso and quantitative zzso for zzso and determination of the urine zzso zzso ratio in detection of systemic disease in dogs without overt zzso 

Prospective zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso samples that had been obtained from dogs for which a complete medical record was available and in which results of a zzso test for urine protein were negative were zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso values, zzso and zzso zzso and quantitative zzso values zzso value, 1 zzso and zzso ratios zzso values, 100 and 200 zzso were zzso Clinical diagnoses rendered within 3 months of enrollment in the study were zzso zzso and specificity were determined with disease status serving as the zzso zzso with clinical diagnosis, sex, age, zzso and serum zzso zzso blood pressure, results of bacterial culture of zzso temperature, zzso zzso and zzso were evaluated by use of zzso zzso zzso 

48 dogs were healthy, and 360 had at least 1 zzso zzso associations were detected between age, presence of disease, presence of zzso disease, zzso and serum zzso zzso and zzso and results of 1 or both of the zzso zzso 

zzso was associated with underlying zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the zzso zzso test for detection of systemic disease were superior to those of other zzso zzso testing in conjunction with other screening procedures may increase diagnosis of zzso disease, but a prospective study in which the zzso values of screening tests are zzso with and without zzso determination, is zzso
