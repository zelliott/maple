zzso zzso is widely used in zzso analyses of zzso in normal and zzso zzso The present study investigates oral administration as a means of minimizing zzso 

Twelve dogs with confirmed zzso received zzso zzso of zzso zzso 6 by mouth and 6 by zzso zzso All dogs received zzso zzso as a zzso Plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso embedded, zzso zzso and analyzed for zzso and zzso zzso pH dependence for zzso and zzso binding was studied in zzso 

zzso and zzso binding in zzso and zzso was strongly correlated for both oral and zzso zzso zzso zzso On average, the extent of zzso binding exceeded that for zzso by a factor of approximately zzso with the factor ranging from zzso to zzso zzso of both markers was pH dependent, but zzso binding was greater at all values of zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is effective as a zzso marker in spontaneously arising canine zzso Selective cellular zzso and zzso higher levels of binding in regions of zzso at the high end of pH zzso might account for the greater extent of zzso zzso
