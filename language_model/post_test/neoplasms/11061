zzso free survival zzso is increasingly used as a primary zzso in zzso clinical zzso This paper provides observations and recommendations on the use of a blinded independent central review zzso for zzso 

The findings and recommendations are based on extensive simulations and a zzso based on 27 previously conducted zzso phase III trials with zzso performed by the zzso Research and Manufacturers Association zzso sponsored zzso Independent Review Working zzso 

zzso of the zzso demonstrate a strong correlation between zzso and zzso estimates of treatment effect zzso Further, differences between treatment groups in zzso rates predict the differences between zzso and zzso estimates of treatment effect supporting the use of a zzso zzso on a zzso of zzso 

The zzso demonstrates that local evaluation zzso provides a reliable estimate of the treatment effect with little evidence for systematic evaluation zzso zzso when a trial is blinded or a large effect on zzso is observed a zzso may not be zzso When a zzso is warranted, a zzso zzso may provide a reduction in operational complexity without compromising the credibility of trial zzso While for large trials that are not adequately blinded a zzso zzso may be zzso A full zzso should be considered in the case of smaller trials or in situations in which there is a particular need to increase the confidence in the zzso zzso
