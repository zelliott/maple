The presence of zzso atoms has made zzso zzso attractive candidates for zzso zzso capture zzso Because of their chemistry and possible zzso with zzso they can also be used to enhance interactions between pharmaceuticals and their targets and to increase the in zzso stability and zzso of compounds that are normally zzso zzso zzso are zzso to a rotating zzso group, which they can substitute successfully in biologically active zzso A reverse zzso zzso approach was used in this work to identify binding proteins for zzso The screening was carried out on the drug target database zzso that contains zzso entries covering zzso known potential drug targets with structures taken from the zzso Data zzso First, for zzso the protocol was applied to three crystal structures of proteins in which zzso derivatives are zzso Then, the model was applied to systems for which the protein structure is available, but the binding site of zzso has not been zzso These systems were used for further validation of the zzso while simultaneously providing new insight into the interactions between cage and zzso Finally, the screening was carried out on the database to reveal potential zzso binding targets of interest for biological and pharmacological zzso zzso are predicted to bind well to zzso and zzso zzso Other zzso pharmaceutical targets are also discussed, together with possible protein zzso
