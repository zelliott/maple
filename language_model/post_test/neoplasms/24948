zzso iron oxide zzso zzso have been receiving great attention lately in biomedical applications, such as in magnetic resonance imaging and drug zzso However, their systemic administration still remains a challenge due to their zzso nature with instances of zzso leading to fast zzso system zzso zzso In this study, magnetic zzso with zzso zzso have been zzso Random zzso of zzso zzso acrylic acid zzso and zzso have been coated on zzso followed by zzso with zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and low zzso zzso having a critical temperature zzso of 44 zzso were zzso zzso and powder X-ray zzso studies showed that the zzso were composed of zzso cubic zzso zzso Nearly zzso zzso was loaded onto the zzso by diffusion zzso Drug release was higher at the zzso temperature zzso zzso zzso in 48 zzso proving the zzso nature of the zzso zzso zzso samples showed a zzso value of 32 zzso as well as high zzso and zzso zzso in magnetic resonance zzso zzso weighted images of zzso were darker than the control with 20 zzso as the zzso At this concentration the magnetic zzso showed nearly zzso viability in zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso with zzso surfaces and size of zzso zzso are therefore highly suitable for in zzso imaging and zzso based drug zzso
