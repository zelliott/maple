We conducted this study to investigate how physicians in a pediatric intensive care unit zzso currently make decisions to withdraw and withhold life zzso zzso with the patient's primary caregiver often precedes decisions about withdrawal and limitation of life support in chronically ill zzso In these scenarios, the patient's primary caregiver was the pediatric zzso To evaluate the influence of zzso training, we compared the attitudes of the pediatric zzso and the zzso using scenarios describing critically ill zzso zzso 

zzso zzso Each physician was randomly assigned 4 of 8 potential case zzso 

A total of 29 American pediatric zzso 

zzso intensive care and zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso manipulation of patient characteristics in two hypothetical case scenarios describing 6-year-old female zzso patients presenting to the zzso after the institution of mechanical zzso support for acute respiratory zzso Cases 1 through 4 described a patient who, before admission, had a zzso projected zzso probability of survival from her underlying cancer and suffered from severe zzso zzso Cases 5 through 8 described a patient who was zzso normal before admission and had a zzso chance of surviving longer than 1 year because of her underlying zzso Each physician was randomly assigned 2 cases from cases 1 through 4 and 2 cases from cases 5 through zzso Within each of these case scenarios, parental preferences zzso or advance support or look for guidance from the zzso and probability of survival zzso vs zzso were zzso Before distribution, the survey instrument was zzso and underwent a rigorous assessment for clinical zzso 

Physicians ratings of the importance of 10 factors considered in the decision to withdraw life support, and their decisions about the appropriate level of care to zzso zzso were offered five management options representing five levels of zzso 1) zzso zzso and mechanical ventilation but continue comfort zzso 2) zzso zzso and other maintenance therapy but continue mechanical ventilation and comfort zzso 3) continue with current management but add no new therapeutic zzso 4) continue with current management, add additional zzso change antibiotics and the like as needed, but do not start zzso and 5) continue with full aggressive management and plan for dialysis if zzso zzso also were asked whether they would obtain an ethics zzso 

A total of zzso physicians responded to our survey zzso of 198 potentially eligible pediatric zzso and 105 of 178 pediatric zzso for response rates of zzso and zzso zzso The respondents considered the probability of zzso survival and the wishes of the parents regarding the aggressiveness of care most important in the decision to limit zzso zzso No clinically important differences were found when the responses of zzso were compared with those of zzso In six of eight possible scenarios, the same level of intensity of care was chosen by less than half of all zzso In three scenarios, zzso of respondents chose full aggressive management as the most appropriate level of care, whereas another zzso chose comfort measures only when viewing the same zzso The most significant respondent factors affecting choices were professional status zzso vs zzso and the zzso importance of functional zzso zzso The majority of respondents zzso believed that the intensive care and the zzso staff were usually in agreement at their institution about the level of intervention to recommend to the zzso zzso zzso
