We combine diffuse optical zzso for detecting and zzso an zzso in a zzso tissue and diffuse optical zzso zzso for characterizing the spectrum of that zzso For detecting and zzso an zzso we reduce the number of unknowns substantially by seeking only the location and size of the zzso Then, we seek to recover an unknown specific tumor component of that zzso from spectral zzso In doing so, we develop a method for distinguishing between healthy and zzso zzso We demonstrate the utility of this theory with zzso zzso
