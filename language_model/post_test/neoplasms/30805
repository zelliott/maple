The zzso zzso zzso zzso are the most important zzso system in the zzso of chemicals to their zzso zzso which then interact with cellular components to provoke toxicity and zzso These zzso comprise a multifamily of zzso two families of which, namely zzso and zzso activate zzso and small molecular weight compounds, zzso A computer graphic procedure zzso has been developed which, based on the molecular shape and electronic structure of the chemical, determines whether the chemical will interact with these two particular zzso zzso families and thus be zzso to toxic and zzso zzso As the zzso levels of these zzso families are low, the ability of the chemical to induce them zzso on repeated administration, is an important zzso of its zzso zzso zzso capability may be determined in short-term experiments zzso utilizing a small number of zzso Thus the combination of zzso and zzso provides a rapid and inexpensive means for the preliminary screening of zzso before the long term and expensive zzso lifetime zzso are zzso
