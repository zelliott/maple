Reports evaluating the efficacy of fine needle aspiration zzso of the adrenal zzso have suggested a possible correlation between size of an adrenal mass and the presence of a primary or zzso zzso These studies have focused on zzso of all adrenal zzso masses regardless of clinical zzso This study investigates this relationship in a zzso of patients with a known history of primary zzso zzso 

All patients who have undergone zzso zzso zzso biopsy of an adrenal mass at zzso University Medical Center and Hines Veterans Administration Hospital, from 1985 to 1991, were zzso 

If size was assumed to be an independent predictor for presence of zzso the highest efficiency was obtained with a zzso value of 3 zzso This value divided the group into 15 zzso zzso zzso or zzso 3 zzso and 21 zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso In the zzso group, zzso of the masses (13 of zzso were benign and zzso (2 of zzso were zzso Within the zzso group, more than zzso of the masses (20 of zzso were zzso with a single zzso benign case zzso zzso zzso 

There is a significant correlation between the size of an adrenal zzso and the presence of zzso in patients with a known primary zzso zzso zzso greater than 3 zzso have a very high probability of involvement by zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso or smaller are usually benign, but zzso tumor can still be found in up to zzso zzso biopsy is useful in evaluating adrenal masses in this zzso
