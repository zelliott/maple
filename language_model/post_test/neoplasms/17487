Literature on zzso tumor therapy in the past 10 years has grown zzso Since 1975 three international zzso on cancer therapy by zzso have been zzso zzso is of clinical interest in the temperature range of 40 zzso degrees zzso Higher temperatures of 44 zzso degrees C are not clinically zzso With local heat application a higher zzso of tissue temperature is zzso zzso zzso in men is limited zzso as the rate of complications increases zzso above 42 degrees zzso The heat dose normally is defined by temperature degree and time of temperature zzso zzso has several effects on tumor zzso It influences proliferation zzso within the zzso cycle, zzso the zzso cells and zzso cells are zzso It is possible to zzso tumor proliferation by zzso zzso zzso tumor cells in hypoxic condition as zzso This was demonstrated in zzso with tumor cells under varying zzso and with zzso experimental zzso zzso with solid tumors in animals had the same zzso zzso enhances the effect of radiation on zzso In solid human tumors only zzso of cells are in growth zzso zzso of tumor cells are hypoxic or zzso Only zzso cells are sensitive to a sparsely zzso radiation and can be zzso This selective zzso is the reason why other radiation qualities for zzso which are also effective on hypoxic cells, are zzso zzso and heavy zzso are densely zzso zzso which zzso hypoxic zzso zzso zzso in combination with sparsely zzso zzso zzso or gamma zzso be an alternative to zzso or heavy zzso The main problem with heat application in clinical zzso is the lack of heating methods which are able to heat the entire volume of a large solid tumor zzso In small experimental animals there is a zzso of about zzso The therapeutic gain of additional heat in zzso is greatly dependent on zzso of the tumor zzso zzso and on cooling of the zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso Many investigations have been done on the interaction of heat and zzso in zzso experiments evaluated three zzso First, the activity of many drugs increases slightly with zzso no special effects are observed above 42 degrees zzso Examples of drugs of that pattern are the hypoxic zzso zzso and the zzso agents zzso and zzso A second type of mechanism is seen with zzso drugs which exhibit greatly increased effectiveness at temperatures above 42 degrees zzso zzso and zzso belong to this zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
