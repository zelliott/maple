Simon's zzso designs are widely used for cancer phase II zzso These methods rely on statistical testing and thus allow controlling the type I and II error rates, while accounting for the interim zzso zzso after such trials is however not straightforward, and several different approaches have been zzso 

Different approaches for point and confidence intervals zzso as well as zzso of zzso are reviewed and compared for a range of plausible zzso Cases where the actual number of patients recruited in the trial differs from the zzso sample size are also zzso 

For point zzso the zzso minimum zzso unbiased zzso zzso and the bias corrected zzso had better performance than the others when the actual sample size was as zzso For confidence zzso using a zzso approach yielded coverage probabilities closer to the nominal level as compared to so-called zzso confidence zzso When the actual sample size differed from the zzso sample size the zzso did not perform worse than an zzso specifically developed for such a zzso Analysis conditional on having proceeded to the second stage required adapted analysis methods, and a zzso minimum zzso conditional zzso zzso can be used, which also performs well when the second stage sample size is slightly different from zzso 

The use of the zzso may be recommended as it exhibited good properties both when the actual number of patients recruited was equal to or differed from the zzso zzso Restricting the analysis in cases where the trial did not stop early for futility may be valuable, and the zzso may be recommended in that zzso
