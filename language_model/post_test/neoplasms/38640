A major zzso of zzso with zzso 2 zzso is development of a vascular leak zzso The zzso of this toxic effect is not zzso We have examined zzso and zzso skin zzso from 14 patients undergoing systemic administration of zzso for evidence of zzso cell zzso Specifically, we have used the zzso technique to detect the expression of three different zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, detected with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, detected with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso detected with zzso zzso zzso Each of these zzso may be induced on cultured zzso cells by various zzso (although not by zzso and is expressed during zzso cell zzso in zzso at sites of delayed hypersensitivity and other immune zzso zzso zzso from each patient showed no zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso 1 and only weak to moderate expression of zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso (except for one zzso zzso with zzso zzso After 5 days of treatment, every patient showed marked zzso expression of all three zzso (except for the same patient who remained zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was confined to zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso and zzso 10 also were expressed on zzso cells and zzso zzso Thus, we conclude that zzso administration of zzso leads to zzso cell zzso Because zzso fails to induce the same zzso on cultured zzso cells, we zzso that zzso acts in zzso by inducing the production of other zzso zzso zzso 1, tumor necrosis factor, zzso and zzso Finally, since zzso cell zzso at sites of zzso immune responses is well known to result in vascular zzso to zzso we propose that the vascular leak syndrome accompanying zzso therapy may arise from widespread inappropriate zzso cell zzso
