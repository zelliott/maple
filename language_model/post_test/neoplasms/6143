In Ethiopia, lack of reliable data on causes of death prevents full understanding of the double mortality burden of communicable and zzso zzso Our objective was to help bridge this research gap by analyzing surveillance data on causes of death in Addis zzso 

Burial surveillance identified zzso deaths in Addis zzso from 2006 through 2009, of which zzso were eligible for verbal zzso a method of interviewing zzso of the deceased about the circumstances, signs, and symptoms preceding zzso We randomly selected zzso from the eligible sample, of whom zzso were defined as adults zzso zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso were completed and causes of death were assigned for zzso zzso 

Overall, 51% zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso of deaths were attributed to zzso diseases, zzso zzso zzso zzso to communicable diseases, and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso Similar proportions of male and female deaths were caused by zzso and communicable zzso Adults aged 55 to 84 were more zzso and those aged 15 to 44 were less zzso to die from zzso diseases compared with the age group 85 or zzso zzso deaths zzso as earlier than age zzso from zzso diseases were mainly due to certain zzso type 1 and type 2 diabetes, hypertension, stroke, and zzso zzso 

zzso diseases are the leading cause of death among adults in Addis Ababa, where the health care system is still geared toward addressing communicable zzso Health policy attention is needed to remedy this zzso This observed double mortality burden is unlikely to be unique to Addis zzso and provides new insight into the zzso transition in urban zzso zzso studies should be conducted in Ethiopia to examine the pattern of zzso transition and the magnitude of double mortality zzso
