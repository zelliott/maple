The characteristic zzso zzso that occur in certain human zzso offer opportunities to understand how two gene systems can affect one another when they are accidentally zzso In the case of zzso lymphoma, such a zzso joins the cellular zzso zzso to a region zzso one of the zzso zzso In at least one example, the coding sequence of the rearranged zzso gene is identical to that of the normal zzso zzso that the gene must be zzso rather than zzso altered in its expression if it is to play a role in zzso One might expect to find the rearranged zzso gene in a zzso that would allow it to take advantage of one of the known zzso promoters or zzso zzso However, the rearranged zzso gene is often placed so that it can zzso neither of these zzso Since the level of zzso zzso zzso is often elevated in zzso cells, the zzso may lead to a deregulation of the zzso zzso Further, since the normal zzso in a zzso cell is often zzso silent in the presence of a rearranged zzso a model for zzso regulation is suggested that involves a zzso negative control element that might use as its target a highly zzso portion of the zzso gene zzso two discrete zzso zzso
