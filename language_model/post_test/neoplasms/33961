The zzso system serves to collect and transport zzso fluid zzso within zzso and plays an important role in the immune zzso The zzso system also constitutes one of most important pathways of zzso zzso In several human zzso increased expression in primary zzso of a new member of the vascular zzso growth factor zzso family, namely zzso is correlated with regional zzso zzso zzso Experimental studies using transgenic mice zzso zzso or zzso of zzso zzso cells into zzso mice have demonstrated a role for zzso in zzso zzso and the subsequent formation of zzso zzso zzso However, there is at present very little evidence for zzso in human zzso which is at zzso with the data obtained in animal zzso Nonetheless, the striking correlation between levels of zzso in primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests that zzso may activate pre-existing zzso which then become actively involved in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The role of zzso in human zzso zzso is therefore likely to involve zzso as well as its capacity to induce zzso of pre-existing zzso zzso
