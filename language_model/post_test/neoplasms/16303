The members of the nuclear zzso zzso are known to mediate a wide array of basic biological zzso such as regulation of cell growth and zzso and induction of zzso In several human zzso this central control function of nuclear receptors is zzso which seems to play an important role in tumor development and zzso Many nuclear zzso genes have been reported to be zzso in zzso however, only a few zzso gene arrangements, deletions or similar genetic changes have been shown to occur in these zzso During the last decade, increasing attention has been directed towards zzso mechanisms of gene regulation such as DNA zzso Many nuclear zzso genes can be silenced through zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso therefore, represents an additional mechanism that zzso expression of key genes during zzso This review will give insights into the role of DNA zzso in the zzso of nuclear zzso genes and its involvement in human zzso
