Recent findings that zzso individual tumor cells in a zzso zzso possess widely different zzso properties and zzso zzso arise from specific zzso of zzso tumor cells have profound implications for eventually understanding and treating zzso zzso These findings have also raised serious doubts concerning the appropriateness of many of the experimental approaches currently in use for studying zzso Diversity in zzso zzso among cells from the same tumor suggests that the usual analyses of tumor cell lines containing multiple zzso zzso may not be zzso This is especially true for tumors where the zzso zzso represent only an extremely small fraction of the total number of tumor cell zzso In addition, the screening of potential zzso and zzso agents for their abilities to inhibit the growth of tumors containing widely zzso zzso of zzso and zzso cells may not be useful in predicting the efficacy of these treatments against zzso New zzso must be developed to isolate and characterize the specific cell zzso that possess the zzso zzso with the reservation that careful attention must be paid to the zzso of these zzso cell zzso especially during long-term zzso zzso the zzso controlling the rapid generation of zzso diversity in tumor zzso and the regulation of zzso diversity during progressive growth of primary and zzso zzso is of fundamental importance in the design of experimental systems for studying the zzso process, and zzso zzso This review and its companion, as well as our other recent reviews, have dealt with current information on cancer zzso and where future efforts might be the most promising in discerning this complex zzso
