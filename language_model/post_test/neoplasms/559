Human zzso zzso zzso and its zzso in zzso zzso zzso and tumor extracts from four patients with zzso tumors zzso cell zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and pancreatic zzso were measured by the zzso specific to each zzso While both free alpha and beta zzso as well as the whole zzso of zzso were found in all these samples, the proportion of beta zzso was much higher in these tumor extracts than in the zzso zzso Since the alpha and beta zzso are known to be translated from separate zzso such increase of zzso is probably due to the zzso increase of zzso zzso beta zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the extracts of these four tumors on zzso zzso and zzso columns demonstrated a zzso of zzso zzso and beta zzso in these tumor zzso and the zzso profiles of zzso urine and tumor extracts were slightly zzso Lower molecular weight forms of zzso and its beta zzso were present in all urine zzso The significance of these zzso remains to be zzso
