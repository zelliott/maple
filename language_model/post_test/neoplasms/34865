The increased mortality associated with zzso was first demonstrated in early zzso zzso Since the seminal paper by Wright et zzso in 1970, nearly 20 studies have analyzed mortality rates in over 5,000 patients with zzso zzso standardized mortality rates are approximately two times higher than in the general population, relating to an average reduction in life expectancy of around 10 zzso The excess deaths are due predominantly to zzso cerebrovascular and respiratory zzso zzso deaths have been high in some studies but not zzso in the largest series looking at cancer mortality in zzso overall cancer deaths were not increased, but colon cancer mortality was higher than zzso In 1993, Bates et zzso first demonstrated that outcome was related to the latest measurable growth hormone zzso and treatment to reduce zzso levels led to improved zzso Other factors predicting poor outcome include the presence of hypertension and zzso On the basis of current evidence, a latest zzso of less than zzso zzso is a better predictor of good outcome than a normal zzso growth zzso zzso possibly due to zzso between zzso and IGF-1 at low zzso zzso There is some evidence to suggest a more stringent zzso zzso (less than 1 zzso may yield additional benefit but further studies are required to investigate any added risk of increased mortality from zzso zzso has been linked specifically to cerebrovascular mortality and its use in patients with zzso must involve a careful zzso analysis in each zzso
