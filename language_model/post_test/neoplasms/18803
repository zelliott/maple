Human zzso 1 zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth factor and zzso signaling in cell zzso But zzso function is more complicated, and its molecular mechanism has not been well zzso 

To further investigate the functions of zzso gene in regulating the vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso a series of zzso expressing zzso zzso small hairpin zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso could zzso the zzso zzso and inhibit cancer cell proliferation both in zzso and zzso cancer cell zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso enhanced the recovery of high levels of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso inhibited the proliferation activity of cancer cells in zzso to some zzso In human cancer zzso in nude mice, tumor growth was inhibited markedly after injections of zzso expressing zzso with the tumor zzso rates of zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso tumor models, zzso zzso expression significantly reduced tumor zzso zzso 

The results demonstrated that zzso zzso both in zzso and zzso cancer cells zzso zzso efficacy by attenuating the zzso of zzso and suppressing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso could be a reasonable approach for cancer zzso
