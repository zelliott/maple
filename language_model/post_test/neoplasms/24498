The zzso signaling in zzso cells is carried out mainly by growth factors that interact with receptors localized at the plasma zzso Most of these receptors have a zzso zzso activity domain that is localized at the zzso region of the zzso The interaction of the growth factors with the zzso besides inducing the zzso activity of the zzso activate signaling pathways the alter gene expression patterns and induce zzso or if zzso are related to zzso Among these receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso are attractive targets for directed zzso zzso receptors are frequently involved in the production of many types of zzso Both, the zzso of the growth factor and the zzso besides zzso at the zzso zzso zzso domain contribute to zzso signaling in human zzso zzso has a pivotal role in maintaining the tumor growth by zzso growth of new blood zzso zzso zzso of tumor growth targeting of the tumor zzso by interfering with the activity of zzso is now a real alternative in zzso zzso zzso is a growth factor involved in growth of zzso tissue and wound zzso zzso zzso of zzso have been found in gastrointestinal tumors and the zzso signaling maintained by this zzso have been described in many zzso zzso and inhibitor of the zzso zzso activity of zzso targets also the zzso of the zzso Finally zzso an II have an important zzso and zzso role in most zzso Different zzso are now under clinical studies for the use in combination of zzso drugs in the treatment of different zzso
