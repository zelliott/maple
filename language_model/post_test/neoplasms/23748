The diagnostic relevance of recording motor evoked zzso zzso after electrical stimulation of the cervical region, as compared with conventional needle zzso zzso was evaluated in 26 patients with zzso zzso zzso damage of different zzso severity and zzso zzso abnormalities zzso or zzso zzso were observed in at least one muscle of all the patients, with a global zzso of zzso of the muscles zzso zzso zzso signs were present in all but one patient with an zzso of zzso of the muscles zzso Combining the two methods, the global zzso of abnormalities rose to zzso zzso abnormalities were consistent with the clinical topography and severity of zzso zzso and were fairly parallel with zzso zzso Recording zzso after zzso electrical stimulation of the cervical region may be regarded as a zzso zzso method for quantitative zzso assessment of zzso zzso
