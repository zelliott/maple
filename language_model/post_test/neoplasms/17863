The zzso countries have a long tradition of large-scale zzso and comprehensive, zzso health data zzso zzso on unique personal zzso enabling follow-up studies spanning many zzso Joint zzso zzso studies provide unique opportunities for zzso molecular zzso zzso The purpose of the present paper is to describe the possibilities for such joint studies, by describing some of the major zzso zzso zzso with a zzso calculation of the cancer zzso in these zzso zzso two million donors have since 1966 donated more than four million biological samples, stored at zzso degrees C to zzso degrees C, to 17 zzso zzso in Finland, Iceland, Norway and zzso As a result of joint database handling principles, the accuracy of personal identifiers and zzso of follow-up for vital status in all participating zzso was zzso zzso the cancer zzso was determined using follow-up through the national cancer zzso zzso based on random samples of population typically showed slightly lower cancer zzso rates than the general population, presumably due to better participation rates among zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso including samples for viral screening or clinical testing showed zzso to zzso fold increased zzso of zzso This excess was very high immediately after zzso but for some cancer sites remained elevated for years after clinical zzso So far, more than 100 zzso zzso zzso have occurred after sample donation, and the annual increase of the cancer cases in these zzso is about 10 zzso The estimates on the zzso of the zzso will assist in interpretation of zzso of results of future studies based on these samples, and the systematic zzso of numbers of cancer cases will serve in study power zzso The present paper summarizes optimal study designs of zzso studies of zzso
