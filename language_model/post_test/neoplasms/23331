The evolution in our understanding of tumor zzso has been the result of pioneering imaging and zzso modeling studies spanning the zzso cell, zzso and tissue zzso Many of these primary data on the tumor zzso are in the form of images from zzso tumor models that provide a wealth of qualitative and quantitative information in many dimensions and across different spatial zzso However, until recently, the zzso of changes in the tumor zzso across spatial scales remained a challenge due to a lack of techniques for zzso zzso and zzso imaging zzso Furthermore, the paucity of three-dimensional zzso tumor vascular data in conjunction with the challenges in obtaining such data from patients presents a serious hurdle for the development and validation of zzso zzso zzso models of tumor zzso In this review, we discuss the development of zzso models of tumor zzso new imaging techniques capable of zzso the 3-D tumor vascular architecture with high zzso and the emergence of zzso zzso of tumor blood flow and molecular zzso zzso these developments are helping us gain a fundamental understanding of the cellular and molecular regulation of tumor zzso that will benefit the development of new cancer zzso Eventually, we expect this exciting integration of zzso imaging and mathematical modeling to have widespread application beyond the tumor zzso to other diseases involving a pathological zzso such as stroke and spinal zzso zzso
