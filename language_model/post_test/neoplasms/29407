To validate the zzso scale for measuring quality of life of patients with cancer in zzso 

The analysis included factor analysis, zzso analysis, zzso analysis, zzso zzso internal consistency zzso patients diagnosed with zzso zzso reliability zzso patients evaluated at two different time points) and sensitivity to change zzso patients evaluated before and after an zzso 

A zzso structure has been found zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have zzso zzso zzso alpha was zzso for the whole zzso None of the items had significant impact on the zzso alpha when zzso Lin's zzso correlation zzso indicated zzso reliability zzso zzso zzso adequate to the uses of the zzso Regarding sensitivity to change, repeated measures analysis demonstrated significant change of the score after an intervention zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso Except for the domain zzso zzso zzso correlation zzso between equivalent domain scores on zzso and the zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso 

The zzso scale measures a zzso zzso zzso indicate that the zzso scale is an instrument that performs consistently over time, with evidence of zzso The finding of zzso items in two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso caution in interpreting the scores of these zzso
