The purpose of the study was to test the zzso and clinical effects of infusions of zzso cells zzso with zzso tumor zzso in patients with advanced zzso 

zzso blood zzso cells from 15 patients with zzso cancer zzso in 10, lung cancer in 2, zzso cell zzso in 1, zzso in 1, breast cancer in 1) were harvested by zzso after zzso with zzso (5 zzso zzso for 4 zzso zzso cells were separated and cultured in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso for 7 zzso zzso was assessed by zzso flow zzso and zzso On day 6, zzso cells were zzso with 1 g of fresh zzso tumor zzso for 24 h and infused zzso zzso (6 million zzso zzso a (4 million zzso and zzso zzso zzso were injected zzso daily for 10 days beginning on the day of zzso cell zzso Treatment was repeated every 21 days for 3 zzso 

The zzso zzso and zzso of cultured cells was consistent with zzso zzso intense zzso for zzso and zzso with zzso for markers of other zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso More than 5 zzso zzso zzso cells were injected in all zzso Nine patients developed zzso zzso delayed type zzso hypersensitivity reactions to tumor zzso after the first zzso zzso than zzso in all zzso Median delayed type zzso hypersensitivity to zzso zzso zzso was 3 zzso after the third zzso One melanoma patient with skin, liver, lung and bone zzso had a partial response lasting 8 months zzso by progression in the zzso Seven patients had stable disease for zzso months, and 7 had zzso 

zzso of tumor zzso zzso cells zzso a strong zzso zzso immune reaction in patients with advanced cancer and has some clinical zzso
