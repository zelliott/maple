Recently, animal fatty acid zzso zzso is reported as a potential therapeutic target for obesity and zzso zzso interest has been developed in searching for novel zzso of this zzso An extract from zzso has been found to inhibit zzso in both zzso and irreversible manners, with an zzso of zzso zzso and an apparent zzso rate constant of zzso of zzso zzso zzso The kinetic study showed that the zzso extract inhibited the overall zzso reaction zzso with zzso but it presented in a mixed manner both with zzso and with zzso Its major reacting site on this zzso as compared between two zzso values, is not in the zzso reduction zzso A weight reducing experiment in rats showed that the extract significantly reduced the zzso and food zzso but in view of statistics zzso zzso zzso a correlation between the reductions in the zzso and in the food consumption and the zzso of zzso zzso could not be zzso Three known zzso compounds were isolated from the extract and the zzso relationship was zzso
