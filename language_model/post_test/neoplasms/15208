A review is given of human zzso zzso recognized by zzso zzso and used as vascular zzso These zzso can be classified tentatively into two categories that partly zzso 1) differentiation markers and 2) zzso involved in specific cellular zzso zzso zzso recognizing zzso differentiation markers reacting with all types of human zzso can be regarded as zzso zzso zzso Other differentiation markers have a restricted distribution that is associated with a zzso of zzso Although sensitivity of the markers is high in general, specificity for zzso is not absolute, based on distribution studies in zzso or in cell zzso With the exception of zzso and zzso it is not clear from the literature whether the zzso also react with zzso zzso zzso examination of other species indicate that only zzso 200 is restricted to zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells in tissue specimens has revealed that the zzso zzso recognizing differentiation zzso show different zzso distribution zzso zzso and zzso 200 react with the zzso zzso surface, in a local and diffuse pattern, zzso zzso zzso factor zzso Factor zzso zzso zzso react with zzso bodies but also with zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso in diagnostic pathology include assessment of vascular invasion by cancer cells, and identification of zzso zzso and related zzso Because zzso zzso zzso and zzso 200 are zzso on zzso and zzso zzso they are most suitable for zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso recognizing zzso zzso involved in specific cellular functions also may contribute to zzso research on the characterization of zzso zzso zzso in the tumor vascular zzso
