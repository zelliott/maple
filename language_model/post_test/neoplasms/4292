A restriction zzso length zzso zzso in the human zzso hormone common zzso gene has been identified and partially characterized in normal zzso and zzso established tumor cell lines, and tumor biopsy zzso High molecular weight DNA was zzso with the restriction zzso zzso separated by zzso in zzso gels, transferred to nylon zzso by the method of Southern, and zzso to zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso After zzso bands were detected at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso bands was zzso and zzso zzso missing the zzso zzso band and both the zzso and zzso zzso bands are consistent with separate zzso that occur in zzso and zzso DNA with zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of all three bands zzso zzso and zzso zzso is indicative of zzso occurring at a frequency of zzso zzso Additional restriction patterns, not yet observed in DNA isolated from term zzso or circulating zzso were detected in DNA obtained from tumor cell lines and fresh tumor zzso at zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Thus, particular zzso zzso are disproportionately represented in zzso DNA, occurring at zzso zzso to zzso higher than would be predicted from their occurrence in normal zzso zzso normal and tumor zzso from the same individual exhibited identical zzso patterns, suggesting that this zzso may be representative of a predisposition toward a variety of zzso rather than indicative of a change in DNA structure at or near this locus as a result of tumor zzso
