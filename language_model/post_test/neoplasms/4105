The human complement zzso system protects an individual against substances of zzso origin, including zzso and microbial zzso Human cells express zzso zzso zzso and zzso thereby zzso attack by zzso a major zzso of zzso Nevertheless, certain zzso cells, particularly those undergoing zzso stress, can activate zzso C, overcoming the regulatory actions of zzso and/or zzso The molecular mechanisms zzso zzso cells are zzso by zzso zzso remain largely zzso We identified a novel gene product that converts human cells into targets for zzso zzso Only zzso cells and cell lines exposed to zzso or zzso stimuli produced this zzso designated zzso which was an zzso zzso zzso Analysis of cloned zzso indicated that this zzso was a zzso protein containing five zzso acids zzso by zzso zzso Its functions were unique in that once zzso from the tumor cells, it bound back to the surface of these cells and activated zzso complement zzso via the alternative pathway, allowing for zzso deposition on the zzso This zzso may offer new insight into innate zzso surveillance of tumor cells by complement is a common feature in the human immune zzso
