The last two decades have witnessed dramatic advances into the mechanisms of drug resistance in zzso The identification of P zzso zzso as a specific mechanism led to the initial hope and expectation that it would be possible to zzso this and increase sensitivity to drug zzso Clinical trials using zzso and second-generation zzso zzso did establish proof of principle that in some settings, clinical drug resistance could be overcome with the addition of a zzso zzso example, clinical resistance to zzso a zzso zzso in women with zzso cancer was shown to be overcome in approximately zzso with the addition of zzso zzso a highly effective zzso zzso However, evolutionary and zzso zzso in resistance mechanisms have tempered clinical results, even with very effective second- and third-generation zzso The lessons from zzso establish sound methodology for the evaluation of zzso zzso for safety, zzso and efficacy in Phase I, II and III clinical zzso This review will focus on some of the zzso clinical trials with earlier and newer zzso zzso either as single agents or in combination with zzso
