zzso A zzso has been associated with zzso as zzso zzso Recently its role in the cell has come under scrutiny for zzso involvement in cancer zzso zzso was originally revealed as a zzso zzso involved in invasion and zzso However, recent studies have also found that under certain conditions, it prevented tumor formation or zzso confusing the precise function of zzso in cancer zzso Here, we try to decipher the role of zzso in cancer and the implications for its dual zzso We propose that differences in zzso zzso of zzso dictate its role in cancer zzso In the zzso zzso functions in various growth signaling zzso such as vascular zzso growth factor, in addition to being involved in cell migration and zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso zzso in these pathways and various others has shown a correlation between high zzso zzso levels and invasive zzso However, an active zzso form of zzso can zzso to the nucleus rather than the zzso and its interaction with zzso factors has been linked to a decrease in zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso has a zzso effect, only when it is localized to the zzso whereas if zzso zzso zzso and the resulting zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus, it acts to suppress tumor growth and inhibit zzso Development of drugs to target zzso and cause zzso and subsequent zzso to the nucleus could be a new and potent field of research in treating zzso
