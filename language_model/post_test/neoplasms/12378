The zzso zzso zzso and zzso are ubiquitous cell zzso If they accumulate excessively within the cells, due either to very high zzso zzso or to deregulation of the systems which control zzso zzso they can induce toxic zzso These molecules are zzso of a class of zzso that includes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and copper containing zzso zzso zzso zzso are high in growing zzso such as zzso zzso zzso are important because they contribute to regulate levels of zzso and zzso These zzso catalyze the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso to generate the reaction products zzso and zzso that are able to induce cell death in several cultured human tumor cell zzso zzso generated by the zzso reaction is able to cross the inner membrane of zzso and directly interact with zzso molecules and structures, inducing an intense zzso zzso Since zzso zzso are involved in many crucial zzso zzso investigations on their involvement in human diseases offer great opportunities to enter novel classes of therapeutic zzso
