A solid phase, zzso zzso zzso zzso competition kit was developed to detect circulating native zzso zzso products in zzso of 151 healthy volunteers and cancer zzso This zzso uses zzso zzso zzso zzso generated against a zzso native zzso zzso zzso Only zzso (1 of zzso of normal control zzso showed strong competition, as compared to zzso (5 of 34) of patients with early stage or no evidence of disease, and zzso zzso of zzso of patients with advanced zzso These differences were statistically significant zzso P less than zzso Eleven zzso samples of cancer patients found to be strong competitors in the zzso competition kit were tested for the presence of zzso zzso by zzso None showed higher zzso values as compared with pooled normal human serum and control zzso It is thus suggested that our procedure detected circulating zzso zzso in zzso of cancer patients mainly with advanced zzso
