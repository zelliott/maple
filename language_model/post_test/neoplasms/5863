The zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso tumor zzso gene 1 zzso tumor zzso genes play important roles in the regulation of the cell zzso The protein products of these two zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, inhibit progression from zzso to S zzso Moreover, zzso has been shown to exert its function through zzso of zzso zzso of zzso Both genes have been found to be zzso or deleted in a wide range of primary human tumors and tumor cell zzso However, the presence of zzso containing zzso elements in every tumor zzso may contribute to the apparent lower deletion detection rate in zzso zzso compared to cell zzso We have developed an zzso zzso that allows us to assess zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso As controls, we used zzso zzso of cell lines with zzso zzso status (four positive and four negative zzso as well as routinely processed nude mouse zzso of two zzso cell zzso zzso cells were characterized by the absence of nuclear zzso whereas zzso zzso was zzso In zzso and normal zzso the level of zzso generally appeared to be zzso We tested 75 random human zzso from 4 different zzso sites for zzso expression and correlated the findings with the zzso presence or absence of zzso Twenty % of tumors selectively lacked zzso while 37% of zzso had zzso zzso In zzso of all zzso both zzso and zzso could be zzso zzso differences existed in the expression of both tumor zzso genes between zzso from different zzso Breast zzso had the highest rate of zzso zzso (13 of zzso Our data show that: zzso zzso may be a suitable zzso to screen for RB and zzso abnormalities in zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso expression occur at a relatively high zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in common human zzso is not mutually zzso zzso loss of function of both tumor zzso genes appears to be a distinctly uncommon zzso and zzso different types of zzso have variable rates of zzso in the zzso zzso
