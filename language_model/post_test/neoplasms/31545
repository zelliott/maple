The objective of this study was to investigate whether functional CT with zzso analysis could be used to demonstrate acute changes associated with zzso zzso analysis yields fractional vascular volume and contrast clearance per unit volume (a measure of zzso Four zzso types zzso zzso breast and zzso were studied zzso and at 1-2 weeks and zzso weeks zzso zzso rises in fractional vascular volume and contrast clearance were shown at 1-2 zzso These zzso were still significantly elevated at zzso weeks zzso In the zzso zzso values were also elevated reflecting a zzso response to zzso Dynamic CT with zzso analysis can be used to measure important zzso zzso which may prove useful in assessing response to therapy of zzso
