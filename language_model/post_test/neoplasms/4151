The present study investigated the ability of zzso collected from cultures of healthy zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso upon brief exposure, zzso zzso zzso in cancer patients' zzso zzso enhanced natural killer zzso and zzso killer zzso zzso zzso zzso contained increased levels of zzso zzso 1, 2, 6, 7 and 12, as well as of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso and zzso necrosis zzso zzso zzso against these zzso significantly reduced the zzso zzso zzso zzso was not inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso class I zzso but was markedly reduced in the presence of zzso against zzso In contrast to zzso zzso derived from cancer patients' zzso exhibited lower levels of the zzso zzso and exerted reduced biological zzso In conclusion, zzso are able to zzso upon short-term zzso zzso zzso from cancer patients' zzso that lyse a variety of zzso targets, including zzso zzso zzso contain high levels of certain zzso that positively influence the induction of zzso zzso zzso Such zzso can be collected easily from healthy donors and stored until use in clinical trials for adoptive cellular therapy of zzso They may also be indicated in the construction of zzso cocktails that have the ability to induce zzso zzso
