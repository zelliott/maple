Classical theories of zzso zzso that the zzso of several zzso zzso is responsible for zzso However, these models do not explain how zzso zzso cause zzso In addition, known zzso rates appear to be insufficient to account for observed cancer zzso Moreover, the current theory doesn't easily account for the long zzso observed in human zzso Proponents of an zzso theory of zzso suggest that zzso instability has a zzso role in zzso In support of this theory, zzso cells frequently display zzso instability while normal cells do zzso Data obtained from a variety of model organisms have revealed that disruption of the cell cycle controls required for zzso results in the acquisition of zzso zzso zzso this zzso instability becomes zzso via zzso zzso and provides a medium for cellular selection and zzso zzso instability allows numerous genetic and zzso zzso to accumulate during zzso without markedly changing zzso until they are zzso or zzso sufficient to be selectively advantageous in the tumor zzso Observations of adaptation in tumor cell populations and application of chaos theory may help zzso the mechanism that drives the enormous genetic zzso observed in tumors and provide insights into the development of new therapeutic cancer interventions and zzso
