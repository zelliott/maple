Evidence is presented for a family of zzso zzso of zzso which we have termed the zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso are zzso zzso that form the major component of the zzso fluid in many zzso zzso We have cloned the entire coding region of human zzso and mapped the gene to zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso In addition, three human zzso zzso were identified on zzso 8, 16, and zzso We have also cloned the mouse zzso zzso and an additional family member, mouse zzso Then, using zzso the mouse zzso gene was localized to zzso 13, and we identified the monkey zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Despite relatively low zzso acid sequence conservation between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso several zzso acids (including four key zzso zzso are strictly zzso and the zzso profiles are remarkably alike, suggesting the possibilities of similar protein zzso and zzso As with fish zzso zzso zzso and zzso contain a signal zzso typical of zzso zzso The zzso were found to be expressed at high levels in several zzso cell lines and in zzso zzso such as brain, heart, and skeletal muscle, as well as several zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso These findings suggest that zzso have several potential roles in a range of cells and zzso
