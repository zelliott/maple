Health disparities and the high prevalence of cardiovascular disease continue to be perplexing worldwide health zzso This study addresses the possibility that genetic differences affecting the biology of the vascular zzso could be a factor contributing to the increased burden of cardiovascular disease and cancer among African Americans zzso compared to Caucasian Americans zzso 

From zzso healthy, 20 to zzso AA zzso zzso zzso and CA zzso zzso 17), we established cultures of blood outgrowth zzso cells zzso and applied zzso zzso zzso have never been exposed to in zzso zzso and their gene expression reflects culture conditions zzso zzso and donor zzso zzso Analysis of zzso identified differential expression of single zzso Gene Set zzso Analysis examined expression of zzso gene sets that survey nine biological systems relevant to zzso zzso 

At the highly stringent threshold of False Discovery Rate zzso zzso 0, 31 single genes were zzso expressed in zzso zzso exhibited the greatest zzso zzso zzso zzso but this was entirely accounted for by a zzso zzso hidden within the zzso probe zzso Among other significantly different genes were: for AA zzso CA, zzso zzso zzso and for AA zzso CA, zzso zzso zzso Many more zzso transcripts for 204 zzso were zzso expressed at the less stringent threshold of zzso zzso Using the biological systems approach, we identified zzso response biology as being significantly different for AA versus CA, showing an apparent zzso increase of expression zzso zzso zzso for zzso genes within that zzso 

Many of the genes implicated here have substantial roles in zzso zzso zzso stress response, a critical regulator of zzso function and vascular zzso may be different between AA and zzso These results potentially have direct implications for the role of zzso cells in vascular disease zzso zzso and cancer (via zzso Also, they are consistent with our zzso hypothesis that genetic influences stemming from ancestral zzso could impact upon zzso cell biology and thereby contribute to disparity of zzso disease burden among zzso The method used here could be zzso employed to bridge the gap between information from structural zzso (for example, disease zzso and cell function and zzso
