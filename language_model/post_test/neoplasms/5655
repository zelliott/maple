The ability to transfer novel genes into zzso cells has allowed us to conceive of novel strategies towards cancer zzso Since the initial zzso clinical trial in 1989, over 300 cancer patients have been enrolled in gene therapy zzso Despite this, an zzso panel concluded that zzso efficacy has not been definitively demonstrated at this time in any gene therapy zzso However, the first 8 years of gene therapy research have provided us with insights regarding the areas that require further scientific zzso For example, it is now clear that while in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells suggest high zzso zzso once these cells are infused in zzso only a small percentage of circulating zzso cells can be zzso While the initial clinical studies have demonstrated that gene transfer in patients can be safe and zzso they have also indicated that future research is necessary towards the development of improved gene transfer techniques for these approaches to be zzso
