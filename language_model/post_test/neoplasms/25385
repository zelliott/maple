A number of changes in zzso components could be demonstrated in zzso of patients with end stage zzso zzso Total and free zzso zzso content of such zzso was shown to be significantly higher than those in zzso of patients with no sign of zzso In addition, a significant increase was found in one of the serum fraction obtained by zzso zzso zzso This increase was shown to be due to an increase in the amount of one of the zzso separated serum components of zzso character as well as to the appearance in zzso of zzso bearing patients of two additional zzso components never detected in non zzso bearing zzso Based on their zzso behavior as well as on observations made in earlier experiments, the zzso nature of the two zzso serum components seemingly characteristic of zzso of zzso bearing patients is highly zzso
