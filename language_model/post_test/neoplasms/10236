Natural killer T zzso cells are a distinct subset of T cells that recognize zzso zzso in the context of zzso zzso There is a considerable body of evidence implicating a role for zzso cells in regulating zzso immunity in zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso for type I zzso zzso We and others have shown that injection of zzso zzso cells leads to clear expansion of zzso cells in zzso in cancer zzso zzso studies suggest the capacity of zzso zzso to enhance zzso zzso zzso and provide the rationale for combination approaches that are now being zzso Recently, we demonstrated the presence of zzso T cells specific for an zzso zzso zzso in patients with advanced zzso These studies suggest that type II zzso cells may play a role in sensing and regulating zzso zzso zzso T cells in cancer may depend on regulating the balance between type I and II zzso cells and holds promise as a broad strategy for immune therapy of several zzso
