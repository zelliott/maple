zzso used to generate local tumor zzso was combined with radiation therapy in a pilot study to determine efficacy and toxicity of this zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso patients were treated at graded doses from zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso administered immediately prior to zzso at zzso degrees C zzso zzso degrees C for one zzso The overall response rate was zzso with a zzso complete response zzso Of those zzso that responded completely and were followed for periods of three to zzso months, there have been no zzso of the zzso treated with the combined zzso The response rate for control unheated zzso in the same patient in the same radiation field was markedly lower zzso overall and no complete zzso Heat treatment alone in the same patients also showed lower response rates zzso overall and zzso zzso with a short response zzso zzso were zzso consisting of one case with long-term zzso zzso It is concluded that this combined zzso of therapy is safe and effective where applied in human superficial tumors and that further development is zzso
