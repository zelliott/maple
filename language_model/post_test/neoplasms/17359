This paper presents a zzso zzso zzso navigation and zzso technique that allows targeting without prior knowledge of the exact architecture of the vessels zzso The zzso active zzso combined with zzso zzso ability to swim following the magnetic field zzso offer new possibilities for the delivery of drugs to zzso Many tumor zzso parameters such as the zzso zzso zzso the zzso blood flow, and the high zzso pressure affect the delivery of zzso drugs to the zzso zzso used as zzso might be helpful in bypassing these limitations while helping to zzso distribute the drug in the targeted zzso Since the zzso network of blood vessels that the tumors recruit is highly zzso and zzso the magnetic control method adopted account for these parameters to achieve zzso We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method using a zzso network offering a complex pattern considered as a worst-case navigation zzso Besides targeted drug delivery to tumor sites using bacterial carrier, zzso of zzso is required for zzso and zzso
