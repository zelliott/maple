Cancer is caused by genetic changes that activate zzso or zzso tumor zzso zzso The repair or zzso of zzso genes may be effective in the treatment of zzso Drugs that target zzso have shown to be effective in the treatment of some zzso However, it is still unclear why the zzso of a single cancer associated gene would ever result in the elimination of tumor zzso In experimental transgenic mouse models the consequences of zzso zzso depend upon the genetic and cellular zzso In some cases, zzso zzso results in the elimination of all or almost all tumor cells through zzso or terminal zzso However, in other cases, zzso zzso results in the apparent loss of the zzso properties of tumor cells, that now appear and behave like normal cells, however, upon zzso zzso rapidly recover their zzso zzso These observations illustrate that zzso zzso can result in a state of tumor zzso zzso when and how zzso zzso zzso sustained tumor zzso will be important towards the development of successful therapeutic strategies for zzso
