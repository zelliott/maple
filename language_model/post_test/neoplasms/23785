To obtain insight in the effect of zzso on the synthesis of acute phase proteins like zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso zzso and C4 and the zzso zzso nine cancer patients who were treated with an isolated limb zzso zzso with high dose zzso zzso zzso were investigated during a zzso period after the end of the zzso zzso of zzso from out of these limbs into the circulation after the zzso induced within 30 zzso to 6 h in all patients elevated serum levels of zzso At the same time zzso protein became zzso in zzso The highest serum levels were obtained at 48 h after zzso The serum levels of the other acute phase proteins zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso rose more slowly and the highest serum levels were found at the third zzso All investigated proteins declined after they had reached their peak zzso zzso of alpha zzso and alpha zzso alpha zzso declined slower than both complement zzso In regard to the zzso levels a nearly continuous increase in the serum level of specifically zzso was zzso This study clearly shows the zzso between zzso and zzso in regard to the synthesis of the different acute phase zzso and zzso also a striking effect on zzso zzso
