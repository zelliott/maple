A zzso zzso system based on a zzso zzso 3 zzso and intended for DNA zzso in zzso pathology is zzso The system has been equipped with a reference channel for correction of zzso light zzso The importance of the adjustment of the zzso for optimal performance of the reference channel is stressed, and a detailed description is zzso An apparatus zzso well below zzso zzso is obtained even during periods of marked instability of the zzso Software for conventional zzso with which about 200 cells can be measured in 20 zzso is zzso In addition a measuring technique where cells are not zzso but are just passed through the zzso light spot is zzso zzso results on zzso specimens of human zzso indicate that this system is at least three times faster than conventional zzso The increased speed of zzso considerably extends the possibilities to evaluate cell proliferation using zzso zzso The measuring capacity of course is dependent upon the quality of the zzso In well prepared zzso specimens 1000 cells have been measured in 35 zzso
