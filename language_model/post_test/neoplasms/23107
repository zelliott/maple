zzso data from experimental and zzso zzso studies were analyzed in attempts to resolve basic questions in zzso from high to low doses and assessing human zzso Four models zzso zzso zzso and zzso were fit to 46 sets of experimental and 4 sets of zzso data by maximizing the likelihood function with a zzso zzso zzso The models were compared as to their zzso in describing the data and analyzed to determine the effect of zzso and breeding category, species, and spontaneous tumor zzso The shapes of the zzso zzso were zzso and errors in risk zzso from linear zzso through the origin were zzso All models were shown to fit the data and to be comparable in zzso The zzso zzso were generally zzso zzso particularly for zzso zzso with one or two orders of magnitude of dose increase required to increase the proportion of tumor zzso from zzso to zzso Linear zzso through the origin generally underestimated the response at low doses, frequently by several orders of zzso The power dependence of tumor zzso on dose was generally found to be of the order of unity, substantially less than assumed in most mathematical zzso
