zzso diagnosis of zzso cells in zzso is hampered by difficulties in the differentiation from zzso zzso zzso Because zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso zzso might complement zzso zzso we determined the power of tumor cell detection using FISH and zzso in 201 zzso from patients with advanced zzso Furthermore, 9 primary breast tumors were zzso and zzso aberrations were compared with those of corresponding zzso zzso zzso By using zzso zzso representing zzso 7, 8, 11, 12, 17, and 18, a rate of zzso zzso combined for the 6 zzso was detected in an overall of zzso of zzso specimens zzso zzso to zzso for the individual zzso comparable to zzso zzso The combination of just 2 FISH zzso zzso representing zzso pairs zzso and zzso was almost equally efficient in the identification of zzso zzso one fourth of the zzso negative zzso were FISH positive and vice zzso From the initially zzso zzso zzso could be subsequently classified positive with zzso FISH by zzso of zzso zzso complexity in rare zzso zzso Thus, zzso FISH zzso including zzso zzso identified tumor cells in significantly more zzso zzso P zzso zzso than conventional zzso zzso greater zzso Finally, our finding that zzso aberration patterns in primary breast tumors and corresponding zzso zzso are comparable indicates that FISH examination of primary tumors will indicate the zzso zzso best suited for an efficient search for zzso in the individual zzso
