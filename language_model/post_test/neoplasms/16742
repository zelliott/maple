We have examined the responsiveness to in zzso stimulation with high-dose zzso zzso zzso of peripheral blood zzso zzso collected from normal donors, or from successive daily zzso of cancer patients with a range of advanced zzso following 5 days of continuous infusion with zzso in zzso zzso donor zzso showed a transient release of tumor necrosis factor zzso (up to 400 zzso during the first day, while factors including zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso and soluble zzso showed a gradual increase to modest levels (at zzso during the 4 day incubation with zzso In contrast, the cancer patients' zzso after 5 days of zzso zzso in zzso responded with one of two patterns of production of zzso In pattern I, exposure to the zzso resulted in a transient release of zzso during the first 48 zzso The level of zzso released showed a progressive increase from zzso harvested from the first zzso (up to 50 zzso of zzso through the fourth zzso (up to 2,000 zzso of zzso Additionally, pattern I zzso showed significant levels of production of zzso soluble zzso zzso and soluble zzso In pattern II, the patients' zzso from each zzso released only low levels of zzso (less than 300 zzso and minimal levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso A pattern I response is considered to be consistent with an zzso role for zzso which zzso a cooperative interaction of zzso and zzso that is zzso by other zzso while pattern II may reflect an zzso in these zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
