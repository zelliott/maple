zzso antinuclear zzso zzso are well known to accompany various pathological conditions and can be artificially induced by zzso Research and clinical data permit us to zzso a zzso connection between cancer and zzso Based on the available data, my group's research suggested that zzso zzso may be used as zzso zzso Among these zzso zzso zzso may be particularly zzso Advances in cancer zzso with zzso zzso zzso the role of zzso immunity in zzso zzso The development of a universal zzso targeting diverse zzso is of clear zzso We showed that certain natural zzso recognize the surface of numerous tumor cells but not normal cells via cell zzso zzso originating from the zzso dying neighboring tumor cells, mediate zzso cellular zzso of tumor cells in zzso and inhibit the development of zzso tumor in zzso zzso A single zzso antinuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically recognizes multiple unrelated human tumor cell lines and accumulates at a high zzso cell ratio in various human tumors in nude zzso zzso with zzso zzso resulted in significant suppression of the growth of several human zzso In addition, zzso zzso when used in zzso zzso can serve as a highly efficient specific zzso to target various zzso or diagnostic zzso pharmaceutical zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso to various zzso Here, the data zzso predominantly in our laboratory over several zzso on zzso zzso tumor targeting of zzso agents is zzso
