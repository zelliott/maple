zzso processes of tissue growth lead to production of new zzso cells, and other material particles at the microscopic zzso At the zzso level, growth is marked by the change of the tissue shape and zzso In addition, the appearance of the new material particles is generally accompanied by deformation and, consequently, stresses in the surrounding zzso Built upon a microscopic zzso model mimicking the mechanical processes of mass supply, a simple zzso theory of tissue growth is used in the present work for explaining residual stresses in arteries and studying stresses around growing solid zzso zzso It is zzso in particular, that the uniform zzso growth can lead to zzso of residual stresses in arteries because of the material zzso This can be a complementary source of residual stresses in arteries as compared to the stresses induced by zzso tissue zzso It is argued that the quantitative assessment of the residual stresses based on in zzso experiments may not be reliable because of the essential stress zzso in the tissue samples under the cutting zzso zzso the problem of tumor growth, it is shown that the zzso zzso or tumor evolution depends on elastic properties of surrounding zzso In good qualitative agreement with the experimental in zzso observations on growing zzso zzso zzso simulations confirm that stiff hosting zzso can inhibit tumor zzso
