To examine the effect of socioeconomic status zzso on mortality in patients with zzso and the underlying factors that may mediate differences in zzso 

We conducted a zzso cohort study in two Danish zzso All patients 30 to 65 years of age with first time zzso from 2000 through 2008 were identified in a zzso zzso zzso database zzso zzso zzso zzso data on patients' zzso zzso level and personal income) and zzso conditions were obtained from public and medical zzso We used Cox zzso to examine mortality within 30 days after zzso with and without cumulative adjustment for potential zzso 

zzso patients of low zzso were more likely to live alone and be unmarried than patients of high zzso They also had more pre-existing zzso more substance abuse, more zzso zzso and zzso infections, and more admissions to small zzso zzso Overall, zzso patients zzso died within 30 days of zzso Patients of low zzso had consistently higher mortality after zzso than those of high zzso crude hazard ratio for low zzso high education, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso crude hazard ratio for low-income zzso high-income zzso zzso zzso zzso Adjustment for differences in social support, pre-existing zzso substance abuse, place of acquisition of the infection, and microbial agent substantially attenuated the effect of zzso on mortality zzso hazard ratio for low zzso high education, zzso zzso zzso zzso adjusted hazard ratio for low-income zzso high-income zzso zzso zzso zzso Further adjustment for characteristics of the admitting hospital had minimal effect on observed mortality zzso 

Low zzso was strongly associated with increased 30-day mortality after zzso Less social support, more pre-existing zzso more substance abuse, and differences in place of acquisition and agent of infection appeared to mediate much of the observed disparities in zzso
