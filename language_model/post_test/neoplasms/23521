The present study measured eight zzso zzso zzso 47, 99, 100, zzso zzso zzso and zzso exposure via zzso of indoor dust and soil, zzso and food zzso Contributions to zzso exposure from different media revealed that indoor dust zzso suspended in zzso was not an important exposure route for zzso zzso for adults in Shenzhen, zzso Food consumption contributed more to daily intake of zzso especially for zzso zzso zzso Based on calculated average total daily zzso hazard zzso were determined to estimate the zzso risks of zzso zzso Meanwhile, cancer risk was also estimated assuming that the oral cancer slope factors of all zzso zzso are zzso as zzso The hazard zzso ranged from zzso zzso to zzso zzso suggesting a low deleterious risk with regard to zzso The cancer risk value ranged from zzso to zzso zzso that the total risks due to exposure to zzso via all exposure routes are extremely low for zzso
