Cancer cells silence zzso tumor zzso genes by zzso two-hit mechanism in which zzso zzso and then loss of zzso occur at the tumor zzso gene zzso However, the identification of zzso tumor zzso genes has challenged the traditional theory of zzso zzso in tumor zzso zzso introducing the novel concept that a single genetic hit can cause loss of tumor zzso zzso The mechanism through which these genes are silenced in human cancer is zzso but zzso the details will greatly enhance our understanding of the zzso of human zzso Here, we review the identification of zzso tumor zzso genes and discuss the potential mechanisms of their zzso In addition, we also discuss how the identification of zzso tumor zzso genes can potentially lead to new approaches in cancer zzso
