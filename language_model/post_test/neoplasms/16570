Although fatigue is a common symptom among cancer patients, it is also a common experience in the general, healthy zzso Its zzso has made it difficult to appreciate whether the fatigue experienced by patients with cancer is distinguishable from the fatigue experienced by the general zzso Because the zzso of fatigue is zzso it also has been difficult to appreciate fully the relative contribution of anemia to zzso zzso 

To address this issue, responses to a brief, standardized set of 13 questions from the zzso Assessment of zzso Illness zzso zzso zzso System were compared across three groups: anemic cancer patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer patients zzso zzso 113 zzso and the general United States population zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso scores of the anemic cancer patients (at both baseline and upon completion of anemia zzso were significantly worse compared with the scores of zzso cancer patients that, in turn, were worse compared with the scores of the general United States population zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were quite distinct for these three zzso Within the group of anemic cancer patients, the degree of anemia zzso moderate, or zzso also was zzso of the degree of fatigue zzso zzso zzso although the zzso were not dramatically zzso 

Although anemia is clearly a factor that contributes to the severity of zzso fatigue among cancer patients, zzso levels explain only part of the difference compared with fatigue among the general United States zzso The distinct zzso of fatigue scores of anemic cancer patients compared with the general United States population and the substantial sample sizes of these two groups enabled a zzso analysis approach that allowed the differentiation of anemic cancer patients from the general population with high sensitivity zzso and reasonable specificity zzso Thus, although fatigue is a symptom most anyone can relate to, the fatigue of cancer patients, particularly those who are zzso is decidedly zzso zzso targeting this common and zzso symptom likely would be of considerable value to patients with zzso
