The hormone zzso stimulates acid zzso by gastric zzso cells and acts as a growth factor for the gastric zzso zzso receptors with zzso zzso of approximately zzso zzso have been detected on isolated gastric zzso cells, and on some cell lines derived from colon zzso We now report that zzso is also bound by five cell lines derived from human gastric zzso but that the affinities of these lines for zzso range from zzso to zzso zzso zzso binds to the cell line zzso with an affinity similar to zzso while shorter zzso zzso bind with reduced zzso zzso of zzso is unaffected by zzso zzso or a number of other hormones with the exception of insulin which zzso binding with an zzso value of zzso zzso The ability to bind zzso with affinities in the zzso range appears to be a property widespread among other tumor cell zzso
