Unexpected zzso admissions may result from early or premature discharge from the zzso We sought to determine the zzso clinical zzso and outcomes of patients admitted to the zzso after actual or planned hospital discharge and to analyze whether the need for zzso admission was related or unrelated to the associated zzso 

We zzso reviewed all adult zzso admissions between January 2004 and December 2006 at a zzso care cancer center and identified the following two groups of zzso those patients admitted directly to the zzso within 48 h of actual hospital discharge zzso zzso and those patients admitted to the zzso within 48 h of planned hospital discharge zzso zzso 

Of zzso patients discharged from the hospital during the study period, 826 patients zzso required zzso to the hospital within 48 h of zzso of these, 13 patients zzso were admitted directly to the zzso zzso zzso An additional 12 patients were admitted to the zzso within 48 h of a planned hospital discharge zzso zzso The majority of these 25 patients zzso zzso A and zzso required zzso admission for a condition that was related to the previous or current zzso The overall hospital mortality rate for both groups was zzso 

A small, but unique group of patients is admitted to the zzso within 48 h of actual or planned hospital zzso zzso of the underlying condition that necessitated the previous or current hospitalization often is the reason for zzso zzso Whether zzso admission could have been prevented by continued hospital care or improved diagnostic evaluation during the prior or current hospitalization requires further zzso
