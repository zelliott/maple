zzso levels of cell cycle inhibitor zzso due to excessive degradation occur in a variety of aggressive human zzso Since reduced zzso expression has been associated with a poor prognosis in many human zzso and resistance to certain zzso therapies, zzso of zzso expression could improve prognosis and prevent excessive cell zzso zzso is one of the major zzso zzso zzso responsible for degradation of zzso zzso of zzso also requires a small zzso zzso zzso which zzso zzso recruitment by bridging the interaction between zzso and zzso It has been shown previously that a direct interaction between zzso and zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso interaction may represent an attractive target for pharmacological zzso Here we describe a zzso zzso zzso for discovering zzso zzso of the zzso zzso interaction in zzso Two compounds zzso and zzso were identified and validated through a zzso relationship zzso Both compounds were also shown to inhibit zzso zzso in zzso These studies demonstrate that disruption of the zzso interaction provides a viable strategy to prevent zzso zzso and may potentially be useful for the control of excessive degradation of this cell cycle inhibitor in tumor zzso
