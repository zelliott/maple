zzso zzso imaging can predict outcomes in cardiac zzso However, limited data exist regarding its prediction of cardiovascular outcomes in cancer zzso We sought to determine whether zzso zzso imaging predicts long-term cardiovascular outcomes in cancer zzso performed a retrospective review of 787 consecutive patients at our institution who underwent zzso zzso imaging from January 2001 through March zzso The Cox zzso hazard model was applied, and total cardiac events, cardiac death, and zzso death were determined for 3 zzso We considered P zzso to be statistically zzso with abnormal zzso zzso imaging results were more likely to be male and older, with heart disease, more vascular risk factors, and lower left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso than patients with normal zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso of total cardiac events included age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso and abnormal zzso zzso imaging zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of cardiac death included age zzso zzso zzso and left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso death were age zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and smoking zzso zzso zzso survival was improved when patients took aspirin zzso zzso zzso and upon each unit increase in left zzso ejection fraction zzso zzso zzso imaging in cancer patients can predict zzso cardiac zzso zzso age, zzso zzso and smoking were associated with worse zzso whereas higher left zzso ejection fraction and the taking of aspirin were zzso
