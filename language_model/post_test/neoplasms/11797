A zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso and its zzso zzso were studied for zzso production and also for zzso zzso When zzso cells were cultured in a medium containing zzso fetal calf serum, the culture zzso exhibited potent zzso 1 zzso activity (also termed zzso zzso zzso activity produced in zzso cultures was predominantly of a zzso species zzso zzso zzso but in zzso cultures zzso with zzso zzso zzso a major zzso activity was associated with a zzso of zzso in molecular zzso The zzso cell line was zzso in normal female, zzso zzso zzso mice but produced progressively growing tumors in animals that had been zzso by zzso zzso zzso and treatment with zzso zzso zzso with zzso failed to produce tumors in zzso nude mice, and the zzso of nude mice that rejected zzso zzso contained significant levels of a zzso cell zzso zzso a zzso and zzso zzso of zzso produced very little zzso but instead produced a potent zzso factor in zzso The zzso cell line was highly zzso in zzso zzso zzso These results indicated a direct association between zzso and the type of zzso produced by these zzso zzso cell zzso
