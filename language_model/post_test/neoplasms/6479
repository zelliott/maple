zzso the phenomenon of premature zzso zzso zzso studies were carried out on zzso zzso of zzso cells from 52 zzso zzso obtained from 45 patients presenting with various solid zzso A highly individual pattern of distribution of the various zzso stages was zzso reflecting the zzso of human solid tumors in an advanced zzso zzso a variety of clinical, zzso and technical factors were examined for their possible influence on these zzso zzso The duration in culture was one of the influencing factors, as were the time zzso between the first diagnosis and the sampling of the respective zzso or the nature of zzso zzso zzso zzso of gene amplification, as represented by zzso zzso could be found in the prematurely zzso zzso of 35 of the 52 zzso zzso proved to be most reliable with regard to screening of double zzso In addition, an adequate quality of zzso zzso was achieved in zzso of 21 out of 24 zzso yielding a sufficient number of zzso zzso In six of these 21 cases zzso was superior to zzso analysis in obtaining zzso while the same was true for 14 of the 52 zzso screened for double zzso Thus the zzso technique was shown to be an indispensable additional source of zzso information in cells of human solid zzso
