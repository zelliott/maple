zzso shrinkage is a common end point used in screening new zzso zzso The standard World Health Organization criterion for partial response is a 50% or more decrease in the sum of the products of two zzso (the maximum diameter of a tumor and the largest diameter perpendicular to this maximum zzso of individual zzso However, zzso the simple sum of the maximum diameters of individual tumors is more zzso related to cell kill than is the sum of the zzso zzso It has been hypothesized that the calculation of zzso products is unnecessary, and a zzso decrease in the sum of maximum diameters of individual tumors zzso zzso shape and zzso to a 50% reduction in the sum of the zzso zzso was proposed as a new zzso We have applied the standard response and the new response criteria to the same data to determine whether the same number of responses in the same patients would zzso 

Data from zzso patients included in eight studies of a variety of zzso were zzso The two response criteria were separately applied, and the results were compared using the zzso zzso The importance of zzso zzso and the frequency of zzso tumors were also zzso In addition, for a subset of 128 patients, a zzso criterion for disease progression zzso increase in the sum of maximum zzso was applied and compared with the standard definition of a zzso increase in the sum of the zzso zzso 

zzso between the zzso and zzso criteria was generally found to be zzso The zzso statistic for zzso for overall response was zzso 

We conclude that one zzso measurement of tumor maximum diameter may be sufficient to assess change in solid zzso
