Active specific zzso for cancer often requires the use of zzso or zzso zzso cells as zzso zzso zzso were obtained for such a zzso However, zzso of viable cell yield from zzso fresh zzso mass was difficult, and initially there did not appear to be a direct relationship between zzso zzso mass and viable cells obtained after zzso We therefore zzso all of zzso zzso specimens processed to attempt to discern such a zzso Of these 137 were melanoma, 14 were zzso 48 were zzso 59 were zzso cell zzso and 35 were classified as zzso A positive correlation was found between zzso zzso mass and viable cell yield, with zzso correlation values varying from r zzso zzso zzso to r zzso zzso zzso For all zzso the zzso correlation was r zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Not surprisingly, the most frequent site of removal associated with bacterial contamination was zzso In conclusion, this study provides useful zzso for predicting viable zzso cell yield from zzso zzso mass of given zzso
