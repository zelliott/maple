DNA zzso provide rich profiles that are used in cancer prediction considering the gene expression levels across a collection of related zzso Support zzso Machines zzso have been applied to the zzso of cancer samples with encouraging zzso However, they rely on zzso distances that fail to reflect accurately the zzso among sample zzso Then, zzso zzso provide additional information that should be considered to reduce the zzso zzso In this paper, we incorporate in the zzso zzso a linear combination of zzso zzso The weights of the combination are zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso This approach allows us to incorporate a smoothing term that penalizes the complexity of the family of distances and avoids zzso The experimental results suggest that the method proposed helps to reduce the zzso errors in several human cancer zzso
