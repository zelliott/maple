A recently described zzso zzso of zzso has been shown to zzso zzso potential to zzso rat pancreatic zzso and zzso cell zzso Using zzso raised against a bacterial fusion protein zzso by zzso zzso zzso we have explored the expression of zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cells and zzso in zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells express barely zzso low levels of zzso zzso zzso while T zzso upon zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso expression of specific zzso zzso zzso The reaction pattern of various zzso indicates that these zzso zzso contain the domain zzso by zzso zzso which is part of the zzso that in the rat zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso of zzso was also found in several aggressive, but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso In human zzso zzso we also observed strong zzso of zzso zzso zzso in all invasive zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, focal expression was already observed in zzso zzso expression being related to areas of zzso The findings establish zzso zzso as tumor progression markers in zzso zzso
