In case of zzso exposure to a substance, its concentration in cells is likely to be zzso Assessing the consequences of this zzso in zzso risk assessment requires the zzso of zzso dynamics models describing zzso zzso with microscopic tools designed to simulate zzso In this article, we propose an approach to approximate zzso cell concentration of zzso in the cells of diverse zzso We adapted the dynamics equations of a zzso based zzso zzso model and used a zzso simulator for the system of equations that we zzso We then coupled zzso simulations with a deterministic hockey stick model of zzso zzso induced substantial modifications relative to zzso curve, compared with the deterministic zzso In particular, there was zzso in the response and the zzso apparent threshold was lower than the deterministic zzso The approach that we developed could easily be extended to other biological studies to assess the influence of zzso at zzso scale for compound dynamics at the cell zzso
