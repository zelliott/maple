zzso in zzso regimens have significantly enhanced patient and graft survival in zzso transplant zzso However, zzso to zzso disorders is increased as a consequence of prolonged zzso Available data pertaining to cancer risks in zzso transplant recipients have been inconsistent, and much of it is derived from international studies, which may not be truly representative of the United States zzso 

We studied a total of 1979 transplants performed in zzso patients from a single center in the United States with a mean follow-up of zzso years, and a total of zzso zzso zzso 

The mean age at the time of diagnosis of cancer was 50 years, and the mean zzso between transplant and diagnosis of cancer was 95 zzso Older patients receiving a transplant had a significantly higher risk for developing cancer as opposed to younger patients zzso zzso for zzso years compared with zzso zzso When compared with the general population using data from the zzso zzso and End zzso zzso registry, the overall risk for zzso zzso was modestly increased in our transplant recipients, with a standardized zzso ratio zzso of zzso zzso zzso When zzso by age groups, younger age at transplant zzso zzso had the highest zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso Similarly, duration zzso zzso years had an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We believe that this study is representative of the United States' zzso transplant population, and highlights the need for reduced zzso in the long-term and increased vigilance for zzso in younger patients receiving zzso zzso
