As highlighted by other articles in this review issue, great progress has been made in the development of targeted treatment zzso directed against particular zzso zzso and the translation of these therapies into the zzso However, recent data from cancer zzso sequencing projects indicate that the spectrum of zzso that contribute to cancer progression is wider than previously zzso and as international projects in this area gather momentum, it appears likely that further zzso zzso will be identified, and the roles of previously characterized ones will be extended to zzso of additional zzso In addition, complementary approaches such as functional zzso and mass zzso zzso zzso are providing important insights into the functional roles played by specific zzso in particular zzso the dependency of these roles on genetic background, how altered zzso regulation zzso zzso signaling networks, and how the latter respond to targeted agents that target the zzso in zzso While other articles in this issue focus on individual zzso zzso and their therapeutic zzso the aim of this review is to take a broader perspective regarding our current knowledge of the cancer zzso and how this can be expanded and exploited for clinical zzso
