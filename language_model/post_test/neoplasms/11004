Here, we present a unifying hypothesis about how zzso zzso transcribed zzso and long zzso zzso zzso to each other using zzso response elements zzso as letters of a new zzso We propose that this zzso zzso zzso zzso activity forms a large-scale regulatory network across the zzso greatly expanding the functional genetic information in the human zzso and playing important roles in pathological conditions, such as zzso
