zzso zzso zzso is a chemical probe inhibitor of zzso activity, which was identified from the National Cancer Institute chemical libraries by using zzso virtual screening with a computer model of the zzso zzso domain bound to its zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex formation and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso growth and zzso zzso zzso in tumor cells that contain persistently activated zzso zzso zzso and active zzso and zzso zzso domain rescue tumor cells from zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso the expression of the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso the growth of human breast tumors in zzso These findings strongly suggest that the zzso activity of zzso is zzso in part through zzso of zzso zzso zzso and provide the zzso for the potential clinical use of zzso zzso such as zzso in tumors harboring zzso zzso
