This study was designed to determine the correlation between the rise of tumor temperature during zzso treatment and the blood flow of the tumors measured by dynamic CT zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this report, we observed 20 patients with zzso tumors which underwent zzso zzso In each case, the temperature of the tumor was monitored with a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were applied before the zzso zzso During the zzso the tumor blood flow of each tumor was estimated by by analyzing the zzso activity curve after a zzso zzso During the zzso zzso zzso the tumor blood flow was estimated by the zzso zzso The value of the tumor blood flow estimated by zzso were zzso to those calculated by the zzso zzso zzso These values were zzso zzso to the rise of the temperature of the tumors during zzso zzso Our results imply that zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso can be used for the prediction of the tumor temperature rise during the zzso zzso
