Numerous studies have demonstrated the presence of cancer stem cells zzso within solid zzso Although the precursor of these cells is not clearly established, recent studies suggest that the zzso of zzso may be quite plastic and associated with the zzso transition zzso In patients, the presence of zzso and zzso has been implicated in increased resistance to zzso zzso a negative zzso factor for treatment success, is a potent driver of a multitude of molecular zzso pathways that allow cells to survive and thrive in the hostile tumor zzso and can induce zzso zzso also provides tumor cells with cues for maintenance of a zzso state and may help to drive the linkage between zzso and zzso zzso the biology of zzso the zzso zzso and their implications in therapeutic zzso may provide crucial new approaches in the development of improved therapeutic zzso
