Cancer zzso is a complex syndrome characterized primarily by diminished zzso intake and progressive tissue depletion that is manifest clinically as anorexia and host weight zzso The gradual loss of host protein stores is central to this zzso This review outlines the techniques that have been used to evaluate human zzso acid zzso their application in patients with cancer zzso and possible therapeutic interventions designed to overcome zzso in host protein and zzso acid metabolism associated with zzso zzso The techniques of nitrogen balance and zzso zzso provide indirect estimates of overall nitrogen metabolism and skeletal muscle zzso protein zzso zzso of circulating zzso acid zzso particularly when combined with assessment of zzso differences and regional zzso acid balance allows for investigation of zzso zzso acid zzso One of the most significant advances in in zzso zzso acid zzso research has been the development of labeled zzso acid zzso studies to evaluate whole body and regional zzso acid zzso The use of stable and unstable zzso acid zzso in these techniques is reviewed in zzso Virtually all of these techniques have now been employed in the evaluation of human cancer zzso The results of studies evaluating zzso acid zzso regional zzso acid balance, and zzso zzso are zzso The use of regional and whole body kinetic studies in cancer zzso are reviewed zzso Most investigators have observed increased rates of whole body protein zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso cancer zzso Some studies have suggested a relationship between the extent of disease and the degree of aberration in zzso acid kinetic zzso Investigators have attempted to reverse some of these zzso by provision of zzso zzso zzso or administration of specific zzso or anabolic agents such as zzso zzso insulin, growth hormone, and zzso zzso The role of total zzso nutrition zzso in cancer and its effects on protein and zzso acid zzso and tumor growth are zzso The possible benefits of specific zzso acid nutritional zzso with increased zzso chain zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso Although many of these approaches appear promising, significant impact on clinically zzso parameters remains to be zzso A better understanding of the underlying protein zzso mechanisms of cancer zzso will likely lead to more effective therapies to reverse the protein calorie zzso associated with cancer zzso
