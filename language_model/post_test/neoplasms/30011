zzso skins have wide variety of biologically active compounds associated with the natural defenses of these zzso 

To study the in zzso zzso activity of methanol extracts of the skin of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The extract was obtained by cold methanol extraction for 96 h using dried skins zzso zzso The methanol skin extract was dried under reduced pressure, giving a zzso zzso In order to test for zzso activity, in zzso tests were performed with the following cancer cell lines using zzso ranging between zzso zzso of the extract by 48 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The methanol extract of zzso zzso produced a growth zzso in a zzso manner against the most of the zzso cell zzso In addition to the growth zzso the extract induced the cell death in the zzso and colon lines zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), demonstrating zzso of zzso with zzso zzso However, prostate and leukemia cell lines demonstrated less sensitivity, with zzso of 24 and 235 zzso zzso This is the first report about the zzso activity by natural products from the skin of zzso zzso 

The methanol extracts of zzso zzso significantly affected the growth of several cell lines, demonstrating that these compounds are a potential source of substances that could be zzso in cancer zzso
