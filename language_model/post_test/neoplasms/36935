zzso radiation therapy zzso allows one to achieve a better zzso of the high-dose region to the prescribed tumor target volume than uniform beam therapy, especially in complex treatment zzso Still, perfect zzso is zzso Hence the goal of zzso zzso planning or inverse planning is to find the beam profiles that yield the optimum among the physically achievable treatment zzso The principal physical advantage of zzso is best exploited if the zzso is driven by physical zzso This article presents an overview of such physical, yet clinically relevant, criteria along with zzso zzso that take these criteria into zzso zzso computer zzso are zzso which allow one to perform the zzso in an interactive manner within a few zzso The application of these methods to some complex clinical example cases is zzso and the results are compared with uniform beam treatment plans and with biologically zzso zzso
