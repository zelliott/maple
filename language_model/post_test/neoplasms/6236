Most protein coding genes generate multiple zzso transcripts through alternative zzso variable 3' and zzso and zzso zzso Although drug design typically targets the main transcript, alternative transcripts can have profound zzso effects, zzso proteins with distinct functions or regulatory zzso zzso of these alternative transcripts is zzso and zzso creating opportunities for more effective and targeted therapies with reduced adverse zzso Moreover, genetic variation can tilt the balance of alternative versus zzso transcripts or generate zzso transcripts that contribute to disease zzso In addition, environmental factors and drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso new opportunities for the treatment of zzso zzso For example, therapies targeting specific zzso transcripts with zzso zzso that correct zzso zzso are already in clinical trials for genetic disorders such as zzso muscular zzso zzso sequencing technologies facilitate discovery of novel zzso transcripts and protein zzso applications ranging from zzso disorders to zzso Consideration of a zzso transcript diversity should become an integral part of drug design, development, and zzso
