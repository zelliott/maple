zzso or zzso designs are commonly used in phase II cancer clinical zzso These designs possess good zzso properties and allow early termination of the trial when the interim data indicate that the experimental regimen is zzso The rigid study design, however, can be difficult to follow exactly because the response has to be evaluated at zzso fixed number of zzso 

Our goal is to develop an efficient and flexible design that possesses desirable statistical zzso 

A flexible design based on zzso zzso probability and the zzso criterion is zzso A three-dimensional search zzso is implemented to determine the design zzso 

The new design controls type I and type II error rates, and allows continuous monitoring of the trial zzso zzso under the zzso hypothesis when the experimental treatment is not zzso the design is more efficient in stopping the trial earlier, which results in a smaller expected sample zzso zzso zzso and simulation studies demonstrate that the zzso probability design possesses good operating zzso 

The zzso probability design is more zzso intensive than two- or zzso zzso Similar to all designs with early stopping due to zzso the resulting estimate of treatment efficacy may be zzso 

The zzso probability design is efficient and remains robust in controlling type I and type II error rates when the trial conduct deviates from the original zzso It is more adaptable than traditional zzso designs in evaluating the study outcome, zzso it is easier to zzso zzso programs are provided to assist the study zzso
