zzso are zzso binding proteins with versatile functions in tumor zzso zzso zzso by zzso has been associated with zzso and zzso We previously reported on regulation of zzso expression during zzso cell zzso Here, we show increased zzso protein levels in the zzso of different tumors, including zzso of the zzso liver, breast and zzso zzso cells were found to express five zzso zzso zzso two of which have not been reported zzso zzso was found to be confined to zzso 5, 6 and zzso zzso of human zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso a specific zzso zzso zzso induced a small but significant increase of zzso while migration was not affected by any zzso zzso zzso Application of zzso zzso protein zzso reduced proliferation and migration of zzso as well as human zzso vein zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso and migration of human zzso vein zzso cell zzso towards a zzso zzso were zzso Interestingly, zzso was found to induce a small zzso effect on zzso in zzso zzso these data show that zzso cells regulate the expression and zzso of zzso during zzso The function of the dominant zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cell biology depends on the concentration and environmental context in which it is presented to the zzso
