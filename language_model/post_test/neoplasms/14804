During tumor development, cells acquire multiple zzso changes upon zzso of zzso and tumor zzso zzso zzso was originally identified as an zzso zzso for the zzso complex that regulates zzso zzso Here, we present evidence that zzso plays a crucial role in various cellular processes and zzso zzso of zzso affects not only zzso contacts but also proliferation in both zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso significantly suppresses proliferation of transformed zzso zzso zzso of zzso is correlated to the proliferation rate in human zzso and is highly zzso in human colon and gastric zzso Moreover, we identify zzso zzso factor zzso an zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso By using zzso zzso we have determined various specific zzso zzso zzso proteins that are involved in several zzso zzso zzso affects the ability of zzso to bind these zzso and expression of zzso short hairpin zzso or a zzso zzso zzso significantly suppresses proliferation of zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso is an important regulator of cell proliferation and that zzso may be an zzso and a potential molecular target for cancer zzso
