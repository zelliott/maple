Rapid and effective differentiation between normal and cancer cells is an important challenge for the diagnosis and treatment of zzso Here, we describe an zzso system for identification of normal and cancer cells based on a zzso zzso approach that exploits subtle changes in the zzso nature of different cell zzso Their differential interactions with zzso zzso are zzso through displacement of a zzso zzso zzso that is zzso when bound to the particle and fluorescent after zzso Using this sensing strategy we can rapidly zzso and effectively distinguish zzso different cell zzso zzso normal, zzso and zzso human breast zzso and zzso zzso normal, zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso
