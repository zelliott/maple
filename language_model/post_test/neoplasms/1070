zzso of the cell cycle has long been recognized as an essential driver of zzso and agents that selectively target key cell cycle components continue to hold promise as potential zzso We have developed zzso a zzso zzso as a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, and 9 zzso 16, 6, and 20 zzso zzso In zzso zzso showed significant zzso activity in human tumor cell lines zzso range, zzso zzso causing zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso II zzso domain and blocking cell cycling at zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso when orally administered at either 50 zzso twice daily or 75 zzso once daily, zzso inhibited human tumor zzso growth zzso percentage tumor growth zzso range, zzso P zzso zzso In zzso zzso reduced the proportion of actively cycling zzso Further zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso doses of zzso zzso tumor growth zzso maintained suppression of zzso such as zzso for up to 16 hours following a single oral zzso A comparison of different schedules indicated that chronic daily oral dosing provided optimal cover to ensure zzso zzso These data indicate that broad zzso zzso may provide an effective method to impair the zzso cell cycle that drives zzso and zzso has the zzso profile that provides an ideal probe to test this zzso
