The objective was to determine whether zzso as compared to zzso injection of zzso and zzso produce differential plasma levels and zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer patients received zzso and zzso injections of zzso 8 and 16 zzso within a zzso twin crossover zzso zzso patients received zzso or zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso resulted in peak plasma levels zzso times zzso less than zzso those observed following zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in peak levels zzso times zzso less than zzso those following zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in an area under the drug zzso zzso to 4 zzso curve zzso times zzso the area observed following zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in an area under the drug zzso zzso to 4 zzso curve zzso times zzso less zzso the area observed following zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso provided greater zzso P less than zzso pain relief than zzso zzso If more rapid and enhanced analgesia is zzso then the zzso site may be preferable over the zzso site for standard doses of zzso and other zzso soluble zzso In addition, the relative potency of compounds of widely differing zzso zzso may depend upon the site of intramuscular zzso
