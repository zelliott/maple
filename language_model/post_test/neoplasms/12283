zzso zzso produced in the zzso metabolism of ethanol can be potentially toxic and zzso The zzso activity of a suicide gene system using zzso delivered alcohol zzso zzso to convert ethanol to zzso inside cancer cells has been investigated in zzso and in zzso In zzso experiments confirmed the toxicity of zzso to a number of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso cells grown in normal media increased by Day 4 to zzso of their starting number, while those exposed to 250 zzso 500 zzso and 1 zzso zzso reached zzso 30 and zzso zzso zzso cells appeared to be less sensitive with zzso cells and zzso cells zzso 105 and zzso of their starting number by Day 4 with 1 zzso zzso After zzso with an zzso containing the human zzso beta 2 zzso zzso cells exposed to 20 zzso ethanol had a reduction in number to zzso by Day 2 and to zzso by Day zzso In a zzso model with zzso zzso cells, mice exposed to daily zzso of ethanol for 5 days formed zzso only zzso on Day 6 and zzso on Day 13 of the volume of those in mice exposed to zzso The ability of this easily administered suicide gene system to produce significant effects on cell proliferation in zzso suggests that further zzso development is zzso
