zzso zzso is a naturally occurring steroid zzso in the adrenal cortex, zzso brain, and gastrointestinal zzso and it is known to have zzso and zzso actions on zzso These effects are considered to be induced by the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study was undertaken to investigate whether zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have zzso effects on cancer cells and to clarify which zzso zzso or zzso is responsible for growth zzso Growth of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso incorporation zzso was zzso and zzso inhibited by addition of all zzso steroids we zzso In particular, the growth zzso due to zzso was considerably greater than that caused by zzso in all cell zzso The suppression of growth of the incubated steroids was not correlated with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The addition of zzso or zzso to the medium did not overcome the zzso of growth induced by zzso or zzso while growth suppression by zzso was partially prevented by the addition of zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso also have an zzso action that is not induced by zzso zzso or zzso activity zzso These zzso zzso zzso may serve as zzso or zzso zzso
