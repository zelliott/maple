Gene selection is an important step when building zzso of disease state based on gene expression zzso Gene selection generally improves performance and identifies a relevant subset of zzso Many zzso and zzso gene selection approaches have been zzso Frequently the claim is made that genes are zzso zzso to zzso zzso and that zzso approaches are therefore per definition more desirable than zzso selection zzso Based on the published performances of all these approaches a fair comparison of the available results can not be zzso This mainly stems from two zzso First, the results are often zzso since the validation set is in one way or another involved in training the zzso resulting in zzso biased performance zzso Second, the published results are often based on a small number of relatively simple zzso zzso no generally zzso conclusions can be zzso 

In this study we adopted an unbiased protocol to perform a fair comparison of frequently used zzso and zzso gene selection techniques, in combination with a zzso of zzso Our conclusions are based on seven gene expression zzso across several cancer zzso 

Our experiments illustrate that, contrary to several previous studies, in five of the seven zzso zzso selection approaches yield consistently better results than zzso zzso The simplest zzso selection approach, the Top zzso method, achieves the best results on the remaining two zzso We conclude that the correlation structures, if present, are difficult to extract due to the small number of samples, and that consequently, zzso gene selection zzso that attempt to extract these structures are prone to zzso
