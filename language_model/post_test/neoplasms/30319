zzso are zzso zzso proteins essential for the maintenance of tissue architecture and integrity, and their impairment is often associated with human zzso zzso regarding regulatory mechanisms associated with zzso zzso in cancer is zzso zzso features of the zzso and zzso regulatory mechanisms in the zzso zzso are zzso This study aims at systematically characterizing the zzso portion of zzso zzso members and the identification of zzso regions zzso putative zzso of regulation, using a zzso approach and biological data zzso Our study demonstrates that the zzso zzso genes zzso specific characteristics in comparison to all zzso zzso both from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes display higher average total zzso number and significantly longer zzso than other genes and across the entire zzso zzso Moreover, in the human zzso we observed an uncommon high frequency of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso repeats, a zzso of zzso zzso repetitive elements at zzso zzso zzso with increased de zzso zzso zzso Using this approach, we identified zzso zzso sites that may constitute novel zzso of zzso zzso expression zzso These findings pinpoint the need to identify mechanisms affecting particularly zzso and zzso elements located in zzso 2 and 3 of human zzso zzso possibly important in the expression zzso of this zzso in zzso and zzso
