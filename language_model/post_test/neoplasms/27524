This article will introduce a novel concept in the use of zzso insensitive host immune cells in cancer zzso zzso is a zzso zzso At a cellular level, it mediates cellular zzso growth arrest, differentiation and zzso Because of the above cellular effects, zzso is able to regulate a host of zzso events in zzso such as normal embryonic development, zzso in tumor zzso zzso transformation and immune zzso As a general rule, its direct effect on cancer cells is zzso to cancer zzso However cancer cells are able to acquire the ability to evade this zzso effect of zzso by becoming insensitive to zzso Furthermore, these zzso cells are able to produce large quantities of zzso The consequence of over expression of zzso by cancer cells is an important factor for subsequent tumor zzso The excess amount of zzso promotes tumor zzso and immune zzso The latter effect of zzso is the most devastating to the zzso The present discussion is focused on the role of zzso insensitive immune cells in cancer zzso The host immune system offers a natural defense program against zzso But, this natural immune surveillance is rendered ineffective by an overproduction of zzso derived from the tumor zzso zzso the host immune cells insensitive to zzso in a gene therapy program offers a hope for us to successfully combat against zzso Based on the above discussion, it is encouraging that there is a possibility for us to achieve a cure in cancer using zzso insensitive immune cells in gene zzso
