zzso an oral zzso zzso inhibitor zzso was evaluated in patients with advanced solid zzso in two single agent phase I studies zzso and zzso In zzso study testing four different administration schedules, the maximum tolerated dose zzso was established at 75 zzso zzso zzso zzso and the recommended dose at 60 zzso zzso regardless of the schedule zzso The dose limiting toxicity zzso consistently observed across all these schedules, was zzso zzso The zzso study was initially investigating an additional schedule of 14 days zzso days zzso While testing two first zzso zzso was observed without reaching zzso To address this issue, a zzso zzso model was used to predict the optimal schedule allowing higher doses with minimal zzso Several administration schedules were simulated using this zzso A 4 days zzso days off schedule was associated with the smallest zzso zzso zzso the zzso study was zzso After reaching zzso (75 zzso zzso with the initial schedule, subsequent zzso received zzso on a revised schedule of 4 days zzso days off, starting at one dose level below zzso zzso zzso zzso As expected, the zzso continued for two more dose levels beyond zzso The zzso reached for this zzso schedule was 105 zzso zzso and the recommended dose 90 zzso zzso In conclusion, early understanding of zzso and zzso determination allowed us to build a zzso model of zzso which predicted the optimal administration zzso This zzso schedule is currently used in the trials in solid zzso with zzso
