The zzso zzso zzso is capable of zzso tumor growth, mainly because of its resemblance to zzso zzso It affects cellular acquisition of iron by binding to zzso and it interacts with the zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in reduced zzso pools and zzso of DNA zzso The abundance of zzso receptors and the zzso of zzso zzso render tumor cells susceptible to the zzso of zzso zzso clinical activity in zzso and zzso cancer has been documented in clinical studies employing intravenous zzso zzso which is currently being re-evaluated in zzso zzso An improved therapeutic index is expected to result from prolonged exposure to low zzso plasma zzso zzso Attempts to accomplish this by oral administration of zzso zzso failed because of insufficient zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso which stabilize zzso against zzso and facilitate membrane zzso has been recognized as a promising strategy for overcoming these zzso Two such zzso complexes, namely zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which both exhibit high zzso when administered via the oral route, are currently being evaluated in the clinical zzso
