This study examined zzso metabolism and zzso in the acute response to controlled intravenous nutrition in seven cancer patients who lost zzso Six zzso and zzso patients without cancer served as zzso zzso zzso was used and zzso of zzso zzso of various zzso zzso end products, and insulin were zzso zzso energy expenditure zzso was measured after an overnight zzso The resting energy need was calculated for each patient according to zzso The nutrition program consisted of zzso and lipids zzso zzso zzso Stockholm, zzso each as 50% of zzso calories and zzso acids zzso zzso zzso These zzso were infused simultaneously at rates equivalent to one, two, and three times zzso over periods of zzso hours on 3 consecutive days after a 12-hour zzso zzso zzso levels and energy expenditure were measured between 6 and zzso hours after the start of the zzso The cancer patients had zzso zzso changes in the zzso state, such as elevated plasma levels of zzso zzso free fatty zzso and zzso and higher energy expenditure than zzso The cancer patients responded to strictly defined zzso challenge in a similar way as the zzso patients without zzso Whole body zzso capacity and the proportion of infused zzso and lipids that were oxidized at different levels of infusion rates were not decreased in cancer patients compared with control zzso Similar zzso zzso zzso among the groups during infusions argues for a maintained plasma clearance of the zzso in the cancer zzso This study supports the suggestion that zzso cancer patients can generate and conserve energy normally in response to intravenous zzso This refers to cancer patients with a history of weight loss up to zzso of their normal body zzso zzso weight loss due to altered zzso metabolism in cancer patients is of quantitative importance in the zzso state rather than in the fed zzso
