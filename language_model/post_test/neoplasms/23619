The fact point genetic zzso provide the species with an ability to respond favorably to changing environmental zzso also specifically compatible with zzso point zzso sensitive, zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso implies an additional function for evolutionary zzso In particular, this suggests that evolutionary point zzso may also be designed to remove from the gene pool those zzso which have accumulated advanced levels of zzso zzso thereby protecting the species from the adverse consequences of accumulating zzso beyond an unsafe upper zzso This hypothesis is used to construct a zzso model zzso for zzso of human cancer as a function of zzso The model assumes that point zzso sensitive zzso and zzso genes are zzso zzso and must exhibit zzso genetic information at zzso for proper zzso zzso evolutionary zzso populate these zzso zzso eventually causing point zzso sensitive genes to yield zzso acid zzso proteins capable of participation in transforming normal cells to zzso The mechanism for evolutionary base zzso is a zzso zzso process in which the required unusual zzso are provided by zzso exchange zzso zzso zzso Cooper, zzso The very good agreement between zzso of cancer data and the model is consistent with the hypothesis that duplex DNA has been zzso designed to zzso an optimum rate of point zzso variation for purposes of zzso providing the species with the ability to respond favorably to changing environmental conditions and zzso to protect the species from adverse consequences of accumulating excessive zzso zzso zzso Cooper, zzso As a result of identifying zzso zzso DNA codes, consequences of evolutionary zzso in zzso and zzso human zzso are zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso may be responsible for most evolutionary traits, whereas zzso zzso zzso may be supplied by the zzso zzso male zzso zzso Evidence from fragile X genetic systems support this zzso The model further illustrates how fragile X genetic properties could be a result of evolutionary zzso altering genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso codes to specify DNA synthesis initiation zzso zzso or zzso This could cause zzso of DNA synthesis and the addition of more zzso codes to the zzso zzso segment of consecutive zzso repeats which would explain how zzso segments are zzso during zzso
