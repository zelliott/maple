zzso involves the sequential zzso of zzso pathways leading to the production of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso constitute a family of structurally related zzso zzso which are defined by their affinity for zzso zzso and sequence similarities in the zzso recognition zzso By zzso specific zzso different members of the zzso family behave as zzso or zzso agents, acting at different levels of acute and chronic inflammatory zzso Recent studies highlighted zzso roles for zzso in zzso in several experimental models of chronic zzso suggesting that these zzso proteins may be potential targets for the design of a novel generation of zzso zzso In this study, we review recent advances on the role of zzso in the zzso amplification and resolution of the inflammatory zzso In particular, we examine the influence of individual members of this family in regulating cell zzso migration, zzso zzso zzso immune cell zzso and zzso From a better understanding of the molecular basis of zzso immune regulation, we may become able to exploit the potential of these zzso proteins and their zzso as suitable therapeutic agents in acute and chronic inflammatory zzso
