To establish structural equation model zzso of subjected quality of life zzso in cancer patients taking into account zzso of zzso 

The zzso model was constructed from correlation zzso of the scores of answers of questions to both patients and zzso Data were collected from 15 cancer patients who hospitalized and took zzso analgesics for pain zzso The patients were asked 18 questions and zzso were asked seven zzso From the correlation zzso among scores of answers, a reasonable model was explored by zzso 

zzso zzso zzso in cancer patients can be modeled by zzso variables consist of contributions from physical, emotional and functional zzso The fitting between data and the model was acceptable by statistical zzso zzso zzso The modeled zzso by zzso was zzso correlated with subjected zzso in patients, indicating that subjected zzso in patients would be affected not only by above zzso variables but other zzso The model taking into account zzso of zzso to improve subjected zzso in patients was also made by zzso The model was reasonably explained and fitting between data and the model was acceptable from some statistical zzso The final model suggests that pharmacist can raise subjected zzso in patients through restraining unpleasant side zzso 

The zzso of zzso to improve subjected zzso in patients can be modeled by zzso The final model suggests that zzso with zzso to assess patients' pain status contribute to raise subjected quality of life in cancer zzso
