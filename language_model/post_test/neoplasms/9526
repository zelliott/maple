There are several scientific approaches for the determination of cellular growth influences of known or novel substances under in zzso conditions, among which zzso zzso measurement is considered to be one of the convenient zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the commonly used zzso zzso zzso based on the ability of zzso from viable cells to produce the brown soluble zzso zzso at zzso zzso Here we have tested the possible growth influence of iron zzso zzso on two human cancer cell lines, the zzso chronic zzso zzso and zzso breast zzso cells, based on the zzso zzso We found that iron zzso zzso possessed an zzso effect when added at 16- to zzso zzso but iron zzso zzso became growth zzso when its concentration was further increased to 1000 zzso In addition, a zzso increase in zzso at the same wavelength was observed when we repeated the experiments without the addition of zzso and zzso zzso When we further repeated the cell growth zzso using zzso zzso content zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso iron zzso zzso showed a consistent zzso growth zzso zzso zzso investigation after zzso blue zzso clearly demonstrated that iron zzso zzso at a concentration of 1000 zzso is zzso to zzso zzso Interestingly, a consistent zzso for the zzso at zzso zzso was further observed with increased iron zzso zzso concentration either in the presence or absence of zzso even in a zzso zzso Thus we conclude that iron zzso zzso is actually growth zzso and even zzso at high zzso towards the zzso and zzso cancer cells and the paradoxical zzso activity of iron zzso zzso on these two cancer cell lines using the zzso zzso was solely due to the zzso of initial pale green iron zzso to zzso iron zzso during incubation in the zzso zzso
