zzso modification of zzso proteins in zzso architecture plays a central role in the zzso regulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are the two major modifications that function as a specific zzso regulator in response to various cellular zzso zzso the mechanism of action of these modifications in zzso is not well zzso recent discovery of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso activities within zzso regulators has an important implication for zzso modification to be a key player for the precise regulation of zzso zzso Here, we discuss recent advances made on zzso zzso and zzso as a fundamental process to zzso gene transcription, with a particular emphasis on their zzso effects in zzso zzso
