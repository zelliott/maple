zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are stable, zzso drug carriers useful for delivering zzso to the sites of solid zzso Compared with conventional zzso zzso zzso are less extensively taken up by cells of the zzso system zzso and have a reduced tendency to leak drug while in zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso are zzso by an extremely long circulating zzso slow plasma clearance and a reduced volume of distribution compared with conventional zzso zzso or free zzso The long circulation and ability of zzso zzso to zzso through zzso zzso zzso results in zzso of zzso in zzso zzso In a number of animal and human zzso including breast, zzso pancreatic and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced higher zzso drug zzso and better therapeutic responses than equivalent doses of conventional zzso zzso zzso or free zzso Low peak plasma zzso of free zzso after administration of zzso zzso zzso and the reduced tendency of the zzso drug to accumulate in zzso suggest that a reduction in cardiac toxicity compared with free zzso may be zzso Thus, the rationale for the use of zzso zzso zzso in solid zzso may be zzso as zzso change in the toxicity profile with a decrease in acute adverse effects (such as zzso and zzso and reduced zzso of zzso greater activity in highly zzso zzso (such as zzso zzso and effective treatment of zzso moderately sensitive to zzso (such as breast and zzso zzso with the possibility of increased zzso response because of enhanced drug zzso In addition, although no comparative study yet exists, there is a suggestion from early human studies with zzso zzso zzso that zzso may be reduced compared with the free zzso
