Most zzso methods which are used in molecular biology generate gene zzso Interpreting large gene lists can reveal zzso insights and generate useful testable zzso The process can be cumbersome and zzso Multiple commercial and open solution currently exist that can aid researchers in the functional zzso of gene zzso The process of gene set zzso includes zzso preparation, which is method specific, gene list zzso and analysis and interpretation of the significant associations that were zzso In this chapter, we demonstrate how zzso can be applied to gene lists generated from zzso profiling zzso
