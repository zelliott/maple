To investigate the relationship between expression of the human zzso protein zzso and the occurrence of an zzso response to zzso zzso 

Human zzso cell lines zzso and zzso were zzso with a zzso or zzso zzso zzso For demonstration of an zzso response, cells lines were zzso with a conditioning dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by a second dose of zzso zzso after an zzso of zzso zzso Response was measured in terms of zzso zzso 

zzso of a zzso zzso caused transient zzso of zzso zzso in both cell zzso The optimal dose for the induction of zzso in the cell lines investigated was zzso and zzso induction occurred within 30 zzso of zzso For both cell lines, the zzso response was zzso when cells were zzso with the zzso zzso However, the zzso an enhancement of the zzso response in cell lines zzso with the zzso zzso was seen only for zzso cells under certain experimental zzso 

The results support the view that while zzso is necessary to the zzso response, it may not by itself be sufficient for the zzso response to zzso
