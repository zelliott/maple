Two zzso restricted zzso have recently been identified from the broadly expressed tumor zzso zzso and several vaccination trials in cancer patients based on these zzso peptides have been zzso zzso there is a crucial need for the identification of zzso zzso restricted to other zzso in order to extend the proportion of patients that can enter these ongoing clinical zzso In the present study, we characterized 2 zzso zzso which are restricted to zzso zzso zzso zzso against these zzso zzso was found in the peripheral blood from patients with different zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso anchor zzso of the zzso peptides improved the recognition by zzso zzso from melanoma zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated spontaneous zzso zzso responses to zzso in a primary melanoma zzso The characterization of these zzso allows more patients can be included in the ongoing zzso zzso vaccination trials against zzso
