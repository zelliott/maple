The purpose is to determine the effect of food on the zzso of zzso an oral zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid (an inhibitor of zzso zzso in normal gut zzso in a zzso ratio of zzso 

zzso patients received a single dose of zzso of 35 zzso with zzso zzso or without food in a crossover study zzso in arm A without breakfast on day zzso and with breakfast on day 0 and in arm B the reversed zzso Blood samples were taken before and after zzso zzso This food effect was evaluated according to the Food and Drug Administration guidelines using zzso zzso 

zzso parameters for zzso without breakfast were as zzso zzso 107 zzso zzso zzso zzso area under the plasma zzso curve zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 104 zzso zzso decreased zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid significantly zzso zzso zzso and increased the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso ratio for the zzso of zzso was not different, which for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso acid was zzso zzso zzso zzso and for zzso acid, the breakdown product of zzso acid, was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso indicative for zzso zzso zzso was not affected, as well as the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso data demonstrated that the zzso confidence zzso for the zzso ratio for the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were within zzso and zzso respectively, indicating no food zzso Only for zzso acid and zzso acid were these values outside this zzso 

Food intake affected only the zzso of the zzso constituent zzso acid but not of zzso zzso and zzso Because zzso acid is included to protect against gastrointestinal zzso this observation might affect the gastrointestinal toxicity and thus the efficacy of zzso
