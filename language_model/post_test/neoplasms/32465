A remarkable feature of the zzso of zzso zzso is that while human zzso to high zzso of zzso zzso in drinking water are associated with increases in skin, zzso and zzso cancer, zzso zzso has not typically caused tumors in standard laboratory animal test zzso zzso zzso administered for periods of up to 2 zzso to various strains of laboratory mice, including the Swiss zzso Swiss zzso zzso and zzso has not resulted in significant increases in tumor zzso However, zzso et zzso (1999) have reported a zzso tumor zzso in zzso mice exposed to zzso in their drinking water throughout their zzso with no tumors reported in zzso In order to investigate the potential role of tissue zzso in differential zzso to zzso zzso a zzso based zzso zzso model for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and human zzso et zzso zzso zzso was extended to describe the zzso in the zzso The zzso model was zzso in the mouse using published data from acute zzso of zzso mice to zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso and validated using data from acute zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the acute model were then compared with data from chronic zzso There was no evidence of changes in the apparent volume of distribution or in the zzso concentration ratios between acute and chronic exposure that might support the possibility of zzso zzso zzso The zzso model was also used to project tissue zzso in the zzso study, in comparison with tissue levels in studies having shorter duration but higher zzso treatment zzso The model evaluation indicates that zzso factors do not provide an explanation for the difference in outcomes across the various mouse zzso Other possible explanations may relate to zzso differences, or to the different zzso of dosing in each of the mouse studies, given the evidence that zzso zzso is likely to be active in the later stages of the zzso zzso
