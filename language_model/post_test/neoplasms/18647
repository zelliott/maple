The ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso that have been stored for many years after zzso to zzso zzso following high-dose zzso has not been zzso 

In this retrospective study, eight Canadian centers contributed data from 53 zzso stem cell transplants zzso performed using zzso that had undergone long-term storage zzso years, range zzso zzso and 120 zzso using zzso stored for zzso months zzso zzso 

The doses of zzso and zzso cells per zzso recipient weight were similar between the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and long- zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso term storage zzso The median days to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 11 days for both zzso and long-term zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 12 and 11 for zzso and long-term storage, zzso zzso were not significantly different between the two zzso When zzso performed with zzso zzso zzso zzso cells was compared there was also no difference in zzso or zzso recovery zzso 12 days for both after short-term storage, and 12 and 11 days, respectively, after long-term zzso Fourteen zzso products stored for zzso years also showed similar count zzso as the entire long-term storage group zzso 11 days for both zzso and zzso 

zzso zzso can be stored for at least 5 years with no apparent loss in their ability to support zzso zzso after high-dose zzso
