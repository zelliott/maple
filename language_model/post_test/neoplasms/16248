To determine whether zzso and serum zzso values for blood samples obtained from cats via vascular access ports zzso are comparable to those for samples obtained by direct zzso 

Prospective zzso 

14 healthy zzso 

A zzso was surgically implanted in a jugular vein in each zzso Blood samples were obtained from the zzso and by direct zzso of the zzso jugular vein 10 weeks after zzso zzso zzso of zzso and serum zzso analyses were compared by use of a paired zzso The zzso to reject the zzso hypothesis was adjusted to account for multiple comparisons by using the zzso procedure in which the nominal zzso value is divided by the number of comparisons zzso zzso zzso 

zzso samples zzso and zzso obtained 10 weeks after zzso placement were evaluated for each zzso Of the 24 measured zzso only zzso total zzso and zzso zzso differed significantly zzso zzso for all 3) between zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso suggest that samples obtained from zzso are suitable for routine zzso monitoring of zzso cancer zzso Sample zzso may account for a slight increase in zzso total zzso and zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso However, the values of variables most critical for monitoring of patients receiving chemotherapy zzso mature zzso and zzso zzso are zzso If proper techniques are used, zzso may be used for administration of chemotherapy as well as for blood collection in cats undergoing cancer zzso
