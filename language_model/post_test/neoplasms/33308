An adequate zzso zzso status has for long been considered to prevent the development of various forms of zzso However, underlying molecular mechanisms remained zzso In zzso zzso exerts its functions as zzso incorporated into zzso zzso zzso compounds can either act as zzso source for zzso or, depending on their chemical forms, in distinct zzso Most potent zzso effects have been attributed to compounds in which the zzso zzso is zzso These compounds are able to induce phase 2 zzso which are involved in the cellular defense system that is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso best studied in cancer development are members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In various cancer cells and zzso zzso and/or zzso are zzso Interestingly, both zzso are targets of zzso An enhanced expression of these zzso may represent a mechanism to counteract zzso zzso They may, however, also provide a selective advantage for pre-existing tumor cells in guaranteeing survival and continuous zzso
