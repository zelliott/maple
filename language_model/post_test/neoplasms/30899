zzso zzso zzso have been used for zzso studies with human tumor zzso and zzso and human tumor zzso in experimental zzso This paper reviews the work that has been performed in these models with different types of cancer, and highlights those papers that have presented zzso estimates and attempts to correlate the zzso zzso studies in zzso zzso as a model for zzso have been performed in human zzso colon cancer, and melanoma cell lines using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The uniform geometry of the zzso has allowed radiation dose estimates to be zzso Up to three logs of cell kill have been achieved with zzso and zzso zzso with minimal toxicity from labeled zzso zzso but zzso had little effect because of its short zzso as shown by zzso It appears that the two most important factors for therapeutic efficacy in this model are good penetration of the zzso zzso and an adequate zzso zzso to allow penetration of the zzso prior to significant zzso zzso zzso studies in animals bearing transplants of colon cancer, zzso lymphoma, zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso small cell lung zzso cervical zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer have been performed with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso beta zzso and zzso alpha emitting zzso zzso to zzso zzso A few studies compared different zzso in the same model zzso The approaches that have been used in these studies to estimate tumor zzso include the zzso approach, zzso zzso zzso and comparison to external zzso The majority of investigators have estimated the dose to tumor and normal zzso using zzso calculations zzso curve and equilibrium dose constant zzso The range of tumor doses has been between 17 and 11 zzso zzso of administered zzso The effectiveness of zzso zzso zzso therapy depends on a number of factors relating to the zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso The density, location, and zzso of expression of zzso zzso within tumors will affect the zzso and therapeutic efficacy of zzso zzso as will zzso factors such as the tumor zzso blood flow, and zzso These factors are discussed and examples are zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
