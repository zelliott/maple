The major focus of cancer zzso has shifted away from arguments about the zzso of the zzso theory of cancer to the more basic question of zzso zzso Despite vast effort aimed at demonstrating such zzso their existence in the zzso of cancer remains zzso zzso analysis of three tumor types, mouse zzso mouse zzso and human zzso melanoma, has received most attention, and a zzso zzso of the surface zzso expressed by these tumors has begun to zzso The prime candidates for zzso that can be considered tumor specific are the few instances of Class 1 zzso that have now been zzso defined on mouse and human zzso These zzso show an absolute restriction to individual tumors, not being zzso on any other normal or zzso cell zzso zzso and genetic characterization of Class 1 zzso represents an essential next step in evaluating the significance of these zzso The surprising features of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the mouse provide insight into the genetic origin of another key class of tumor zzso in this case zzso with characteristic properties of both differentiation zzso and zzso zzso In normal mice, zzso zzso are restricted to cells in the zzso and strains differ with regard to expression versus zzso of zzso zzso zzso information for zzso is universal in the zzso however, as zzso developing in mice that normally lack zzso are found to express zzso What is clear from the past two decades of research in cancer zzso is that a far more detailed knowledge of surface zzso of tumor cells will be necessary before we can begin to assess the possibility of zzso control of zzso
