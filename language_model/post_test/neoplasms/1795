To investigate the association between zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and cancer zzso by zzso of zzso poor zzso zzso in cancer zzso 

One hundred and zzso cases of esophagus cancer, 148 cases of stomach cancer, 212 cases of lung cancer, 112 cases of zzso cancer and zzso controls were zzso by zzso specific zzso chain reaction zzso for zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in cancer groups and control group were zzso 

The zzso of zzso of zzso were zzso in the group of esophagus cancer patients, zzso in the stomach cancer patients, zzso in the group of lung cancer patients, only zzso in the zzso cancer patients and zzso in control zzso There were statistical differences between the cancer groups and control group zzso cancer, zzso zzso zzso zzso stomach cancer, zzso zzso zzso zzso lung cancer, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer, zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso have a high zzso of esophagus cancer, stomach cancer and lung cancer, zzso they have a low zzso of zzso zzso It suggests that zzso may participate in the zzso of zzso of esophagus cancer, stomach cancer and lung cancer, but may involve in the zzso of zzso of zzso zzso
