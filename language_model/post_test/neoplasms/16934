It is generally agreed that most zzso particularly those that arise zzso are caused by randomly occurring zzso at specific sites of the zzso Hence zzso of these spontaneous tumors can be described by zzso mathematical zzso In this paper we offer a mathematical approach to zzso A zzso model was developed to calculate the number of zzso required for zzso zzso This model demonstrates that the two hit model, as originally proposed by zzso for zzso in children, is not zzso for tumors in zzso Our results show that zzso transformation is more likely to be due to a specific set of four zzso This zzso model is compatible with most current views on zzso and most phenomena in zzso
