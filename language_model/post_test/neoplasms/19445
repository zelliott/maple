This study aimed to estimate survival at 5 years by zzso sex and stage of the patients who presented a new cancer in 1994 in the zzso zzso 

A cohort study began in 1994 by an exhaustive collection of the incidental zzso notified in the zzso area at the health insurance zzso zzso A zzso random sample based on tumor zzso was followed at 1 year, 3 years and 5 zzso The analysis of the observed survival was carried out according to zzso zzso Relative survival was calculated according to zzso II zzso 

The follow-up sample concerned zzso zzso For all zzso relative survival at 5 years was zzso for the women and 51% for the zzso Relative survival rate at 5 years was zzso for the women with a breast cancer zzso for the patients in stage I) and zzso for those with a cancer of the zzso Relative survival at 5 years for zzso cancer was zzso for men and zzso for zzso For lung cancer, the relative survival rate fell from zzso for patients in stage I to zzso for those in stage zzso 

Our study produces zzso survival data for a entire geographical area covering zzso of the French zzso Survival improves with earlier diagnosis but depends also on quality of care and availability of zzso access to medical care can be a zzso zzso While in terms of zzso the situation in the zzso area is close to the national situation, survival at 5 years for a set of tumors appears to be better in this area than the nationwide zzso Besides providing information useful to determine mortality and zzso the health insurance data offer additional insight to cancer epidemiology and contribute to better knowledge of this zzso
