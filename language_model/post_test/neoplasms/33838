zzso zzso zzso is modulated by zzso agents, which, in turn, abrogates zzso resistance in zzso zzso The feasibility of administering various sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in patients with advanced solid zzso was evaluated in this Phase I and pharmacological study to assess this premise in the clinical zzso The study also sought to determine the maximum tolerated dose zzso levels of zzso and zzso as a function of zzso to characterize the zzso zzso behavior of zzso administered both before and after zzso assess zzso fluctuations in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and seek preliminary evidence of zzso zzso 

zzso patients were zzso to receive treatment with oral zzso daily on days zzso and zzso administered zzso either on day 1 before zzso zzso zzso zzso or day 5 after zzso zzso zzso Treatment was repeated every 6 zzso Blood sampling for zzso studies was performed on both days 1 and 5 of course zzso zzso were sampled to evaluate major zzso effects on zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were the principal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These effects were more prominent in patients receiving zzso zzso resulting in a much lower zzso of zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was observed in patients with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso No zzso zzso effects were noted to account for zzso zzso zzso At the zzso level, zzso activity in zzso decreased zzso on average, and zzso fluctuations did not appear to be zzso 

The principal zzso of the zzso regimen were zzso and zzso which were consistent and zzso albeit zzso zzso zzso was substantially more zzso resulting in disparate zzso and dose levels recommended for subsequent zzso evaluations zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso differences in zzso zzso do not account for this clinically relevant magnitude of zzso zzso The characteristics of the zzso effects of zzso the paucity of severe zzso zzso and zzso activity at tolerable doses warrant zzso evaluations on this zzso
