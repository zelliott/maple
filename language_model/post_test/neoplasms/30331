Since its discovery, the tumor zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso has become a zzso with a wide spectrum of functions, which is typically meditated through its zzso zzso zzso however, zzso also functions in a zzso zzso It is well established that zzso regulates several signaling zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso focal zzso zzso zzso and more recent, zzso zzso zzso zzso where zzso of these pathways typically leads to cancer development and zzso In regard to most of these zzso the underlining molecular mechanism of zzso regulation is well established, but not so much for the zzso zzso Indeed, accumulating evidence has shown an inverse correlation between zzso expression and zzso in several zzso However, the detailed mechanism by which zzso regulates zzso is poorly zzso In this review, we discuss the role of zzso in regulating zzso by directly targeting zzso and zzso zzso and a putative zzso between the zzso
