Resistance to zzso drugs is a significant clinical problem for the treatment of cancer patients and has been linked to the zzso of survival pathways and expression of zzso zzso zzso Thus zzso of these survival pathways or zzso zzso expression may increase the efficacy of drug zzso Here we review the role of the zzso zzso zzso family in regulating important proliferation and survival pathways in cancer cells and the involvement of zzso zzso in the expression and activity of zzso and zzso two of the most important drug zzso zzso zzso zzso are over expressed in various types of tumors and regulate the zzso of signaling pathways that are important for tumor cell zzso survival and expression of drug zzso zzso This makes zzso zzso attractive targets for the development of zzso zzso zzso zzso mainly on solid tumors, we provide an update on the literature describing the zzso functions of zzso zzso Also we provide an overview of the development of selective small zzso zzso zzso zzso Because of the intense effort by pharmaceutical companies and academia it is reasonable to expect that zzso zzso zzso will enter the clinic in the foreseeable zzso We therefore finish this review with a discussion on the most efficient application of these zzso zzso This includes a consideration of which tumor type is the most appropriate target for treatment, how to select the patient population that stands to gain the most from treatment with zzso zzso which molecular markers are suitable to follow the course of treatment and whether zzso zzso zzso should be used as zzso or in combination with other zzso zzso
