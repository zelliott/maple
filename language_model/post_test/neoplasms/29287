It has been zzso that the preliminary steps of cancer known as zzso zzso could be zzso by a competitive mechanism among zzso and zzso zzso Cell competition is a process of selection among populations of cells with different zzso the best adapted cells zzso survive and zzso in the tissue at the expense of the less well adapted cells zzso and these loser cells are eliminated from the tissue by zzso However, the molecular mechanisms zzso this process and the genes involved are still zzso A mechanism of zzso communication during cell competition known as the zzso zzso has been recently proposed to distinguish loser from winner zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso in the zzso disc while zzso zzso are expressed specifically during cell competition in the cells to be zzso Cell competition has been zzso to have implications in development, tissue zzso zzso and zzso zzso the process of cell competition does not affect the total cell number and organ zzso is maintained because winner cells compensate for the zzso A role of cell competition as the mechanism occurring during initial stages of zzso formation is currently under zzso
