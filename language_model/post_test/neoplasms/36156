Age is the main risk factor for the prevalent diseases of developed countries: cancer, cardiovascular disease and zzso The zzso process is deleterious for zzso but can nonetheless evolve as a consequence of the declining force of natural selection at later ages, attributable to zzso hazards to zzso zzso can then occur as a zzso of zzso of zzso that lower fitness at later ages, or of natural selection in zzso of zzso that increase fitness of the young but at the cost of a higher subsequent rate of zzso Once thought of as an zzso complex and zzso process of zzso of damage, zzso has turned out to be influenced by mechanisms that show strong evolutionary zzso zzso activity of the zzso zzso growth zzso of zzso zzso network can extend healthy lifespan in zzso zzso zzso mice and, zzso zzso zzso activity can also promote zzso while zzso maintenance and zzso can protect against zzso We discuss the relationship between zzso zzso mechanisms of zzso and disease, and the associated scientific challenges and zzso
