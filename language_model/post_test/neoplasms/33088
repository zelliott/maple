Cancer poses a tremendous therapeutic challenge worldwide, highlighting the critical need for developing novel zzso A promising cancer treatment zzso is gene therapy, which is a form of molecular medicine designed to introduce into target cells genetic material with therapeutic zzso zzso gene therapy strategies currently used in zzso models, and in some cases in the clinic, include zzso zzso zzso zzso conditional zzso approaches, zzso of zzso zzso of growth factor zzso zzso of zzso zzso of tumor invasion and stimulation of the immune zzso The translation of these novel therapeutic zzso from the zzso setting to the clinic has been driven by encouraging zzso efficacy data and advances in gene delivery zzso One area of intense research involves the ability to accurately regulate the levels of therapeutic gene expression to achieve enhanced efficacy and provide the capability to switch gene expression off completely if adverse side effects should zzso This feature could also be implemented to switch gene expression off when a successful therapeutic outcome zzso Here, we will review recent developments related to the engineering of zzso switches within gene delivery systems, which could be implemented in clinical gene therapy applications directed at the treatment of zzso
