zzso in a new platinum zzso which was found to be active in experimental tumors and devoid of zzso A phase I study was conducted in cancer patients according to a new design following the recommendations of our Institution's ethical committee to avoid the major drawback of classical phase I studies in which many patients receive the experimental drug at doses far under the potentially active dose zzso from experimental zzso The potentially active dose of zzso was determined from the zzso zzso zzso Range zzso to be between 45 zzso zzso zzso and 67 zzso zzso zzso The patients in this study received with increasing intervals zzso zzso zzso zzso 1/2, zzso zzso 1, of the low dose of the zzso this dose being reached after 90 to 120 days on zzso 23 zzso patients have entered the trial of which 19 reached the low dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso similar to those with zzso occurred in all patients at or above the dose of 30 zzso Renal toxicity was monitored with zzso level and did not occur in any patient at any dose nor did significant zzso toxicity zzso Thus zzso and vomiting appear to be the limiting toxicity of the zzso zzso were observed in this phase I study in lung cancer zzso breast cancer zzso melanoma zzso and perhaps zzso zzso decrease in alpha zzso zzso zzso The proposed starting dose for phase II studies is 45 zzso but we plan to continue dose escalation during the phase II according to the design of Jones and zzso This new study design allows each patient entering a phase I study to be treated with a potentially active dose of the drug zzso
