To evaluate the clinical zzso of a new schedule of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso derived from the zzso mushroom zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to induce DNA damage and zzso in zzso and has shown activity in a number of human tumor zzso zzso A number of drug-resistant cell lines including those that express the zzso zzso retain sensitivity to zzso 

We conducted a phase I trial of zzso given as an intravenous infusion (30 zzso on a daily zzso schedule every 28 zzso A total of ten patients were enrolled and treated at three dose levels, 6, 8, and 11 zzso per zzso 

zzso reached zzso zzso during the zzso infusions with zzso zzso zzso disappeared rapidly from plasma and was zzso for only zzso zzso after the end of the zzso The mean zzso was zzso zzso and the mean clearance was zzso zzso per zzso Peak plasma zzso of zzso of approximately 300 zzso were zzso zzso parameters did not differ significantly from day 1 to day zzso zzso was highly zzso Other prominent zzso included anorexia and zzso One case of zzso zzso zzso possibly secondary to zzso was zzso No other zzso or zzso toxicity was zzso One patient experienced a zzso grade 3 zzso skin injury thought to be secondary to zzso of zzso zzso zzso suppression was zzso No objective tumor responses were zzso 

The recommended phase II dose on this schedule is 6 zzso
