With the beginning of the 21st century, a new and exciting era for cancer therapy has begun with the appearance of molecular targeted zzso Numerous drugs for chemotherapy have been discovered following careful screening of natural and synthetic zzso After zzso candidate chemotherapy drugs are examined to determine if they have sufficiently zzso to function as an zzso zzso However, the development of molecular targeted drugs is based on more logical zzso First, the target is determined then a search is conducted for molecules able to inhibit the target zzso Some molecular targeting drugs, such as zzso zzso zzso have shown amazing effects when compared to currently used chemotherapy drugs, whereas few others have completely failed to inhibit tumor development in clinical zzso Thus, an efficient method for finding effective molecular targeted drugs is zzso An important question is whether the target zzso is responsible for tumor growth or zzso In addition, the clinical administration schedule must be suitable for the component zzso The drugs will not be completely successful in clinical trials if any of the key points are zzso zzso studies are necessary for a complete evaluation of molecular targeted drugs and, based on the results observed in clinical applications, the testers must return to their basic laboratory if necessary and improve the drugs for more advanced zzso In this review we discuss on the current and future status of molecular target zzso
