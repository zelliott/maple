To assess multiple zzso as an indicator of abuse by relating quantity of zzso obtained by older zzso to number of zzso 

Data were obtained from the Norwegian Prescription database which includes all prescriptions filled in Norwegian zzso The study population consisted of people aged zzso who filled five or more prescriptions for weak or for strong zzso in zzso 

In 2008, zzso persons filled five or more prescriptions for strong zzso and zzso for weak zzso More than zzso had three or more zzso Over half of strong zzso users and zzso of weak zzso users had zzso of over 40 zzso For strong zzso increasing zzso was found with increasing number of zzso When zzso care patients were zzso the mean zzso level for strong zzso was much lower, and little association with number of zzso zzso For weak zzso little association between mean zzso and number of zzso was zzso 

This study demonstrated that the increasing quantities of strong zzso with increasing number of zzso are largely due to treatment of zzso care zzso While the use of multiple zzso can be a red flag for problematic medication use, it cannot be considered synonymous with zzso or zzso
