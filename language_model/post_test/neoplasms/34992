Among the zzso zzso capable of detecting zzso zzso some recognize zzso and others identify zzso of zzso zzso Of the latter, the most commonly used is directed against an zzso present in cell zzso derived from milk fat zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso To determine their relative sensitivity and specificity and hence their diagnostic value, we compared four commercially available zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 35 beta zzso the zzso zzso to zzso zzso We studied zzso samples of human zzso of diverse zzso types and degrees of zzso zzso was found to be less sensitive than the zzso zzso to zzso in several zzso tumors, including tumors of the prostate (11 of 13 zzso gastrointestinal tract (13 of 34 zzso and zzso zzso of eight zzso zzso was also less sensitive in zzso zzso of 24 zzso Of the zzso zzso all stained with the zzso zzso to zzso whereas none stained with zzso zzso zzso with zzso was seen in two of 14 zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso to zzso zzso are more sensitive and specific for the identification of zzso origin of zzso than is zzso zzso zzso should not be used as the sole marker of zzso differentiation in tumor zzso
