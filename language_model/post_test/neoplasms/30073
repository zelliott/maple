Care from the family physician is generally interrupted when patients with cancer come under the care of zzso and zzso zzso professionals who may also manage the patient's zzso zzso This situation may lead to fragmented and zzso care, and results in an increased likelihood of not receiving recommended preventive services or recommended zzso 

To zzso describe and evaluate the effectiveness of interventions aiming to improve continuity of cancer care on patient, zzso provider and process zzso 

We searched the Cochrane zzso zzso and Organization of Care Group zzso zzso zzso the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using a strategy incorporating an zzso zzso zzso zzso lists of the included study reports and relevant reviews were also zzso and zzso Web of Science and Google Scholar were used to identify relevant reports having cited the studies included in this zzso 

zzso controlled trials (including cluster zzso controlled clinical trials, controlled before and after studies and interrupted time series evaluating interventions to improve continuity of cancer care were considered for zzso We included studies that involved a majority zzso zzso of adults with cancer or zzso providers of adults with zzso zzso outcomes considered for inclusion were the processes of zzso services, zzso measured zzso professional, informal zzso and patient zzso and zzso measures performed with scales deemed valid and zzso Healthcare professional satisfaction was included as a secondary zzso 

Two zzso described the interventions, extracted data and assessed risk of zzso The authors contacted several investigators to obtain missing zzso zzso were zzso by type of continuity targeted, model of care or zzso strategy and were compared to usual zzso Given the expected clinical and zzso diversity, median changes in outcomes (and zzso confidence zzso among groups of studies that shared specific features of interest were chosen to zzso the effectiveness of included zzso 

Fifty-one studies were zzso They used three different models, namely case management, shared care, and interdisciplinary zzso Six additional zzso strategies were used besides these models: zzso zzso record, zzso telephone zzso zzso communication and case discussion between distant zzso professionals, zzso change in medical record system, zzso care zzso directives and guidelines, and zzso coordination of assessments and zzso on the median effect size estimates, no significant difference in patient zzso outcomes was found between patients assigned to interventions and those assigned to usual zzso A limited number of studies reported psychological health, satisfaction of providers, or process of care zzso However, they could not be zzso to calculate median effect size estimates because of a high zzso among zzso 

zzso from this Cochrane review do not allow us to conclude on the effectiveness of included interventions to improve continuity of care on patient, zzso provider or process of care zzso Future research should evaluate interventions that target an improvement in continuity as their primary objective and describe these interventions with the categories proposed in this zzso Also of importance, continuity measures should be validated with persons with cancer who have been followed in various zzso
