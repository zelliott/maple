zzso strategies thus far reported can result in both side effects and drug zzso To address both of these issues at the cellular level, we report a molecular engineering strategy, which employs zzso zzso to induce selective zzso inside target zzso The zzso zzso composed of both multiple zzso zzso and a high ratio of zzso short DNA, exploit the target recognition capability of the zzso enhanced cell zzso via zzso effects, and cellular disruption by the zzso zzso zzso the zzso backbone built into the zzso is zzso only inside zzso As a result, selective zzso is achieved equally in both normal cancer cells and drug-resistant zzso Control zzso have confirmed the zzso of the zzso itself, but they have also shown that the physical properties of the zzso backbone contribute to target cell zzso zzso our approach may shed new light on drug design and drug zzso
