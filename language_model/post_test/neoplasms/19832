In this work, a novel, zzso zzso of gelatin and zzso acid zzso were zzso by a novel zzso zzso method that overcame challenges of completely contrary zzso between gelatin and zzso acid zzso The GO zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared by zzso in zzso These zzso zzso were then zzso with zzso acid zzso for targeting cervical cancer cells zzso zzso and were characterized for their various zzso and pharmaceutical zzso zzso transform infrared zzso zzso and zzso zzso studies indicated the successful synthesis of zzso which showed low critical zzso concentration in water zzso zzso All zzso were stable in human blood serum and their mean diameters were below 300 zzso suitable for passive zzso zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso showed the reduction in drug zzso and zzso leading to the zzso enhancement of zzso The release of zzso from both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was controlled for a long zzso The zzso results demonstrated great advantages of zzso and zzso over the conventional dosage form of zzso zzso These results, therefore, indicate that zzso is a promising material to prepare drug zzso zzso as a controlled delivery system and zzso is a potential targeted delivery system for cancer zzso
