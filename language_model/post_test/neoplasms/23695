Based on the finding that the nuclear DNA of zzso cells is much more unstable than that of zzso cells, yielding a larger amount of zzso DNA by acid zzso we developed a new method of cancer cell detection in ordinary pathological sections by zzso zzso with zzso DNA zzso after acid zzso zzso bovine serum zzso was zzso with zzso calf zzso DNA and used as the zzso of zzso DNA, and white male rabbits were zzso with the zzso to obtain the zzso zzso zzso zzso sections were prepared from the zzso biopsy specimens taken from zzso zzso tumors and 73 benign tumors of human zzso and zzso zzso Additional 82 biopsy specimens of borderline zzso were also zzso The sections were zzso stained with the zzso after zzso zzso and DNA zzso by zzso with 2 N zzso at 30 degrees zzso The acid zzso for zzso zzso was optimum for the specimens fixed with zzso zzso zzso at room temperature for zzso zzso and all zzso cells were specifically stained positive, in sharp contrast to the negative zzso of all zzso cells including inflammatory zzso This new method gives us decisive help in making diagnosis of zzso in daily pathological zzso The possibility of zzso of borderline zzso was zzso
