We recently showed that vaccination with a complex of zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso zzso responses in 9 of 9 patients vaccinated in a clinical zzso In this study, we performed T cell zzso and analyzed tumor responses in these zzso To evaluate zzso and zzso T cell responses, an zzso zzso zzso was zzso The zzso showed low background and was sensitive for detecting zzso T zzso An increase in the zzso T cell response was observed in 2 of 2 initially zzso and 5 of 7 initially zzso patients after zzso An increase in the zzso T cell response was also observed in 2 of 2 zzso and 5 of 7 zzso patients after zzso Analysis of peptides recognized by zzso and zzso T cells revealed two dominant zzso regions, zzso and zzso zzso responses were observed in 3 zzso cancer patients and a zzso melanoma zzso In 3 of 4 prostate cancer patients, zzso zzso zzso values stabilized during the course of zzso The use of whole zzso containing multiple zzso and zzso zzso may be beneficial for cancer vaccines to prevent tumors from evading the immune zzso
