zzso estimates of the risk of cancer resulting from accidental zzso of zzso gene therapy zzso into zzso vulnerable zzso sites may prove an important supplement to zzso derived data in zzso zzso ratios for future gene therapy zzso We have approached risk assessment by considering either a single zzso zzso event or a single natural zzso to be potentially zzso should either occur in a cell that would otherwise end with one less than the total number of zzso required for frank zzso Estimates of the relative probabilities of these two phenomena yield a relative risk assessment, which in conjunction with zzso data on natural cancer zzso can be converted into an assessment of absolute zzso This approach yields an estimated range of relative risk over 10 years of about zzso to 25 for cells bearing single copies of inserted zzso the upper limit is higher for multiple zzso These estimates, if accurate, imply that small experimental human or animal gene therapy zzso will rarely, if ever, manifest zzso zzso and that more precise future risk assessments will require additional data on natural and zzso zzso zzso
