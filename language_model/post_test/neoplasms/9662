zzso of cellular zzso therapies with chemotherapy and other zzso agents may be of significant clinical benefit in the treatment of many forms of zzso zzso delta zzso T cells are of particular interest for use in such combined therapies due to their potent zzso zzso and relative ease of generation in zzso Here, we demonstrate high levels of zzso against solid zzso cell lines with combination treatment utilizing zzso T cells, zzso agents and the zzso zzso zzso with low zzso of zzso agents or zzso zzso zzso cells to rapid killing by zzso T cells with levels of zzso approaching zzso In addition, zzso enhanced the zzso zzso of zzso cells to zzso T cell zzso resulting in almost zzso zzso of zzso targets in some zzso zzso T cell zzso was zzso by zzso following zzso and zzso recognition of zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso T cells was also induced after exposure to zzso zzso We conclude that administration of zzso T cells at suitable intervals after chemotherapy and zzso may substantially increase zzso activities in a range of zzso
