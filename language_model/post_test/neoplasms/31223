The zzso mouse strain was created in the early 1970s and has since been used extensively in transgenic research because of its zzso zzso background, superior zzso performance, and prominent zzso of zzso zzso which facilitate zzso of zzso Little is known, however, about the zzso and spontaneous disease of zzso zzso zzso zzso the purpose of this study was to determine survival to 24 zzso of age and the zzso of zzso and zzso disease at 14 and 24 zzso of zzso At 14 zzso of age, the zzso of zzso mice was zzso in males zzso zzso zzso and zzso in females zzso zzso zzso All tumors in males and most in females at this time were zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Survival to 24 zzso of age was approximately zzso in both sexes zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of mice with tumors at this time was zzso in males and zzso in zzso In decreasing order of frequency, the following zzso were observed in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso lung AB tumors, liver zzso tumors, zzso neural crest tumors, and zzso zzso zzso in zzso lung AB tumors, zzso zzso zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Compared with other mouse zzso the observed zzso of tumors in zzso mice suggest a higher than usual rate of lung tumors and a lower than usual zzso of liver tumors and zzso This tumor profile should be considered in the interpretation of zzso zzso in zzso transgenic zzso
