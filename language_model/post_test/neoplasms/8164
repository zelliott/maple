Genes linked to human zzso often function in evolutionary zzso zzso and research in zzso zzso has been instrumental in zzso some of the pathways affected, such as zzso and Ras zzso The advent of zzso interference zzso technology has allowed zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso gene zzso Here we review some of the most recent zzso zzso screens that have been conducted and discuss their impact on cancer research and possibilities for future zzso We also show that genes zzso implicated in human zzso are significantly more likely to have a zzso zzso zzso than average, zzso the use of zzso zzso as a cancer gene discovery zzso We zzso that zzso zzso screens in zzso zzso will continue to be productive in identifying new cancer gene candidates and will provide further insights into cancer gene zzso
