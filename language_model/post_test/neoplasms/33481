zzso are zzso zzso and are implicated in diverse biological zzso zzso a member of zzso zzso family, is expressed in airway zzso cells and body zzso like zzso tear film, ear fluid, and breast zzso In addition to its normal zzso an zzso expression of zzso has been reported in a variety of zzso Among various potential zzso of zzso zzso growth factor zzso -like zzso are hypothesized to interact with and activate the zzso zzso suggesting an zzso factor function for zzso The heavily zzso tandem repeat domain provides the structural rigidity to the extended zzso zzso zzso by virtue of its extended structure, serves as a barrier for some zzso and zzso zzso interactions and as a potential zzso for certain growth zzso An intricate relationship between zzso and growth factor signaling is also reflected in the zzso regulation of zzso The zzso promoter has binding sites for different zzso factors, which are responsible for the regulation of its expression in different zzso The zzso zzso acid, and transforming growth zzso signaling pathways regulate zzso expression in a partially zzso zzso Taken together, all of these features of zzso strongly support its role as a potential candidate for diagnostic and therapeutic applications in cancer and other zzso
