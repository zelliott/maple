zzso is a highly zzso zzso derived zzso that has been reported to stimulate a host zzso zzso zzso zzso human zzso zzso is currently undergoing clinical phase I zzso We have studied the growth modulating effects of zzso on a variety of freshly zzso human tumor specimens using an in zzso soft zzso cloning zzso Final zzso of zzso to 10 zzso were used in continuous incubation zzso Of 147 zzso 73 zzso were zzso for the determination of tumor growth modulating zzso The most common tumor types recruited included breast, zzso cell zzso zzso cancer and zzso zzso of tumor colony forming units zzso formation zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso zzso Similarly, only zzso zzso specimens (a zzso cell lung zzso had a significant decrease in tumor colony forming units zzso formation zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso at 1 zzso We conclude that zzso is not a direct zzso of tumor colony formation in zzso However, zzso effects could perhaps be achieved in zzso via the zzso effects of zzso
