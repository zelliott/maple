We designed and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2, which selectively zzso matched sequences at zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 differ only in that the zzso is zzso by an N in the second ring, which precisely recognizes and effectively zzso DNA according to the recognition rule of zzso zzso We investigated zzso DNA zzso zzso in 39 human cancer cell lines, and the effect on expression levels in cancer cell lines by zzso zzso 1 and zzso The zzso analysis of the mean zzso showed that zzso 1 and 2 did not correlate well with each other zzso zzso zzso despite having a common DNA zzso mechanism zzso zzso zzso zzso gene expression analysis demonstrated that there are several zzso regulated zzso The results suggest the intriguing possibility that DNA zzso agents recognizing longer zzso sequences may provide a promising approach for developing new types of zzso zzso
