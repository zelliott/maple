zzso with hybrids zzso fused zzso cells zzso and tumor cells is a novel cancer zzso approach designed to combine tumor zzso with the zzso and zzso capacities of zzso For clinical purposes, we have incorporated a large-scale process for the generation of zzso zzso together with novel zzso zzso The zzso system provides for ease and zzso of method, efficient zzso cell hybrid formation, and zzso production of hybrids in a high-volume zzso zzso zzso In addition, we have evaluated DC zzso with a variety of zzso human tumor cell lines with the rationale that these tumor cell partners would prove a ready, suitable source for the generation of zzso cell hybrid zzso The DC production process can generate zzso to zzso zzso from a single zzso product zzso 180 zzso As determined by zzso analysis, zzso of zzso total cells zzso ratio of DC and tumor zzso resulted in a consistent average of zzso zzso cell hybrids, irrespective of the tumor type zzso zzso were retained in the population for 48 h zzso and following freezing and zzso Upon zzso of the tumor cell partner for vaccine purposes, the overall fusion efficiency was not altered at doses up to 200 zzso zzso of zzso cell hybrid populations for their ability to stimulate zzso responses demonstrated that zzso populations are superior to mixed populations of zzso and tumor cells in generating a primary zzso response, as indicated by zzso zzso Moreover, hybrids zzso zzso zzso and zzso melanoma tumor cells zzso zzso cell line) zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso T cells, which are restricted for recognition of a melanoma zzso zzso zzso zzso within the context of the DC zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cell hybrid population served to further improve this zzso zzso zzso Overall, our results are promising for the large-scale generation of zzso hybrids zzso zzso and zzso tumor cells, that may prove useful in human vaccine zzso
