Whole body exposure to zzso zzso radiation appears to decrease overall cancer zzso The data come from at least eight large studies of populations exposed to various forms of radioactive material and from more limited studies of occupational and environmental zzso to zzso zzso and zzso Earlier experiments in animals strongly support the protective effect that is apparent in zzso Also, experimental reports from zzso kept in zzso conditions suggest that zzso radiation is essential for optimal growth and zzso The combined evidence points to the presence of zzso thresholds and of zzso or beneficial effects at doses below those zzso Furthermore, according to the geological record, the high background radiation under which life first evolved has progressively attenuated up to the zzso Thus it is intriguing to zzso that modern humans may live under conditions of partial zzso of zzso zzso low doses of zzso radiation may likely function as zzso of repair and zzso mechanisms, much as low-level zzso challenges are responsible for enhanced immune zzso This hypothesis runs contrary to the prevailing consensus of regulatory default zzso which zzso the possibility of zzso thresholds for agents that are zzso at certain levels of zzso Still, those are zzso policy assumptions without scientific or even empirical zzso whereas the hypothesis advanced here has consistent zzso and experimental zzso The implication is that a partial zzso of zzso radiation could be zzso by a safe zzso possibly through dietary zzso zzso data from studies of nuclear workers and populations subjected to unusual zzso suggest that safe supplementation with about zzso zzso would be beneficial and zzso
