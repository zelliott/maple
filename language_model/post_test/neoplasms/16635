zzso processes in the zzso zzso zzso are controlled by pathways of gene functions that are analogous to those used in zzso zzso genetic studies in zzso zzso have helped build the zzso for these regulatory zzso Many zzso of human genes that are targets for zzso in cancer have been found to function at distinct steps within such genetic zzso This way, studies in zzso zzso have provided important clues about the functions of human zzso and tumor zzso zzso how human cancer genes function and act in signaling zzso is of great zzso This information reveals what kind of molecular changes contribute to the process of cell zzso Moreover, additional candidate zzso and tumor zzso may be revealed by identifying the functional partners of genes with an established role in zzso Furthermore, identifying a cascade of gene functions increases the number of potential targets for therapeutic intervention, as blocking either one of multiple genes may interfere with signal zzso through the zzso zzso approaches in a number of different model systems act zzso in solving pathways of gene zzso By using multiple models, the field takes advantage of the strengths of each system and zzso its zzso As one of the most powerful genetic animal systems, zzso zzso will continue to reveal new zzso signaling zzso In addition, now that the zzso zzso zzso sequence has been completed, an increasing number of researchers are likely to discover zzso of human disease genes in the zzso and to analyze gene function in the zzso zzso Combined with the great potential of this animal in drug screens, it is simple to predict that zzso zzso will zzso its way deeper and deeper into cancer zzso
