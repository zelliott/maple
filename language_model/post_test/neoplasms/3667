zzso zzso including whole zzso loss or gain, zzso changes, and a variety of zzso aberrations are common in cancer zzso If zzso cells fail to coordinate zzso zzso with DNA zzso this will inevitably lead to a change in zzso and the formation of zzso or zzso zzso will generally provoke abnormal segregation of zzso Indeed, it has long been recognized that errors in the zzso zzso cycle may be an important cause of zzso and thus contribute to cancer zzso This view has recently received fresh impetus with the description of zzso zzso in almost all solid human zzso As the primary zzso organizing center of most zzso cells, the zzso assures symmetry and zzso of the cell division process, a function that is essential for accurate zzso zzso In addition, a growing body of evidence indicates that zzso might be important for initiating S phase and completing zzso zzso undergo zzso precisely once before cell zzso Recent reports have revealed that this process is linked to the cell division cycle via zzso zzso zzso 2 activity that couples zzso zzso to the onset of DNA replication at the zzso phase zzso zzso in zzso phase regulating proteins like the zzso zzso zzso D and zzso zzso and 6, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso are among the most frequent aberrations observed in human zzso These zzso might not only lead to unrestrained zzso but also cause zzso instability by uncontrolled zzso zzso Since several excellent reports on cell cycle regulation and cancer have been published, this review will focus on the role of zzso in cell cycle zzso as well as causes and consequences of zzso zzso replication in human zzso
