zzso to the paradigm that cancer zzso increases indefinitely with age, significant data now suggest cancer zzso may markedly reduce beyond age 80 years for humans and beyond 800 days for mice, and is not zzso We show that increasing cellular zzso with age is a possible cause of this reduction, since zzso cells are removed from the pool of cells that retain zzso ability necessary for zzso We further show that animal interventions appearing to alter zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso support the prediction that increasing zzso rate reduces cancer while reducing zzso and vice zzso Studies of environmental agents associated with increased cancer might be zzso to find if there is an association with longevity increases, which may markedly alter our view of such zzso We also show that if an agent functions by slowing both zzso and zzso longevity is increased while reducing zzso zzso restriction is the only known intervention that accomplishes this, but there may be zzso
