The success of a zzso zzso for zzso relies on the use of one or more tumor cell traits that equate with tumor zzso or zzso These traits can be divided into intrinsic zzso and zzso zzso zzso Most probably, a zzso response to zzso will be influenced by both of these sets of zzso zzso analysis of cultured cells derived from zzso tumors of head and neck patients has shown that in zzso survival of tumor cells is not the only factor affecting tumor zzso Two possible reasons are the high degree of selection involved in growing the cells in zzso and the inability to assess the contribution of the zzso contact effect with cultured zzso A possible means of overcoming both of these problems would be an assessment of the zzso of the cell population immediately after removal from the zzso Since a good correlation exists between intrinsic cellular zzso and DNA zzso break repair zzso as zzso by the zzso zzso technique zzso we have investigated the feasibility of using zzso field inversion gel zzso zzso in identifying resistant tumor cells in zzso zzso has several advantages over neutral zzso in that it is faster zzso zzso samples can be run on the same zzso zzso and, most importantly, one can zzso DNA damage and repair by zzso the DNA with zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
