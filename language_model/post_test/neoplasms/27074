zzso zzso are one of the water channel proteins located in the cell membrane that transport not only water but also some small zzso such as zzso Since zzso are involved in cancer proliferation and zzso it might be possible to zzso them as new targets for cancer molecular zzso In this study, we investigated whether zzso can be specifically targeted by using zzso zzso zzso which passes through zzso In the in zzso experiments, comparing the cancer cell lines with different expression levels of zzso and zzso major zzso known to be expressed in zzso and examining the effect of their zzso on these cells, the expression of zzso and zzso in cell lines was shown to be closely related to zzso zzso When zzso was injected into zzso mice, zzso rank zzso analysis revealed that zzso levels in tumor and in plasma were mutually correlated only in tumors expressing zzso at a high zzso These results indicate the possibility of using zzso as new targets to characterize cancer using zzso zzso as a molecular zzso
