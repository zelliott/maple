Nuclear medicine zzso using zzso as a zzso are increasing in their use, especially in the domain of zzso zzso In these applications, it often is critical to have the capability of zzso zzso zzso and being able to relate it to the biological properties of the zzso However, images from single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso without compensation for these effects, image quality can be zzso and accurate and precise zzso is zzso Although zzso correction for zzso is becoming more common, most zzso can only model single energy zzso such as zzso and zzso Thus, zzso correction for zzso is challenging because it zzso two photons zzso and 245 zzso at nearly equal rates zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we present a method of calculating a single zzso zzso zzso for the zzso emissions of zzso and that can be used to correct for zzso zzso in zzso images acquired with this zzso Using this methodology, we can derive an effective linear zzso zzso zzso and an effective zzso energy zzso based on the zzso probabilities and linear zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This approach allows us to treat the emissions from zzso as a single zzso with an effective energy of 210 zzso We obtained zzso projection data from a tank filled with a uniform solution of zzso The projection data were reconstructed using an zzso zzso zzso with no zzso zzso and with zzso correction assuming zzso energies of zzso zzso and 210 zzso (the derived zzso The reconstructed zzso images demonstrate that the use of no zzso zzso or correction assuming zzso energies of zzso or 245 zzso introduces zzso into the reconstructed zzso distribution when compared against the effective energy zzso In zzso this work provides both a theoretical framework and experimental methodology of zzso correction for the zzso emissions from zzso Although these results are specific to zzso the foundation could easily be extended to other zzso zzso
