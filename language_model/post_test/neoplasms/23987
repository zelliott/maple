The present work is an attempt to explain the high resistance of muscles to cancer zzso We used primary cultures of rat skeletal and cardiac muscle, and examined the effect of the zzso of these cultures zzso zzso zzso on proliferation of cancer zzso The results demonstrated that CM inhibited the proliferation of several types of zzso cells by more than zzso without a significant zzso on normal zzso Cell cycle analysis revealed that CM increased the number of cells in S and zzso zzso suggesting a zzso effect of zzso For defining the biological properties of the zzso which are present in the zzso skeletal muscle cultures were grown in chemically defined medium zzso free zzso The concentrated sample was applied to a zzso zzso column and three zzso were zzso Only one fraction showed zzso zzso Four protein bands were observed in this zzso as revealed by zzso We suggest that some, or all of these proteins are responsible for zzso of tumor cell zzso
