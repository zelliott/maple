The discovery of zzso that predict treatment effectiveness has great potential for improving medical care, particularly in zzso These zzso are increasingly reported on a continuous scale, allowing investigators to explore how treatment efficacy varies as the zzso values continuously increase, as opposed to using arbitrary categories of expression levels resulting in a loss of zzso In the age of zzso as continuous zzso zzso expression level percentage rather than positive v zzso alternatives to such zzso analyses are zzso The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of an intuitive statistical zzso zzso treatment effect pattern plot zzso evaluating zzso zzso when a zzso is measured on a continuous zzso zzso zzso explores the patterns of treatment effect across overlapping intervals of the zzso zzso As an example, zzso methodology is used to explore patterns of treatment effect for varying levels of the zzso zzso in the BIG zzso International Group) zzso zzso clinical trial comparing zzso with tamoxifen as zzso therapy for zzso women with hormone zzso breast zzso zzso analyses showed patients with higher zzso values who were assigned to receive tamoxifen had the poorest prognosis and may benefit most from zzso
