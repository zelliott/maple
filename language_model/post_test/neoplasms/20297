Through interaction with zzso zzso zzso receptors provide an interface between specific zzso immunity and zzso gamma zzso host zzso zzso gamma R trigger such diverse functions as immune complex zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso oxygen intermediate and zzso zzso and zzso cellular zzso zzso Moreover, zzso gamma R are the exclusive trigger molecules for tumor cell killing by human zzso zzso Studies of zzso gamma R function have been aided by the use of zzso zzso to link cells or pathogens to specific host cell zzso including zzso gamma zzso These zzso have permitted determination of the role of zzso gamma R in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by human zzso zzso This approach has also indicated that zzso gamma R do not serve as entry points for viruses such as dengue virus and zzso Taken together, these results provide insight into the utility of manipulating zzso gamma R function in the therapy of cancer and infectious zzso
