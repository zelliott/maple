zzso factor is a cell surface zzso responsible for initiating the zzso zzso of zzso Many tumor cell zzso and intact tumor cells have been shown to contain tissue factor zzso zzso studies show that many tumors associated with zzso syndrome express tissue factor on their cell zzso zzso cells shed membrane fragments which carry tissue factor that can account for the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso cells also produce soluble substances that can induce tissue factor expression on host cells, such as zzso and zzso at sites distant from the zzso zzso all the functional zzso molecules are localized on the outer cell membrane in many tumor cells, the zzso activity on the intact cell surface is largely dormant and can be greatly enhanced upon cell injury or zzso zzso factor zzso activity on the cell surface can be modulated by zzso in the plasma membrane without loss of cell zzso zzso factor activity on cell surfaces is largely regulated by a plasma zzso tissue factor zzso zzso This inhibitor binds to both functional and zzso tissue zzso complexes on the cell surface and prevents zzso tissue zzso complexes from becoming functional after cell injury or zzso zzso but not zzso therapy is effective in preventing the occurrence of devastating zzso events in patients with zzso syndrome and the zzso for this are still zzso
