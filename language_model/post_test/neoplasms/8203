The zzso zzso three-dimensional zzso ultrasound zzso imaging system makes it possible to display tumors in three dimensions and estimate their zzso 

Experimental and clinical studies of the volume zzso function of the zzso zzso system was carried out to evaluate its accuracy and assess the extent of tumor shrinkage caused by zzso dehydration, and zzso zzso In the experimental studies, compared with the actual volume of a zzso zzso gelatin column, the estimated volume was found to be equivalent to 114 zzso zzso % with the zzso probe and 143 zzso zzso % with the zzso probe zzso plus or minus standard zzso The mean estimated volume of tumor models was zzso zzso zzso % with the zzso probe and 131 zzso zzso % with the zzso zzso Greater distance from the probe was associated with a greater degree of error than the target zzso size, angle, or the number of traces of its outline zzso In the clinical studies, compared with the zzso determined tumor volume zzso zzso the mean estimated tumor volume was 178 zzso zzso % in zzso zzso zzso zzso % in zzso zzso and 137 zzso zzso % after zzso zzso dehydration, and zzso were thus associated with tumor zzso 

The volume of gastrointestinal zzso can be estimated by zzso although it is overestimated in comparison with actual zzso zzso also allows direct comparisons to be made between the tumor volume before surgery and the volume of fixed pathological zzso so that the rate of tumor shrinkage can be zzso
