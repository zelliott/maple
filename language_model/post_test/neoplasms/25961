The purpose of this study was to zzso positioning discrepancies between zzso zzso and transmission zzso scan using image zzso A direct comparison of zzso and zzso acquisitions was performed where all studies were analyzed in respect to artifacts caused by inaccurate zzso In addition, phantom zzso were conducted to estimate the consequences of repositioning errors on standardized zzso value calculations zzso 

40 patients were examined by zzso zzso scans using PET and 15 patients were subject to zzso examinations in the zzso zzso zzso between the scans was achieved by a laser zzso positioning system in combination with external body zzso After reconstruction and image fusion of the scans, the positioning discrepancies were measured as the distances between the outer boundaries of E and T in four different body zzso Additional evaluations of the zzso by increasing zzso dislocation were performed using a zzso phantom containing hollow zzso 

For the zzso acquisitions, the mean spatial zzso along the three zzso axes zzso zzso and zzso were between zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas for the zzso examinations mean values between zzso zzso and zzso zzso were determined zzso of significance in each direction p zzso zzso zzso were found in zzso of the whole body scans, but in none of the zzso zzso The development of image artifacts was simulated by phantom zzso In contrast, the zzso of the zzso zzso caused by increasing positioning discrepancies were minimal because of the minimal differences between the zzso zzso of the media zzso 

The presented data show that an zzso reconstruction of zzso studies requires a precise positioning of the zzso zzso examination protocols without repositioning are advantageous due to the significantly lower positioning zzso The additional reconstruction of zzso studies has proven to be useful in discovering image artifacts and is therefore zzso
