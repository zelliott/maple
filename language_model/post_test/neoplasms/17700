zzso has been shown to be zzso in animals and should be considered potentially zzso in zzso The mechanism of action is unknown but zzso is zzso zzso and also may act as a late stage zzso or zzso An estimated zzso million workers are potentially exposed to zzso through their zzso Of those exposed workers, about zzso were found to be exposed to zzso air zzso greater than the 3 zzso set by OSHA as a permissible exposure zzso Fewer than zzso were exposed to zzso greater than 1 zzso but over zzso were exposed to zzso of zzso zzso or zzso A quantitative risk assessment, using the zzso zzso zzso model, found the zzso zzso estimate of lifetime risk for excess zzso to be zzso per 100,000 at the OSHA permissible exposure zzso The estimated risk is 23 per 100,000 at 1 zzso and zzso per 100,000 at zzso zzso Reduction of the OSHA permissible exposure level to 1 zzso would significantly decrease risk with minor economic disruption for most industries zzso However, reduction of risk to levels which have been generally regarded by other regulatory agencies as acceptable, zzso zzso to zzso would require increased control by all the industries zzso
