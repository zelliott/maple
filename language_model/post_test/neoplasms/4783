zzso zzso though present themselves as a group of zzso small zzso play critical roles in many biological and pathological zzso Among which the regulation of human cancer is one of the most excited zzso The goal of this study is to obtain zzso robustly associated with cancer by screening all of the possible zzso pairs in three consecutive zzso First, in zzso analysis, gene set enrichment analysis is carried out for all zzso zzso Second, in zzso analysis, information zzso similarity on GO is calculated for zzso pairs screened from the former zzso Third, in zzso analysis, zzso enrichment analysis is performed for zzso pairs screened from the second zzso In this study, we totally included zzso zzso and 25 cancer zzso As a result, 94 zzso were identified with robust association with 17 types of zzso Meanwhile, 83 pathways with relevance to both zzso and cancer were also singled zzso This framework provides an effective way to narrow down zzso for cancer and to pinpoint corresponding zzso
