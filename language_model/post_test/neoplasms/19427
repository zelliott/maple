To investigate the relationship between the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso development and zzso of human gastric zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of breast, and lung zzso 

Using tissue zzso by zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso we examined the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in 62 specimens of human gastric zzso and 62 specimens of zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso in 120 specimens of zzso zzso of breast and 20 specimens of normal breast zzso the expression of zzso zzso in 72 specimens of human lung cancer and 23 specimens of normal tissue adjacent to zzso 

The expression of zzso zzso in the zzso of gastric and zzso zzso was not significantly different from that in the normal zzso adjacent to cancer zzso and was not associated with the invasion of tumor and the pathology grade of zzso zzso However, the expression of zzso zzso was correlated zzso to the zzso zzso zzso of gastric and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso in the zzso of gastric and zzso zzso was significantly different from that in the normal zzso adjacent to cancer zzso zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso of gastric and zzso zzso only, the expression of zzso was significantly associated with the zzso zzso zzso invasion and pathological grade of the tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso of breast, the expression of zzso and zzso was significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso and invasion zzso However, neither of them was expressed in the normal breast zzso In addition, the expression of zzso was closely related to the degree of cell differentiation of zzso zzso of breast zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso zzso was closely related to the degree of cell differentiation zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso but the expression of zzso gene was not related to sex, age, and type of zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso of zzso and zzso and low expression of zzso zzso have a higher zzso zzso zzso rate and zzso In addition, zzso of zzso is closely related to the degree of cell zzso zzso of the three genes is able to provide a reliable index to evaluate the invasion and zzso of tumor zzso
