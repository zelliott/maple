The continuous flow of molecular genetic information has cautiously started zzso into clinical practice changing the future landscape of the clinical management of zzso zzso zzso analysis for individuals at familial risk and testing zzso surgical or zzso preventive intervention can protect from zzso zzso zzso and stomach cancer and reduce zzso Research is focusing now on the development of effective zzso to replace zzso surgery for improving quality of life and to provide novel targeted therapies for zzso cancer zzso The zzso staging system and conventional zzso factors have led clinical decisions on zzso therapy for decades improving survival in patients with zzso zzso However, current staging methods and therapeutic decisions remain zzso Patients with zzso cancer who are at low risk of recurrence could be spared the toxicity of systemic treatment if clearly zzso while others at high risk of distant recurrence could get zzso benefit if therapy matched the molecular genetic profile of either the host or the zzso With the establishment of validated molecular analysis techniques it is believed that clinical zzso will gradually overtake zzso by their capacity to form more accurate zzso systems and delineate better zzso of response to specific zzso Areas of cancer research such as zzso zzso analysis, tumor zzso zzso gene expression profile linked targeted therapy, cancer stem cells, circulating cancer cells and zzso zzso keep on producing promising data which is believed to refine future preventive and early intervention strategies on an individual zzso Today these zzso strategies are in a transition phase prior to full zzso into clinical zzso At present they wait for the results of large-scale prospective validation studies which compare molecular against zzso zzso It is anticipated that molecular genetic zzso when implemented in clinical practice will considerably improve both biologically guided therapeutic decisions and clinical zzso
