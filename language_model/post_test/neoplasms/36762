In children it is very important to zzso zzso harvesting and to reduce the number of zzso per zzso The value of zzso peripheral blood zzso cell concentration as a predictor of zzso yield was studied in 23 pediatric patients with zzso and zzso zzso in order to zzso duration of zzso zzso 

The patients underwent 25 stem-cell zzso episodes with zzso alone and 40 zzso zzso zzso zzso blood and harvested zzso cell zzso were analyzed by means of flow zzso 

Using linear zzso analysis, a highly significant correlation was found between the peripheral blood zzso cell count and the zzso zzso patient body weight collected on the zzso day zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso The results indicate that at least 1 zzso zzso zzso cells can be harvested during one zzso procedure in all patients if the zzso blood zzso cell count is zzso or zzso zzso and a zzso cell target of zzso or zzso 5 zzso zzso is achieved in at least zzso of patients if this value is zzso or zzso 50 zzso zzso processing a median blood volume of zzso zzso zzso zzso over a median time of zzso minutes zzso zzso 

Our results suggest that the number of zzso cells harvested in a single zzso zzso can be predicted from the measurement of peripheral blood zzso cell concentration on the collection zzso
