The zzso zzso of zzso zzso is common in medical examinations of the zzso tract conducted using zzso zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine the effects of a zzso pump inhibitor zzso on the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 

A total of 130 patients examined from July 2007 to October 2008 were included in the final zzso A zzso was administered orally prior to zzso in 65 zzso The remaining 65 patients underwent zzso without administration of the zzso The assessments used visual and quantitative zzso 

Visual evaluation showed that zzso zzso zzso in the stomach was significantly reduced zzso zzso zzso in the zzso group compared with the control zzso The quantitative evaluation also revealed a significant reduction in the maximum standardized zzso values zzso in the stomach in the zzso group compared with the control group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the colon showed a decreasing trend on visual evaluation in the zzso group compared with the control group, and the quantitative evaluation found a significant reduction in the zzso zzso zzso in the colon in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso 

The oral administration of a zzso was effective for reducing the zzso zzso of the zzso in the zzso zzso However, based on the error associated with zzso zzso a quantitative evaluation should therefore be combined with the visual zzso
