zzso or zzso sampling of a zzso zzso suspect or zzso for zzso either primary or zzso is always mandatory for indicating and planning the therapeutic zzso zzso zzso needle biopsy is the most used technique for obtaining cellular or tissue samples, as it is zzso easy, reliable and less expensive than other zzso The aim of this paper is to evaluate the efficacy of zzso biopsy in responding to the clinical query with a diagnostic result, and to zzso the different factors that might influence the diagnostic zzso of the sampled cellular or tissue zzso 

The results of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso obtained by zzso US guided technique in patients with a zzso suspect for zzso were evaluated in terms of zzso or zzso in obtaining a zzso zzso The results were zzso with regard to the site of the zzso the sampling method zzso or zzso and the expertise of the operator (in terms of number of formerly executed zzso 

The difference in zzso of zzso vs zzso sampling resulted statistically significant zzso vs zzso zzso The operator's former experience resulted the most important factor in determining the success of the zzso The operators with an experience rate below 50 former procedure have, in fact, obtained inadequate material more than twice zzso vs zzso compared to the more experienced zzso the difference was statistically significant for zzso zzso 

The period of technical learning of operators may be considered adequate after a personal experience of almost 50 procedures learning or over for zzso zzso while the apprenticeship is continuous and progressive for zzso of sampling by zzso
