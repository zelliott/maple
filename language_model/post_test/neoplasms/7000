The statins zzso zzso A zzso zzso were proven to be effective zzso agents against cardiovascular zzso Recent reports demonstrate an zzso effect induced by the statins through zzso of cell zzso induction of zzso or zzso of zzso These effects are due to suppression of the zzso zzso leading to depletion of various downstream products that play an essential role in cell cycle zzso cell zzso and membrane zzso Recent evidence suggests a shared zzso fingerprint between embryonic stem cells, cancer cells, and cancer stem zzso zzso targets of zzso zzso zzso and zzso are more frequently zzso in certain zzso In the absence of bona fide cancer stem cell lines, human embryonic stem cells, which have similar properties to cancer and cancer stem cells, have been an excellent model throwing light on the zzso affects of various putative zzso zzso It was shown that key cellular functions in zzso abnormal zzso and zzso cancer cells and human embryonic stem cells are inhibited by the statins and this is zzso via a suppression of this zzso zzso The strategy for treatment of zzso may thus be the targeting of a putative cancer stem cell within the tumor with specific agents such as the statins with or without zzso The statins may thus play a dual zzso role as a zzso drug for the prevention of heart disease and as an zzso agent to prevent certain zzso This review examines the relationship between the zzso stem cells, and certain zzso
