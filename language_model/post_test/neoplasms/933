Response evaluation criteria in solid zzso zzso were introduced as a means to zzso zzso response with no definition of the minimum number of zzso This study was conducted in order to evaluate discrepancies between full assessments based on either all target zzso or fewer zzso zzso evaluation was performed on separate occasions based on between one and seven of the target zzso with simultaneous assessment of zzso zzso 99 patients were zzso 38 patients demonstrated progressive disease, in zzso of whom it was a result of the appearance of new zzso or unequivocal progress in zzso zzso 32 patients showed stable disease, with 8 having results that differed when 1-3 target zzso were zzso 22 cases were considered as having partial regression, with only 1 case differing when performing 1-3 target zzso zzso Seven cases demonstrated complete zzso The number of zzso cases increased gradually from measuring three zzso to one target zzso The average number of available target zzso among those with discrepancies was zzso which was significantly higher than those demonstrating zzso zzso zzso zzso In conclusion, measuring fewer than four target zzso might cause discrepancies when more than five target zzso are zzso
