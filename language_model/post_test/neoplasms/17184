Here we report that zzso a novel checkpoint zzso zzso zzso enhances the activity of zzso by disabling the zzso and zzso zzso checkpoints following DNA zzso Using a focused library of 51 zzso agents, we undertook a systematic screen using three different cell lines to determine which zzso have their activity enhanced when combined with zzso We found that zzso was most effective at enhancing activity of zzso zzso zzso however, there was a surprisingly wide range of activity within each class of zzso zzso next, selected six different therapeutic agents and screened these in combination with zzso across a panel of cell zzso This revealed a preference for enhanced zzso of select agents within tumor types, as, for instance, zzso zzso enhanced the activity of zzso only in melanoma cell zzso Additionally, although zzso zzso status was important for the overall response to combinations with some zzso our data indicate that this alone was insufficient to predict zzso We finally compared the ability of a structurally related zzso zzso zzso to enhance the in zzso activity of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso significantly enhanced activity of only zzso in zzso suggesting that strong zzso in zzso can translate into zzso in zzso In conclusion, our results show that selection of an appropriate agent to combine with a zzso inhibitor needs to be carefully evaluated in the context of the genetic background and tumor type in which it will be zzso
