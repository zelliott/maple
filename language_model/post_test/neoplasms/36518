Loss of function of the zzso tumor zzso gene by point zzso is the most commonly detected genetic zzso in human zzso There is growing evidence that amplification and zzso of the zzso gene are alternative mechanisms that also lead to functional zzso of zzso While zzso zzso and zzso amplification have been reported to occur in zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of zzso in other pediatric solid tumors is not zzso We therefore tested a series of other pediatric solid tumors for zzso gene zzso zzso amplification could not be detected in specimens from 40 zzso tumors, 15 zzso 12 zzso or 4 zzso zzso To determine whether zzso amplification was an alternative mechanism of zzso zzso in adult zzso that frequently possess zzso zzso 68 samples of zzso cell zzso of the upper zzso zzso zzso of which were previously shown to contain zzso zzso were also tested for zzso zzso zzso amplification did not occur in any of the tumor specimens zzso These findings suggest that zzso amplification may only occur in a limited subset of human zzso Loss of function of zzso may be an essential event in human zzso If so, then other mechanisms of zzso zzso must occur in those tumors that exhibit neither zzso zzso nor zzso zzso
