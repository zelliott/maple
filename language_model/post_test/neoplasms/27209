In recent years there has been an outburst of interest regarding the employment of zzso for biomedical zzso Among the different types, such as zzso organic, biological and hybrid systems, virus based zzso have become a popular field of zzso zzso are able to form organized structures by molecular self assembly of repetitive building blocks, which implies non zzso interactions of protein zzso to form the zzso structure of viral zzso Plant virus based systems, in particular, are among the most advanced and exploited for their potential use as zzso structured zzso and zzso Plant viruses have a size particularly suitable for zzso applications and can offer several zzso In fact, they are structurally uniform, zzso zzso and easy to zzso Moreover, many are the examples regarding zzso of plant virus based zzso by means of modification of their external surface and by loading cargo molecules into their internal zzso This plasticity in terms of zzso engineering is the ground on which zzso payload zzso and targeted delivery can be fully zzso This review aims primarily to zzso the most important plant virus based zzso systems through their recent applications in zzso such as zzso display for vaccine development and targeted delivery for diagnosis or zzso In addition, their production in the most commonly used plant propagation and expression systems will be also zzso
