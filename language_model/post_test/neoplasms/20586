In contemporary medicine cancer has an exceptionally important role, even though it is not a new zzso zzso are found in all animals and plants, and today are more frequent than before, when they were found predominantly in advanced zzso The frequency occurrence depends of many factors, and it is more frequent in countries with higher degree of civilization, what is the consequence of zzso of other diseases as well as more pronounced zzso leading to in proper zzso many sources of intoxication with zzso factors arising from environmental pollution, and even by the use of some diagnostic and therapeutic zzso Cancer is the result of zzso in cell growth and zzso In the appearance and spreading of tumors many factors are zzso In the Department of Experimental and Clinical Oncology of the Institute for Oncology and zzso we in the first place investigated the role of zzso hormones and central nervous system, predominantly in experimental conditions, based on the investigations on animals, the in zzso investigations is tissue cultures and some disturbances which are found in blood of patients with zzso As in the processes of zzso the immune system has in important role, in the zzso investigations we primarily investigated parameters of the status of the immune system in patients with zzso zzso The number and function of particular cell zzso of the immune system was investigated, namely T and B zzso and their zzso zzso cells and zzso In the majority of analyzed patients with breast and lung cancer, zzso diseases and other zzso it was shown that the majority of them had a decreased number of immune cells that correlated with the clinical advances of disease and applied zzso zzso However, it was shown that the function of these cells, primarily zzso but also of T zzso was markedly decreased even before changes in the cell number, indicating that a functional impairment is present even before the cell number decrease and zzso to the advancement of the zzso As the results of exploring of investigation of the zzso status indicate the concrete defects in the function of the separate components of the immune system, these findings make it possible to direct zzso for the correction of existing zzso The activity and pathways of mechanisms of zzso cells and the possibility of their zzso were also zzso Also, the possibility of the application of zzso in the precise zzso of some zzso was zzso The role in zzso was investigated in tumors whose appearance, growth and spreading is zzso One of the zzso tumors is breast zzso It was shown that they are significantly dependent on zzso and growth factor presence, zzso content, and that these characteristics can change during the disease and do not have to be identical in their zzso Numerous investigations that we performed were in the in zzso conditions, zzso in cell zzso The obtained data show how some tumor cells react to applied agents, zzso and zzso However their effect in zzso is very often different, as in the in zzso conditions many other factors are involved, suggesting a need for further investigations of these zzso The role of the central nervous system zzso in zzso in experimental animals exposed to chemical zzso zzso with simultaneous treatment of the zzso system was zzso It was shown that zzso expressed their influence on zzso by regulating the brain zzso as well as by direct influence on the zzso processes during cell development and zzso The obtained results will direct our further investigations toward obtaining zzso for receptors for zzso and zzso zzso of zzso gene into tumor cell cultures and genes for zzso and zzso At the same time we will work on isolation of zzso melanoma tumor zzso and construction of a vaccine using some zzso and zzso We will try to introduce appropriate zzso in the zzso
