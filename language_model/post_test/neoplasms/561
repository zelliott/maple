zzso studies of zzso zzso were performed on 18 patients divided into three groups: seven patients were given zzso zzso by rapid zzso five patients received the drug zzso and six patients were treated by continuous zzso infusion for 96 zzso The results showed rapid zzso injection to be zzso by high early levels of drug achieved both in plasma and bone zzso with a rapid fall zzso Administration of zzso zzso gave rise to erratic plasma values due to greater zzso in zzso whereas zzso zzso infusions showed constant levels of the drug in plasma and significantly zzso to zzso less zzso in bone zzso The main difference observed between rapid injection and slow infusion in the zzso of the drug was the very high level of zzso reached by rapid injection in plasma and bone zzso which was of short duration zzso when compared to the low sustained levels observed during zzso This zzso zzso profile is consistent with the reported absence of zzso in prolonged infusion and may be related to the zzso lower levels of zzso achieved in bone zzso
