zzso zzso zzso C zzso represents a new target class for the discovery of zzso While many of the current generation of zzso agents function by directly binding to zzso zzso or cell surface zzso the disruption of zzso zzso interactions zzso by zzso zzso is an zzso avenue for zzso cancer zzso One such example is the zzso domain of zzso Previously we developed a molecular probe, the zzso zzso zzso zzso which diminished proliferation of pancreatic cancer zzso We have expanded upon that discovery using a chemical modification approach and here report a series of zzso side zzso zzso that target the zzso zzso domain in zzso and in zzso These peptides exhibit significant activity against pancreatic and breast zzso both in cellular and animal zzso zzso zzso bearing two zzso aromatic units on alternate side zzso was found to be the most active compound, with pronounced zzso of zzso zzso We zzso that these organic zzso zzso extend the productive reach of the zzso beyond the zzso binding pocket, which defines the limit of accessibility for the native zzso sequences that the zzso domain has evolved to zzso Cell zzso is achieved with zzso zzso using zzso rather than a larger zzso zzso zzso zzso This, in conjunction with zzso of targeting through side chain zzso has yielded an approach that will allow the discovery and development of next-generation cellular zzso for zzso zzso as well as for other zzso zzso
