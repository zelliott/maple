The change from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso is a safe alternative in transplant patients with zzso zzso whereas the results of conversion for chronic zzso zzso zzso are controversial, depending on the zzso score, degree of zzso and zzso zzso rate zzso Our aim in this study was to compare zzso zzso zzso blood pressure zzso effects, and anemia after switching to zzso zzso among zzso transplant recipients with CAN versus zzso 

Fifty-five kidney transplant recipients with conversion from zzso to zzso zzso to CAN or zzso were analyzed for the variables at 6 months before, at the time of, and at 6 months and 1, 2, and 3 years after the switch to zzso 

There were no differences between CAN and zzso in the slope of estimated zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso at 1 year zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso and at 2 years zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso The values of zzso zzso zzso zzso before zzso zzso 136 vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as at 1 zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and at 2 years after conversion zzso zzso 430 vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso showed some significant differences, as did the use of both zzso agents, zzso zzso inhibitor and zzso zzso blocker at the moment of switch zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso at 1 year zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and at 2 years zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso There were no differences in graft survival zzso zzso P zzso zzso By zzso zzso analysis, the best zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso at 2 years was zzso zzso zzso at the moment of switch to zzso zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso 

The evolution of zzso damage was more important in the CAN group requiring greater use of 2 zzso zzso for control of zzso We probably need zzso and zzso zzso to show which patients with CAN will show a bad evolution after the change to zzso
