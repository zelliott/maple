Early zzso zzso obstruction is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality after zzso zzso We evaluated the impact of patient zzso patient zzso pathology, zzso site, surgical technique, admission type, and teaching hospital status on the zzso of zzso zzso obstruction after zzso zzso 

Using the zzso zzso Sample database, we examined the clinical data of patients who underwent zzso zzso from 2006 to zzso zzso analyses were performed to identify factors zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

A total of zzso patients underwent zzso zzso during this zzso Overall, the rate of zzso zzso obstruction was zzso zzso zzso zzso vs emergent zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso obstruction was less frequent after zzso procedures compared with open procedures zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso Using zzso zzso analysis, zzso disease zzso odds ratio zzso zzso zzso emergent surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso age older than 65 years zzso zzso zzso female sex zzso zzso zzso history of alcohol abuse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peripheral vascular disease zzso zzso zzso left zzso zzso zzso zzso chronic lung disease zzso zzso zzso open procedure zzso zzso zzso African-American race zzso zzso zzso and teaching hospital zzso zzso zzso were associated with a higher risk of zzso zzso zzso There was no association between hypertension, diabetes, zzso heart failure, chronic zzso failure, liver disease, zzso smoking, zzso or total zzso and early zzso zzso 

Early zzso obstruction is a relatively common complication after zzso zzso zzso disease patients had a zzso higher zzso of early zzso zzso and emergent surgery and zzso were relevant zzso of early zzso zzso
