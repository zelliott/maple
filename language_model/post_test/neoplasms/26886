To ascertain prevalence of peripheral sensory and motor zzso and to evaluate zzso in relation to zzso 

zzso Jude Lifetime zzso zzso a clinical follow-up study designed to evaluate adverse late effects in adult survivors of childhood zzso 

A children's research zzso 

zzso required treatment for an zzso solid zzso between 1962 and 2002, age zzso 18 years, zzso 10 years zzso and no history of zzso zzso zzso zzso were included in the evaluation with a median age of 32 years and a median time from diagnosis of 25 zzso 

Not zzso 

zzso exposure measures were cumulative doses of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with scores zzso 1 on the sensory zzso of the zzso Total zzso zzso were classified with prevalent sensory zzso Those with zzso zzso scores of zzso for zzso strength were classified with prevalent motor zzso Participants completed the zzso walk test zzso the Timed Up & Go test zzso and the zzso Organization Test zzso 

The prevalence of sensory and motor impairment was zzso and zzso zzso zzso exposure was associated with an increased risk of motor impairment zzso odds ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso without evidence for a dose zzso Platinum exposure was associated with increased risk of sensory impairment zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso without evidence of a dose zzso zzso impairment was associated with poor endurance zzso zzso zzso zzso and mobility zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso exposure may increase risk for long-term motor and sensory zzso zzso zzso with sensory impairment are at increased risk for functional performance zzso
