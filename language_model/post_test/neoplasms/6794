We take advantage of the special characteristics of human tumors to image tumor response including predicting zzso to specific cancer zzso The zzso zzso of zzso includes increased zzso zzso zzso increased proliferation zzso zzso increased zzso acid zzso as well as other functions such as fatty acid synthesis which have yet to be fully zzso The zzso dependent zzso offer rich opportunities for selective imaging, including zzso that have high affinity for hormone zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tissue specific zzso such as sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso As knowledge of cancer biology has grown, it has become possible to develop zzso which image the client proteins involved in response to specific drugs, zzso zzso zzso for zzso 2 zzso by zzso 90 inhibitor zzso More and more zzso drugs will be used to explore the pharmacology of zzso therapies, such as zzso These may or may not be excellent imaging agents, but as zzso or even true zzso for specific zzso drugs, zzso imaging through zzso zzso zzso will provide highly useful information, relating cancer pharmacology within the local zzso to treatment zzso
