DNA damage at the base sequence and zzso level is a fundamental cause of zzso and degenerative zzso Multiple zzso and their interactions with the inherited and/or acquired zzso determine DNA damage and zzso instability zzso The challenge is to identify for each individual the combination of zzso and their doses zzso the zzso that zzso zzso stability, including zzso integrity and functionality and DNA zzso Using zzso array systems with zzso analysis zzso of DNA damage, cell death and cell growth, it is possible to zzso on an individual basis, the optimal zzso for DNA damage prevention and cancer growth zzso This knowledge can also be used to improve culture systems for cells used in zzso such as stem cells to ensure that they are not genetically zzso when returned to the zzso Furthermore, this information could be used to design dietary patterns that deliver the zzso combinations and zzso required for preventing DNA damage by zzso zzso or zzso Using this approach, new knowledge could be obtained to identify the dietary restrictions and/or zzso required to control specific zzso which is particularly important given that reliable validated advice is not yet available for those diagnosed with zzso
