zzso zzso analysis holds much promise for zzso analysis, but has as yet seen limited application because of lack of easily used software and the relatively lengthy run times of preferred fitting methods (such as true maximum likelihood and zzso zzso This paper compares three relatively simple choices for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso first stage combined with a zzso second stage zzso joint zzso zzso least squares fitting of first and second stage zzso and zzso penalized zzso zzso These choices can be combined with various methods for zzso the second-stage zzso the two contrasted here are based on first and second-stage zzso zzso and zzso yielded indistinguishable results, and had small sample performance superior to zzso In larger samples there was little practical difference among the zzso Use of zzso zzso to estimate the prior zzso required considerably more zzso than use of second-stage zzso but produced no discernible improvement in zzso zzso zzso All three methods performed well for zzso of zzso parameters but were less satisfactory for zzso of second-stage zzso
