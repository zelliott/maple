To systematically review the best supportive care zzso literature and to evaluate the ethical and zzso zzso issues by using widely acknowledged zzso 

Two search strings that included both cancer and supportive as terms (with random article type, or review or zzso explored databases from 1966 to zzso zzso zzso and papers were reviewed for inclusion criteria, and relevant data were extracted by two independent zzso Data were validated for zzso Ethical and zzso zzso were evaluated by using the criteria derived from the Helsinki zzso of the zzso CONSORT statements for the evaluation of reports of randomized, controlled zzso and the universal requirements for ethical clinical zzso 

zzso published papers were identified that described 32 studies, 20 of which incorporated the design of treatment plus supportive care zzso versus SC alone, and 12 of which incorporated the design of treatment versus zzso Most of the studies had poor compliance to critical Helsinki requirements, to zzso precautions derived from the CONSORT statement for studies involving a zzso arm, and to four of seven universal requirements for ethical clinical zzso 

Lack of rigor in zzso studies has contributed to a generation of research with widespread ethical and zzso zzso Ad hoc SC and lack of zzso of SC delivery may be sources of systematic bias or error in zzso zzso zzso these shortcomings in future studies demands greater vigilance toward these issues by researchers, institutional review zzso editors, and peer zzso Given the prevalence of overlooked problems that are later identified, currently open zzso studies should be reevaluated by institutional review boards and researchers to check for ethical and zzso zzso and identified shortcomings should be zzso
