Advanced zzso materials hold promise for targeted delivery of drugs, with the ability to follow the transport as well as its zzso This should, ideally, be possible with minimum invasive surgery and having no or minimum zzso of the zzso It requires development of newer materials whose physical properties would allow for easy probe, which could carry the therapeutic zzso which will be stable under zzso conditions, and at the same time would be able to zzso barriers to the zzso We report the development of a composite consisting of highly fluorescent zzso zzso and the zzso zzso which could easily be converted into zzso and would form a stable zzso with suicide gene for induction of zzso in cervical cancer zzso The simultaneous red, green, and blue zzso from the zzso provided convenient optical imaging and flow zzso zzso without having to use additional zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso composite could be converted into solid film and be stored with the retention of optical zzso The pH zzso optical properties in the medium were also intact in the films that quickly dissolved in water with retention of zzso
