zzso zzso has been shown to exert zzso mechanisms and effects in experimental zzso We report here the results of a randomized, zzso zzso Phase II zzso trial with zzso in healthy smoking zzso The subjects were supplemented daily with 2 zzso 600 zzso of oral zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso for a period of 6 months, and internal dose markers zzso and zzso zzso zzso fluid zzso urine zzso biologically effective dose markers zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso and biological response markers zzso frequency and antioxidants scavenging zzso were assessed at both zzso and zzso times zzso and zzso zzso Overall, the internal dose markers remained unchanged at zzso as compared with zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso When zzso the biologically effective dose zzso we observed an zzso effect of zzso toward the formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso mean zzso SE; P zzso zzso as well as of zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso There was no effect of zzso on the formation of zzso zzso in peripheral blood zzso or zzso aromatic zzso zzso in mouth zzso zzso cells or zzso zzso Likewise, zzso of the biological response markers showed an zzso effect of zzso on the frequency of zzso in mouth floor and in soft zzso cells zzso zzso zzso versus zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and a stimulating effect of zzso on plasma zzso scavenging capacity zzso zzso 14 versus zzso zzso 19 zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not on zzso fluid zzso scavenging zzso We conclude that zzso has the potential to impact upon tobacco smoke zzso in humans because it can zzso certain zzso zzso in specific zzso
