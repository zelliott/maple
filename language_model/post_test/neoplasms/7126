The zzso zzso is believed to be involved in development, growth, zzso and therapy resistance of many zzso Here we show zzso a member of the inhibitor of zzso protein zzso family, implicated in zzso zzso and the regulation of zzso in cancer cells, exists in a novel zzso pool in zzso zzso Furthermore, we have constructed stable cell lines that provide the zzso pool with either zzso zzso zzso or the previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso which has proven zzso effects in cancer cells but not in normal zzso zzso Cancer cells grown in zzso medium zzso taken from zzso cells absorbed zzso and experienced enhanced protection against zzso zzso These cells also exhibited an increased zzso and zzso potential, suggesting that zzso in the zzso zzso may be directly associated with zzso zzso further supporting zzso function in zzso zzso cancer cells grown in CM taken from the zzso cells began to zzso through a zzso and zzso zzso that was further enhanced by the addition of other zzso and zzso zzso Together our findings suggest a novel zzso function for zzso in the control of cancer aggressiveness and spread, and should result in the genesis of additional cancer treatment zzso
