The zzso of genetic changes is considered as the main factor that determines the development of zzso Recent zzso in zzso and molecular biology led to the discovery of many new molecular markers and to the development of techniques able to monitor these zzso As a consequence, molecular epidemiology has emerged as a powerful approach to study the zzso relationship between the environment, the zzso and the genetic predisposition of each zzso zzso to cancer is determined at different levels such as the genetic zzso of zzso involved in the zzso and zzso of zzso the zzso of genes that maintains the zzso stability, like those involved in DNA repair or zzso zzso and finally the zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso the full assessment of each zzso genetic predisposition is a long and difficult zzso As the zzso of zzso in zzso cells zzso all these zzso its measurement would facilitate the evaluation of the individual predisposition status, provided that a marker common to a large spectrum of zzso could be zzso Our current studies on the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso has revealed that zzso repetitive sequences are zzso hot spots for several major classes of environmental zzso such as aromatic and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We thus consider the possibility that these sequences form a new class of zzso for zzso zzso In order to validate this hypothesis, we designed a sensitive zzso zzso able to detect specific zzso induced by a common food-borne zzso in the colon zzso of rats exposed for a short period to this zzso This zzso is sensitive enough to allow early detection of induced zzso and therefore allows to differentiate between zzso animal and those exposed for a period as short as 1 zzso
