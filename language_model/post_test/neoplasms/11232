It was hypothesized as early as 1986, that the recently discovered common fragile sites could facilitate zzso events, such as deletions and zzso that result in zzso expanded cancer cell populations with specific zzso zzso in specific cancer zzso A natural extension of this hypothesis is that the zzso expansion must be driven by zzso of genes at zzso zzso whose altered functions actually drive zzso zzso Nevertheless, when the zzso gene was discovered at zzso the most active common zzso fragile region, and proposed as an example of a tumor zzso gene altered by zzso zzso and zzso a wave of reports suggested that the zzso gene was altered in cancer simply because it was in a fragile region and not because it had contributed to the zzso expansion, thus turning the original hypothesis upside zzso Now, after nearly ten years and more than 500 zzso reports, it is apparent that zzso is an important tumor zzso gene and that there are genes at other fragile regions that contribute significantly to development of zzso A second fragile gene with a demonstrated role in cancer development is the zzso gene on zzso zzso zzso to the zzso gene contribute to development of hormone responsive and other zzso zzso of our recent studies of these two fragile tumor zzso genes were summarized at the first zzso meeting in zzso zzso zzso
