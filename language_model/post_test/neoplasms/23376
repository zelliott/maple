In the past ten years, long zzso zzso zzso have been shown to comprise a major part of the zzso zzso and are predicted from their highly specific expression patterns, to play a role in regulating zzso gene expression in development and zzso Many zzso particularly those lying in imprinted zzso are predominantly zzso zzso transcripts that can also show a low level of zzso and both the zzso and spliced transcript have the potential to be zzso Three known imprinted zzso zzso have been shown to silence from three to ten genes in zzso in imprinted gene zzso We review here the potential for functional zzso zzso defined here as zzso zzso to play a wider zzso role in the zzso zzso This potential has been underestimated by the inability of current zzso technology to zzso zzso zzso zzso
