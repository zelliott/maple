We analyzed zzso from 28 patients with various types of zzso for the occurrence of zzso against zzso A of zzso zzso and two zzso zzso A total of 27 of these individuals were zzso or infected with zzso zzso at one time or another during the study, whereas the remaining patient was zzso with four zzso zzso species of zzso zzso were obtained from several of these patients before zzso zzso colonization or infection of these individuals was zzso which provided an opportunity to evaluate their responsiveness to zzso zzso as they acquired the zzso zzso A was zzso from culture zzso zzso of strain zzso and the two zzso were zzso from an isolate of strain zzso a highly zzso strain originally recovered from the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso A and the two zzso were detected in these zzso and zzso which contained relatively high zzso levels to zzso A afforded mice complete protection against lethal challenges with this zzso zzso analyses showed that patients infected with zzso zzso had consistently higher zzso levels zzso less than zzso to the zzso than patients who were zzso with this zzso Also, patients zzso with zzso zzso possessed significantly higher zzso levels zzso less than zzso to these three zzso than zzso hospitalized zzso zzso type 1 was the strain most commonly isolated from these patients zzso but colonization or infection due to this zzso usually resulted in the production of low levels of zzso to zzso zzso However, infections with zzso type 7 organisms were always associated with zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso These results indicated that potentially toxic products were elaborated during the course of zzso colonization and infection with zzso zzso
