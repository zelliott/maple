We studied a panel of 21 human tumor and other cell lines, mainly of zzso origin, for the expression of zzso zzso by an indirect zzso zzso using zzso zzso Four of the lines, 2 zzso a breast tumor cell zzso zzso and a colon zzso zzso showed no zzso reaction with the zzso The levels of binding in another breast tumor line zzso and a colon zzso line zzso were much zzso These cell lines plus some of the zzso positive lines from the panel were studied by zzso of zzso cell zzso Two mechanisms for zzso of the zzso zzso levels at the cell surface were zzso In the zzso and one breast tumor line, beta 2 zzso zzso zzso was expressed but little or no zzso B, or C zzso were zzso The other zzso negative lines had defects similar to that in the previously reported zzso zzso cell line zzso In these lines, zzso zzso were produced but did not appear at the cell surface because beta zzso was not zzso The absence of zzso zzso from the cell surface is presumed to afford protection against zzso immune attack whether naturally as against the zzso during pregnancy or in abnormal situations against certain zzso
