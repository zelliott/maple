Women who were cancer survivors for less than 2 years reported the most functional limitations, but long-term (5 or more zzso cancer survivors remained more likely than cohort members who had not had cancer to report that they were unable to do heavy household work zzso of zzso zzso survivors, versus zzso of 23 zzso who never had cancer, multivariable OR zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso unable to walk a half mile zzso versus zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and unable to walk up and down stairs zzso versus zzso OR zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso The increased prevalence of functional limitations was apparent for zzso survivors of breast cancer and also certain other zzso
