Using common alcohol consumption categories, to conduct a pooled analysis of six ongoing large-scale cohort studies in Japan in order to produce concrete estimates of the quantitative contribution of alcohol consumption to zzso and major causes of mortality in the Japanese zzso 

Of the zzso subjects, there were zzso deaths during zzso zzso of zzso Using a zzso model, we conducted a zzso of the zzso of each alcohol consumption category in each study, thereby obtaining pooled estimates for the risk of total and major causes of mortality due to alcohol zzso 

There was a zzso or zzso association for the risk of total and major causes of mortality in men, and the risk of total and heart disease mortality in zzso Compared with zzso there was a significantly lower risk for total mortality at an alcohol consumption level of zzso zzso cancer mortality at zzso zzso heart disease mortality at zzso zzso and cerebrovascular disease mortality at zzso zzso in men, and for total mortality at zzso zzso in zzso In addition, mortality risk increased zzso with rising alcohol dose among zzso It was estimated that zzso of total zzso zzso of cancer zzso zzso of heart disease mortality and zzso of cerebrovascular disease mortality in men, but only zzso of these risks in women, could be prevented by reducing alcohol consumption to zzso zzso in men and zzso zzso in zzso 

Maintaining alcohol consumption below 46 zzso in men and 23 zzso in women appears to zzso the risks of mortality in the Japanese zzso
