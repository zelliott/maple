It is now well established that zzso is zzso in its target zzso through the modifications of both side chain and zzso The zzso zzso zzso is the side chain modification zzso through which zzso is zzso into zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is the zzso modification zzso through which zzso is zzso into zzso During the past two decades, a great number of vitamin D zzso were zzso by altering the structure of both side chain and zzso of zzso with the aim to generate novel vitamin D compounds that inhibit proliferation and induce differentiation of various types of normal and cancer cells without causing significant zzso Previously, we used some of these zzso as molecular zzso to examine how changes in zzso structure would affect its target tissue zzso Recently, several zzso zzso of zzso with unique biological activity profiles were zzso Two of the zzso zzso 117 and zzso 515 lack the zzso of the zzso skeleton of zzso zzso 117 contains the same side chain as that of zzso while zzso 515 contains an altered side chain with a zzso modification combined with zzso at zzso and zzso zzso it is unknown how the removal of zzso from the zzso skeleton of zzso would affect its target tissue zzso In the present study, we compared the zzso fate of zzso 117 and zzso 515 with that of zzso in both the isolated zzso rat zzso which expresses only the zzso zzso zzso and rat zzso cells zzso zzso which express both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results of our present study indicate that zzso 117 is zzso like zzso into polar zzso via the zzso zzso zzso in both rat kidney and zzso 106 zzso As expected, zzso 515 with altered side chain structure is not zzso via the zzso zzso zzso Unlike in rat zzso both zzso 117 and zzso 515 are also zzso into less polar zzso in zzso 106 zzso These zzso displayed zzso and zzso characteristics consistent with zzso zzso and were zzso assigned as zzso zzso of zzso 117 and zzso zzso In zzso we report that removal of the zzso from the zzso skeleton of zzso does not alter its target tissue metabolism zzso
