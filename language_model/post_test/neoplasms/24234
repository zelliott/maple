Solid tumors usually exhibit a poorly organized zzso and a zzso energy metabolism which result in an zzso pH and large hypoxic areas in the tumor zzso A lot of cell biological data support the hypothesis that such zzso conditions are promoters of the zzso of zzso cells, zzso of the immune response, and zzso for tumor cell zzso Our experimental in zzso analyses and computer simulations indicate that the efficiency of zzso and classical methods for cancer treatment might be improved if a zzso zzso could be restored which reflects that found in normal zzso In order to monitor and manipulate the tumor zzso we suggest utilizing zzso feedback zzso which are controlled by zzso zzso These zzso zzso play the role of zzso zzso and can be implanted directly at the sites of zzso tumors and zzso where they can zzso normal zzso zzso The drug application scheme can be precisely controlled by an integrated zzso The paper summarizes the current state of development of such zzso feedback zzso and outlines their potential for zzso cancer zzso
