We sought to evaluate differences in zzso zzso between National Cancer Institute zzso and other centers and determine whether the level of available evidence influences the degree of variation in zzso 

The National Cancer Institute recognizes centers of excellence in the advancement of cancer zzso These zzso cancer centers have been shown to have better outcomes for cancer zzso however, little work has compared surgical process zzso 

A retrospective cohort study was conducted using zzso zzso and End zzso registry linked to Medicare claims zzso Fee-for-service Medicare patients with a definitive surgical zzso for breast, zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso diagnosed between 2000 and 2005 were zzso zzso data from 1999 to 2006 were zzso Our main outcome measure was zzso zzso at zzso centers compared to other institutions, zzso by level of evidence as graded by National Comprehensive Cancer Network zzso zzso 

All centers achieved at least zzso and often zzso zzso with guidelines based on level 1 zzso zzso rates for guidelines with zzso evidence ranged from zzso to zzso and were higher at zzso zzso The adjusted zzso ratios for category 1 guidelines were between zzso and zzso whereas zzso ratios for guidelines with zzso evidence ranged from zzso to zzso primarily favoring zzso zzso 

When strong evidence supports a zzso there is little variation in practice between zzso centers and other hospitals, suggesting that all are providing appropriate zzso Variation in care may exist, however, for guidelines that are based on expert consensus rather than strong zzso This suggests that future efforts to generate needed evidence on the optimal approach to care may also reduce institutional zzso
