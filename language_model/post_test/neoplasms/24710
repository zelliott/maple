The human zzso resistance gene 1 zzso encodes a plasma membrane zzso zzso that functions as an zzso pump for various structurally unrelated zzso zzso We have identified two zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in peripheral blood cell samples from Japanese cancer zzso Two patients carried the zzso zzso zzso that encodes zzso zzso whereas a further two carried zzso zzso that encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso zzso carrying either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and selected with zzso The resulting zzso mixed populations of zzso cells were designated as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The cell surface expression of zzso zzso in zzso cells could not be detected by zzso cell zzso although low expression of zzso zzso was found by Western zzso zzso zzso expression levels in zzso cells were slightly lower than the corresponding zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso By zzso analysis, both zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso as a zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was zzso as a zzso zzso zzso cells did not show any drug resistance unlike zzso zzso Moreover, a zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso species lacks zzso zzso Taken together, we conclude from these data that zzso zzso expresses a zzso zzso and this is therefore the first description of such a zzso zzso We contend that the zzso zzso zzso may affect the zzso of zzso zzso agents in patients carrying this zzso
