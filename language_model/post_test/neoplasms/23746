zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been shown to inhibit relevant tumor growth in zzso and in animal zzso Recently, zzso zzso zzso have been developed which target zzso zzso cells via one zzso binding site and tumor zzso by the other zzso For example, the zzso zzso possesses specificity for zzso and zzso gamma zzso the low affinity zzso gamma zzso expressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso and large zzso zzso zzso The human zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to be amplified in breast, zzso lung and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso has been shown to be an important zzso indicator in breast and zzso zzso The restricted expression of the zzso zzso product in normal human zzso and the wide distribution of zzso expression in such tumors may justify attempts to use an appropriately constructed zzso in clinical zzso In this report we have addressed this issue by zzso evaluating the expression of zzso zzso product in a variety of zzso tumors utilizing zzso and the zzso zzso parent of zzso zzso Among the studied zzso zzso expression was detected in zzso of primary zzso stained with zzso and in zzso of those stained with zzso In the group of zzso tumors, zzso zzso was detected in zzso of cases by zzso and in zzso by zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
