zzso zzso tumor necrosis zzso zzso and zzso zzso are important zzso of the inflammatory response in human zzso The aim of this study was to determine the relationship between serum levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso children with zzso disease, and relate these levels to zzso of fever, presence of zzso and the effect of zzso zzso 

110 zzso episodes in 70 children with zzso disease were zzso zzso analyses were performed with sensitive zzso methods using double zzso zzso 

zzso had a sensitivity of zzso in detecting zzso in children with fever and zzso zzso This sensitivity was not influenced by the presence of zzso or newly diagnosed zzso A positive correlation between zzso and the zzso levels on the following day was observed zzso zzso zzso zzso was elevated in zzso of the episodes and mean levels were significantly higher in zzso zzso but lower in zzso zzso zzso was elevated in zzso of cases and correlated strongly with mean zzso zzso 

zzso is a sensitive and early predictor of bacterial infection in both zzso and zzso zzso children with zzso It is more sensitive than zzso in detecting zzso but the zzso value is too low to allow zzso levels to influence initial treatment decisions in patients with zzso zzso production seems to be impaired in zzso children and serum zzso cannot be employed as an indicator of bacterial zzso
