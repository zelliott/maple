The large zzso and zzso zzso zzso of oral zzso is well zzso We investigated whether dose zzso would result in less zzso Fifteen patients (five in each zzso zzso were given either 100 zzso once daily, 50 zzso twice daily, or 25 zzso four times daily for 21 zzso On days 1, 8, and 15 blood samples were collected during 24 hours to measure plasma zzso zzso Hematologic toxicity was determined by weekly zzso and zzso counts and expressed as the relative decrease in these zzso zzso administration of zzso 100 zzso correlated with a significantly higher peak concentration than was observed with the other two zzso The mean area under the concentration versus time curve zzso and mean time with a plasma zzso concentration above 1 zzso were similar with the three zzso Peak plasma zzso zzso and times with plasma concentration above 1 zzso correlated significantly with the relative decrease in zzso but not zzso zzso Large zzso and zzso zzso of zzso parameters was observed with all three zzso These data do not support zzso a daily zzso zzso zzso Moreover, it does not appear useful to adjust oral zzso doses based on zzso data obtained once during a prolonged treatment zzso Finally, adjusting oral zzso doses based on zzso toxicity seems zzso to decrease the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
