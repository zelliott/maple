zzso a member of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso family, is a surface zzso best known for its capacity to initiate multifaceted zzso signals in normal B cells and zzso cells zzso zzso treatment approaches have been considered for the experimental therapy of human zzso zzso and multiple zzso based on findings that zzso binding by its natural zzso zzso zzso led to growth zzso of zzso B zzso Recent studies also exploited the selective expression of the zzso zzso on human zzso and zzso tumors but not on most normal, zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso on human breast, zzso zzso zzso non small cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells was found to produce a direct zzso effect through cell cycle zzso and/or zzso induction with no overt side effects on their normal zzso zzso treatment also heightened tumor rejection immune responses through DC zzso and by increasing tumor zzso through zzso of zzso zzso expression and zzso production of zzso cancer zzso These zzso features can produce a zzso zzso through which the zzso tumor subset is eliminated by activated zzso zzso T zzso However, the potential risk of systemic inflammation and zzso consequences remains a concern for systemic zzso experimental zzso The promise of zzso as a tumor therapeutic agent to directly zzso tumor cell growth, and indirectly activate zzso immune response, may depend on selective and/or restricted zzso expression within the tumor zzso This may be achieved by zzso cancer vaccines of zzso cancer cells that have been zzso ex zzso with zzso as documented by recently clinical zzso This review summarizes recent findings on zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso tumor treatment approaches, and examines our understanding of the multifaceted molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso
