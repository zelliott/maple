zzso techniques can suppress multiply scattering light and have been demonstrated as an effective tool to improve image quality of superficial zzso where many zzso start to zzso Learning the penetration depth behavior of different polarization imaging techniques is important for their clinical applications in diagnosis of skin zzso In the present paper, we construct a zzso sample consisting of zzso and zzso media and examine zzso using both experiments and zzso Carlo simulations the penetration depths of three different polarization imaging methods, zzso linear differential polarization imaging zzso degree of linear polarization imaging zzso and rotating linear polarization imaging zzso The results show that the contrast zzso of the three techniques are zzso different, but their characteristic depths are all of the order of the transport mean free path length of the top zzso zzso depths of zzso and zzso depend on the incident polarization zzso The characteristic depth of zzso and approximately of zzso at small zzso scales with the transport mean free path zzso The characteristic depth of zzso is almost twice as big as that of zzso and zzso and increases significantly as g zzso
