The major causes of cancer are: 1) smoking, which accounts for about a third of zzso cancer and zzso of lung zzso 2) dietary zzso lack of sufficient amounts of dietary fruits and zzso The quarter of the population eating the fewest fruits and vegetables has double the cancer rate for most types of cancer than the quarter eating the zzso 3) chronic infections, mostly in developing zzso and 4) hormonal factors, influenced primarily by zzso There is no cancer epidemic except for cancer of the lung due to zzso Cancer mortality rates have declined by zzso since 1950 zzso lung zzso Regulatory policy that focuses on traces of synthetic chemicals is based on zzso about animal cancer zzso Recent research indicates that zzso zzso are not zzso Half of all chemicals tested in standard high-dose animal cancer tests, whether occurring naturally or produced zzso are zzso there are high-dose effects in zzso cancer tests that are not relevant to zzso human zzso and which contribute to the high proportion of chemicals that test zzso The focus of regulatory policy is on synthetic zzso although zzso of the chemicals humans zzso are zzso More than 1000 chemicals have been described in zzso 28 have been tested and 19 are zzso zzso Plants in the human diet contain thousands of natural zzso produced by plants to protect themselves from insects and other zzso 63 have been tested and 35 are zzso zzso There is no convincing evidence that synthetic chemical pollutants are important as a cause of human zzso Regulations targeted to eliminate minuscule levels of synthetic chemicals are enormously zzso the Environmental Protection Agency has estimated that environmental regulations cost society $140 zzso Others have estimated that the median toxic control program costs 146 times more per hypothetical zzso saved than the median medical zzso zzso to reduce tiny hypothetical risks has other costs as well: if reducing synthetic pesticides makes fruits and vegetables more expensive, thereby decreasing consumption, then the cancer rate will increase, especially for the zzso The prevention of cancer will come from knowledge obtained from biomedical research, education of the public, and lifestyle changes made by zzso A zzso of priorities in cancer zzso both public and private, seems called zzso
