zzso regulation of zzso zzso receptors zzso is frequent in solid zzso and it is often associated with the acquisition of an aggressive zzso Thus, therapies targeting these receptors have been proposed as molecular approaches to treat human zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso for zzso growth factor zzso controls genetic zzso leading to cell growth, invasion and protection from zzso zzso zzso of zzso in patients affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have provided strong genetic zzso for its role in human zzso moreover, zzso zzso of this zzso as a consequence of different mechanisms such as zzso zzso stimulation or point zzso is frequent in sporadic zzso Several strategies to block the zzso of zzso are under development, such as the use of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso and some of these compounds have already been used in clinical zzso In this review, we will discuss the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso involvement in zzso and present zzso and clinical data obtained with compounds aimed at targeting zzso in the frame of cancer zzso
