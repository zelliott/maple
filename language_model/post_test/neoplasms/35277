The dissemination of tumor cells prior to the surgical zzso of early stage tumors poses a serious risk to the disease free survival of cancer zzso This risk arises from the zzso capacity of these cells to form solid zzso zzso after a prolonged period of zzso exacerbated by the fact that these cells are often zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso the long term survival of cancer patients therefore zzso an understanding of the mechanisms of tumor cell dormancy and the accompanying drug zzso zzso designed to compare the biological behavior of zzso versus zzso zzso of tumor cells provide evidence that there exists a phenomenon of zzso dormancy which may depend on a zzso dialogue between the tumor cell and the tissue zzso Through a combination of zzso cell culture technique and in zzso models investigators are now beginning to zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying this zzso Here we review the results of a series of experiments describing the role of cell zzso events in dictating tumor cell behavior, including the balance between proliferation and zzso and the acquisition of drug zzso
