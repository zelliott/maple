To determine if therapist supervision of an exercise program produced better functional outcomes in zzso stem cell transplant patients than a zzso exercise zzso 

zzso patients who were less than 6 months post zzso stem cell transplant were randomly assigned to either a therapist supervised training group zzso or a zzso training group zzso Training consisted of zzso exercises zzso bicycle zzso versus zzso and resistance exercises zzso zzso weight machines versus zzso band zzso zzso completed physical performance tests zzso fast walk, zzso walk, forward zzso repeated zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso before and after 4 weeks of zzso zzso and zzso outcomes and group differences were analyzed by a Student zzso 

Patients in both groups were similarly zzso at zzso Training increased the zzso walk distance and zzso walk in the supervised group by 12 and zzso respectively, and increased the zzso walk distance by zzso in the zzso group zzso zzso score for worst level of fatigue declined in both groups but not zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso transplant patients derive functional benefits from short-term exercise training regardless of how the training program is zzso zzso zzso the reasons for the low participation rate zzso zzso the zzso characteristics of each exercise supervision style and zzso how best to match patient preference to exercise supervision style remain significant issues in this area of patient delivery zzso
