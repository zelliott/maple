Patients with zzso and zzso zzso are often included in the same study population, even though zzso zzso zzso typically have different presenting symptoms, clinical zzso and zzso This is because the outcomes for patients with zzso zzso are zzso 

Adult patients who underwent surgery for an zzso zzso zzso or zzso between 2007 and 2011 were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hazards zzso analysis was used to identify an association between zzso location with survival and zzso 

Of the zzso patients who underwent zzso zzso surgery, 140 zzso had surgery for zzso zzso A zzso location was associated with poorer survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and increased spinal recurrence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso but not local zzso zzso zzso or zzso recurrence zzso zzso zzso The factors independently associated with prolonged survival for patients with zzso zzso were: decreasing number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreasing tumor size zzso zzso zzso and radiation zzso zzso zzso The factors associated with prolonged local progression free survival were: decreasing tumor size zzso zzso zzso non small cell lung cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso and zzso radiation therapy zzso zzso zzso The factors independently associated with prolonged zzso progression free survival were: age zzso 40 years zzso zzso zzso surgical zzso zzso zzso zzso and whole brain radiation zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso 

Patients with zzso zzso have more distinct clinical presentations and outcomes than patients with zzso zzso The findings of this study may help risk zzso and guide treatment regimens aimed at maximizing outcomes for patients with zzso zzso
