This work describes an independent method to use the zzso zzso zzso CT imaging system for daily monitoring of anatomical changes of cancer patients whose anatomy extends beyond the imaging field of zzso 

The imaging detector response to changes in attenuating media was measured using zzso zzso Weight loss was simulated using an zzso phantom and determining the system's ability to detect the weight zzso Layers of zzso zzso were added to an zzso pelvis phantom and CT simulations of the phantom were conducted, one in which the phantom and zzso were both within the zzso imaging field of view, and another in which the couch was raised so that the zzso was outside the field of zzso zzso treatment plans were developed using the zzso treatment planning system, and successive zzso of the plan were then delivered to the zzso Weight loss was simulated by removing a zzso zzso layer of zzso following each zzso The exit detector zzso were obtained from each zzso and ratios of zzso were calculated relative to a reference zzso for which all zzso was in zzso zzso of ratio zzso were determined and used to correlate with simulated weight zzso Exit detector zzso and ratio zzso were also zzso analyzed for five patients all of whose zzso extended beyond the imaging field of view and all of whom experienced weight variations exceeding zzso during zzso 

Exit detector signal is well correlated to changes in zzso thickness as demonstrated in both slab and zzso phantom zzso Measured and expected signal increases agreed to within less than zzso for simulated weight loss on the zzso zzso Exit detector signals for pelvic patients with significant weight loss variations were consistent with phantom zzso 

The analysis of the ratio zzso for the phantom zzso and real patients indicated that exit detector zzso can be used to detect relative changes in patient anatomy for each fraction as a means of in zzso quality zzso
