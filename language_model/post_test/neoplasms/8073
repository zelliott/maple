There is a common belief that most cancer prevention trials should be restricted to high-risk subjects in order to increase statistical zzso This strategy is appropriate if the ultimate target population is subjects at the same zzso However if the target population is the general population, three assumptions may zzso the decision to enroll high-risk subject instead of zzso subjects from the general population: higher statistical power for the same sample size, lower costs for the same power and type I error, and a correct ratio of benefits to zzso We critically investigate the zzso of these zzso 

We considered each assumption in the context of a simple zzso We investigated statistical power for fixed sample size when the investigators assume that relative risk is zzso over risk group, but when, in reality, risk difference is zzso over risk zzso We investigated possible costs when a trial of high-risk subjects has the same power and type I error as a larger trial of zzso subjects from the general zzso We investigated the ratios of benefit to harms when zzso from high-risk to zzso zzso 

zzso here are zzso First, the increase in statistical power with a trial of high-risk subjects rather than the same number of zzso subjects from the general population assumes that the relative risk is the same for high-risk and zzso zzso However, if the absolute risk difference rather than the relative risk were the same, the power can be less with the high-risk zzso In the analysis of data from a cancer prevention trial, we found that zzso of absolute risk difference over risk groups was nearly as plausible as zzso of relative risk over risk zzso Therefore a zzso assumptions of constant relative risk across risk groups are not zzso limiting zzso of estimates of benefit to the general zzso Second, a trial of high-risk subjects may cost more than a larger trial of average risk subjects with the same power and type I error because of additional recruitment and diagnostic testing to identify high-risk zzso Third, the ratio of benefits to harms may be more favorable in high-risk persons than in zzso persons in the general population, which means that zzso this ratio to the general population would be zzso Thus there is no free lunch when using a trial of high-risk subjects to extrapolate results to the general zzso 

Unless the intervention is targeted to only high-risk subjects, cancer prevention trials should be implemented in the general zzso
