zzso breakage syndrome zzso is a rare zzso zzso syndrome of zzso instability mainly characterized by zzso at birth, combined zzso and predisposition to zzso Due to a founder zzso in the underlying zzso gene zzso the disease is encountered most frequently among Slavic zzso The principal clinical manifestations of the syndrome are: zzso present at birth and progressive with age, zzso facial features, mild growth zzso zzso intellectual zzso and, in zzso zzso zzso Combined cellular and zzso zzso with zzso zzso infections, a strong predisposition to develop zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are other integral manifestations of the zzso The zzso gene codes for zzso which, as part of a DNA repair complex, plays a critical nuclear role wherever zzso DNA ends occur, either zzso or as a result of zzso zzso Laboratory findings include: zzso spontaneous zzso breakage in peripheral T zzso with zzso zzso involving zzso 7 and 14, zzso sensitivity to zzso radiation or zzso as demonstrated in zzso by zzso methods or by colony survival zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso absence of full-length zzso zzso zzso and zzso are common to DNA zzso IV zzso zzso zzso and severe combined zzso with zzso growth zzso and sensitivity to zzso radiation due to zzso zzso zzso zzso In fact, zzso was most commonly confused with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso should inform parents of an affected child of the zzso risk for further children to be zzso zzso molecular genetic diagnosis is possible if zzso zzso in both zzso of the zzso gene are zzso No specific therapy is available for zzso however, zzso stem cell transplantation may be one option for some zzso zzso is generally poor due to the extremely high rate of zzso
