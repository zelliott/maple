The past few years have seen a wider acceptance of a role for DNA zzso in zzso This can be attributed to three zzso First, the documentation of the zzso of zzso at zzso zzso has convincingly implicated DNA zzso in the generation of zzso point zzso The second important advance has been the demonstration of zzso zzso of tumor zzso genes by DNA zzso The third development has been the zzso of experimental methods to manipulate DNA zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that DNA zzso changes in cancer cells are not mere zzso of zzso zzso but can play an instrumental role in the cancer zzso It seems clear that DNA zzso plays a variety of roles in different cancer types and probably at different stages of zzso DNA zzso is intricately involved in a wide diversity of cellular zzso Likewise, it appears to exert its influence on the cancer process through a diverse array of zzso It is our task not only to identify these mechanisms, but to determine their relative importance for each stage and type of zzso Our hope then will be to translate that knowledge into clinical zzso
