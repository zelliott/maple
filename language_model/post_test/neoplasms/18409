Clinical trials of zzso necrosis factor zzso have raised questions about the potential risk of certain serious adverse events zzso To assess the safety of zzso in zzso arthritis zzso over time and across five other zzso inflammatory diseases and to compare zzso zzso and mortality rates with data on the general zzso 

This analysis included zzso patients exposed to zzso in 36 global clinical trials in zzso zzso arthritis zzso zzso zzso zzso Crohn's disease zzso psoriasis and juvenile idiopathic arthritis zzso to 15 April zzso Events per 100 zzso were calculated using zzso reported after the first dose to 70 days after the last zzso zzso zzso rates were calculated for zzso using national and zzso zzso zzso mortality rates zzso were calculated for each disease using data from the World Health zzso 

zzso rates of zzso of interest in zzso have remained stable over zzso Rates of zzso of interest for zzso zzso CD, psoriasis and zzso were similar to or lower than rates for zzso zzso zzso rates for zzso patients were as expected for the general zzso zzso across all six diseases indicated that no more deaths occurred with zzso than expected in the general zzso 

Based on 10 years of clinical trial experience across six diseases, this safety report and the established efficacy of zzso in these diseases provide the foundation for a better understanding of its zzso zzso
