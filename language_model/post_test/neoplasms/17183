The decision on whether to implement a 20-year screening zzso for a cancer requires weighing the harms and costs against the health benefits (such as the number of cancer deaths averted every zzso The evidence of the benefits is often based on a zzso zzso such as the mortality reduction over the entire follow-up time in a single trial, or an average of such zzso measures from a zzso of several zzso There are several problems associated with using the traditional zzso zzso from trials to deduce the yearly mortality reductions expected from a sustained screening zzso We here propose using a rate ratio curve, and its complement (a mortality reduction zzso to address the mortality impact zzso zzso and zzso of a screening zzso This curve is easy to zzso as it shows when mortality reductions begin, how big they are, and how long they zzso We illustrate when and how such rate ratio zzso from screening trials could be zzso and how they could be used to compare reduction patterns expected with different screening zzso We encourage zzso to report the necessary data to arrive at such zzso
