zzso is a ubiquitous protein modification found in zzso cells that zzso many cellular responses, including DNA zzso The zzso zzso zzso family catalyze the formation and addition onto proteins of zzso charged zzso zzso zzso from zzso The absence of zzso and zzso both of which are activated by DNA damage, results in hypersensitivity to zzso radiation and zzso zzso zzso zzso that compete with zzso at the zzso activity site are effective zzso and zzso agents and, in zzso tumors, can be used as zzso therapies acting through the principle of synthetic zzso Through extensive zzso programs, third-generation zzso have now entered clinical trials and are showing great zzso However, both zzso and zzso are not only involved in DNA repair but also in zzso regulation, zzso zzso and cellular zzso The impact on these processes of zzso zzso on long-term therapeutic responses needs to be zzso
