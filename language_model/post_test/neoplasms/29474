zzso zzso zzso zzso has been suggested as a means of identifying metabolically active zzso whereas vascular zzso is accepted as an indicator of zzso This investigation describes the frequency and stability of zzso zzso and vascular zzso in the zzso zzso on serial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies and zzso the findings with clinical data and risk factors for cardiovascular disease zzso 

zzso zzso scans of 100 cancer patients who had at least 2 zzso studies were zzso Sites of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso were compared to assess the frequency and stability of the vascular findings and their correlation with clinical zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was seen in zzso of the patients on the initial scan and changed on the second scan in zzso of the zzso zzso were often seen in patients with zzso zzso but zzso and zzso zzso were present at the same site in only 2 zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso correlated with zzso Patients with diabetes, hypertension, zzso or a history of zzso had significantly more zzso No correlation was seen between zzso zzso and zzso stability and the zzso between scans, age, risk factors, or history of zzso 

zzso vascular zzso was common on zzso and correlated with vascular zzso although the specific sites rarely zzso zzso were stable over time, but zzso zzso changed in more than half of the patients, supporting the zzso that inflammation in zzso is a zzso and waning inflammatory zzso
