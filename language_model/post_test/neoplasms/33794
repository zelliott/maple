A model incorporating recent information regarding the specificity of a zzso liquid zzso zzso for zzso platinum in plasma zzso and the concept of mobile and fixed zzso was developed for cancer patients treated with zzso Model parameters were determined using plasma and urinary platinum data obtained in 20 zzso It was assumed in the model that parent drug accounted for essentially all the platinum measured in plasma zzso in the 2 h period immediately post zzso At times greater than 4 h post infusion, platinum zzso in plasma zzso were assumed to be due entirely to zzso mobile zzso with possible zzso The model accurately simulated platinum zzso in plasma zzso over a zzso period following a zzso infusion of 80 zzso of zzso to seven patients, 100 zzso to ten patients and 120 zzso to three zzso
