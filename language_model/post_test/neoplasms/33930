The persistent presence of zzso instability zzso has been demonstrated in majority of human zzso particularly in solid zzso Recent progress in molecular and cellular biology as well as zzso has shed light on the possible molecular mechanisms and their association with zzso zzso instability may result from various causes, including defects of zzso zzso checkpoint, zzso zzso failure of cell cycle checkpoint, DNA double strand break, zzso dysfunction, zzso and so zzso The researches broaden new insight in molecular mechanisms of zzso and provided new ideas in diagnoses, therapy, zzso and prognosis of zzso
