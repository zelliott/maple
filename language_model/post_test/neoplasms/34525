The potential tumor zzso zzso and its zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso have been implicated in the zzso zzso degradation of proteins involved in cell proliferation as well as in the regulation of zzso zzso We show here that both zzso and zzso concentrate at zzso and that zzso zzso associates with the maternal zzso Interestingly, zzso in the levels of these proteins have opposing effects on zzso zzso of zzso in various cell lines and primary cells leads to zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso reduces zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso results in a decrease of zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso leads to zzso zzso We further show that the zzso zzso abnormalities are due to daughter zzso zzso In zzso our results demonstrate that zzso in the zzso balance cause zzso zzso defects and suggest a role for zzso zzso degradation in zzso zzso
