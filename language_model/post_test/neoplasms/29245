A major drawback of zzso acid zzso drug zzso or zzso for cancer therapy is their preferential zzso in the liver after systemic zzso In an attempt to investigate the zzso characteristics and in zzso fates of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso derivatives were prepared by varying the degree of zzso The zzso zzso formed zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso with the zzso charged surfaces in the zzso zzso Although zzso of zzso reduced their cellular zzso in zzso larger amounts of zzso were taken up by cancer cells zzso zzso an zzso zzso than by normal zzso zzso The ex zzso images of the zzso using an optical imaging technique after the intravenous injection of zzso zzso into normal mice demonstrated that zzso could effectively reduce the liver zzso of zzso and increase their circulation time in the zzso When the zzso were zzso administered into zzso mice for in zzso real-time imaging, the strongest zzso signals were detected at the tumor site of the mice for the whole period of time zzso indicating their high tumor zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso were more effectively accumulated into the tumor tissue up to zzso higher than bare zzso The high tumor zzso of zzso zzso was further supported by the zzso tumor imaging, in which their rapid zzso into the tumor tissue was clearly zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso can be useful as a means for cancer therapy and zzso
