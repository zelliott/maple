A gradual diminution in the zzso reserve or functional capacity over time is the characteristic hallmark of aging, and this has a direct impact on the choice of cancer therapy and its toxicity profile in elderly patients with zzso With the expected rapid rise of the older population as a zzso zzso will increasingly treat elderly zzso zzso of competent care to this increasing pool of older patients with cancer zzso that zzso professionals become familiar with zzso changes in organ physiology and their impact on cancer treatment and zzso In this comprehensive review, we have listed changes in zzso zzso zzso and zzso physiology with zzso Also zzso is the impact of these changes on cancer therapy and toxicity in each organ zzso zzso zzso changes primarily lead to reduction of the cardiac functional reserve, with a zzso increase in the risk of zzso heart zzso Changes in gastrointestinal physiology lead to increased zzso zzso A reduction in pulmonary reserve has implications for zzso zzso and a decline in zzso function leads to an increased potential for zzso These changes impair the ability of older patients with cancer to tolerate cancer therapy and increase their risk of zzso This may lead to an overall decline in functional status, resulting zzso poor quality of life, and ultimately poor zzso Becoming familiar with age-related zzso changes is the first step for zzso seeking to better tailor their zzso This, combined with adoption of some of the clinical interventions suggested in this review, can help better manage the geriatric zzso zzso Further research is necessary for the development of more specific evidence-based zzso
