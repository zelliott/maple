A simple model is proposed for zzso zzso The model is zzso in parameters but linear in time, following models in environmental cancer zzso Assuming a zzso distribution for the age and period specific numbers of incident cases approximate confidence and prediction intervals are zzso The major advantage of this model over current models is that zzso predictions can be made with greater zzso The model also preserves in the period of prediction the age pattern of zzso rates existing in the zzso It may be fitted with any package which includes an zzso zzso least squares algorithm, for example zzso Cancer zzso predictions for the zzso zzso Region in Sweden are presented as an zzso
