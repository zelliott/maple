The cell cycle length of individual cells within a tumor cell population is known to vary, mainly as a consequence of differences in the length of zzso zzso A number of observations suggest that the distribution of zzso phase transit times is well described by models where the transition from zzso to S phase is governed by a probability zzso However, entry into S phase as a consequence of progressive zzso of zzso E with time, to the point where zzso zzso zzso is zzso does not provide a basis for a probability zzso We suggest that zzso of the activity of the zzso zzso factor during zzso phase could provide a mechanism that explains the kinetic behavior of zzso phase zzso A negative feedback loop controlling zzso is possible because zzso of zzso following zzso by zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso factor, marking it for zzso by the zzso complex and subsequent zzso zzso The activity of several cellular zzso factors, including zzso and zzso has been shown to zzso by negative feedback zzso leading to zzso and subsequent zzso zzso The zzso mechanisms for zzso and zzso suggest that transitions from the cell cycle to zzso are also governed by probability zzso
