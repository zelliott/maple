zzso is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with zzso The molecular mechanisms that control zzso are related to zzso in various zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and growth factors and their zzso These abnormalities affect the downstream signal zzso pathways involved in the control of cell growth and other zzso zzso One of the most recognized signal zzso pathways involves the signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso known to be activated by numerous zzso growth factors, and zzso zzso is zzso zzso in several clinical cancer specimens and cell lines, leading to cell transformation and zzso zzso target genes are involved in multiple steps of zzso including invasion, cell survival, zzso zzso and zzso immune zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso by a variety of mechanisms can exert zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso might be an excellent target for therapeutic intervention in tumor zzso This review highlights the pivotal role of zzso in tumor zzso and in therapeutic strategies to target the zzso signaling zzso for the zzso of zzso
