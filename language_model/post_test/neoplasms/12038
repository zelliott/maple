On the basis of results showing that the extent and direction of protein zzso essential for cell growth and cell differentiation can be zzso aside from the zzso level, also on the level of zzso zzso the main results of various properties of zzso from normal and tumor zzso are zzso The main established difference between the two zzso concerns the organization and zzso of the zzso within the zzso In tumors, zzso and inactive zzso and zzso particles are encountered in considerable amounts freely in the zzso zzso not attached to the zzso Furthermore, the zzso profile of tumor cells compared with the normal tissue is characterized by a shift towards zzso with lower zzso zzso zzso zzso were not found to differ in physical and chemical zzso In smaller zzso fragments of zzso zzso differences in the frequency of certain zzso appear zzso zzso experiments with DNA do suggest, however, that the zzso zzso from tumors is being zzso at the same zzso as zzso zzso from normal zzso thus proving its overall sequence zzso zzso and zzso methods have not so far revealed any clear differences in the properties of zzso proteins from normal and tumor zzso In zzso systems, zzso from various tumors show approximately the same incorporation rates for zzso acids as zzso from normal zzso The enhanced protein synthesis of the cells, on the basis of data obtained from zzso experiments with cell free systems, is to be attributed mainly to the increased content of translation factors in the zzso
