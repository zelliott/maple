zzso and biological zzso of zzso are closely related to each other and are the main objects of diagnostic zzso zzso zzso for example, a well-known zzso criterion of zzso is however only an indirect sign of impaired cellular growth control zzso Nowadays, it is a goal of cancer research to investigate these regulatory processes in order to zzso new diagnostic criteria of zzso Silver zzso of zzso organizer regions zzso basically meets this new zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and are thus of central importance for the protein synthesis of a zzso Silver zzso zzso associated proteins and indicates activated zzso zzso zzso zzso covers the zzso potential of a given cell or a zzso zzso A prerequisite of reliable application of the zzso method to diagnostic zzso pathology is zzso of the technique, which should be based upon scientific results obtained by basic zzso zzso in zzso cells zzso are primarily zzso of zzso corresponding to the zzso centers at the zzso zzso This has been shown to be an important criterion to determine the quality of the silver zzso zzso Most artifacts result from inadequate tissue preservation zzso unspecific zzso structures and the zzso procedure zzso They should either be excluded zzso ever zzso by a proper zzso technique, zzso adjustment to the zzso of every individual zzso In this respect, digital image analysis proved to be a useful zzso The mean size of zzso in small zzso of the same tissue sample is an equivalent of the zzso of a given zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By use of such a standardized zzso technique a high diagnostic accuracy is zzso The zzso potential of a cell or a zzso can be determined by number, size, zzso intensity and distribution of the silver stained zzso In zzso tissue sections the zzso of the mean number of zzso and the mean area of one zzso zzso has been shown to be a very sensitive diagnostic zzso In zzso specimens determination of the total silver stained area per cell is superior to counting of zzso simply by zzso zzso and zzso tissue can reliably be zzso by these zzso zzso In addition, the zzso potential of the different zzso zzso zzso of the urinary zzso can precisely be zzso Flat zzso zzso with moderate zzso zzso zzso exhibit zzso values in the range of well differentiated zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
