alpha zzso zzso which is known as an efficient serum zzso inhibitor and is detected in tumor cell zzso was found to inhibit the activity of DNA zzso alpha zzso from human stomach zzso The concentration of ACT required for 50% zzso was zzso zzso and the manner of its zzso showed the partially competitive relationship between ACT and DNA in the zzso zzso zzso the removal of ACT by zzso zzso lost its zzso and zzso zzso activities in zzso On the other hand, it did not inhibit the activity of human DNA zzso zzso Other human serum proteins including serum zzso alpha zzso zzso alpha zzso and zzso G as well as other zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not affect the activity of DNA zzso zzso zzso ACT heated at 60 degrees C did not inhibit DNA zzso zzso although it could still bind to DNA as well as native zzso It was therefore concluded that the zzso action of ACT on DNA zzso alpha was a direct phenomenon unrelated to its zzso zzso or DNA binding zzso
