zzso is a zzso factor which plays a critical role in development and tumor zzso The hypoxic response is mainly zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso and zzso which becomes active under low oxygen zzso zzso activates the zzso of zzso zzso genes which regulate diverse cellular functions including zzso zzso and zzso In cancer zzso zzso genes promote zzso invasion and zzso transition zzso a critical step of zzso zzso is a master regulator of zzso and zzso zzso and is recently implicated to be essential to mediate cancer zzso We recently showed that zzso promotes zzso through direct regulation of zzso zzso zzso is critical for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plays a zzso role in relation to other zzso regulators zzso zzso under zzso zzso of zzso zzso and Snail could be used as a zzso marker in cancer zzso These findings suggest that zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso and zzso through the coordinated regulation of different zzso zzso Our results provide the important link between zzso and zzso processes regulated by zzso The implications of the roles of zzso and zzso in early embryonic development are zzso
