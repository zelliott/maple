To establish the feasibility of zzso tumor targeting with an zzso zzso 

Animal experiments were performed in compliance with Institut National de la zzso zzso de la zzso zzso animal protection guidelines and were approved by local government zzso zzso was used to measure the zzso of zzso constituted of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in a zzso magnetic field in zzso For in zzso studies, 38 male Swiss nude mice bearing a zzso human prostate zzso tumor in each flank received an intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso saline zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso particles zzso zzso 2) after a small magnet with a magnetic field of zzso T and a field zzso of 11 zzso was fixed to the skin above one zzso The animals were examined at magnetic resonance zzso imaging with eight different zzso iron doses (13 zzso and zzso zzso (12 zzso Their excised tumors were then stained with zzso zzso blue and zzso and were examined zzso With use of the paired Student zzso test, signal intensity, tumor surface enhancement, and number of stained cells were compared between the control and zzso tumors to determine significant differences zzso zzso zzso 

The mean zzso zzso ranged from 10 to 40 zzso when the magnetic field equaled zzso T and the field zzso equaled 25 zzso At zzso three-dimensional zzso zzso MR imaging in zzso the tumor exposed to the magnet showed strong negative enhancement, zzso compared with the zzso enhancement of the other zzso zzso enhancement occurred after 3 hours of magnet zzso After 24 hours of magnet application, zzso iron particle zzso was observed in the targeted tumors zzso 

zzso targeting of zzso stabilized zzso after they are zzso injected is feasible in zzso
