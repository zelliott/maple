The development of molecular technologies, together with progressive sophistication of molecular imaging methods, has allowed the further zzso of the multiple zzso and zzso effects of pathways leading to zzso Acting against these pathways by specifically targeted agents represents a major challenge for current research efforts in zzso As conventional zzso based pharmacological zzso may be inadequate to monitor the tumor response to these targeted treatments, the identification and use of more appropriate, zzso zzso zzso appear to be crucial to zzso the design, dosage and schedule of these novel therapeutic zzso An zzso zzso zzso metabolism and enhanced flux of zzso derivatives through zzso which sustain the zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso are two major hallmarks of cancer zzso This review focuses on the changes detected in these pathways by MRS in response to targeted zzso The progress and limitations of our present understanding of the mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso in cancer cells are discussed in the light of gene and protein expression and the zzso of different zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso Examples of zzso induced in the MRS zzso profile of cells exposed to different agents or to tumor environmental factors are zzso Current studies aimed at the identification in cancer cells of zzso zzso markers of therapies targeted against specific conditional or zzso cell zzso stimulation are then zzso Finally, the perspectives of present efforts addressed to identify zzso of the zzso cycle as possible novel targets for zzso therapy are zzso
