Cancer patients commonly suffer from zzso a syndrome in which tumors induce zzso changes in the host that lead to massive loss in skeletal muscle zzso Using a zzso mouse model of cancer zzso we tested the hypothesis that tumor zzso causes a reduction in zzso synthesis and zzso zzso expression in skeletal zzso Mice implanted with Lewis lung zzso were examined by in zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso We examined zzso synthesis rate and the expression of genes that play zzso roles in skeletal muscle zzso Our in zzso zzso results showed reduced zzso synthesis rate in zzso zzso mice relative to control zzso mice, and were zzso with whole zzso zzso data showing zzso expression levels of skeletal muscle regulatory genes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso a major regulator of zzso zzso and, zzso zzso protein 3 zzso zzso pattern of gene expression was also associated with genes involved in inflammation and immune response, protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and inadequate zzso stress defenses, and these effects led to zzso Our findings suggest that reduced zzso synthesis is linked to zzso dysfunction, ultimately leading to skeletal muscle wasting and thus advance our understanding of skeletal muscle dysfunction suffered by cancer zzso This study represents a new line of research that can support the development of novel zzso in the molecular medicine of skeletal muscle zzso Such zzso would have zzso applications not only for cancer patients, but also for many individuals suffering from other chronic or zzso diseases that exhibit muscle zzso a condition for which only marginally effective treatments are currently zzso
