zzso stem zzso cells are a uniquely zzso zzso population of cells that must be differentiated before being useful for cell zzso Since most studies zzso subcutaneous zzso to test the in zzso functionality of zzso zzso cells, the objective of the current study was to develop an appropriate and clinically relevant in zzso zzso system in which the behavior and zzso of zzso zzso cells could be effectively tested in a zzso zzso zzso Male zzso cells were differentiated either into zzso or zzso using protocols that were previously developed and published by our zzso The differentiated cells were implanted into a zzso fracture created in the zzso zzso of zzso female mice, strain matched to the zzso cell zzso The ability of the differentiated zzso zzso cells zzso the Y zzso to incorporate into the newly formed bone was assessed by zzso zzso imaging and zzso zzso cells differentiated with either zzso or zzso medium supplementation formed a soft tissue mass that disrupted the normal bone architecture by 4 weeks after zzso in some zzso In contrast, mice receiving zzso cells that were differentiated in a three-dimensional type 1 collagen gel showed evidence of new bone formation at the zzso site without evidence of tumor formation for up to 8 weeks after zzso In this injury model, type 1 collagen is more effective than medium supplementation at driving more complete differentiation of zzso cells, as evidenced by reducing their zzso Overall, the current study emphasizes the importance of using an appropriate zzso zzso system to effectively test the behavior and zzso of the cells in zzso
