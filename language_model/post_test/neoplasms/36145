The zzso zzso zzso zzso is frequently activated in human zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso or dysfunction of zzso and zzso zzso deleted on zzso 10 zzso Therefore zzso is thought to be a promising target for cancer zzso Many agents targeting zzso have been developed and some of them have been evaluated in clinical zzso In recent years, development of zzso zzso as companion zzso for molecular targeted drugs has become an important requirement for clinical zzso however, no clinically established zzso that predict the efficacy of zzso zzso have been zzso We previously reported that expression of zzso zzso determined by zzso analysis correlated with the zzso efficacy of a zzso inhibitor zzso in zzso and in zzso suggesting that it might be used as a zzso zzso In this study, to evaluate zzso candidates in in zzso tumor samples, we developed an zzso protein zzso system in conjunction with the tissue zzso technology using a panel of 24 human tumor zzso zzso We have clearly demonstrated that expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso viral zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso determined by this system significantly correlated with those determined by zzso zzso As expected, zzso status correlated with expression of zzso zzso but not zzso Finally, we confirmed that zzso zzso levels determined using this system correlated with the in zzso efficacy of zzso The present results indicate that the zzso protein zzso system could be used to zzso expression of zzso proteins in zzso tumor zzso as well as in human tumor specimens to predict drug efficacy in future clinical zzso
