In zzso planning, the shape of a target volume can at present be exactly zzso by means of zzso zzso A method often applied is to project the largest target volume scan on the plane of the central ray and to calculate the dose in this zzso This method does not allow to take into account any change of the target volume scan which will be mainly due to the body contours of the zzso The results of dose calculations made in several planes for zzso and zzso tumors are zzso With this zzso 33 out of 60 zzso techniques for nine tumor sites meet the requirements with regard to the central ray zzso If several planes are zzso this is only true for ten zzso zzso It is therefore absolutely necessary to calculate the doses of several planes if the target volume has an irregular shape or if the body contours vary zzso This is the only way to prevent a false treatment caused by possibly severe dose excesses or dose zzso in zzso
