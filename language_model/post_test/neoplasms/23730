The disposition of zzso is understood in considerable detail compared to other zzso zzso Recent insights into the zzso relationship between zzso and zzso systemic exposure and both toxicity and outcome offer a basis for more rational approaches to drug zzso with the emphasis on systemic exposure zzso rather than the amount of drug administered per body surface zzso Recent studies indicate that zzso example 21 zzso of low dose zzso may be a more effective dosage schedule for some zzso Until the longer term zzso have been zzso enthusiasm for this new dosage schedule must be tempered by the potential for greater risk of second zzso which has been associated with the zzso or twice zzso of larger intravenous zzso zzso of active zzso drug (and zzso zzso have identified correlations for toxicity and clinical efficacy for such drugs as methotrexate, zzso zzso and platinum complexes zzso et zzso zzso Reed et zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Similar approaches are feasible for the zzso and may provide an additional strategy for further improvement in the use of these active zzso
