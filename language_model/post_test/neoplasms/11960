In the zzso of cancer, two conditions are zzso 1 degree zzso of the zzso 2 degrees safeguard of surrounding zzso In zzso zzso zzso depends on the administration of a certain zzso within a suitable period or number of zzso At the rate of 5 sessions weekly, the following zzso law may be formulated zzso zzso zzso zzso Perfect tolerance of the zzso tissue is in fact obtained if the total dose is equal or less zzso zzso The nominal standard dose of zzso is a limiting dose of about 1,800 zzso zzso and zzso have published tables which permit one to zzso without an index of zzso of the supporting tissue by means of a series of double entry tables corresponding each to a frequency of 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 sessions per zzso Each table provides the zzso factor in relation to the number of sessions and the elementary zzso The zzso factor is about 100 whatever the zzso and whatever the subdivisions of the dose when zzso equation is satisfied, zzso when one is at the limit of zzso Furthermore, the zzso factor of two parts, of treatment under various regimens may be added zzso It is sufficient for the sum to be equal to 100 to ensure full zzso which eliminates all difficulty of manipulation of a zzso zzso The conditions of zzso of continuous zzso do not permit one to separate the doses of zzso and zzso as was the case with zzso zzso but, generally speaking, both in continuous and zzso administration the shorter the period of treatment the more the zzso dose exceeds the tolerance dose, whereas with very small zzso one may obtain zzso zzso within the limits of tolerance of the supporting zzso For very large or zzso zzso one may have to, in order to obtain zzso exceed more or less the perfect tolerance defined by zzso 100 or its equivalent using zzso zzso The latter is, moreover, only an approximation : the effective zzso if one takes into consideration late fibrosis, is very much less than that defined by zzso 100, in particular for high partial dose zzso The author insists, after others, on the absolute necessity of taking into consideration the time factor as defined by zzso relationship recalled zzso There is no sense in obtaining strict physical dose measurement if one does not also take into consideration the time factor, the biological importance of which is zzso
