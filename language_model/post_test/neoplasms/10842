zzso zzso feature immune zzso mechanisms that prevent T cells from generating effective zzso immune zzso zzso interventions aimed at zzso these zzso mechanisms have been shown to enhance zzso zzso but they lack direct zzso zzso Here, we investigated the effect of zzso cancer zzso on immune zzso zzso We observed that exposure to zzso zzso markedly reduced expression of the T cell zzso zzso programmed death zzso 2 zzso on both human zzso and human tumor zzso zzso of zzso resulted in enhanced zzso proliferation and zzso zzso zzso as well as enhanced recognition of tumor cells by T zzso Further analysis revealed that zzso controlled zzso of zzso zzso with these data, patients with zzso head and neck cancer displayed enhanced recurrence-free survival upon treatment with zzso zzso compared with patients with zzso tumors, demonstrating the clinical relevance of zzso zzso zzso We therefore conclude that zzso zzso drugs can enhance the zzso potential of zzso and decrease the zzso capability of tumor zzso This dual action of platinum compounds may extend their therapeutic application in cancer patients and provides a rationale for their use in combination with zzso zzso
