zzso progression is a zzso process involving genetic and zzso changes in a transformed zzso Some of these changes may be induced by host factors which may also select for transformed cellular zzso with a high ability to survive and zzso In this article we review studies showing that receptors for the zzso portion of zzso may be expressed on cells from human or animal tumors of zzso zzso We also review data demonstrating that at least with respect to cells transformed in zzso with zzso virus, transformation per zzso is not sufficient for the induction of zzso zzso zzso We also zzso preliminary data showing that zzso zzso expression is zzso involved in zzso a high zzso zzso upon transformed zzso zzso mechanisms to explain these observations are zzso
