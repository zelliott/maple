A statistical method has been developed that is useful for studying the relationship between the growth zzso of zzso tumors and the detection probability either through symptoms or by zzso zzso models that describe the distribution of pathological variables in zzso tumors, detected after various histories of zzso are derived and parameters for detection probabilities and the growth zzso are then estimated by the maximum likelihood zzso By this method the probabilities of detection through symptoms as well as by screening can be estimated as functions of pathological zzso such as tumor zzso The growth rate of tumor can also be estimated from the distribution of pathological zzso The present method was applied to gastric cancer in Japan, where an annual screening program for the disease zzso The detection probability for the indirect X-ray used as the screening test was estimated to be zzso zzso zzso + zzso zzso zzso The doubling time of gastric cancer was estimated to be zzso zzso
