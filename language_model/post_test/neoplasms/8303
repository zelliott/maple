The pace of development in novel technologies that promise improvements in the early diagnosis of disease is truly zzso One such technology at the forefront of this revolution is mass zzso New capabilities in mass zzso have provided the means for the development of zzso and the race is on to find innovative ways to apply this powerful technology to solving the problems faced in clinical zzso One area that has garnered much attention over the past few years is the use of mass spectral patterns for cancer zzso The use of these so-called zzso zzso for disease diagnosis relies fundamentally on the pattern of signals observed within a mass spectrum rather than the more conventional identification and zzso of a zzso such as in the case of cancer zzso or zzso zzso The inherent zzso of zzso pattern technology enables the analysis of hundreds of clinical samples per zzso Currently, there are two primary means by which zzso patterns can be acquired, zzso laser zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso method that has been popularized under the name, zzso In this review, an historical perspective on the development of zzso patterns for the diagnosis of zzso zzso is zzso In addition, a critical assessment of the overall technology is presented with an emphasis on the steps required to enable zzso pattern analysis to become a viable clinical tool for diagnosing zzso zzso
