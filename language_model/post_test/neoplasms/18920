Current standards for assessment of zzso response to therapy zzso zzso therapeutic efficacy values, inappropriate for zzso and deterministic studies, zzso neglect the natural growth characteristics of zzso zzso are based on zzso zzso inappropriate for zzso therapies, and zzso do not accommodate integration of zzso means of therapeutic efficacy assessed with, for example, zzso zzso zzso or magnetic resonance imaging, with data from anatomical changes in zzso 

A quantity for zzso response was formulated assuming that an effective treatment may decrease the cell proliferation rate zzso and/or increase the cell loss rate zzso of the zzso zzso response values were zzso for 11 zzso zzso patients treated with zzso zzso zzso and 12 prostate cancer patients treated with a nutritional zzso 

zzso response was found to be equal to the zzso of the ratio of zzso zzso volume to the volume of corresponding zzso zzso zzso the natural growth characteristics of zzso results in zzso of treatment effectiveness based on currently used zzso The model also zzso the integration of data from zzso volume changes, with data from functional zzso 

zzso response to therapy can be assessed with a continuous zzso quantity for both zzso and zzso zzso
