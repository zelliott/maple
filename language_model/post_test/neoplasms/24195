Human zzso zzso zzso are a useful tool for animal experiments especially for evaluation of new zzso zzso We have been establishing zzso and have developed zzso zzso panels for new drug evaluation using zzso With regard to quality control zzso in changes into zzso zzso and/or artificial zzso among zzso zzso we studied genetic zzso and effects of long-term zzso on zzso properties such as growth and zzso and we discuss the use of zzso stock of zzso and periodic replacement in order to maintain zzso of the experimental zzso We examined zzso markers and DNA zzso to identify species and individuality of the zzso zzso Growth zzso and sensitivities to zzso drugs were examined using zzso with different zzso in nude zzso Among the zzso we zzso five human zzso were found to have changed to mouse origin from their zzso markers and were zzso We identified the individuality of zzso which we used for the zzso panels by DNA zzso and their properties were stable for long-term zzso in nude zzso However, growth speed and zzso to drugs were altered with long-term zzso although DNA fingerprint analysis did not show any obvious changes with zzso zzso zzso such as zzso markers and DNA zzso is useful to identify individuality of experimental zzso and zzso should be renewed periodically even when there are no signs of artificial contamination when they are used in experiments which require continuous zzso of experimental zzso
