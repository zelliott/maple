The gene transfer of zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso combining zzso specificity with the zzso cell function could be an attractive tool in zzso In this study, we directed the human natural killer zzso cell line zzso to tumor cells by gene transfer of a zzso with specificity against the human zzso zzso zzso The zzso was constructed of a zzso humanized zzso zzso zzso zzso fused to the zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with the zzso gene by zzso and zzso cells were enriched by zzso zzso zzso zzso cells specifically zzso zzso colon zzso cell lines, which were resistant to the parental zzso cell zzso The zzso was not inhibited in the presence of soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso cells retained their zzso zzso activity after zzso in zzso and inhibited the tumor growth in zzso after adoptive transfer into zzso zzso This zzso zzso cell line available in unlimited source might be useful in clinical zzso of zzso zzso
