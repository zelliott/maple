Although zzso techniques are zzso they are still the zzso therapeutic zzso for certain types of zzso They are mainly relevant to zzso that are either zzso or located so deep that access is zzso Of the various types of radiation that can be delivered by the zzso route, ultrasound is the most suitable for deep zzso The study compares the efficacy of two types of zzso with respect to their ability to induce zzso zones of zzso zzso The zzso of the first zzso is zzso whereas the second is plane and can rotate around its zzso Both have an external diameter of 4 zzso are fitted with surface cooling systems and operate at zzso zzso and 14 zzso zzso involves mathematical zzso of zzso tissue in the targeted area by resolving the zzso transfer equation zzso using an zzso based on finite zzso The zzso gives a temperature value from which the zzso dose can be zzso It is shown that tissue zzso by zzso zzso is slow, and, in consequence, zzso zzso the heating zzso in zzso zzso with a zzso zzso lasting zzso s would be required to zzso a tissue mass with a radius of 8 zzso The corresponding period using a rotating plane zzso with 20 firing angles is only zzso zzso The mean exposure time of each shot lasts 31 zzso 7 zzso Therefore zzso would have much less impact in the case of therapy administered using a plane zzso than that using a zzso zzso
