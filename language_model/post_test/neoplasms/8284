zzso zzso of zzso is designed to increase safety and zzso by decreasing cardiac and gastrointestinal toxicity through decreased exposure of these zzso to zzso while effectively delivering drug to the zzso We conducted an zzso phase I study to determine the zzso profile of a single dose of zzso zzso zzso in patients with various solid zzso Safety and zzso were zzso 

Patients received a single intravenous infusion of zzso 75 zzso Plasma samples were analyzed for concentration of zzso zzso total zzso and zzso 

A total of 18 patients aged zzso years zzso 60 zzso zzso 17 were zzso for zzso zzso The most common primary tumor was soft tissue zzso zzso Total body clearance for total zzso was zzso zzso while the volume zzso was 82 zzso The terminal zzso was zzso zzso Based on the zzso and zzso values for total zzso and zzso zzso an estimated zzso of circulating zzso was zzso zzso was detected in all zzso the mean zzso was zzso zzso The mean zzso urinary zzso of zzso was zzso of the zzso The most common adverse events were zzso zzso fatigue zzso and vomiting zzso zzso zzso as zzso fall in zzso to zzso was observed in one zzso zzso values did not correlate with zzso laboratory or demographic zzso 

The zzso profile of zzso suggests that the zzso zzso results in a longer zzso with less free drug available for tissue distribution than conventional zzso consistent with the enhanced therapeutic index observed in clinical zzso
