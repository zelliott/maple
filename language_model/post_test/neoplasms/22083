To estimate the mortality due to zzso levels of zzso blood pressure, total blood cholesterol, body mass index zzso and vegetable and fruit intake amongst zzso and zzso in New Zealand in zzso In addition, to estimate the zzso burden of disease that could potentially be avoided in 2011 if exposure to these risk factors were zzso 

The study uses comparative risk assessment methodology, a systematic approach to zzso both attributable and zzso burden of disease developed by the World Health zzso 

About zzso of deaths among zzso and zzso of deaths among zzso were estimated to be due to the selected risk zzso zzso mortality rates for attributable zzso heart disease burden were consistently higher in zzso for individual risk zzso Age zzso mortality attributable to zzso was relatively higher for zzso especially diabetes zzso Estimates of zzso mortality suggest that the health gains for zzso would be relatively greater than for zzso across all risk factors, but particularly with improvements in zzso 

zzso levels of zzso blood pressure, cholesterol, zzso and to a lesser extent vegetable and fruit intake are major modifiable causes of death in New zzso Small changes in risk factor levels could have a major impact on population health within a decade, with relatively greater health gains for zzso
