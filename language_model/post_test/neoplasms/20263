Previous work has indicated that zzso of zzso intake is oxidized in normal humans with zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso stressed patient is zzso with decreased zzso zzso and protein zzso This study evaluated whether the plasma zzso concentration alone would be a reliable indicator of efficient zzso zzso and protein sparing in the critically ill septic cancer patients receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nitrogen zzso oxygen consumption, and zzso zzso were measured in 8 septic zzso patients during a zzso infusion of zzso zzso followed by the infusion of insulin with the same zzso zzso During zzso infusion without insulin the zzso concentration was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso of zzso tissue zzso and nitrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During the zzso clamp the zzso concentration was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso increased to 45 zzso zzso of zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso and nitrogen zzso dropped to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso concentration was greater than 10 zzso in 4 patients and between zzso and zzso zzso in 4 patients after zzso infusion zzso Despite this difference in initial zzso zzso zzso of plasma zzso to less than 5 zzso with insulin resulted in the same decrease in nitrogen zzso and improvement in zzso zzso We conclude that, independent of the initial zzso zzso maintenance of zzso with insulin appears to be a good indicator of efficient zzso zzso and protein sparing in septic zzso patients receiving zzso as the primary mode of nutritional zzso
