A comparative analysis of vaccination with zzso zzso tumor cells engineered to express a large number of zzso molecules established the superior ability of zzso zzso factor zzso to evoke zzso specific, and long-lasting zzso zzso Early stage clinical testing of this vaccination strategy in patients with diverse solid and zzso zzso revealed the consistent induction of a coordinated zzso and cellular reaction that zzso substantial tumor zzso Nonetheless, most subjects eventually succumbed to progressive disease, zzso that additional immune defects remained to be zzso More detailed investigations of the mechanisms underlying protective immunity in zzso systems together with the characterization of the zzso reactions of patients who achieved durable clinical benefits in response to zzso uncovered several pathways that restrain the efficacy of zzso tumor cell zzso These include milk fat zzso zzso growth factor zzso expansion of zzso box protein zzso regulatory T cells, zzso zzso zzso negative zzso and soluble major zzso complex class I zzso protein A suppression of zzso innate and zzso zzso zzso Together, these results define key regulatory circuits that zzso zzso tumor destruction and suggest novel zzso therapies that might enhance the clinical activity of zzso tumor cell zzso
