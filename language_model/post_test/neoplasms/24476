The human body displays marked zzso paired zzso differ zzso exerting effects upon cancer zzso and zzso However the factors involved remain zzso In this large study involving over a quarter of a million cancer patients, we examine the zzso zzso of cancer zzso including zzso stage at diagnosis and survival in the five major paired zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

Cancer patients were selected from the Thames Cancer zzso database and zzso zzso rates zzso stage distribution at diagnosis and survival rates zzso zzso zzso 

Cancer zzso differed significantly by zzso at all sites studied zzso zzso zzso but substantially in the lung zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso data showed strongly zzso zzso organ size ratios zzso in the lungs and zzso in the zzso Patients with left zzso cancer, right lung cancer and left zzso cancer showed significantly better survival than those with zzso disease zzso zzso zzso 

In the lungs and zzso zzso in cancer zzso closely coincided with zzso in organ zzso Our results suggest that tissue mass in these zzso is an important contributor to asymmetry in cancer zzso
