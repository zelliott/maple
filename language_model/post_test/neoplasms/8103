To assess the accuracy of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso when staging different zzso zzso 

This was a retrospective, zzso zzso study of 260 patients with various zzso diseases who underwent zzso zzso for tumor zzso CT images alone, PET images alone, PET + CT data viewed side by side, and fused zzso images were evaluated separately according to the zzso zzso One hundred zzso patients with tumors not staged according to the zzso system or a lack of reference standard were excluded from data zzso 260 patients were zzso zzso zzso were determined for each of the four image zzso zzso and a clinical follow-up of 311 zzso zzso days served as standards of zzso 

zzso proved significantly more accurate in assessing zzso system stage compared with CT alone, PET alone, and side-by-side PET + CT zzso zzso zzso Of 260 patients, 218 zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso were correctly staged with zzso 197 zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso with side-by-side PET + CT, zzso zzso zzso zzso 57% to zzso with CT alone, and 166 zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso with PET zzso Combined zzso had an impact on the treatment plan in 16, 39, and 43 patients when compared with PET + CT, CT alone, and PET alone, zzso 

zzso staging with zzso is significantly more accurate than CT alone, PET alone, and side-by-side PET + zzso This diagnostic advantage translates into treatment plan changes in a substantial number of zzso
