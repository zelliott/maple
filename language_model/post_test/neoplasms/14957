The question of what makes an zzso vitamin D intake is usually equivalent to, zzso serum zzso D zzso do we need to stay above to minimize risk of zzso This is a simplistic question that ignores the evidence that fluctuating zzso of zzso may in themselves be a problem, even if zzso do exceed a minimum desirable zzso Vitamin D metabolism poses unique problems for the regulation of zzso D zzso zzso in the zzso outside the kidney that possess zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso behave according to zzso reaction zzso When zzso declines, the ratio of zzso must increase to maintain tissue zzso at its zzso zzso The mechanisms that regulate this zzso metabolism are poorly zzso I propose that delay in cellular adaptation, or lag time, in response to fluctuating zzso zzso can explain why higher zzso in regions at high latitude or with low environmental ultraviolet light can be associated with the greater risks reported for prostate and pancreatic zzso At temperate latitudes, higher summertime zzso levels are followed by sharper declines in zzso causing inappropriately low zzso and high zzso resulting in tissue zzso below its ideal zzso This hypothesis can answer concerns raised by the World Health Organization's International Agency for Research on Cancer about vitamin D and cancer zzso It also explains why higher zzso zzso are not good if they zzso and that desirable zzso zzso are ones that are both high and zzso
