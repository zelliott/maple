The prevalence of zzso an established zzso risk factor for many zzso has risen steadily for the past several decades in the US and many other zzso Particularly alarming are the increasing rates of obesity among children, zzso continuing increases in the rates of obesity and zzso zzso for many years to zzso zzso of energy balance, via increased physical activity, has been shown in numerous comprehensive zzso reviews to reduce cancer zzso Unfortunately, the effects and zzso targets of physical activity interventions on the zzso process have not been thoroughly zzso Studies to date suggest that exercise can exert its zzso effects at many stages during the process of zzso including both zzso initiation and zzso As discussed in this review, exercise may be altering zzso initiation events by zzso zzso zzso specifically by enhancing the zzso zzso system and by enhancing selective zzso in the zzso zzso pathway, including, but not limited to, zzso Furthermore, exercise may reduce zzso damage by increasing a variety of zzso zzso enhancing DNA repair systems and improving zzso protein repair zzso In addition to altering processes related to zzso zzso exercise may also exert a zzso effect by zzso the processes involved in the promotion and progression stages of zzso including scavenging zzso oxygen species zzso altering cell zzso zzso and zzso decreasing zzso enhancing immune zzso and suppressing zzso A paucity of data exists as to whether exercise may be working as an zzso strategy via altering zzso in initiated or zzso zzso therefore, no conclusions can be made about this possible zzso The studies directly examining cell proliferation and zzso have shown that exercise can enhance both zzso which is difficult to interpret in the context of zzso Studies examining the relationship between exercise and chronic inflammation suggest that exercise may reduce zzso zzso and reduce the state of zzso chronic zzso Additionally, exercise has been shown to enhance components of the innate immune response zzso zzso and natural killer cell zzso Finally, only a limited number of studies have explored the relationship between exercise and zzso therefore, no conclusions can be made currently about the role of exercise in the zzso process as it relates to zzso zzso In zzso exercise can alter biological processes that contribute to both zzso and zzso events in the zzso zzso However, more zzso detailed studies are needed to examine each of the potential mechanisms contributing to an zzso decrease in zzso in order to determine the minimum dose, duration and frequency of exercise needed to yield significant zzso effects, and whether exercise can be used zzso to reverse the zzso zzso changes that increase cancer zzso
