It is well recognized that human zzso are hypoxic compared to normal adjacent zzso and that zzso is related to a poor outcome regardless of zzso of treatment, including surgery alone, zzso or zzso zzso regulates a complex zzso of gene zzso via zzso factors 1 and 2 zzso zzso We have shown that in breast cancer and many other zzso types, zzso zzso express high levels of zzso compared to normal tissue zzso and compared to the zzso This high zzso zzso is an independent zzso factor for poor zzso The mechanisms zzso zzso in zzso may include inflammatory zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso into zzso increases the zzso level of zzso protein and changes the zzso of zzso Many of these zzso genes are involved in inflammation and zzso Thus, the conversion of a peripheral zzso into a zzso generates a complex new zzso of zzso genes that may contribute to zzso and the complex zzso within the zzso and as such provides important targets for zzso
