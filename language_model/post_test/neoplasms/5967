zzso genetic zzso are a hallmark of human cancer zzso These genetic zzso may include specific gene zzso that drive the cancer process or zzso changes such as zzso instability that may be caused by specific genetic zzso Identification of zzso cell populations that share a specific genetic zzso is virtually synonymous with the detection of zzso These zzso cells can be detected among a large population of normal cells from limited clinical samples by DNA amplification zzso Because of their unprecedented sensitivity and zzso these approaches offer new hope for the early diagnosis of human zzso
