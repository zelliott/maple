Nearly a century ago, cell biologists zzso that the zzso aberrations zzso cancer cells might be caused by a mysterious zzso zzso had only just been zzso For years, however, this enigmatic structure was neglected in zzso investigations and has only recently zzso as a key suspect in zzso A majority of cancer cells, unlike healthy cells, possess an amplified zzso complement, which they manage to coalesce neatly at two zzso poles during zzso This zzso mechanism permits the cell to form a zzso zzso zzso for segregation of sister zzso On rare occasions this mechanism fails, resulting in zzso zzso and the assembly of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the cell to an almost certain fate of zzso arrest or zzso The catastrophic nature of zzso has attracted efforts to develop drugs that can induce zzso in cancer zzso Such zzso would theoretically spare healthy cells, whose normal zzso complement should zzso zzso zzso zzso In search of the zzso zzso of zzso cancer zzso and zzso zzso chemotherapy, research is zzso to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso Here, we detail the progress made towards that end, highlighting seminal work and suggesting directions for future research, aimed at zzso this zzso cellular tactic and exploiting it for zzso zzso We also propose a model to highlight the integral role of zzso zzso and the delicate balance of forces on which cancer cells rely for effective zzso zzso Finally, we provide insights regarding how zzso of this balance may pave an zzso for inducing lethal zzso zzso and death selectively in cancer zzso
