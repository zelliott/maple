zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that degrades zzso to three products, zzso carbon monoxide zzso and iron zzso The present study was originally designed to characterize the zzso induction by zzso extract as a potential zzso zzso Through zzso zzso with human zzso cells as the cellular zzso surprisingly, we found that zzso was enriched in the active zzso isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso was further carried out by liquid zzso with zzso coupled plasma mass zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso extract contained two major zzso species, zzso zzso ; zzso and zzso zzso ; zzso and six minor zzso zzso Commercial sodium zzso zzso ) was used to verify the effects of zzso extract on zzso expression and related zzso signaling zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor 2 zzso pathways were found to zzso zzso induction by zzso extract and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso inhibitor tin zzso IX zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso also inhibited zzso induction by zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso compounds are responsible for zzso induction by zzso zzso Although the exact role of toxic zzso compounds in the treatment of zzso injury remains zzso zzso zzso induction may be a key mechanism to antagonize the zzso of zzso compounds in human zzso
