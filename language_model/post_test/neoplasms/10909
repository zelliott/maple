zzso by zzso is the major mechanism by which zzso zzso activate zzso However, the mechanisms of entry and presentation of vaccine peptides by zzso remain zzso In this study, we determined that the mechanisms of zzso presentation differed between zzso and zzso zzso zzso We found that a zzso long zzso could be taken up by zzso and that the zzso could be zzso with early zzso The zzso of zzso peptides by zzso was inhibited at low temperatures or by the zzso of zzso filaments or zzso In contrast, zzso peptides were zzso by zzso at low temperatures, and zzso was not inhibited when zzso filaments or zzso were zzso Moreover, zzso zzso but not zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso degradation pathways were necessary for zzso presentation leading to the zzso of zzso T cells, but the zzso degradation zzso alone was sufficient to process zzso peptides for zzso class I zzso We further found that zzso peptides could enhance zzso T cell responses in zzso and in zzso and induced stronger zzso responses than zzso zzso Taken together, our results demonstrate that zzso present zzso peptides through an zzso zzso to promote strong zzso effects in zzso
