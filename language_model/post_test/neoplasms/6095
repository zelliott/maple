Drug development is a complex and risky zzso Clinical development must be a thoroughly paced process zzso by clinical and zzso questions logically zzso Drug development parameters are changing due to better insights in system biology and mechanisms of zzso zzso there is a need to revisit how clinical trials are designed and zzso 

In the context of this paper, the development of zzso is placed in perspective of possible new trends for more optimal drug zzso zzso is an zzso agent with a favorable safety profile as its zzso zzso does not lead to the release of toxic zzso such as zzso In addition, its cellular zzso zzso through the zzso receptors of zzso makes it an attractive agent for the treatment of highly zzso tumors zzso These observations have served the rationale to bring this agent to the clinic from Phase I up to Phase III with a focus on pancreatic zzso The pathways for its development have been challenging due in part to the fact that there is no proof of zzso study for any zzso agent, even those used in the zzso 

Solid mechanism and zzso zzso clinical trials providing evidence on the mechanism of action and how the agent interacts with the biology of the targeted disease are today an absolute requirement for the development of new zzso zzso clinical trial design must complement system biology understanding so that zzso designed to zzso may give robust grounds to zzso trials designed to zzso
