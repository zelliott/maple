zzso zzso zzso visible mobile lipids are considered important markers in the diagnosis of human cancer and are thought to be closely involved in various aspects of zzso zzso such as cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and drug zzso A method allowing the straightforward identification of the zzso classes contributing to the mobile lipids in human zzso zzso is highly zzso zzso zzso High Resolution Magic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was done directly on human zzso zzso and zzso zzso tissue zzso A diffusion edited zzso based on zzso echo and bipolar zzso zzso was used to characterize molecules with low diffusion rates, arising from mobile zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are simultaneously detected and all contribute to the mobile zzso zzso present in zzso zzso and clear cell zzso zzso tissue specimens zzso On the contrary, zzso cell zzso zzso spectrum is predominated by zzso zzso and that of zzso zzso is characterized by signals arising from zzso zzso zzso diffusion edited High Resolution Magic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso done on intact zzso is a powerful zzso tool to obtain a simple and immediate identification of mobile zzso zzso This can offer a significant contribution to better understanding their involvement in cancer zzso Furthermore, ex zzso high resolution zzso zzso allow to improve the interpretation of in zzso zzso zzso zzso increasing its clinical zzso
