Chemical zzso is generally recognized as a zzso process consisting of zzso promotion and zzso Today there is substantial evidence that the process involves zzso species of zzso which are generated through zzso or zzso transformation of zzso and their zzso and which can alter zzso zzso zzso and zzso thereby interfering with normal cell growth and zzso Most cells possess powerful defense mechanisms against these effects, both in the form of antioxidants acting as zzso zzso and of various zzso capable of preventing the formation of zzso the removal of zzso species of zzso The present paper is a brief survey of current knowledge concerning these zzso The available information is consistent with the concept that chemical zzso and its prevention share a common zzso zzso the zzso zzso of a zzso that can lead, on one hand, to the generation of zzso species of oxygen and thereby cancer zzso promotion and zzso and, on the other hand, to an induction of zzso zzso that can prevent these zzso The final outcome will depend on the relative impact of the two zzso zzso of the underlying molecular mechanisms may provide a rationale for devising drugs that enhance resistance against chemical zzso without themselves being zzso
