The cell zzso zzso zzso zzso content of 46 human tumors was zzso The extraction procedure of zzso and zzso was used with the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of the study was to determine whether zzso could be reliably zzso from small, zzso pieces of tumor zzso to zzso zzso In most cases it was possible to examined larger masses of zzso which served as a control of the zzso In this preliminary study zzso values, calculated from a standard curve derived from zzso bovine blood zzso with a specific activity of zzso zzso ranged from as little as zzso to as much as zzso zzso of zzso These findings suggested that the procedures used might be zzso on a routine basis to determine the zzso content of tumors and its possible relationship to the radiation sensitivity of the zzso
