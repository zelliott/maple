A zzso zzso approach was applied to zzso a zzso zzso with promising zzso activity but poor water zzso We zzso a zzso zzso of zzso ( 7) in which zzso acid is connected via a zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso group of zzso zzso 7 was 80 times more soluble than zzso in zzso solution at pH zzso and was stable in human zzso zzso 7 was zzso to zzso less toxic than the parent drug to four human tumor cell zzso In the presence of zzso zzso 7 could be activated to elicit similar zzso to the parent drug in tumor zzso zzso kinetic studies showed that zzso coli zzso had a quite low K m of zzso zzso for compound 7 and exhibited 520 times higher zzso efficiency for 7 than for 6 (a zzso zzso of zzso zzso modeling studies predicted that compound 7 would have a higher binding affinity to human zzso than compound zzso zzso 7 may be useful for selective cancer chemotherapy by a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso therapy zzso zzso
