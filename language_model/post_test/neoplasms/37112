The zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso through the A ring to zzso or zzso zzso material zzso 10) to prepare zzso zzso for activity zzso and affinity isolation of binding proteins from zzso When zzso to zzso the resulting zzso zzso inhibited both zzso zzso activity and growth of zzso cells in zzso The zzso was at least one order of magnitude more potent as an inhibitor than the parent zzso These findings confirm previous results that demonstrate an zzso zzso protein with zzso zzso activity at the external plasma membrane surface of zzso cells that is shed into culture media zzso by growth of zzso zzso A comparable activity, responsive to zzso was present in zzso of cancer zzso zzso zzso to zzso beads as the affinity support bound a large number of serum zzso However, compared to serum from normal patients, the affinity support bound two proteins of zzso zzso zzso and zzso not found in zzso of normal zzso The zzso zzso protein from human zzso reacted with zzso to a zzso zzso protein from culture media zzso by growth of zzso cells that blocked and zzso the zzso activity from zzso cell plasma zzso The results point to the zzso zzso protein from cancer patient zzso that bound to the zzso affinity support as representing the circulating equivalent of the previously identified 34 zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso activity at the external cell surface of cultured zzso cells and a corresponding zzso zzso protein shed into culture media zzso by growth of zzso zzso
