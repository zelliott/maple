The use of education is recommended to teach patients zzso zzso to reduce zzso fatigue, however, there is little evidence of its effectiveness or optimal zzso This educationally based zzso fatigue intervention trial, zzso aimed to reduced severity of fatigue in zzso zzso 

One hundred and ten participants zzso years undergoing zzso zzso were randomly assigned to receive zzso zzso and zzso fatigue education and support zzso zzso zzso only; zzso zzso only; or zzso no zzso zzso zzso Data collection occurred at zzso and zzso zzso and at zzso zzso 

The intervention was not associated with reduction in fatigue levels at any assessment zzso zzso changes were seen with secondary zzso zzso Physical activity zzso zzso was associated with significantly greater increase in vigorous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and moderate physical activity participation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with significant improvements in walking levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with no zzso zzso and unpaid zzso zzso was associated with slower return to zzso levels of paid work zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso than no zzso zzso was associated with decreased levels of unpaid work zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with no zzso 

The zzso zzso did not significantly improve the primary outcome, level of fatigue, regardless of when it was delivered, however, significant changes were observed in zzso zzso Further investigations into educationally based zzso should target activity participation rather than changes in underlying fatigue to improve overall patient zzso
