zzso zzso is a process zzso cancer cells in concert with zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso such as zzso induce zzso zzso and thereby decrease zzso skeletal destruction, severity of bone pain, and frequency of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso will reduce zzso bone turnover in healthy dogs and zzso bone zzso in dogs diagnosed with primary and secondary bone zzso 

Six healthy dogs and 20 dogs with naturally occurring primary or zzso bone tumors were administered zzso zzso 

Prospective zzso In all dogs, healthy zzso zzso 6) and with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the bone zzso effects of zzso were evaluated by zzso changes in serum zzso zzso or urine zzso zzso zzso or zzso In dogs with zzso zzso zzso zzso 10), serial changes in tumor relative bone mineral density zzso assessed by zzso zzso zzso were used to characterize zzso zzso effects within the immediate tumor zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso of zzso was assessed in 9 dogs receiving multiple zzso or zzso consecutive zzso 

All dogs had significant reductions in serum zzso or urine zzso zzso or both after zzso zzso In a subset of dogs with zzso zzso reduced urine zzso zzso and increased primary tumor zzso coincided with improved limb usage as reported by pet owners in dogs treated with zzso and concurrent oral zzso Multiple zzso infusions were not associated with zzso evidence of zzso 

In dogs with skeletal zzso zzso zzso exerts bone zzso effects, appears safe, and can provide pain zzso
