zzso zzso in liver cancer 1), which encodes a zzso zzso protein zzso is a potent tumor zzso gene that is frequently zzso in several human zzso zzso is a zzso protein that has been shown previously to bind members of the zzso gene zzso Here we show that zzso zzso also known as zzso interacts and extensively zzso with zzso in focal zzso The binding was mapped to the zzso domain located in the N zzso of zzso and to the zzso zzso domain located in the C zzso of the zzso In zzso analyses with zzso proteins determined that the isolated zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso activity, suggesting that zzso is a negative regulator of zzso zzso zzso zzso with this possibility, we found that zzso zzso of zzso in a zzso tumor line impaired the zzso activity of zzso and increased zzso activity in zzso Our observations expand the complexity of proteins that regulate zzso function and define a novel mechanism of the cross talk between Ras and zzso zzso
