Cancer risk assessment involves the steps of hazard zzso zzso assessment, exposure assessment, and risk zzso The rapid advances in the use of molecular biology approaches has had an impact on all 4 zzso but the greatest overall current and future impact will be on the zzso assessment because this requires an understanding of the mechanisms of zzso both background and induced by environmental zzso In this regard, hazard identification is a qualitative assessment and zzso is a quantitative zzso Thus, the latter will ultimately require a quantitative assessment of molecular zzso that are used to describe the zzso for zzso It has been possible for many years to zzso zzso at the level of the single zzso For example, analysis of zzso frequency by zzso selection, analysis of zzso zzso by Northern zzso analysis of translation zzso by Western zzso and analysis of zzso of metabolism from zzso zzso However, it is becoming clear that it is necessary when considering risk for adverse health outcomes to develop quantitative approaches for whole cell zzso or organ zzso For example, cancer is a whole tissue zzso not a feature of single gene zzso in spite of the zzso zzso mode of formation of a zzso Thus, there is the need to zzso the zzso of a zzso the zzso zzso genetic regulation zzso and signaling pathways in normal and stressed zzso The hypothesis presented by zzso and zzso of the requirement for 6 acquired characteristics for tumor development, independent of tissue type and species or zzso seems to provide a viable zzso This hypothesis can be addressed through whole cell molecular assessment using zzso and quantitative zzso together with the emerging zzso zzso This is the world of the new zzso cell zzso
