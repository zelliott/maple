Survival figures from a zzso study incorporate the overall practice in diagnosis, cure and clinical follow-up for a specific disease within a given health care zzso Being the outcome of a number of individual, social and economical aspects, zzso survival may be thought as index for measuring the level of a country's zzso 

The zzso project, a European Cancer zzso zzso concerted action, provided reliable information on survival for more than 800,000 cancer patients from 11 European zzso A great deal of zzso information has derived from zzso Women had a longer survival than men for all studied zzso sites, except for the zzso European survival zzso was fairly high for several zzso but it was lower for zzso with a relatively good prognosis and those sensitive to zzso The ranking of populations of cancer survival tended to be fairly stable for many zzso zzso of Switzerland and Finland ranked high and Polish zzso zzso Denmark, Italian and France zzso did not substantially differ from the European survival zzso For most zzso prognosis improved during the studied period (years of diagnosis: zzso Survival figures for colon zzso zzso zzso zzso r zzso zzso zzso and female breast cancer zzso zzso zzso well correlated with the national health expenditure of different participating zzso The zzso study, a new Italian Cancer zzso collaborative project involving more than 100,000 cancer patients, was set up to study survival differences within the zzso Survival of cancer patients was not homogeneous in 7 studied Italian regions (the estimated zzso relative survival for all zzso zzso combined ranked from zzso in zzso of Sicily to zzso in those of zzso The lowest levels of regional health expenditures were accompanied by the lowest levels of prognosis for overall zzso However, a relatively low correlation among patient cancer survival and the regional health expenditure zzso zzso zzso was found, suggesting that other factors such as different efficiency in managing cancer may play a role in explaining the zzso zzso 

zzso survival figures may be used to study zzso aspects, comparing different health systems, and may be interpreted as indexes for discussing zzso in health in different zzso
