Virtually all cancer biological attributes are zzso Because of this, it is currently difficult to reconcile results of cancer zzso and zzso zzso It is also established that cancer zzso zzso arise at rates higher than suspected, but yet are insufficient to explain all cancer cell zzso We have analyzed sequence variations of 17 abundantly expressed genes in a large set of human zzso originating from either normal or cancer zzso We show that cancer zzso have greater variations than normal zzso for zzso of the tested zzso These variations cannot be explained by known and putative zzso Furthermore, cancer zzso variations were not random, but were determined by the composition of the zzso base zzso as well as that of the bases located upstream (up to b - 4) and downstream (up to b + 3) of the substitution zzso The replacement base was also not randomly selected but corresponded in most cases zzso to a repetition of b - 1 or of b + zzso Base zzso follow a specific pattern of affected zzso A and T zzso were zzso observed in cancer zzso In contrast, cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Science zzso and zzso identified in the genes of the current study occurred zzso with C and zzso On the basis of these zzso we developed a working hypothesis that cancer zzso zzso results primarily from increased zzso zzso
