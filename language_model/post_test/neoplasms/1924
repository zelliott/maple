The literature is briefly summarized as to how several nutrients affect immune function, zzso to infection, and cancer zzso or zzso zzso deficiencies can impair immunity and so influence zzso to infectious agents, including ones that are common and relatively virulent in acquired immune zzso syndrome zzso zzso A variety of nutrients affect several of the immune functions that are defective in human zzso virus zzso zzso For example, zzso increased the number of zzso zzso vitamin E decreased the number of zzso cells and increased the zzso zzso vitamin D decreased the zzso zzso and iron increased the number of peripheral zzso in humans receiving zzso Furthermore, nutritional deficiencies can influence gastrointestinal function, while infectious diseases can influence zzso requirements by altering the efficiency of zzso and the rate of tissue zzso zzso depressed serum zinc levels, and zzso zzso zzso have been found in AIDS zzso The above findings suggest that dietary zzso might diminish the immune defects in zzso infection and enhance resistance to opportunistic zzso However, dietary zzso in immune defects are generally not well zzso and may be small relative to the magnitude of the defects observed in AIDS zzso Because conflicting or adverse effects have been reported for some zzso recommendations for dietary supplementation in zzso individuals are premature and possibly zzso Further studies are much needed to relate dietary zzso zzso to clinical zzso
