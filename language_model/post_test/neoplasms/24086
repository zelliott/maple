Safety in the drug treatment of hypertension can only be seen in relation to zzso which has now come to mean not just blood pressure zzso reduction but improvements in hard end points including zzso Information on safety can come from a variety of sources, in an ascending zzso which is as zzso zzso studies, cohort studies, zzso control trials zzso and zzso based on good zzso Only in the case of zzso are zzso criteria for zzso established, but evaluation of zzso and cohort studies remains zzso Despite these reserves about the data sources, it is proposed that the zzso study pointing to the risk of acute zzso zzso during therapy with zzso calcium channel zzso zzso can be balanced out by another better more recent study, and by a large cohort study from zzso In a very elderly population, a zzso cohort study strongly suggests that zzso zzso can be linked to increased mortality and that the specific links may be with a high dose and when the initial zzso is less than zzso zzso zzso However, initial zzso was only available in an unspecified number of zzso The risk of using zzso zzso was no more than that of zzso These differences can be attributed at least in part to the low zzso profile of zzso and the marked rapid zzso zzso with zzso zzso which could also explain the adverse effects found when this agent is given to patients with acute coronary zzso During the chronic use of zzso zzso zzso zzso most evidence suggests that there is little or no zzso zzso or in the case of zzso even a decrease in plasma zzso zzso These differences may explain why the expected zzso of left zzso zzso is obtained with long- but not zzso zzso At present the results of several large zzso controlled trials with zzso zzso are zzso In the meantime, when the decision has been made to use a zzso the preferential choice is for the use of a zzso for hypertension with clinical zzso or for zzso hypertension, for a zzso zzso for the control of left zzso zzso and for the zzso zzso when there is associated depression of zzso zzso
