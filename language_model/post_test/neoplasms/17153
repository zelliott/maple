zzso sequencing zzso allows for zzso sequencing analysis of large regions of the human zzso We explored the use of targeted zzso for simultaneous testing for multiple zzso in zzso zzso 

A custom panel zzso was designed to target 12 cancer genes with zzso zzso hot zzso zzso was performed to analyze DNA from zzso zzso zzso and zzso samples including 105 frozen, 72 zzso and 51 zzso aspiration samples representing all major types of zzso zzso 

Only zzso zzso of input DNA was sufficient for successful analysis of zzso of zzso The zzso accuracy for zzso detection was zzso with the sensitivity of zzso of zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso identified zzso in 19 of 27 of classic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 25 of 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso 14 of 18 conventional zzso and 7 of 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 of 10 poorly differentiated zzso zzso 20 of 27 zzso zzso zzso and 11 of 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, 5 of 83 benign zzso zzso were positive for zzso Most tumors had a single zzso whereas several zzso and zzso demonstrated two or three zzso The most common zzso detected were zzso and zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso frequency was zzso in zzso and was lower in zzso 

The zzso zzso panel allows simultaneous testing for multiple zzso with high accuracy and sensitivity, requires a small amount of DNA and can be performed in a variety of zzso tissue and zzso aspiration samples, and provides quantitative assessment of zzso zzso Using this approach, the point zzso were detected in zzso of specific types of zzso cancer and in only zzso of benign zzso zzso and were shown to be present in the majority of cells within the cancer zzso
