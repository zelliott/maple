zzso zzso zzso zzso is a genetic disorder characterized by zzso in zzso an zzso zzso The net effect of zzso expression on cancer outcomes from animal studies has proven zzso We evaluated whether reduced systemic zzso levels, expected in patients diagnosed with zzso impacted clinical outcomes for zzso 

A retrospective cohort analysis using zzso zzso and End zzso was conducted to evaluate the effect of zzso on survival among patients diagnosed with breast, zzso zzso or prostate cancer between 2000 and 2007 zzso zzso zzso We generated zzso survival zzso and Cox models to compare the effect of zzso on zzso survival for a composite of the four zzso and separate models by cancer, adjusting for demographic zzso cancer type, cancer stage, and zzso 

zzso survival analysis for a composite of the four zzso showed an adjusted zzso of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso of zzso P zzso zzso for zzso indicating significantly improved survival zzso When zzso by cancer type, zzso diagnosis showed a significant protective effect among breast cancer patients with an adjusted zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso 

There was a significant association between zzso and improved survival outcome for a composite of patients with breast, zzso zzso and lung cancer, and in analysis zzso by cancer, the association was significant for zzso patients with breast zzso 

This study supports the hypothesis that zzso zzso zzso expression is associated with improved survival outcome in multiple zzso and suggests that zzso zzso therapy may have broad-based zzso
