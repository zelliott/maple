zzso zzso in tumor models and widespread zzso of zzso in solid tumors prompted the study of the combination of the zzso target of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analog zzso with zzso 

zzso adult patients were zzso zzso zzso was given once weekly for 3 weeks and zzso was given from days 1 to 14 every 4 zzso zzso was given at 25, zzso 50, or 75 zzso with zzso at zzso zzso or 1,800 zzso divided into two daily zzso zzso of both drugs were determined during cycles 1 and zzso zzso studies in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso and wound tissue of the skin characterized pathways associated with the metabolism or disposition of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso 

Two recommended doses zzso were zzso 75 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and skin zzso One patient achieved a partial response lasting 10 months and 10 of 29 zzso patients had stable disease for zzso 6 zzso The only zzso interaction was a zzso increase in plasma exposure to zzso zzso data suggested that prolonged exposure to zzso reduced the zzso zzso of zzso zzso influenced the metabolism of zzso and inhibited zzso zzso behavior similar to that of zzso zzso of the target zzso zzso by zzso was zzso zzso and zzso signaling was inhibited in zzso zzso cells and was more pronounced at the zzso with the larger amount of zzso 

Good zzso feasibility of prolonged treatment, zzso activity, and favorable zzso profile support further investigation of this zzso
