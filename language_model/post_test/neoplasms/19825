We extended follow-up of a cohort of German rubber industry workers zzso or retired in zzso by 9 years zzso to zzso to reassess previously observed cancer mortality zzso 

We calculated standardized mortality ratios and zzso results by work area, duration of zzso and year of zzso 

The cohort includes zzso men and 1863 women from five tire or general rubber goods producing zzso Among men we observed significantly elevated standardized mortality ratios for zzso of the lung and the zzso in the full cohort and in specific zzso Among women we observed a significantly elevated standardized mortality ratio for cancer of the zzso 

We observed excess risk for several cancer sites among men and zzso Further cancer risk analysis of workers in the rubber industry should focus on differences in work areas and associated zzso
