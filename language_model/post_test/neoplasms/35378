It has become increasingly apparent that the ability to generate an optimal host immune response requires effective cross talk between the innate and zzso components of the immune zzso zzso zzso in particular those that can induce a danger zzso often called signal 3, are crucial in this role of initiating and zzso the presentation of zzso zzso to T cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso in particular has been defined as a zzso zzso zzso required for the zzso cross zzso Given this unique interactive function, a significant amount of work has been performed to define possible therapeutic applications for zzso zzso zzso administration can clearly act as a potent zzso for zzso T cell responses in a variety of zzso As an example, in the cancer setting, systemic zzso is capable of suppressing tumor growth, zzso and zzso in zzso zzso however, has been associated with significant zzso and zzso toxicity in early clinical trials, results that have proven to be a major obstacle to its clinical zzso Recent research has focused on decreasing the toxicity of zzso using different delivery approaches, including zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although effective, these approaches also have limitations, including the generation of zzso zzso in addition to lacking the simplicity and versatility required for universal clinical zzso Thus, there is a significant interest in the development of alternative delivery approaches for zzso administration that can overcome these zzso Several zzso delivery approaches for zzso protein or gene expression zzso are being zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso These developing approaches have shown promising zzso effects with significantly lessened systemic zzso This article discusses the potential capabilities of these zzso zzso delivery systems in different disease settings, including allergy, infection, and zzso
