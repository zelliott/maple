A small zzso zzso dose of zzso will reduce gut damage due to high dose zzso zzso in mice and sheep but efforts to demonstrate this effect in man have been hampered by difficulty in the measurement of gut zzso We have evaluated the zzso zzso zzso test, a new method for measuring zzso zzso as a means of assessing damage due to high dose zzso The test was reliable, with a narrow normal range, easy to use and well zzso It detected an increase in zzso zzso after high dose zzso with a maximum occurring between 9 and 15 days after treatment and subsequently returning to zzso It was shown in 19 patients that a zzso dose of zzso was capable of significantly reducing the abnormalities in zzso zzso which resulted from high dose zzso
