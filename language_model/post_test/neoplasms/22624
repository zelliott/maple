The zzso transition zzso describes a rapid and often zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso was originally defined in the context of zzso zzso including heart zzso zzso and neural crest zzso zzso cells loosen zzso zzso structures throughout zzso They zzso their zzso zzso organization and typically express zzso filaments and zzso zzso They become isolated, mobile and resistant to zzso The zzso at least zzso resembles the evolution from normal to transformed cell zzso during zzso zzso The relevance of the concept of zzso in this context was indicated by in zzso models using transformed zzso zzso zzso pathways typical of zzso zzso in zzso were also found to be activated during cancer zzso More recently, it has been found that such pathways indicate an increased plasticity linked to cellular zzso and ability to generate zzso However, in the absence of direct evidence, a number of zzso and zzso remain skeptical about applying the zzso concept to human tumor zzso Typically in the cancer field, zzso concept appears to be fully relevant in some situations, but the concept has to be adjusted in other situations to reflect tumor cell renewal and plasticity during zzso progression and zzso
