The zzso zzso model of cancer is widely zzso zzso appears to result most often from zzso of damage to the DNA expressed as multiple zzso in the zzso zzso zzso segregation during zzso of normal or zzso cells produces zzso cells and also contributes to the evolution of zzso However, it has been pointed out zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that DNA damage and loss of zzso are much more likely to lead the zzso clones of cells to extinction than to successful expansion zzso an example of zzso zzso It was argued that zzso zzso represent new zzso species that successfully evolve to zzso their hosts by incorporating zzso zzso of zzso through spontaneous or zzso zzso fusion into their zzso zzso zzso fusion is generally blocked by the zzso zzso to which the cells are bound via surface zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso In order for progression of zzso zzso toward clinically significant cancer to occur, the zzso cells must escape from the zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso also allows the zzso cells to invade adjacent zzso and zzso to remote zzso Both invasion and zzso likely involve fusion of the zzso zzso cells with zzso blast zzso There are at least three pathways through which zzso cells can be liberated from the zzso zzso zzso Their zzso molecules may be modified zzso by zzso so that they can no longer grip the zzso zzso Their zzso molecules or zzso may be saturated with other zzso zzso zzso zzso Their zzso molecules may be zzso from the cell surface or the zzso itself may be zzso zzso by zzso or zzso It is hypothesized that zzso of zzso cells and zzso fusion go hand-in-hand in the progression of zzso to clinically significant cancer through invasion and zzso The zzso between tumor recognition and exposure to zzso and the increased zzso of cancer with age can probably be related to slow breakdown of the zzso zzso that provides a barrier to zzso zzso
