A recent study zzso zzso zzso zzso 315 zzso zzso described a method of detecting zzso tumors by zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance (1 H zzso study of zzso We performed a similar study of the W 1/2, a mean of the full zzso at half height of the zzso of the zzso and zzso groups of the lipids of plasma zzso which is zzso related to the zzso apparent relaxation time zzso zzso W 1/2 values were measured at a fixed baseline zzso of 310 zzso The study was prospective and blinded and comprised 182 subjects consisting of 40 controls, 68 patients with zzso zzso 45 with zzso tumors undergoing therapy and 29 benign tumor zzso No differences were seen between any groups that could serve as a basis for a useful clinical zzso The major difficulty in the determination of W 1/2 was due to interference of zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso resonance zzso zzso level was seen to correlate zzso with W 1/2 within zzso patient zzso These zzso results may be related to differing zzso very low density zzso zzso levels in the patient populations of each zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso of plasma zzso is not a valid measurement for assessing zzso
