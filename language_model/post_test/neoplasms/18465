Despite long-term clinical experience with zzso unpredictable severe adverse reactions remain an important zzso to limit the drug zzso To identify a genetic zzso affecting the risk of zzso zzso we performed a zzso association zzso 

We studied zzso patients consisting of 67 patients with grade 3 or 4 zzso and zzso patients showing no toxicity zzso with grade 1 or 2 were excluded from the zzso for zzso association zzso We further examined the single zzso zzso zzso showing P values of less than zzso using an additional set of 48 patients with grade 3/4 zzso 

The combined analysis indicated that zzso in zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso odds ratio zzso with zzso confidence zzso zzso the zzso zzso as zzso was significantly associated with zzso zzso A zzso analysis of patients with only breast cancer showed a similar trend of association for the marker zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso We subsequently performed zzso analysis and found that a zzso constructed from zzso and zzso which was in linkage zzso with zzso zzso showed stronger association zzso zzso with zzso zzso than a single landmark zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso that could influence the zzso of zzso adverse drug reactions zzso might exist in this zzso 

Our findings show that genetic zzso in the zzso 1 locus are suggestively associated with the risk of zzso zzso and might be zzso in development of diagnostic system for predicting the risk of the zzso leading to better prognosis and quality of life for patients with zzso However, these results should be considered preliminary until zzso in adequately larger powered and controlled zzso
