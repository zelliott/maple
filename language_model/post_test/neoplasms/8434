The pressing need for large-scale culture methods has prompted efforts to develop vessels which will accommodate the growth of large numbers of zzso zzso The large-scale zzso zzso have been used to grow viruses for vaccine production, zzso acid studies, and various cancer research zzso Two particular types of culture vessels used for large-scale production of zzso cells were discussed and examples of their use in vaccine production zzso Development of these large-scale culture systems has enabled the pharmaceutical companies to zzso meet the ever-increasing demands worldwide for zzso zzso employ a production process that produces a zzso vaccine product in cell culture, and zzso produce large volumes of bulk vaccine at a single campaign, thus allowing multiple usage of a single production unit over the course of a zzso The type of large-scale culture vessel used depends on the purpose of the culture and the type of cells that are to be grown in the zzso The unit process vessel, with its zzso provides superior surface area, but because of the stainless steel housing, the cells cannot be monitored zzso Additionally, the unit process vessel can be equipped with a jacket for precise temperature regulation and thus eliminate the need for zzso The roller bottles, on the other hand, allow microscopic monitoring of the growing cells but are limited in surface area available for growth, and the volume of harvest fluid zzso from a bottle is very zzso It should be noted that handling of roller bottles is zzso and requires many more zzso and hence more personnel than employing unit zzso vessels for zzso zzso The use of mass zzso techniques in cancer research has also been of immense zzso The production of large numbers of zzso cells has provided researchers with the raw materials to perform molecular biology experiments such as DNA sequencing, which required zzso quantities of cells before sufficient quantities of DNA could be isolated to allow sequencing zzso Additionally, the technique of mass zzso also provided sufficient quantities of cells for zzso into either nude mice or zzso zzso in an attempt to determine the tumor induction capacity of the cultured zzso Additional characterization studies which require large numbers of cell, zzso and zzso profiles can also be performed on cells grown in roller bottle zzso There are numerous factors which limit the productivity of mass zzso systems and the scientist should be aware of their zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
