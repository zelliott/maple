We performed a zzso study of zzso zzso in solid tumors to determine the zzso dose zzso and define its toxicity profile at higher zzso 

zzso patients, seven with zzso zzso twelve with zzso melanoma, and two with zzso zzso were enrolled onto the zzso Patients were entered onto zzso that received zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso by continuous intravenous infusion for 7 days every 28 zzso zzso levels were determined by zzso In tumor tissue samples, zzso zzso zzso levels were measured by both zzso activity and zzso protein zzso 

Of seven patients treated with zzso at zzso zzso one experienced grade 3 or 4 zzso Of 11 patients treated at zzso zzso four experienced zzso two after a single course of zzso All three patients who received zzso at zzso zzso experienced zzso zzso events occurred in two patients, both with zzso zzso Two of seven patients zzso with zzso obtained partial responses with a median duration of 8 zzso zzso penetrated the zzso zzso An association was found between zzso levels as measured by zzso activity and zzso zzso but this did not correlate with zzso tumor zzso 

The zzso for zzso delivered as a zzso intravenous infusion in patients with zzso zzso was determined to be zzso zzso the same as the zzso for patients with zzso zzso There was no clinical correlation with zzso expression and response to zzso The responses noted in patients with zzso zzso warrant further phase II zzso
