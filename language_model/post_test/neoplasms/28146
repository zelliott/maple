Despite recent progress in early detection and local zzso therapy, patients with primary zzso cancer quite frequently zzso with incurable zzso Early zzso tumor cells that may be seminal for distant failure and are zzso by current diagnostic methods have been identified by zzso techniques in bone zzso of cancer patients using zzso zzso against zzso Recently, promising new molecular approaches, zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso have been suggested as a potential technique for the detection of minimal residual tumor burden by targeting zzso transcribed from zzso genes in bone zzso peripheral blood, or zzso zzso Several studies using zzso thus far indicate a highly sensitive and specific staging zzso although the zzso value is still zzso However, limitations may arise from zzso expression of marker zzso in zzso cells and deficient expression in circulating tumor zzso The present review focuses on the relevant literature and demonstrates the range of current applications of zzso zzso for detecting zzso tumor cells in peripheral blood and bone zzso of patients with solid zzso We will both zzso technical evaluations of published molecular approaches and discuss the widely disparate results on zzso findings in clinical zzso
