zzso zzso treatments, delivered by conventional zzso systems, have rapidly become the most common form of zzso Several innovative alternative zzso options are also now available, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso These innovative approaches have divergent zzso zzso zzso is being developed because it allows treatments to be delivered using conventional zzso without expensive zzso zzso and not because it improves dose zzso On the other hand, zzso and zzso systems have different geometric degrees of freedom, beam sizes and zzso techniques than those of conventional zzso which may enable these innovative systems to deliver superior dose zzso to some treatment zzso Because conventional zzso are themselves finely honed machines, enhancement of one aspect of machine performance is sometimes accompanied by diminution of zzso For example, zzso systems possess an enhanced zzso zzso capability but currently can only deliver zzso radiation zzso Thus the various delivery systems may prove optimal for different types of treatments, specific machine designs zzso for specific disease zzso In practice, of course, zzso delivery systems will be distinguished not just by the quality of the dose zzso they deliver but also by factors not discussed in this chapter, such as the efficiency of their treatment process, the integration of zzso imaging into that process, and their ability to measure, zzso and compensate for the effects of respiratory motion, a major detriment to accurate zzso zzso
