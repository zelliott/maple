zzso zzso have become a standard tool for gene transfer zzso Compared with other gene transfer systems, zzso zzso have several advantages, including their ability to zzso a variety of cell types, to integrate efficiently into the zzso DNA of the recipient cells and to express the zzso gene at high zzso The relatively well understood biology of zzso has made possible the development of packaging cell lines which provide in trans all the viral proteins required for viral particle zzso The design of different types of packaging cells has evolved to reduce the possibility of helper virus zzso The host range of zzso has been expanded by zzso the zzso with zzso viral zzso and zzso zzso The development of zzso zzso has allowed efficient gene transfer to zzso zzso This review describes different strategies adopted for developing zzso to be used in gene therapy zzso
