Based on zzso data showing zzso between zzso zzso and platinum agents, a phase I trial of zzso with zzso administered as a 3 h infusion in patients with advanced solid tumors was zzso The primary goals of this trial were to evaluate the zzso of this combination and the zzso of zzso when administered over 3 h and to compare the zzso and zzso with previously described zzso 

Patients with advanced solid tumors, good performance status, normal organ function, and no potentially zzso therapy were eligible for the zzso zzso was escalated from an area under the curve zzso of 3 to an zzso of zzso zzso was escalated from 50 to 90 zzso 

zzso patients with advanced solid tumors (20 with prior platinum zzso received a total of 60 cycles of zzso Full doses of both agents zzso zzso 5, zzso 90 zzso in cycle 1, 45 zzso in subsequent zzso could be zzso The major toxicity noted was zzso which could be zzso with the use of saline zzso and zzso No responses were zzso however, seven patients were able to receive more than two courses of zzso Of note, two of three patients with zzso progressive small cell lung cancer were able to receive six cycles of therapy without evidence of zzso One patient experienced resolution of zzso syndrome of inappropriate zzso zzso The zzso variables zzso and zzso of the 3 h infusion were essentially identical to those previously observed when zzso was administered over 72 zzso The average zzso for cycle 1 was zzso zzso 301 zzso and the mean zzso for all dose levels was zzso zzso The mean zzso over the dosing zzso for each dose level ranged from approximately 6,000 to 9,000 zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso after the 3 h infusion was lower than was observed after a 72 h zzso 

The regimen of zzso and zzso zzso as a 3 h zzso was well zzso Further development of this zzso particularly in small cell lung cancer, is zzso
