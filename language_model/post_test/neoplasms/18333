The authors examined potential reasons zzso zzso distress, health behavior, chronic health conditions, access to medical care) for increased prevalence of zzso functional limitations among long-term zzso or zzso zzso cancer zzso 

The authors used National Health zzso zzso data from 2005 through 2007, and defined zzso functional limitation as reporting zzso to perform at least 1 of 5 activities zzso approximately one-quarter of a zzso walking up and down 10 steps without zzso standing for 2 hours; zzso zzso or zzso and lifting 10 zzso Increased prevalence of zzso functional limitations was compared between long-term survivors of each of 11 cancer types reported by zzso or zzso respondents zzso zzso zzso and persons without cancer history zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Among cancer survivors, zzso had a zzso functional limitation versus zzso of zzso The zzso prevalence of zzso functional limitations varied by cancer type, ranging from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso lung zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and breast zzso zzso cancer survivors had increased odds of reporting a zzso functional limitation than controls after adjusting for zzso factors (all P zzso zzso zzso in the prevalence of arthritis and zzso pain and in access to medical care explained differences in zzso functional limitation prevalence between controls and long-term breast, zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso lymphoma, melanoma, and prostate cancer survivors were equally likely to report a zzso functional limitation as zzso 

Treatment of arthritis and zzso pain and increasing access to medical care might help reduce the risk of zzso functional limitations and improve quality of life among specific long-term cancer zzso
