zzso and zzso receptors have been shown to play a role in zzso Whereas the zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso frequently expressed by tumors, the other three zzso the zzso B zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been poorly investigated in human zzso 

We investigated 161 human tumors for their zzso zzso zzso expression using in zzso zzso zzso with the universal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in displacement experiments with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The distinct rank order of zzso of these zzso for each zzso zzso allows us to identify the zzso zzso expressed by each zzso 

Twelve of 12 prostate zzso 41 of 57 breast zzso and 5 of 5 zzso expressed predominantly zzso zzso 11 of 24 zzso 1 of 26 zzso and 1 of 1 zzso zzso had zzso zzso zzso 9 of 26 zzso zzso 1 large cell neuroendocrine lung zzso and 4 of 9 small cell lung zzso had zzso zzso zzso whereas 3 of 9 small cell lung zzso had zzso zzso Renal cell zzso had zzso receptors in 6 of 16 cases and zzso receptors in 4 of 16 zzso Finally, 2 of 10 Ewing zzso had zzso zzso In zzso zzso detected zzso zzso zzso in neuroendocrine tumors expressing the zzso zzso 

This is the first study detecting the proteins of zzso zzso and zzso receptors in a group of human tumors using differential binding zzso Particularly relevant is the zzso expression in lung zzso and other neuroendocrine lung tumors, whereas gastrointestinal zzso preferably express zzso zzso These tumors may be targets for diagnostic and zzso applications of zzso zzso zzso
