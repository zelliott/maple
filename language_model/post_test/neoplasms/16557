Comparative zzso zzso zzso is a molecular zzso analysis that allows identification of zzso changes by comparing the copy number of DNA sequences in cells of tested tissue and the reference zzso zzso is based on competitive zzso in zzso zzso of two differently labeled DNA zzso zzso and reference, zzso normal, zzso zzso with zzso zzso of a healthy zzso First described by zzso et zzso in 1992, the zzso zzso has been widely used for identification and characterization of both zzso and structural zzso abnormalities in cells of different zzso at various pathological conditions in humans, especially in tumor zzso We discuss the specific features and quality control of comparative zzso zzso its advantages and limitations in detection of zzso imbalance and the prospects for development of this zzso
