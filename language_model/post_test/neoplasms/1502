zzso zzso zzso zzso is a rare zzso zzso In this study we investigated the von zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso in patients with zzso 

The plasma or serum zzso activity was measured using a sensitive zzso zzso zzso zzso by detecting the residual collagen binding activity zzso of von zzso factor zzso before and after zzso by zzso zzso of zzso in plasma of patients with zzso were also analyzed by zzso zzso Moreover, the serum zzso activities were compared between the patients with zzso and those with zzso 

The zzso of variation for zzso and zzso of the zzso were zzso and zzso The plasma and serum zzso activity in healthy individuals were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 30) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively, while the plasma zzso activity in 5 patients with zzso was markedly decreased zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The unusually large zzso zzso were observed in two plasma samples of the patients with zzso Although the zzso activities in patients with benign and zzso tumors were also decreased zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso respectively), they were relatively high in comparison with that of zzso patients zzso zzso zzso 

zzso of the zzso activity using zzso is a simple and rapid method for diagnosing zzso The zzso activity in patients with zzso was markedly lower than those of patients with zzso
