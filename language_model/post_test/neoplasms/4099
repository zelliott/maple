The admission of zzso patients to an intensive care unit zzso is still controversial, especially if mechanical ventilation is zzso To avoid useless stays in zzso the evaluation of the respective role of the underlying zzso and acute organ failures might be useful for better definition of the categories of patients who could benefit from aggressive zzso zzso For this purpose, we carried out a retrospective study of the charts of 107 consecutive zzso patients admitted to an zzso in a comprehensive cancer zzso over a four-year zzso The following characteristics were recorded within 24 h of admission: patient data, characteristics of zzso and the underlying zzso the type and number of organ system failures zzso and simplified acute zzso scores zzso and zzso zzso The impact of each variable on outcome in the zzso was studied by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 59 patients died in the zzso zzso rate: zzso Patients with a zzso zzso zzso zzso 57, zzso were more likely to experience respiratory failure, an underlying zzso deemed rapidly zzso and to have longer lasting zzso than patients with a solid zzso zzso zzso 50, zzso However, the mortality rate did not differ in the two groups zzso zzso zzso versus solid zzso zzso p zzso zzso Respiratory and cardiovascular organ failure zzso zzso zzso for zzso correlated with mortality in the zzso In the multiple zzso zzso model, only the number of organ system failures and respiratory failure remained zzso of zzso zzso In conclusion, the characteristics of the underlying zzso are not relevant when deciding whether or not zzso patients should be admitted to an zzso The main risk factors for death in an zzso are the number of organ failures on admission, and among them the presence of respiratory zzso
