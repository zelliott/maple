Although changes of plasma zzso have been documented in limited pancreatic zzso tumors, a relationship between plasma zzso and pancreatic cancer in a large-scale clinical study has not been zzso 

zzso plasma levels of zzso were zzso analyzed in 133 pancreatic cancer and 38 pancreatic benign tumor zzso 

Plasma zzso in pancreatic cancer patients were significantly higher than those with benign pancreatic tumor zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The percentage of zzso zzso zzso in pancreatic cancer was zzso and no positive results were obtained in benign pancreatic zzso Plasma zzso levels were increased in pancreatic cancer with advanced tumor zzso zzso with the progression of tumor stage, there was an increase in the percentage of zzso of zzso in pancreatic zzso There were markedly higher levels of plasma zzso in the zzso group than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso vs zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed that high plasma zzso levels zzso zzso were positively associated with distant zzso of pancreatic zzso 

Plasma zzso levels had a positive relationship with tumor stage of pancreatic zzso Increased zzso plasma zzso levels might be a useful predictor for distant zzso in human pancreatic zzso
