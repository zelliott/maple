The invasion of normal zzso and penetration of basement zzso by zzso cells is likely to require the active participation of zzso zzso The four major groups of zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso collagen and zzso vary in their quantitative zzso between different zzso With the exception of zzso they also vary zzso within each class, so that there are no zzso zzso tissue barriers to tumor cell zzso The zzso constituents are stabilized and organized by a variety of zzso and zzso interactions between the zzso tissue zzso These interactions play important roles in zzso integrity and may alter the zzso of the constituents to zzso zzso It is likely that the complete degradation of the zzso will require the action of more than one zzso because of differing zzso to tissue zzso zzso and zzso tumors produce zzso zzso which may participate in zzso These zzso may also be involved in zzso tissue turnover in other normal and pathological zzso The use of long-term tumor cell cultures has verified that tumor cells themselves are capable of producing these zzso However, there are many potential modulating influences operative in zzso which are absent in culture so that details of actual mechanisms and control of zzso of complex zzso are not well zzso Recent work on the degradation by tumor cells of zzso zzso previously produced by cultured cells is likely to shed more light on pathways of tissue destruction in zzso zzso with tumor cell zzso of defined zzso zzso will also be useful, but invasive and zzso abilities are not necessarily zzso It is unlikely that simple correlations can be drawn between the production of one particular zzso zzso by all tumor cells and the complex biological mechanisms operative during tumor zzso
