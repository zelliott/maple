The loading of tissue with zzso can result in the enhancement of the radiation dose absorbed from low-energy zzso or gamma ray zzso We have explored the potential of this phenomenon for radiation zzso We have demonstrated the effect of zzso concentration and radiation quality on this dose enhancement in zzso we have calculated the effect of such enhancement on depth dose zzso in the brain, we have estimated the zzso content in two human brain tumors during computerized zzso zzso scans, we have studied the zzso of the zzso contrast media after direct injection into rabbit tumors, and we have demonstrated that the combination of zzso and contrast media injection is far more effective than either agent alone in causing the zzso of mouse zzso These results suggest that there may be a therapeutic advantage from loading tumors with zzso and treating them with low-energy zzso
