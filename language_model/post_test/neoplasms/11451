zzso zzso infections are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in zzso cancer patients and zzso therapy are used both zzso and zzso in these zzso 

To compare the benefits and harms of zzso with those of zzso B and zzso when used for prevention or treatment of invasive zzso infections in cancer patients with zzso 

zzso and the Cochrane Library zzso zzso zzso abstracts and unpublished trials were zzso zzso to authors and zzso 

zzso trials comparing zzso with zzso B or zzso 

Data on zzso invasive zzso infection, zzso use of additional zzso zzso therapy and adverse effects leading to zzso of therapy were extracted by two authors zzso 

Two trials were zzso One trial compared zzso to zzso zzso B as empirical treatment of fever of unknown origin zzso zzso zzso in zzso cancer patients zzso patients, 58 zzso The other trial compared zzso to zzso B zzso in the treatment of confirmed and presumed invasive zzso infections zzso patients, 98 zzso In the first trial, zzso was significantly inferior to zzso zzso B according to the zzso zzso zzso More patients died in the zzso group and a claimed significant reduction in the number of breakthrough zzso infections disappeared when patients arbitrarily excluded from analysis by the authors were zzso In the second trial, the zzso preparation of zzso B was used without any indication of the use of zzso and substitution with zzso and salt water to avoid zzso this zzso This choice of zzso resulted in a marked difference in the duration of treatment on trial drugs zzso days with zzso versus 10 days with zzso B), and zzso meaningful comparisons of the benefits and harms of the two zzso 

zzso zzso B is significantly more effective than zzso for empirical therapy of zzso cancer patients and should be zzso For treatment of zzso there are no trials that have compared zzso with zzso B given under optimal zzso
