Different individuals appear to respond differently to the same zzso and different zzso act differently on zzso We conducted zzso sensitivity zzso by using three zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso an ultraviolet light zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a tobacco zzso in parallel in healthy human subjects to determine the relationships among these zzso Our results showed that the mean breaks per cell values zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso sensitivity were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Age, sex, smoking status, and family history of cancer were not correlated with any of these zzso zzso Also, there was no correlation between zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso sensitivity, but a weak correlation between zzso and zzso was observed zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso When the 75th zzso of zzso was used as a zzso point in each zzso only one individual zzso was sensitive to all three zzso Ten individuals zzso were sensitive to two zzso 20 zzso to one zzso and 25 zzso to none of three zzso Our study suggests that these three zzso may involve different DNA damage and repair zzso The lack of correlation between the zzso results may indicate the necessity of using a battery of zzso sensitivity tests to refine our ability to identify a zzso at high cancer zzso
