Since the optimal duration of zzso therapy in zzso zzso patients is not clear, we evaluated the safety and efficacy of short courses of intravenous zzso treatment in selected pediatric cancer patients admitted for fever and zzso 

We zzso analyzed the clinical course of children with zzso zzso and zzso All patients were treated with empirical intravenous zzso In episodes of fever of unknown origin zzso treatment regimen allowed zzso of antibiotics and early hospital discharge regardless of absolute zzso count zzso or evidence of bone zzso recovery as long as patients were zzso for at least 24 h and had been treated for a minimum of 72 zzso 

106 episodes of zzso zzso occurred in 56 zzso 84 episodes were classified as zzso and intravenous zzso therapy was discontinued regardless of zzso when patients met the criteria described zzso No death or major complication zzso None of the patients had to be zzso for zzso fever or zzso 

zzso of intravenous antibiotics regardless of zzso or evidence of bone zzso recovery seems safe and effective in pediatric cancer patients with zzso when children are zzso for at least 24 h and are treated for a minimum of 72 zzso
