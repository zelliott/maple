A variety of zzso have been associated with the presence of human zzso zzso zzso its zzso and fragments of its zzso in blood and zzso The usefulness of these zzso tumor markers in zzso zzso has been inhibited by inadequate zzso zzso In order to achieve the required sensitivity and zzso concentration steps and other procedures to remove zzso human zzso hormone were zzso In addition, the coexistence of a zzso of the zzso or beta human zzso hormone zzso contributes to significant errors of measurement in zzso The importance of the zzso zzso as a potential tumor marker has been recognized previously but no method was available to measure this zzso zzso We report here the development of a series of zzso zzso zzso which will accurately measure zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso directly in small volumes of zzso zzso These zzso are highly specific, extremely sensitive, and not labor intensive since they employ zzso plate zzso Application of these zzso to urine samples from patients with zzso zzso indicated that over 50% of all patients tested zzso the zzso zzso in their zzso Also, this zzso comprised more than 50% of the zzso of zzso zzso components present in the specimens that were positive for zzso This cancer marker is also zzso in zzso zzso states such as zzso in which the low molecular weight zzso can also be zzso directly by zzso zzso We conclude that a search for zzso zzso in the urine of patients with zzso will be improved by the inclusion of accurate zzso of the prominent quantities of the beta zzso zzso by these zzso
