Certain zzso such as the brain, eye, and zzso are particularly sensitive to damage by zzso zzso these zzso have developed unique zzso properties that curtail inflammatory responses, a phenomenon termed immune zzso In addition, by co-opting some of the regulatory cues zzso in immune privilege in normal zzso tumors can evade zzso While many different mechanisms contribute to immune privilege, there is evidence that zzso migration is an important checkpoint in its zzso This hypothesis is based on the fact that zzso entry into these zzso is restricted by physical barriers and that the collapse of these obstacles marks a critical step in the development of zzso disease at these zzso Numerous studies in a variety of experimental systems have characterized the molecular and cellular mechanisms involved in zzso zzso to zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso has revealed critical insights into the events occurring in the zzso space of zzso zzso including locomotion patterns and interactive behavior of zzso in the zzso zzso Here, we review our current understanding of immune cell migration to and within zzso zzso and highlight how this knowledge may be exploited for zzso zzso
