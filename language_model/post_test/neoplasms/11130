zzso and zzso zzso zzso were discovered in 2007 in respiratory tract samples in adults and zzso Other zzso zzso and zzso have been associated with illness in zzso patients, and some studies suggest a higher prevalence of zzso and zzso in this zzso 

To determine whether a higher prevalence or viral load for zzso and zzso exists in zzso children compared with zzso zzso 

We measured the prevalence and viral load of zzso and zzso zzso by quantitative real-time zzso of viral DNA in respiratory tract specimens from pediatric zzso patients and zzso controls with acute respiratory zzso 

The prevalence of zzso in the zzso population was zzso zzso versus zzso zzso in the control population zzso and zzso zzso versus zzso zzso respectively for zzso zzso The mean viral load (in copies per cell or zzso of zzso for zzso was higher in the zzso group compared to the control group zzso but was not statistically different for zzso A higher prevalence was seen in the zzso stem cell transplant recipients compared with other zzso patients zzso versus zzso zzso zzso persistence was demonstrated only in zzso zzso of sequential samples for zzso and no persistence was seen for zzso 

A higher prevalence of zzso or zzso in the zzso population compared with the zzso group was not zzso Higher viral loads for zzso in the zzso group may suggest an increased zzso potential in this zzso
