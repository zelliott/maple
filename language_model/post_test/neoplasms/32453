In a zzso zzso study, we compared serum levels of 15 zzso zzso zzso zzso and three zzso pesticides in residents of two districts in eastern zzso one with extensive environmental contamination from a former zzso production site zzso and the other matched on geography but with low zzso levels zzso The zzso geometric means for sum of 15 measured zzso zzso were statistically significantly higher in subjects from the zzso district for both zzso zzso versus zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso versus zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were also significantly higher, although the absolute differences were less zzso There was no substantial difference in zzso levels between the zzso We also conducted an zzso study to compare cancer zzso occurring in these same two districts from 1985 through zzso We calculated standardized zzso ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals for each district using indirect zzso and rates from eastern zzso Among males from zzso zzso but not zzso zzso there was an excess of cancer of the tongue zzso zzso stomach zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and kidney zzso zzso and lower than expected zzso of prostate cancer zzso zzso in contrast, there was an excess of zzso zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso zzso in zzso not observed zzso Among females from zzso but not zzso there was an excess of cancer of the lip zzso zzso stomach zzso zzso and lung zzso zzso in contrast, there was an excess of kidney zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cancer in zzso not observed in zzso Taken together, these results raise the possibility that high environmental exposure to zzso in the zzso district may be associated with higher rates of certain zzso particularly stomach and lung zzso
