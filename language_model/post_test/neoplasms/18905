The Internet provides a widely accessible zzso for meeting zzso care needs of cancer zzso In this paper, we describe the development and zzso of an Internet site designed as a base from which to conduct a zzso controlled trial to meet zzso needs of zzso stem cell transplantation zzso zzso 

A zzso team zzso wrote content, and programmed an Internet site for online study zzso zzso assessment, and study zzso All survivors who were zzso years after zzso for zzso zzso and treated at one transplant center were approached by mail for zzso All study activities could be conducted without study staff zzso However, participants had options for phone or zzso contact with study staff as zzso 

Of zzso participants approached for the study, zzso zzso of those zzso zzso and completed baseline zzso Mean age was zzso zzso zzso age range, zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso percent required staff contact one or more times; a majority were for minor technical issues or delays in completion of enrollment or baseline zzso 

This study demonstrated the potential for providing Internet-based zzso care to long-term survivors of zzso Although building a zzso Internet site requires a team with diverse expertise, once built, these resources can be implemented rapidly with large numbers of zzso 

While Internet-based services will not meet all the needs of cancer survivors, this methodology represents an important zzso for zzso zzso clinical services as a method for meeting zzso information, and resource needs of cancer zzso
