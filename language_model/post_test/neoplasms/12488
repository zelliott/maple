The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso implicated in the control of zzso zzso Here we identify the mouse zzso gene as a zzso zzso zzso gene by using a zzso genetic screen for zzso genes involved in zzso zzso zzso from zzso mice, but not those from zzso mice, show frequent loss of zzso and a zzso zzso rate of the zzso zzso zzso mice have greater zzso to zzso zzso but most zzso retain and express the zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso Loss of zzso alters the spectrum of zzso that develop in zzso deficient mice to include a range of zzso in zzso zzso such as the zzso liver and zzso Mouse zzso zzso from zzso mice, or zzso mouse cells expressing zzso small interfering zzso have higher levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not of zzso zzso We propose that zzso loss of zzso leads to genetic instability by mechanisms that might involve the zzso of zzso providing a rationale for the early occurrence of these zzso in human zzso
