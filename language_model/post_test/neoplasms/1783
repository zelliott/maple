zzso is a crucial biological process that prevents uncontrolled cell proliferation and eliminates harmful zzso Resistance to zzso stimuli is a hallmark feature of various zzso One of the mechanisms through which tumor cells are believed to acquire resistance to zzso is by zzso of inhibitor of zzso proteins zzso zzso are a group of structurally related proteins that were initially identified in zzso zzso zzso block zzso either by binding and zzso zzso or through zzso zzso This family of proteins has become increasingly prominent in the field of cancer zzso To date, zzso of several zzso has been detected in various zzso This paper reviews the recent advances in the research of zzso The differential expression and the biological significance of each zzso in various cancer types will be zzso Finally, we review the most recent advances in the research efforts aimed at using zzso as potential targets for cancer zzso
