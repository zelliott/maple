zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in promoting the zzso and survival of zzso T cells during the primary zzso Interestingly, zzso plus zzso activated zzso zzso T cells are highly resistant to zzso cell death zzso which zzso with high expression levels of zzso molecules such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso We determined whether the resistance of activated zzso zzso T cells to zzso contributes to more effective protection against tumor cell zzso We found that during a primary tumor challenge, despite initial zzso in controlling tumor cell growth, zzso mice were able to more effectively control tumor burden over time compared with zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, vaccination of zzso mice with zzso zzso zzso that express zzso zzso better protection against the growth of zzso zzso tumor cells relative to similarly vaccinated zzso zzso The enhanced protection against tumor cell growth was not due to more effective zzso of zzso memory zzso T cells in vaccinated zzso zzso In zzso studies indicate that zzso activated zzso zzso zzso T cells proliferated to the same extent and possess similar zzso against zzso tumor cells as zzso zzso T zzso However, relative to zzso cells, activated zzso zzso zzso T cells were highly resistant to zzso Thus, the enhanced protection against zzso in zzso mice is likely due to the recruitment and zzso of zzso memory zzso zzso T cells and their prolonged survival at the tumor zzso
