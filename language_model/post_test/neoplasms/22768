Many cancer zzso agents form DNA zzso zzso zzso extremely zzso zzso that form zzso bonds between two opposing DNA zzso blocking DNA replication and zzso However, cellular responses triggered by zzso can cause resistance in tumor cells, limiting the efficacy of such zzso Here we discuss recent advances in our understanding of the mechanisms of zzso repair that cause this zzso The recent development of strategies for the synthesis of zzso zzso greatly contributed to these zzso Key features of repair are similar for all zzso but there is increasing evidence that the specifics of zzso recognition and synthesis past zzso by DNA zzso are dependent upon the structure of zzso These new insights provide a basis for the improvement of zzso therapy by targeting DNA repair pathways that lead to resistance to treatment with zzso zzso
