The modification of cell zzso at elevated temperatures by zzso the nearest analog of zzso was studied with the use of zzso cells in the presence or absence of zzso When the cells were exposed to temperatures ranging from zzso degrees for zzso to 4 zzso in the presence of zzso (5 zzso there was a selective zzso of zzso killing of hypoxic zzso No enhanced killing of zzso cells by zzso was seen at these zzso These results indicate that zzso metabolism may be involved in influencing the heat sensitivity of hypoxic zzso The low toxicity of zzso and its specificity to hypoxic cells suggest that it may be a useful zzso to zzso zzso
