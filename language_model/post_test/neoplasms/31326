In 1969, the International Agency for Research on Cancer zzso initiated the zzso zzso to evaluate the zzso risk of chemicals to zzso zzso from short-term zzso tests were first included in the zzso zzso in the zzso based on the observation that most zzso are also zzso although not all zzso are zzso Experimental evidence at that time showed a strong correlation between zzso and zzso and indicated that short-term zzso tests are useful for predicting zzso Although the strength of these correlations has diminished over the past 20 years with the identification of putative zzso zzso such tests provide vital information for identifying potential human zzso and understanding mechanisms of zzso The short-term test results for agents compiled in the zzso zzso zzso Profile zzso database over nearly 15 years are summarized and reviewed here with regard to their zzso zzso zzso The evidence of zzso or zzso based on a zzso zzso of test results from three genetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is zzso zzso are made for assessing chemicals based on the strength of evidence from short-term tests, and the implications of this approach in identifying zzso mechanisms of zzso are zzso The role of short-term test data in influencing the overall zzso of specific compounds in recent zzso volumes is discussed, particularly with reference to studies in human zzso zzso oxide is cited as an zzso
