This systematic review aims to get insight into the feasibility of zzso exercise testing zzso in patients with cancer prior to a physical exercise zzso We will focus on quality zzso as the adherence to international guidelines for methods of zzso and safety of zzso Furthermore, we compare the peak oxygen zzso zzso values of patients with cancer with reference values for healthy persons to put these values into a clinical zzso A computer aided search with zzso exercise zzso and zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was carried zzso We included studies in which zzso with continuous gas exchange analysis has been performed prior to a physical exercise zzso in adults with zzso Twenty studies describing zzso patients were zzso zzso adherence to international recommendations for zzso varied per zzso In most studies, the methods of zzso were not reported in zzso zzso events occurred in zzso of zzso The percentage zzso of reference values for healthy persons varied between zzso and zzso for tests before treatment, between zzso and zzso for tests during treatment and between zzso and zzso for tests after zzso Our results suggest that zzso is feasible and seems to be safe for patients with cancer prior to a physical exercise zzso We recommend that standard reporting and quality guidelines should be followed for zzso zzso The decreased zzso values of patients with cancer indicate that physical exercise should be implemented in their standard zzso
