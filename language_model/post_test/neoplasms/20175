The zzso of genetic damage in the forms of activated zzso and zzso zzso genes is the driving force in the evolution of a normal cell to a zzso zzso For example, both the zzso of zzso zzso and the zzso of several zzso zzso including zzso have been observed in the development of human colon and lung zzso Point zzso in key zzso can activate zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso Thus, several critical genes for zzso are potential targets for zzso and radiation that can induce point zzso at low zzso The zzso zzso are targets for many zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is an early zzso the zzso zzso the development of many zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are observed in more human tumors and at a higher frequency than any other zzso and zzso of the zzso may occur at various stages of the zzso zzso Numerous zzso other than the zzso genes have been shown to be activated in human tumors and to a lesser extent in zzso zzso zzso that induce zzso expression of zzso are gene amplification and zzso zzso or gene zzso zzso of zzso and possibly gene zzso during the absence of gene amplification occur in the development of many human zzso For a specific tumor type, amplification of any one zzso may occur at a low frequency, but the frequency of tumors in which at least one zzso is amplified can be much zzso zzso amplification is usually associated with late stages of tumor zzso however, amplified zzso has been observed in early clinical stages of zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso has been detected at a high frequency in several zzso zzso zzso genes have been detected by DNA zzso zzso in both human and zzso zzso For example, zzso and zzso genes were found to be activated by gene zzso in human zzso zzso zzso Several potentially new types of zzso have also been detected by DNA zzso zzso The zzso of the genetic zzso observed in most human tumors is unclear at zzso Examples of zzso gene zzso and those documented for zzso in the zzso gene demonstrate that zzso conditions can induce zzso zzso of normal zzso The genetic zzso observed in most human tumors are probably generated by both spontaneous events and zzso zzso
