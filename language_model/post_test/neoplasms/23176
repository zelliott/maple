Chemical investigation of the seeds of zzso zzso has led to the isolation of a new zzso zzso zzso two new zzso zzso 3) of 1, and a new zzso zzso zzso together with a known compound, zzso zzso zzso The structures of zzso were determined by zzso and zzso zzso analysis and the results of zzso zzso The isolated compounds zzso were examined for their zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, as well as zzso zzso and zzso normal cell zzso zzso 2, 4, and 5 were found to display selective zzso toward zzso tumor cell zzso Although the zzso observations of zzso and zzso cell deaths by 2, 4, and 5 revealed changes characteristic of zzso neither DNA degradation nor zzso of zzso was zzso Our findings demonstrated that 2, 4, and 5 may trigger zzso zzso cell death in zzso and zzso zzso
