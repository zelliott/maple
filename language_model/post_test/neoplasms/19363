zzso zzso called zzso is one of the most important literature databases for the biological and medical sciences, but it is impossible to read all related records due to the sheer size of the zzso We usually have to repeatedly enter zzso in a zzso manner to extract useful zzso Software which can reduce such a zzso task is therefore zzso 

We developed a zzso software, the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso large number of zzso zzso extracts and displays the zzso sentences of gene names and other zzso and some information from zzso zzso The result links to whole abstracts and other resources such as the Online zzso zzso in Men and zzso zzso While zzso zzso at the zzso when evaluating the existence of zzso the popular zzso operates at the zzso zzso the relationship between the two zzso a gene name and a common word, is more accurately captured by zzso than zzso In addition, zzso shows the list of zzso and considers the zzso and variations on gene zzso Through these functions, zzso would reduce the task of searching through records for gene zzso 

We developed zzso in order to extract useful records efficiently from zzso This system has four advantages over a simple zzso zzso the reduction in the amount of collected zzso the showing of zzso lists, the consideration for zzso and variations on gene names, and the links to external zzso We believe zzso is helpful in collecting necessary zzso efficiently in order to find research zzso zzso is freely available under the zzso zzso as additional files to this zzso
