The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso fast zzso shot zzso sequence during zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine zzso zzso size of zzso zzso zzso The zzso was performed on pig liver samples at various power settings and zzso For MR monitoring during and after zzso a zzso zzso zzso sequence was zzso zzso seen by zzso during and after zzso were correlated with zzso zzso zzso zzso a core zone of complete tissue zzso close to the tip of the zzso could be differentiated from an adjacent transitional zone showing incomplete zzso zzso resonance imaging right at the end of zzso zzso with maximum heating zzso zzso overestimated the core zone but accurately described the transitional zzso zzso resonance imaging after cooling of the tissue zzso showing structural as opposed to zzso zzso exactly depicted the core zone of complete tissue zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence strongly zzso the zzso zzso size during zzso however, structural changes of the tissue seen after cooling accurately define zzso size in zzso For clinical purposes the zzso geometry seen during MR monitoring should therefore well extend the tumor zzso
