The zzso power, for total, zzso cancer and respiratory zzso of selected zzso zzso and mineral zzso zzso measured at zzso was studied in the British National Diet and Nutrition zzso zzso zzso of people aged 65 years and zzso zzso status and its primary and underlying causes were recorded for zzso zzso age zzso zzso zzso years and zzso % zzso participants, from the baseline survey in zzso until September zzso During this zzso 74 % of the male and 62 % of the female participants zzso Total mortality was significantly predicted by baseline plasma zzso zzso zzso of vitamin C zzso ratio zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso Total mortality was also significantly predicted by baseline dietary zzso zzso zzso of food energy zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso vitamin C zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 95 % zzso zzso zzso zzso patterns and significance for primary zzso cancer and respiratory mortality differed in certain respects, but not zzso Model adjustment for known disease or mortality risk zzso resulted in loss of significance for some of the zzso however, plasma zzso and zzso and food energy remained significant zzso We conclude that total and primary zzso cancer and respiratory mortality in older British people of both sexes is predicted by several zzso zzso of zzso zzso some of which may reflect the zzso zzso status at zzso whereas others may reflect the zzso of their zzso
