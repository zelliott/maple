It has long been known that zzso of zzso through zzso zzso cycles may cause zzso of zzso and genetic traits within a cell zzso Because zzso zzso is often found in zzso zzso we investigated the occurrence of zzso events in human solid zzso Evidence of frequent zzso events was found in zzso that showed unspecific zzso zzso including ring zzso zzso zzso and zzso associations, as well as extensive zzso zzso in the pattern of structural changes but not in tumors with zzso aberrations and low zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso participating in zzso bridge formation were involved in a significantly higher number of structural aberrations than other zzso zzso with zzso events showed a decreased elimination rate of unstable zzso aberrations after zzso compared with normal cells and other tumor zzso This result suggests that a combination of zzso unstable zzso and an elevated tolerance to zzso damage leads to constant zzso reorganization in many zzso thereby providing a flexible genetic system for zzso evolution and zzso
