Various zzso processes are driven by zzso zzso especially involving zzso at branch ends of cellular zzso These emerging insights fuel the interest to design potent zzso to block zzso As a step toward this aim, we prepared a series of ten zzso to zzso zzso with zzso as a common zzso To obtain activated zzso for ensuing zzso formation, conditions for the facile synthesis of pure zzso from zzso unprotected zzso were zzso To probe for the often encountered zzso diversity of human zzso we selected representative members from the three zzso of zzso zzso as zzso Diversity of the zzso display was accounted for by using four zzso with different degrees of zzso branching as zzso in zzso zzso Cases of increased zzso potency of zzso clusters compared to free zzso were zzso zzso of relative zzso was not directly associated with zzso in the zzso and depended on the zzso zzso Of note for screening zzso efficacy of blocking appeared to decrease with increased degree of zzso branching in zzso zzso zzso to tumor cells was impaired with selectivity for zzso and zzso Representative compounds did not impair growth of zzso cells up to a concentration of 5 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso The reported zzso and the zzso of its zzso by structural parameters of zzso and zzso set zzso examples for the further design of selective zzso and zzso zzso
