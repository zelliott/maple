The effect of electric zzso on zzso blood flow was investigated in the zzso zzso zzso After the application of short intense electric zzso relative zzso zzso was measured using an zzso extraction zzso A significant reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was observed within 1 h following the application of eight electric zzso to the zzso zzso zzso blood flow slowly recovered, almost reaching the zzso level by 24 zzso No change in zzso was induced in the zzso zzso normal leg zzso A similar pattern of blood flow reduction was induced when a second set of electric zzso was applied to the zzso following a 24 h zzso The degree of zzso blood flow reduction was dependent upon the number of electric zzso applied, at zzso zzso and less effect was observed if less than eight zzso were zzso A modification of the zzso of the electric zzso resulted in changes in the direction of zzso blood flow zzso zzso blood flow increased following zzso in the range between 80 and zzso V and decreased at zzso higher than 640 zzso These results demonstrate that the local application of electric zzso to solid zzso can modify zzso blood zzso zzso of increased zzso resulted in the progressive reduction of zzso blood flow with a corresponding increase in zzso zzso as measured by growth zzso zzso blood flow reduction by electric zzso could have potential in exploiting zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso
