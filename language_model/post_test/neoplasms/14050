The frequency and distribution of rare and common zzso fragile sites in zzso derived from peripheral zzso were compared in 26 patients with zzso solid zzso and 24 normal zzso In order to avoid bias in zzso the identity of each individual as patient or control was disclosed only after the study was zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso fragile sites were found in five patients zzso zzso zzso zzso and two controls zzso Common fragile sites were present in 21 of 26 patients and in 19 of 24 zzso These differences are statistically not significant in the Fisher zzso We conclude that the expression of fragile sites does not indicate a predisposition for solid zzso
