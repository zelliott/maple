Solid tumors may zzso factors that mediate immune suppression in zzso We investigated the effect of zzso from 25 human tumor cell lines on zzso from healthy zzso A profound zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity was seen when zzso were cultured in concentrated tumor zzso from 6 cell lines zzso into high zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso effects were reversed when the tumor zzso was zzso Cell cycle studies of inhibited zzso showed most of them were growth arrested in the zzso phase similar to zzso zzso In addition, these zzso did not express zzso and expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso resembled that of resting zzso zzso gel zzso of the tumor zzso and western zzso analysis demonstrated the presence of soluble zzso in the zzso tumor zzso but not in control zzso Most importantly, depletion of soluble zzso by zzso from the tumor zzso neutralized the zzso effects on zzso zzso our results show that zzso shed by cultured zzso tumor cells mediates zzso of zzso proliferation and function by inducing cell growth zzso
