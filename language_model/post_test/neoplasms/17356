zzso are pivotal in cancer biology and are putative candidates for cancer zzso The investigation of zzso has been hampered by the lack of zzso suitable for zzso and zzso zzso tissue zzso Here, we validated zzso rabbit zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (against zzso and zzso (against zzso in zzso zzso was performed on sections of matching zzso zzso zzso and zzso tissue from 19 zzso 20 zzso 17 breast, and 9 zzso zzso Sections were stained with zzso and zzso and compared with the zzso of the zzso The degree of zzso was assigned for zzso patterns and zzso zzso between zzso and zzso ranged from weak, for zzso zzso to nearly complete for zzso zzso We confirmed that zzso zzso and zzso bound very zzso in zzso tissue and no zzso was zzso By contrast, zzso zzso and zzso generally showed a high degree of agreement in zzso patterns of zzso and zzso zzso In zzso the zzso had overlapping zzso patterns that were generally more intense for zzso when compared with zzso zzso This study suggests that zzso and zzso zzso closely matches the zzso of standard zzso and also does so in archival zzso zzso
