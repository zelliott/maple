The regulation of zzso cell death, a terminal and fatal cell fate decision, has been intensely investigated and, due to its paramount implications for human health and disease, has sparked one of the most prolific and competitive research fields in biological and biomedical sciences of the past zzso Many key components of the molecular machinery processing and zzso zzso cell death signals have been described in great detail by now, dramatically advancing our understanding of how the network of zzso signaling proteins zzso and regulates cell death signals, and ultimately zzso zzso Building on the latest significant advances in deciphering zzso signal zzso as well as on the central original groundbreaking discoveries in cell death research, we here present an in-depth description of the current knowledge on the core molecular machinery of zzso signaling and how it is implicated in human physiology and zzso
