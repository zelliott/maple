With the aim to identify zzso zzso peptides with high affinity for zzso we used three in zzso prediction zzso to screen the protein sequence for possible zzso zzso One zzso scored highest in all three zzso and the high zzso affinity of this zzso was verified in an zzso stabilization zzso By stimulation with zzso zzso cells a zzso clone was established, which was able to kill two breast cancer cell lines in an zzso and zzso manner, demonstrating presentation of the zzso on the surface of cancer zzso Furthermore, blood from cancer patients and healthy donors was screened for spontaneous zzso zzso against the zzso in zzso zzso zzso Patients with breast cancer, zzso melanoma, or zzso cell zzso hosted powerful and zzso zzso responses against the zzso In addition, when blood from healthy donors was tested, similar responses were zzso Ultimately, serum from cancer patients and healthy donors was analyzed for zzso B1 zzso zzso responses against zzso B1 were frequently detected in both cancer patients and healthy zzso In conclusion, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified, which was presented on the cell surface of cancer cells, and zzso spontaneous zzso responses in cancer patients and healthy zzso
