We have investigated factors that affect the efficiency of single zzso zzso before transplant and define groups of patients that may require more than one collection for zzso zzso A consecutive series of 56 patients with zzso zzso and solid zzso had peripheral blood stem cells zzso collected following zzso with zzso factors zzso alone or after conventional chemotherapy zzso or high-dose zzso zzso followed by zzso The efficiency of zzso was assessed by total zzso cell number zzso in the harvest, zzso cells and zzso units zzso Linear zzso analysis was performed to determine factors that affect zzso yield as assessed by the above zzso Thirty-five patients were mobilized once, 13 patients twice, six patients required three, one required four and one required five zzso zzso zzso and collection by zzso occurred in patients with extended previous zzso zzso and patients older than 50 zzso The number of zzso cycles given in the past also had an adverse effect on zzso zzso In contrast, disease status, bone zzso zzso by zzso cells, type of zzso time since last zzso and zzso regimen used were not significantly related to the collection efficiency by zzso Age, extent of previous zzso and amount of zzso given prior to zzso define the patients who require more than one zzso course for support regardless of the underlying disease, zzso status or zzso regimen zzso In such patients a plan for multiple zzso should be scheduled in zzso
