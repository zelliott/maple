For 23 patients, an zzso zzso zzso zzso scan and a zzso zzso scan after zzso zzso was performed at the Massachusetts General Hospital to assess in zzso treatment zzso A well-balanced population of patients was investigated to assess the effect of the tumor location on the accuracy of the zzso 

Range zzso was achieved by comparing the measured zzso zzso zzso activity zzso with the corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso differences in the zzso end of the activity zzso were analyzed as potential indicators for the range differences between the actual delivered and planned zzso 

The average spatial agreement between the measured and simulated activity distribution was within zzso zzso and the corresponding average absolute agreement was within zzso zzso from gamma index zzso The mean absolute range zzso at 93 randomly chosen positions in 17 treatment fields delivered to 11 patients was zzso zzso zzso differences in the agreement of the measured and simulated activity distribution for the different zzso sites were zzso This resulted from the different effect of factors such as zzso zzso effects, motion, or limitations in the zzso zzso activity zzso 

We found that zzso and cervical spine patients can greatly benefit from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso range zzso However, for the successful application of the method to patients with zzso tumors, major technological and zzso improvements are zzso Among the zzso and cervical spine target sites, patients with zzso zzso or metal implants represent groups that could especially benefit from the zzso
