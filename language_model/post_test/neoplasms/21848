There is increasing evidence that zzso zzso presentation either zzso or zzso plays a crucial if not essential role in the generation of regulatory T cells zzso Thus, it is possible to induce zzso of any desired specificity in zzso The same goal can be achieved in zzso by expanding zzso zzso T cells and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, in zzso expansion of zzso is limited to zzso that have resulted in zzso generation in zzso zzso zzso can be used in cellular therapy with the goal to prevent zzso disease or even to interfere with established zzso The latter requires that the zzso can suppress zzso cells that have already caused harm, which is possible because of the zzso zzso properties of zzso zzso these cells can accumulate in zzso zzso zzso and exit into inflamed zzso Generally, the in zzso interference is dependent on zzso such as transforming growth zzso and zzso that were zzso in in zzso analysis of zzso The precise mechanisms of suppression remain enigmatic, however, but may be further zzso by the molecular analysis of suppressed versus zzso T zzso
