zzso capable of transforming cells and causing tumors in humans and animals, has been previously shown by us to mediate zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso tail by 8 zzso acids in both zzso and cell culture zzso Since zzso zzso is involved in maintaining zzso structure, such zzso might alter this structure and affect gene zzso To test the latter possibility, we zzso cultured zzso zzso human embryonic kidney cells with plasmids expressing either wild type zzso or truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso which were either zzso or zzso zzso with fluorescent zzso Each zzso zzso was found to be incorporated into zzso at 24 and 48 zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso plasmids were tested for gene expression by zzso and real-time zzso zzso of the results for over zzso genes using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso methods revealed significant differences in expression of numerous genes between the zzso and zzso zzso Many of the zzso expressed zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso zzso The results thus demonstrate the potential of zzso to contribute to the process of zzso through zzso zzso
