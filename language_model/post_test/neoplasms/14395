zzso zzso zzso is highly prevalent in multiple human zzso Despite significant efforts to directly target Ras activity, no zzso zzso have been developed and taken into the zzso Since Ras proteins must be anchored to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane zzso for full biological activity, we devised a zzso screen to identify molecules with ability to zzso zzso from the zzso Here we zzso the zzso and biology of three classes of compound identified by this screening method that inhibit zzso PM zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso All three classes of compound significantly abrogate cell proliferation and Ras signaling in zzso cancer zzso Taken together, these studies provide an important proof of concept that blocking PM zzso of zzso is a zzso therapeutic zzso
