An increased rate of zzso synthesis in zzso zzso has long been zzso as an important aspect of the zzso metabolism of transformed zzso However, the contribution of lipids to cellular zzso zzso development and zzso zzso as well as their potential role in zzso the spread of zzso cells to secondary sites, are not yet fully zzso In this article, we review the recent findings that support the importance of zzso synthesis and metabolism in zzso Specifically, we explore the role of zzso zzso zzso in cancer cell migration and invasion, and in the induction of zzso zzso These processes are crucial for the dissemination of zzso cells and formation of zzso which constitute the main cause of cancer zzso
