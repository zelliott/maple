To test its diagnostic potential and sensitivity in zzso zzso serum zzso was measured at diagnosis in 191 children with solid zzso and 25 with acute zzso In stages I + II, III + IV and zzso zzso median levels were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso patients, median values for stages I, II, III and IV disease were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso High levels of zzso were also found in patients with other types of zzso Children in clinical zzso after treatment for zzso invariably had normal zzso levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso even though the majority had zzso identifiable residual zzso The values rose when zzso was zzso or clinically zzso We conclude zzso that, though levels of greater than 100 zzso zzso are highly suggestive of advanced zzso caution should be exercised in using serum zzso as a diagnostic test in children with cancer and zzso that serum zzso levels are not a sensitive index of residual zzso in patients, with initially elevated levels, that are receiving zzso
