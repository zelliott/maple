zzso acid zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that is widely distributed throughout the plant zzso A variety of biological activities have been ascribed to zzso acid including zzso and in zzso zzso zzso However, zzso acid is most highly regarded for its zzso activity and specific zzso against a variety of tumor cell zzso Interest in developing even more potent zzso agents based on zzso acid has led to the discovery of a host of highly active derivatives exhibiting greater zzso and better therapeutic zzso than some current clinical zzso zzso While its mechanism of action has not been fully determined, it has been shown that some zzso acid zzso disrupt viral fusion to the cell in a zzso step through interaction with the viral zzso zzso whereas others disrupt assembly and budding of the zzso zzso With regard to its zzso properties, zzso acid was previously reported to exhibit selective zzso against several zzso cell zzso However, more recent work has demonstrated that zzso acid is zzso against other zzso zzso and zzso brain zzso human tumor zzso zzso acid appears to function by means of inducing zzso in cells irrespective of their zzso zzso Because of its selective zzso against tumor cells and favorable therapeutic index, even at doses up to 500 zzso body weight, zzso acid is a very promising new zzso agent for the treatment of zzso infection and zzso
