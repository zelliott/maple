zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso that are essentially involved in turnover of the zzso zzso zzso The aim was to investigate the diagnostic value of zzso and zzso as tumor markers in zzso zzso zzso and evaluate the value of combining zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso as diagnostic aids for zzso zzso 

A total of 179 patients with zzso zzso zzso and 92 zzso were included in this zzso The levels of zzso and zzso were measured using zzso 

zzso for zzso and zzso were significantly higher in zzso zzso than those in benign zzso zzso Among all variables zzso zzso zzso found that zzso and zzso were significantly correlated with the presence of zzso disease zzso Analysis of receiver operating characteristics zzso zzso showed that the area under the curve of zzso zzso was significantly larger than that of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso With parallel zzso the combination of zzso and zzso achieved the higher sensitivity of zzso The combination of zzso and zzso in serial interpretation was able to boost the specificity to zzso The combination of zzso zzso and zzso produced better sensitivity, zzso zzso and zzso than zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso in zzso may represent helpful zzso to conventional diagnostic tools in ruling out zzso as a probable diagnosis, thus guiding the selection of patients who might benefit from further invasive zzso
