There are several characteristics of zzso that suggest that expression of this zzso may play an important role in tumor invasion and zzso the zzso gene is expressed in response to stimulation by zzso and tumor zzso and the protein product of this gene is a zzso capable of degrading multiple components of the zzso zzso Experimental evidence to support this hypothesis has been derived from several animal model systems, in which a positive correlation has been observed between zzso expression and tumor progression and zzso In addition, in zzso experiments in which the levels of zzso the tissue inhibitor of zzso were altered also strongly suggest a zzso role for zzso in tumor zzso The expression of active zzso in tumor cells requires the fulfillment of several criteria, and this zzso process is reminiscent of the molecular events that are currently understood to contribute to tumor progression and zzso zzso of zzso zzso requires both a zzso a step which may zzso to the zzso of an zzso in zzso zzso as well as the lifting of zzso repression, which may zzso to the loss of tumor zzso zzso Both positive and negative zzso of zzso zzso appear to zzso pathways that involve the zzso zzso and/or zzso The expression of active zzso zzso also requires conversion of the zzso to an active form, and a proper balance between the expression of zzso and the levels of active zzso The multiple levels of zzso regulation support the concept of zzso zzso and may provide a tool for further understanding of the molecular nature of the events that lead to tumor zzso invasion, and zzso
