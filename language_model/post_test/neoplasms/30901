zzso data arising from a decade of zzso are summarized along with techniques zzso to arrive at the reported dose zzso zzso of the zzso methodology allows it to serve as a vehicle for the calculation of solid tumor zzso although several limitations zzso zzso zzso of solid tumors will ultimately zzso determination of absorbed zzso for the individual zzso Several approaches currently under investigation are zzso For reasons of zzso solid tumor zzso estimates continue to use the assumption of homogeneous activity distribution in a source organ, accounting for either all radiation or only zzso zzso As zzso tools become available for incorporating zzso cellular level data, the currently used zzso zzso as an index of tumor zzso will likely be replaced with a statistical distribution based on the number of viable cells in the tumor zzso Estimates of a tumor control dose would be based upon a linear extension of dose coupled with a threshold dose for cell zzso
