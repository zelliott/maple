A general growth model derived from basic cellular properties can be used to describe the dynamic process of cancer growth with mathematical zzso It has been recognized that cancer growth is under genetic control, with a multitude of interacting genes each segregating in a zzso fashion and displaying environmental zzso In this article, we integrate the mathematical aspects of the pervasive growth model into a statistical framework for the identification of quantitative trait zzso that zzso cancer zzso This zzso framework is constructed with a single zzso zzso zzso blocking zzso zzso studies have been performed to demonstrate the usefulness of the zzso The proposed model provides a generic platform model for testing and detecting specific DNA sequence zzso that regulates the timing of cancer zzso growth and zzso
