The zzso of zzso activity in actively dividing cells leads to zzso of their zzso and suppression of cell growth when the zzso lengths become smaller than a certain threshold value (typically about 1-2 zzso of zzso We evaluated the time zzso zzso required to reach the threshold zzso DNA size after initiation of treatment, which is of critical importance for the efficacy of zzso zzso A model based on the solution of a system of differential equations was developed to analyze the efficacy delay and dynamics of tumor zzso The efficacy delay was strongly dependent on the size distribution of zzso lengths at the treatment zzso An increase in the zzso of zzso size resulted in zzso of the zzso However, the long-term dynamics of tumors with homogeneous populations of zzso were more significantly affected by zzso zzso compared to tumors with zzso size distribution of zzso zzso distribution of zzso and tumor doubling times are of critical importance for the dynamics of tumor growth in presence of zzso zzso
