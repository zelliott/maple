The purpose of our study was to review and determine the cardiovascular safety profile of zzso A4 zzso zzso in a Phase I study in 25 patients with advanced solid zzso 

zzso was administered in a zzso fashion starting at 18 zzso zzso every 21 days, and the zzso dosage was 90 zzso Continuous evaluation included bedside blood pressure and pulse monitoring, zzso zzso zzso at fixed time points for measured zzso zzso determination, determination of the corrected zzso zzso zzso using zzso formula zzso zzso zzso zzso and chart zzso zzso correlations of zzso dose, zzso area under the curve, and zzso versus heart rate zzso blood pressure, zzso and zzso zzso over the first 4 h zzso were zzso 

After zzso administration, there were significant increases in zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso time points zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the 3- and zzso time points zzso beats per minute zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Three of 25 patients had prolonged zzso intervals at zzso whereas 15 zzso of 25 and 18 zzso of 24 patients had prolonged zzso intervals at 3 and 4 zzso The slope of zzso and zzso increasing as a function of time during the first 4 h was correlated to dose (in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso for HR, P zzso zzso and r zzso zzso for zzso and to zzso area under the curve zzso zzso zzso and r zzso zzso for HR, P zzso zzso and r zzso zzso for zzso blood pressure and zzso zzso zzso zzso correlations were not zzso Two patients had zzso changes consistent with an acute coronary syndrome within 24 h of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso the zzso zzso There was a zzso relationship with the zzso infusion and with zzso changes consistent with an acute coronary syndrome in two zzso It is zzso that future trials with zzso have eligibility guidelines limiting patients with known coronary artery disease or those with multiple coronary artery disease risk factors until more experience is gained regarding potential cardiovascular toxicity with this zzso
