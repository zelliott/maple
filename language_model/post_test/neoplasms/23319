Several studies have shown that zzso actively regulate alternative zzso zzso zzso mechanisms in cancer lead to zzso transcripts different from the pool of transcripts occurring only in healthy zzso At the same time, altered presentation of zzso class I zzso is frequently observed in various types of zzso zzso of genes related to zzso class I zzso processing has been observed in several cancer types, leading to fewer zzso class I zzso on the cell zzso Here, we use a zzso wide analysis of predicted alternative zzso forms, based on a publicly available database, to show that peptides zzso in cancer zzso zzso comprise significantly fewer predicted zzso class I zzso compared to peptides from normal zzso zzso zzso in cancer transcripts are in the case of the three most common zzso class I zzso representatives consistently found to contain fewer predicted zzso compared to normal zzso We observed a significant difference in zzso acid composition between protein sequences associated with normal versus cancer zzso as transcripts found in cancer are enriched with zzso zzso zzso This variation contributes to the observed significant lower likelihood of zzso peptides to be predicted zzso compared to peptides found in normal zzso
