zzso colony stimulating factors zzso decrease the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in cancer patients receiving zzso zzso There are two zzso zzso and zzso that differ in dosing schedules from which zzso may zzso 

This study aimed to compare the effectiveness of zzso zzso and zzso on the risk of zzso The secondary objective was to compare the effectiveness of the timing of initiation zzso versus zzso 

A retrospective study of administrative claims from US commercial zzso included adult patients with zzso lymphoma, breast, or lung cancer, treated with chemotherapy between July 2004 and January zzso For these patients, the first course of chemotherapy and each unique cycle with use of zzso was identified and designated zzso if used within the first 5 days of each cycle, or zzso if after day zzso The risk of zzso and zzso hospitalization was evaluated for the zzso and zzso prophylaxis zzso and for the prophylaxis and delayed zzso initiation zzso 

Among zzso zzso identified, zzso and zzso used zzso and zzso zzso The rate of zzso hospitalization was zzso for zzso prophylaxis and zzso for zzso prophylaxis zzso Compared to chemotherapy cycles with zzso zzso those with zzso prophylaxis had decreased risk of zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso hospitalization zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso hospitalization rate was zzso for zzso zzso initiation and zzso for delayed zzso initiation zzso zzso cycles with zzso initiation of either zzso had decreased risk of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso hospitalization zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with delayed initiation of zzso 

zzso prescribed as prophylaxis resulted in lower risk of zzso and zzso zzso compared to zzso zzso This reduction was similar for zzso zzso initiation when compared to delayed zzso zzso
