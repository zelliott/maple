It was originally proposed that zzso zzso genes zzso act in a zzso zzso Instead, numerous zzso including zzso and zzso exhibit zzso as a consequence of the zzso of zzso zzso Due to the challenges of identifying zzso zzso by human zzso analysis alone, mouse models play a pivotal role in firmly establishing the zzso of a zzso as in the recent identification of zzso as a zzso lung zzso In many cases, zzso exhibit conditional or compound zzso in which loss of one zzso zzso is functionally important only in certain settings or after compound loss of other zzso The zzso deletion syndrome zzso ) is a paradigm of compound zzso and demonstrates the importance of zzso interactions to elicit specific zzso These concepts must be integrated into basic science studies to avoid delay in the identification of important zzso In the clinical zzso the challenges for molecular zzso are the development of quantitative measures that can accurately and systematically ascertain the status of zzso genes in zzso zzso and the use of this information to accurately predict prognosis and response to zzso
