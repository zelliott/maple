In conjunction with the European cohort study among asphalt workers coordinated by the International Agency for Research on Cancer zzso we studied the mortality of zzso French men who were followed for 17 years for a total of zzso zzso This group contained zzso subjects who had ever been employed as asphalt zzso they contributed zzso zzso of zzso A reference group was composed of zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso who had been employed only in building or ground zzso 

zzso ratios standardized for age and period were zzso with their zzso confidence intervals zzso from the age and period mortality rates of all French men for the years covered by the study zzso We also compared the mortality of exposed workers and the reference group with zzso zzso models after adjustment for age, calendar period, and either duration of employment or length of zzso 

zzso from lung cancer was equivalent to the expected rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but was zzso greater than among the zzso reference group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We also found an excess of gastrointestinal zzso especially of the esophagus zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and stomach zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the internal reference group confirmed these findings, especially for stomach cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

Although our results are not statistically zzso they suggest that zzso workers may have a slightly higher rate of lung cancer and a moderately higher rate of stomach cancer than their zzso zzso The excess of lung cancer may be due to potential zzso factors, including the occupational risk factor of coal zzso exposure and the lifestyle risk factor of zzso A zzso zzso study is under way that will make it possible to control for smoking and other potential zzso zzso this is necessary before any definitive conclusions can be zzso
