On the basis of zzso studies that show zzso of class III zzso is associated with resistance to zzso agents, several investigators have addressed the relation between class III zzso and outcome in patients treated with such zzso High expression of class III zzso has been found to be correlated either with low response rates in patients treated with regimens containing zzso or zzso or with reduced survival in patients with zzso lung cancer, in breast, zzso and gastric zzso and in zzso of unknown primary zzso Two studies have shown patients with advanced zzso lung cancer receiving zzso whose zzso expressed high levels of class III zzso had a lower response to zzso and shorter survival, whereas this variable was not found to be zzso in patients receiving regimens without zzso zzso zzso analysis of samples from patients in the zzso trial, which compared zzso chemotherapy to no further therapy in zzso zzso lung cancer, showed that chemotherapy seemed to overcome the negative zzso effect of high levels of expression of class III zzso and the greatest benefit from zzso was seen in patients with high levels of expression of class III zzso Further analyses in zzso and advanced zzso lung cancer showed a relation between high expression of class III zzso and baseline factors such as age under 60 years, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and advanced stage of zzso These results suggest that class III zzso could be both a zzso and a zzso zzso Large zzso studies are warranted to determine the zzso or zzso value of class III zzso in different settings and zzso
