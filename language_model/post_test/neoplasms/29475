The zzso process, through the addition of zzso is a major zzso modification of proteins and zzso zzso may be zzso in either the zzso zzso leading to zzso or zzso zzso or as zzso zzso that targets only single proteins involving a single zzso zzso In both cases, the key precursors are the zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso In this work, we propose MRS for the detection of zzso zzso visible in high-resolution MR zzso of intact cells from different human zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso sugar zzso including zzso signals observed for the first time in whole cells, are zzso also taking advantage of spectral changes that follow cell treatment with ammonium zzso Finally, parallel changes in zzso zzso and zzso pools, observed after pH changes induced by ammonium zzso in the different zzso cell lines, may provide more details on the zzso zzso
