A zzso zzso liquid zzso method is described for the determination of free and zzso zzso acids in serum and zzso Free and zzso zzso acids are extracted from serum or zzso using a zzso zzso zzso and then zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso Free and zzso zzso acids are labeled with zzso in zzso using zzso as zzso zzso zzso acids are zzso by zzso zzso and then zzso by the same zzso zzso zzso acids are separated zzso on a zzso column zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso : 50 : 40) and zzso zzso : 50 : zzso as mobile zzso The zzso is monitored by a zzso at 370 zzso zzso and 440 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the amounts of free and zzso zzso acids were obtained between 50 zzso and 200 zzso for free zzso acids and between 25 zzso and 100 zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from serum and zzso samples are not less than zzso This method is sensitive, reliable and useful for the simultaneous determination of free and zzso zzso acids in serum and zzso
