zzso factors are present in several zzso vegetables and commonly used spices and zzso They can be divided into several different groups, based on their chemical structure, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso trace metals, zzso zzso and degradation products of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso Among each of these groups of compounds are zzso which may exert their zzso action by more than one zzso zzso The zzso processes of zzso are still not known in detail and probably varies with the cancer disease in zzso zzso the description of the zzso backgrounds for the actions of zzso factors must be based on a simplified model of the process of zzso The model used in this presentation is a zzso zzso model, in which initiators are thought to be directly or indirectly zzso promoters are zzso as substances capable of zzso a growth advantage on initiated cells and zzso are believed to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso Experimental evidence for the mechanisms of action of zzso agents in fruits and vegetables that protect against initiation include the scavenging effects of zzso on activated zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso oxygen and zzso by zzso the zzso effects of many compounds including zzso acid and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso by some zzso and zzso the induction of zzso and of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso the shielding of sensitive structures by some zzso and the stimulation of zzso exerted by zzso zzso zzso at the zzso level in zzso include the zzso effects of zzso and the membrane stabilizing effects reported with zzso the zzso of zzso caused by compounds from zzso the stimulation of immune responses seen with zzso and zzso acid and the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso and zzso A few zzso of conversion have been identified zzso and it can be argued on a theoretical basis, that many zzso of initiation should also be efficient against zzso The mechanisms of zzso substances in fruits and vegetables are discussed in the light of cancer prevention and zzso
