zzso protein zzso zzso zzso play a central role in zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling during cell zzso The fourth and least studied zzso zzso zzso pathway, big zzso zzso 1 zzso also known as zzso signal regulated zzso 5 zzso is activated in response to growth factors and zzso zzso of this signaling zzso has been implicated not only in zzso functions such as cell survival, proliferation and differentiation but also in pathological processes such as zzso cardiac zzso and zzso In recent years a series of zzso mice lacking components within the zzso cascade have been generated, which have enabled us to investigate the role of the zzso zzso within different zzso zzso of these knockout mice have led to major discoveries in the role of zzso signaling in zzso and in cardiac zzso Moreover, studies using conditional zzso knockout mice, which circumvent the early embryonic zzso of zzso zzso have unveiled the importance of zzso in zzso survival and maintenance of vascular integrity during zzso Here we zzso current understanding of the function of zzso as well as include new data generated from a series of zzso zzso knockout mice in an attempt to dissect the role of the zzso zzso in various cell types in zzso
