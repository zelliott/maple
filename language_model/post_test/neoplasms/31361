zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso systems that exhibit zzso zzso The rate at which this zzso occurs is determined by the exchange rate of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso This exchange rate is controlled, in turn, by the zzso chain composition of the zzso We describe in zzso and in zzso studies using zzso as delivery vehicles for the zzso drug zzso We demonstrate that the zzso zzso composition determined the rate at which zzso are eliminated from plasma after intravenous administration, and the rate of zzso leakage from zzso The nature of the zzso component also determined the zzso efficacy of zzso zzso in zzso and human in zzso and human zzso tumor zzso Increased circulation time and improved activity were obtained for zzso containing zzso with an zzso zzso chain zzso as a result of slower zzso zzso
