We formulate a theoretical model to analyze the vascular zzso process of an zzso vessel network during solid zzso zzso The model incorporates a zzso organized initial zzso zzso zzso veins and zzso and involves zzso zzso vessel zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso cell proliferation and zzso The emerging zzso zzso is zzso zzso into zzso zones and zzso efficiently an injected zzso It displays a complex geometry with zzso zones and zzso zzso of increased vascular density and blood flow of varying zzso The corresponding cluster size distribution is zzso reminiscent of a zzso critical zzso The zzso zzso fluctuations correlate with pressure drops in the initial zzso suggesting a physical mechanism underlying hot spot zzso
