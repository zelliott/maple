To briefly review scientific rationale of zzso zzso radiation therapy zzso and discuss the zzso opportunities, and challenges in the zzso of zzso Some of these ideas were discussed during a workshop on zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in April 1994 at Bethesda, MD, and others have been discussed elsewhere in the zzso 

zzso control of cancer is an important component in the overall treatment strategy in any patient with zzso It has been shown that failure to achieve zzso control can lead to zzso an increase in chances of distant zzso and zzso a decrease in the zzso In many disease sites, the doses delivered currently are inadequate to achieve satisfactory local tumor control zzso this is because in many sites, only limited doses of zzso can be delivered due to the proximity of cancer to zzso normal zzso By zzso the zzso beams to the zzso doses to the tumors can be enhanced and doses to the normal zzso can be zzso With the advances in zzso such zzso is possible now and is the rationale for using zzso However, a number of questions do remain that are not limited to the zzso zzso What are the implications in terms of target volume definitions when implementing zzso zzso Are there some sites where research efforts can be focused to document the efficacy and cost effectiveness of zzso zzso How do we implement day-to-day zzso treatment zzso zzso How do we transfer the technology from the university centers to the community without compromising zzso zzso What are all the quality zzso improvement questions that need to be addressed and how do we ascertain quality assurance of zzso zzso Have we looked at cost-benefit ratios and quality of life zzso issues zzso 

There is a need for defining multiple target zzso gross tumor volume, clinical target zzso and planning target zzso Such definitions should make zzso of zzso more complex, yet will make high-dose delivery a zzso There are many sites in which single and zzso studies are ongoing that include zzso zzso head and neck, and zzso In other areas, cooperative group trials are required because of the inability of single institutions to zzso enough patients to answer clinically relevant questions with statistical zzso Although zzso of zzso will require multiple steps, these multiple steps can be brought into clinical practice gradually and one does not have to wait until all steps required for zzso of zzso are zzso In this respect, zzso should be used in a very broad sense, from zzso eye view zzso use of zzso dose distribution, use of zzso zzso in choosing alternative plans, zzso beam arrangements, intensity zzso inverse planning, to totally automated zzso of zzso To transfer the zzso capabilities to the community from the University Centers, there is a necessity to develop quality assurance zzso zzso and the zzso Oncology Group are zzso these zzso zzso zzso radiation therapy has potential not only to improve local control and decrease zzso but also to improve the cost benefit ratio in the use of zzso as well as in improving quality of life in patients with zzso 

Achieving many potential benefits of zzso zzso in local control, decreasing zzso zzso preservation, improvement in cost zzso will require further zzso and clinical research in carefully conceived and successfully completed future clinical zzso
