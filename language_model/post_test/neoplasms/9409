zzso zzso transplantation zzso of stem cells for treatment of fetal defects in some animal models of human diseases has prompted us to study the mechanisms of zzso zzso tolerance and embryonic zzso The objective of this study was to determine whether zzso transplantation of tumor cells would affect the survival and growth of the tumor cells themselves as well as fetus zzso A total of 2 zzso zzso zzso cells or zzso cells were transplanted into the zzso or abdominal cavity of zzso mice on zzso or zzso of zzso The adult and newborn zzso mice which were zzso with the same number of zzso cells and zzso cells by zzso injection were used as positive controls for the cancer bearing control group while zzso fetuses of the same gestation were used as negative controls zzso for the normal zzso zzso The development of fetuses transplanted with tumor cells in zzso was monitored by several zzso zzso and the tumor growth of them were observed by some distinctive bearing cancer zzso The zzso transplanted group was further assessed for minimal cancer bearing by detection of zzso zzso using zzso zzso and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso In addition, tumor burden and the development of the F1 generation of the mice by zzso were also zzso zzso zzso C zzso and zzso cell nuclear zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells transplanted in the zzso were analyzed under laser zzso zzso There was no significant difference in the zzso zzso between the experimental and control zzso HE zzso of the major zzso including liver, zzso and zzso showed that these zzso properly zzso No tumor zzso were found in those delivered mice after zzso transplantation with zzso cells and zzso zzso Furthermore, as minimal bearing cancer index for zzso cells, zzso expression analyzed by zzso and zzso indicated that no tumor cells were detected in the experimental zzso The F1 zzso developed normally without any signs of tumor zzso Fluorescence analysis revealed that expression of zzso and zzso was markedly reduced in the zzso cells after injection for 24, 48, and 72 zzso Our study showed that the tumor cells did not grow in the mice by zzso zzso whereas transplantation of the same number of tumor cells resulted in obvious zzso tumor in the adult and newborn zzso Furthermore, the differentiation and proliferation of zzso cells changed dramatically after zzso Our results suggest that, while the embryonic transplantation of tumor cells does not affect fetal development, the survival and growth of implanted tumor cells may be significantly inhibited in the embryonic zzso
