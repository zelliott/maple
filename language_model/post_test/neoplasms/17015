The zzso of pathways regulating cellular function is a frequent hallmark of cancer and the development of specific zzso zzso that alter tumor growth and progression are the focus of multiple recent zzso zzso zzso zzso are a large group of diverse protein zzso that specifically target proteins for zzso and their importance to normal cellular function is illustrated in the many diseases associated with their loss of function or inappropriate zzso zzso zzso protein 2 zzso is an F box protein that plays critical roles in zzso zzso zzso zzso and acts as an zzso box zzso zzso zzso zzso recognition zzso zzso of zzso is associated with poor prognosis and zzso in many zzso and is a well validated drug zzso In a recent report, Chan et zzso have identified an zzso inhibitor that selectively zzso zzso zzso zzso activity using an integrated virtual zzso drug screening and experimental validation zzso This zzso inhibitor restricts cancer zzso and zzso sensitivity to zzso agents in multiple animal tumor zzso These findings identify a new novel small zzso that targets the zzso and reduces tumor growth by attenuating zzso zzso and inducing cellular zzso
