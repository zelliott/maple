zzso is a zzso factor that regulates zzso development, zzso and zzso zzso Given that T cells, zzso and zzso in the tumor zzso are thought to zzso tumor zzso tumor cells may acquire zzso expression through fusion with these zzso normal zzso We here revealed that a small proportion of tumor cells in human zzso specimens expressed zzso To investigate the consequences of zzso acquisition by tumor cells, we established zzso and zzso cell lines expressing a zzso active form of zzso zzso in an zzso zzso The expression of zzso promoted cancer cell invasion in association with changes in cell zzso Analysis of gene expression and zzso interference experiments revealed that zzso suppressed zzso expression by zzso the zzso zzso Snail and zzso in a manner independent of zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso also zzso zzso expression and increased invasive activity in tumor zzso in zzso Our results thus suggest that the acquisition of zzso expression contributes to tumor zzso
