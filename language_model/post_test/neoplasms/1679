Estimates of the zzso daily dose zzso of zzso resulting from use of representative zzso products containing zzso have been zzso All of the parameters that determine the amount of zzso absorbed by an individual vary from one individual to zzso Moreover, for some parameters there is uncertainty as to which is the correct or representative value from a range of zzso zzso the parameters used in the zzso of the zzso of zzso from usage of a particular product type zzso zzso makeup, zzso were represented by zzso evaluated using zzso Carlo zzso From these data, zzso of values for key zzso such as the amount of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso were defined and used to provide a distribution of zzso for each zzso zzso The estimated total zzso zzso zzso all zzso for males and females at the zzso mean, and 95th zzso of the distribution of individual zzso values were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for females and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso The ratio of the zzso to zzso dose corresponding to a target risk level of 1 zzso zzso the acceptable risk level for this investigation, derived using approaches typically used by the zzso the zzso and proposed for use by the European Union zzso were also zzso All ratios were well below 1, indicating that all the extra lifetime cancer risk from the use of zzso zzso products, in the manner assumed in this assessment, are well below acceptable zzso Even if it were assumed that an individual used all of the products together, the estimated zzso would still provide a dose that was well below the acceptable risk zzso
