Most scientists agree that the majority of human solid zzso tumors are characterized by zzso instability zzso involving gain or loss of whole zzso or zzso of zzso zzso is thought to be an early event during zzso and might therefore be involved in tumor zzso Despite its frequent occurrence in tumors and its potential importance in tumor evolution, zzso is poorly defined and is used zzso and zzso Here, we provide criteria to define zzso and argue that few experimental approaches are capable of assessing the presence of zzso zzso assessment of zzso is crucial to zzso whether zzso is a driving force for zzso and whether a zzso unstable zzso is necessary for tumor zzso
