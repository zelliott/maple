zzso one quarter of all cancer patients will require zzso radiation treatment at some point during the course of their disease, but only a minority of these patients are entered in clinical zzso 

We review the literature debating the ethics of inclusion of zzso patients on clinical zzso We suggest that these patients provide a potentially valuable resource that can be leveraged to facilitate the discovery and validation of zzso zzso of radiation response and zzso In addition, this patient population offers valuable opportunities to test combination of radiation and targeted therapies to screen for activity, toxicity and zzso in a relatively safe zzso 

Patients undergoing zzso radiation therapy may provide new opportunities for the development and testing of zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso opportunities to test combinations of radiation and targeted zzso
