The zzso zzso analogue zzso zzso was brought into clinical studies because of zzso observations of its zzso in zzso tumor cells, zzso zzso lack of zzso and zzso activity after oral zzso 

zzso zzso was given orally every 4 weeks to 21 adults with a variety of solid tumors at doses ranging from 59 to zzso zzso zzso prophylaxis with zzso zzso and steroids, given zzso on day 1 and orally on days zzso was required beginning with the dose of 118 zzso The plasma zzso of zzso zzso were determined by an zzso method with zzso zzso The in zzso zzso effects on zzso zzso forming cells zzso of the plasma from 11 patients, obtained 4 and 6 h after treatment at all dose levels, were also zzso 

zzso was the main zzso toxic effect and the maximum tolerated dose zzso for zzso was zzso zzso with zzso grade zzso in two of three zzso zzso zzso and vomiting were zzso and the zzso for gastrointestinal toxicity was fixed at 820 zzso with grade 4 vomiting in one of two zzso Other frequent toxic effects were zzso and zzso Peak levels of zzso zzso were achieved 4 h after zzso zzso zzso and zzso and significant zzso zzso of the main zzso parameters were zzso Very low levels of the zzso zzso zzso were detected only at the highest zzso The zzso tests showed a zzso colony growth zzso with no correlation between the growth zzso effect and the degree of zzso in the same zzso Plasma zzso of zzso zzso were 1000 times lower than the concentration zzso the growth of zzso of zzso No objective tumor responses were zzso 

zzso to the occurrence of severe and prolonged zzso and zzso the clinical development of oral zzso zzso was zzso The zzso zzso and its lack of relationship with plasma levels of zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso might be related to the formation of potent zzso zzso present in human plasma at zzso zzso and with prolonged zzso as suggested by zzso tests performed with plasma from patients in zzso zzso
