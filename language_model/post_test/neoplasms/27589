zzso by the rapid expansion in the development of zzso viral agents for the treatment of solid tumors, we formulated and analyzed a three-dimensional mathematical model of a tumor that is infected by a zzso zzso We initially considered three patterns of zzso injection in which a fixed fraction of cells are initially infected with the virus throughout zzso the entire zzso zzso the tumor core, and zzso the tumor zzso zzso For each injection pattern, an approximate analysis of the model provides a simple and accurate condition for whether the virus will eradicate the zzso The model was then generalized to incorporate zzso necrosis and an innate immune response against zzso tumor zzso Recent zzso and clinical data were used to validate the model and estimate key zzso zzso Our analysis has the following zzso even in the absence of an immune response, tumor zzso requires widespread distribution of the virus within the tumor at the time of zzso core or rim injections alone may result in tumor escape, particularly in a zzso zzso the more rapidly a virus zzso infected cells the more effective it will be at controlling the zzso and the innate immune response to the virus can potentially prevent the virus from controlling the zzso even with repeat zzso zzso in addition to diffuse zzso infection, tumor zzso by zzso zzso will probably require potent suppression of innate immune clearance mechanisms zzso by replacement of zzso zzso zzso combinations with traditional zzso zzso treatments, and/or zzso therapeutic gene expression with zzso bystander zzso
