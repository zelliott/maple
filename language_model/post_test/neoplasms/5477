During a phase I study of zzso human tumor necrosis factor zzso in cancer patients, serial immune studies were performed and analyzed for effects of zzso The zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was given over 2 h zzso on days 1, zzso zzso zzso and zzso at doses of 40, 80, zzso zzso and 240 zzso zzso testing was performed before therapy three times and subsequently on days 2, 8, 10, 12, 29, 33, 50, 54, 71, 75, and zzso two zzso zzso parameters evaluated included zzso zzso killer zzso spontaneous zzso activated killer cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso production zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso production zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso and zzso of peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Data were analyzed for long-term effects, the effect after 1 day of treatment zzso 1), and for weekly effect zzso from day 1 to day 5 of a given treatment zzso zzso decreases were seen in the spontaneous zzso of peripheral blood zzso cells and zzso zzso cells, whereas increases in spontaneous peripheral blood zzso activity were seen with zzso zzso zzso increases in zzso production of resting zzso and zzso were demonstrated, with late increases in zzso production by zzso zzso zzso No spontaneous zzso or zzso were noted in zzso with treatment, but production of zzso by zzso rose with zzso zzso During 5 days of zzso treatment, the percentages of circulating zzso and zzso cells zzso whereas that of zzso and zzso cells increased significantly and consistently, as determined by a zzso zzso zzso changes in several independently measured parameters were observed, including a zzso diminished production of zzso by zzso zzso by zzso and increased in zzso zzso zzso Because there was no clinical response in this trial, no association of zzso change with clinical response can be zzso No biologically optimal dose of zzso was zzso The data suggest that zzso may act as a trigger zzso initiating a broad zzso zzso
