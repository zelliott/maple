To evaluate dosing and intervention strategies for the phase II zzso of a zzso zzso inhibitor using zzso zzso and zzso with the aim of maximizing zzso the number of patients on treatment and zzso the average dose level during zzso 

A previously developed zzso model for zzso zzso was updated and parameters were zzso zzso patients, once daily and twice daily zzso Treatment of zzso was simulated for 16 weeks, initiated at zzso once zzso zzso measures included the number of patients on treatment and overall drug zzso A hypertension intervention design proposed for phase II studies was zzso including zzso treatment and dose zzso Additionally, a zzso dose escalation was investigated, zzso up to zzso once daily unless unacceptable toxicity zzso 

Using the proposed zzso intervention design, zzso of patients could remain on treatment, and the mean dose administered was zzso The adverse event zzso guided dose zzso increased the average dose by zzso while only marginally increasing the percentage of patients dropping out due to toxicity (from zzso to zzso 

The proposed hypertension intervention design is expected to be effective in maintaining patients on treatment with zzso The zzso dose zzso with blood pressure as a zzso yielded a higher overall dose level, without relevant increases in zzso Since increased exposure to zzso seems correlated with increased treatment zzso the zzso treatment design may thus be a valid approach to improve treatment zzso
