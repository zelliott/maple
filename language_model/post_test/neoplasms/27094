Although the large zzso shock proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified over 30 years ago, these abundant and highly zzso molecules have received much less attention compared to other conventional zzso Large stress proteins act as molecular zzso with exceptional zzso capability and prevent the zzso of proteins induced by zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso and zzso are integral to the ability of these molecules to zzso immune functions and are essential for developing large zzso complex vaccines for cancer zzso The potent zzso activity of the zzso protein zzso complexes demonstrated in zzso studies has led to a phase I clinical trial through the National Cancer Institute's rapid access to intervention development zzso zzso that is presently zzso Here we review aspects of the structure and function of these large stress zzso their roles as molecular zzso in the biology of cell stress, and prospects for their use in immune regulation and cancer zzso Lastly, we will discuss the recently revealed zzso activity of scavenger zzso A that binds to zzso and zzso as well as the feasibility of targeting this zzso to promote zzso zzso and zzso immunity induced by large zzso vaccines and other zzso
