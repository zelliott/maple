Changes in the structure and/or the expression of zzso genes were thought to be the major cause of cancer for many zzso However, the recent discovery of zzso zzso zzso transcripts suggests that the molecular biology of cancer is far more zzso zzso zzso are key players of the family of zzso and they have been under extensive investigation because of their involvement in zzso often taking up roles of tumor zzso or zzso zzso to the slow nature of experimental identification of zzso zzso zzso procedures have been applied as a valuable complement to zzso Numerous zzso tools, implemented to recognize the characteristic features of zzso zzso have resulted in the prediction of multiple novel zzso zzso zzso approaches provide valuable clues as to which are the dominant features that characterize these regulatory units and zzso act by narrowing down the search space making experimental zzso faster and significantly zzso Moreover, in combination with zzso zzso methods, such as deep sequencing and tilling zzso zzso methods have aided in the discovery of putative molecular signatures of zzso deregulation in human zzso This chapter focuses on existing zzso methods for identifying zzso zzso provides an overview of the methodology undertaken by these tools, and zzso their contribution toward unraveling the role of zzso in zzso
