A fast zzso protein zzso was detected by zzso zzso zzso in addition to factor VIII zzso zzso using zzso to human factor VIII zzso zzso had partial zzso identity with zzso migrated as an zzso and was distinct from zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso was zzso by zzso A and was zzso from the bulk of zzso by ammonium zzso zzso A significant amount of zzso was seen in normal serum zzso zzso zzso plasma from patients with: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso severe zzso A zzso zzso zzso Trace amounts of zzso were observed in plasma from normal donors zzso zzso zzso but neither zzso nor zzso was zzso in the plasma or serum from patients with severe von zzso disease zzso zzso zzso Freshly prepared zzso contained trace amounts of zzso similar to normal zzso but increased levels were observed in zzso factor concentrates prepared for patient zzso zzso levels of zzso were also seen in zzso after storage at 4 degrees C for 7 d and this generation of zzso was diminished by the addition of zzso zzso The presence of significant levels of zzso in situations where zzso zzso may be activated and zzso of its generation by zzso zzso suggest that this protein is produced by zzso action of zzso on the zzso zzso
