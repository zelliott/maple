Phase II zzso trials traditionally have used response rate zzso as the primary end point, but newer targeted agents require the consideration of alternative end zzso High rates of early progressive disease zzso suggest inadequate drug activity and may be useful in the early stopping of zzso This study used a simulation to define a set of rules to assess a combined end point of zzso and zzso 

The simulation assumed a zzso trial with a specified alpha error and zzso It randomly generated the true response rate, zzso of the agent under study and its true rate of early progressive disease, zzso for each run of the zzso Two pairs of parameters were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A drug was considered zzso for further development if r was less than or equal to zzso and zzso was greater than or equal to zzso zzso the zzso zzso and interesting for further development if r was greater than or equal to zzso or zzso was less than or equal to zzso zzso the alternate zzso zzso for the required number of patients with responses, zzso and zzso zzso were generated for each set of zzso 

zzso for zzso and zzso that satisfied the specified error rates were zzso There was at least an zzso likelihood that a study would be stopped at the first stage of zzso if r and zzso were zzso 

The simulation was able to establish stopping rules by combining the zzso and the zzso that achieved the desired error zzso High rates of early stopping suggest that this design could shorten phase II trials of inactive zzso
