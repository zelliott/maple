zzso of moving targets using a scanned zzso beam can cause clinically intolerable zzso and zzso within the target volume due to the interplay zzso Several motion zzso techniques such as zzso beam tracking and zzso are currently investigated to overcome this zzso To enable detailed experimental studies of potential zzso techniques a complex zzso phantom was zzso The phantom consists of an artificial zzso with ribs to introduce density zzso The contraction of the zzso can be controlled by a stepping zzso A robotic driven detector head positioned inside the zzso mimics zzso a lung zzso The detector head comprises 20 zzso chambers and 5 zzso films for target dose zzso The zzso breathing as well as the zzso zzso motion zzso translation, zzso zzso can be programmed independently and adjusted zzso This flexibility allows studying the zzso effects of correlation zzso between internal and external motions, irregular breathing, or baseline drifts to name a zzso Commercial motion detection systems, zzso zzso or zzso belt, can be mounted as they would be mounted in a patient zzso They are used to control the zzso treatment delivery and to generate data for zzso dose zzso To evaluate the zzso properties, zzso addressing zzso stability, zzso zzso and performance of dedicated breathing zzso were zzso In addition, initial zzso tests for treatment with a scanned carbon beam are zzso
