zzso or acquired resistance to current treatment protocols remains a major concern in clinical zzso and may be caused by defects in zzso zzso Since recent data suggest that TRAIL can bypass zzso resistance caused by zzso we further investigated the role of zzso in zzso zzso Here we report that zzso of zzso zzso protection against TRAIL in zzso zzso or breast zzso cell zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso of zzso and Bid indicating that zzso was activated upstream and also downstream of zzso in a feedback amplification zzso zzso zzso blocked zzso of zzso zzso and zzso into active zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso or zzso Also, zzso blocked zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso resistance against TRAIL indicating that zzso was also amplified through a zzso loop between zzso and zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso of zzso directly translated into full zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso and zzso independent of zzso zzso although zzso similarly inhibited loss of zzso membrane potential and the release of zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso in all cell zzso By demonstrating a cell type dependent regulation of the TRAIL signaling zzso at different level, zzso by zzso and by zzso these findings may have important clinical zzso Thus, strategies targeting the molecular basis of resistance towards TRAIL may be necessary in some tumors for cancer therapy with zzso
