It recently has been shown zzso that the focusing provided by a zzso zzso high magnetic field can significantly improve electron beam dose zzso This could permit precise targeting of tumors near critical areas and minimize the radiation dose to surrounding healthy zzso The experimental results together with zzso Carlo simulations suggest that the magnetic confinement of electron zzso beams may provide an alternative to zzso or heavy zzso radiation therapy in some zzso In the present work, the external magnetic field capability of the zzso Carlo code zzso was zzso by providing a zzso that modeled the actual field produced by the zzso magnet used in the experimental zzso The magnetic field in our simulation covered the region from the vacuum exit window to the phantom including surrounding zzso In a zzso zzso magnetic field, it is observed that the electron dose can be focused in both the zzso and zzso zzso The measured dose profiles of the electron beam are generally reproduced in the zzso Carlo simulations to within a few percent in the region of interest provided that the geometry and the energy of the incident electron beam are accurately zzso Comparisons for the zzso beam dose profiles with and without the magnetic field are also zzso The experimental results are zzso reproduced in the zzso Our simulation shows that the excessive dose at the beam entrance is due to the magnetic field zzso and focusing scattered secondary electrons that were produced in the air by the incident zzso zzso The simulations also show that the electron dose profile can be manipulated by the appropriate control of the beam energy together with the strength and displacement of the zzso magnetic zzso
