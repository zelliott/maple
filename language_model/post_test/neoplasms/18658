zzso zzso OF THE zzso The objective of this study was to assess whether zzso zzso zzso imaging improved the evaluation of suspected zzso and if there was any resulting change in zzso 

A total of 53 patients with suspected zzso were investigated by performing two zzso acquisitions started at mean times zzso zzso 64 and zzso zzso 155 zzso after the zzso zzso The total number of zzso zzso was 133 and the total number of benign zzso was zzso Visual and zzso analysis was performed on both the early and delayed zzso 

Overall, there was a significant improvement zzso zzso zzso in the sensitivity of delayed imaging zzso compared with early imaging zzso in detecting zzso zzso without a reduction in zzso In 10 patients, 13 zzso zzso were zzso on early imaging alone but detected on delayed zzso In seven patients, 10 zzso zzso were incorrectly classified as zzso zzso on early imaging but correctly reported as zzso zzso on delayed zzso Management was altered in 2 out of 17 zzso Overall, delayed imaging altered management in 2 out of 53 studied zzso zzso zzso imaging was useful in zzso zzso from benign zzso zzso but did not improve the evaluation of pulmonary zzso 

zzso imaging should be performed as late as reasonably possible after zzso administration in order to increase zzso contrast and thereby improve the sensitivity of demonstrating additional sites of zzso zzso zzso may be of benefit in the evaluation of zzso zzso but does not improve the overall evaluation of pulmonary zzso
