During the drug development process, phase I trials are the first occasion to study the zzso of a zzso They are performed in healthy subjects, or in patients in zzso and are designed to determine a safe and acceptable dose for the later zzso of clinical zzso We performed a zzso survey to investigate the way zzso are described and reported in phase I clinical zzso 

We performed a zzso search to retrieve the list of papers published between 2005 and 2006 and reporting phase I clinical trials with a zzso zzso We used a spreadsheet to record general information concerning the study and specific information regarding the zzso such as the sampling times, number of subjects and method of zzso 

The search yielded zzso papers, of which 37 were excluded for various zzso Nearly all of the papers in our review concerned cancer studies, although this was not a requirement in the zzso zzso with the selection process, zzso papers explicitly stated zzso as an objective of the zzso The methods section usually included a description of the zzso zzso but zzso of the papers provided no information concerning the methods used for the zzso and in zzso the description was only zzso The zzso method was usually zzso with zzso or purely descriptive zzso zzso zzso and areas under the zzso zzso were the zzso variables most often zzso The results of the zzso study were frequently reported in a separate paragraph of the results section, and only zzso of the studies related the zzso findings to other results from the study, such as toxicity or zzso In addition, important information such as the number of subjects included in the zzso study or the zzso sampling scheme was sometimes not reported zzso 

Concerns about the decreasing zzso of the drug development process prompted the regulatory authorities to recently recommend better integration of all available information - including, in particular, zzso - in this zzso In our review, we found that this information was often either missing or incomplete, which zzso that zzso We suggest several improvements in the design and the reporting of the methods and results of these studies, to ensure that all relevant information has been zzso zzso findings should also be integrated into the broader perspective of drug development, through the study of their relationship with toxicity and/or zzso even in the early phase I zzso
