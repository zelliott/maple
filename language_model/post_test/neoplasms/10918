zzso studies have shown that taller people are at increased risk of cancer, but it is unclear if zzso risks vary by cancer site, or by other factors such as smoking and socioeconomic zzso Our aim was to investigate these associations in a large UK prospective cohort with sufficient information on incident cancer to allow direct comparison of zzso risk across cancer sites and in relation to major potential zzso and zzso zzso 

Information on height and other factors relevant for cancer was obtained in zzso for middle-aged women without previous cancer who were followed up for cancer zzso We used Cox zzso models to calculate adjusted relative risks zzso per 10 zzso increase in measured height for total incident cancer and for 17 specific cancer sites, taking attained age as the underlying time zzso We also did a zzso of published results from prospective studies of total cancer risk in relation to zzso 

zzso women included in our analysis were followed up for a total of zzso million zzso zzso zzso years per woman, zzso zzso during which time zzso incident zzso zzso The zzso for total cancer was of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for every 10 zzso increase in zzso zzso increased for 15 of the 17 cancer sites we zzso and was statistically significant for ten sites: colon zzso per 10 zzso increase in height zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso melanoma zzso zzso breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso kidney zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The increase in total cancer zzso per 10 zzso increase in height did not vary significantly by socioeconomic status or by ten other personal characteristics we zzso but was significantly lower in current than in never smokers zzso In current smokers, zzso zzso were not as strongly related to height as were other zzso zzso per 10 zzso increase in height zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso In a zzso of our study and ten other prospective studies, zzso zzso for total cancer showed little variation across Europe, North America, zzso and zzso 

Cancer zzso increases with increasing adult height for most cancer zzso The relation between height and total cancer zzso is similar in different zzso
