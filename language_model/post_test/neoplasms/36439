The zzso necrosis factors zzso are zzso small proteins produced by cells as part of the zzso zzso zzso The exact zzso role of zzso is unknown, but interest in them focused on three of their zzso as potential zzso agents, as zzso zzso of an zzso response to injury and as zzso molecules in zzso The first zzso to be zzso now known as zzso has been relatively well studied because the zzso protein was easily produced since it was cloned in zzso Studies on zzso or zzso were hampered by the inability of most groups to express the zzso zzso This paper describes the expression and zzso of zzso zzso in zzso coli, followed by studies to zzso the zzso binding site of the zzso through zzso zzso zzso with single zzso acid changes at either of two distinct loop regions, at positions zzso zzso or zzso were found to have greatly reduced zzso binding and zzso zzso These two regions in zzso zzso to known loop regions where zzso also result in loss of biological activity of zzso a related zzso which shares the same cellular receptors with zzso This provides evidence for a new hypothesis that both the zzso bind to their receptors as zzso each of which is capable of binding simultaneously to three zzso This leads further to the intriguing possibility of a new mechanism of zzso zzso through simultaneous binding to a single zzso
