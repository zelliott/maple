The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been shown to be highly zzso in cancer and inflammation and is critically linked to the processes of invasion and zzso One of the key zzso involved in specifically degrading the zzso zzso zzso component of the zzso is the zzso zzso zzso zzso of HS by zzso releases both a host of zzso growth factors anchored within the mesh of the zzso as well as defined fragments of HS capable of promoting cellular zzso The finding that zzso is elevated in a wide variety of tumor types and is subsequently linked to the development of pathological processes has led to an explosion of therapeutic strategies to inhibit its zzso zzso So far only one compound, the zzso zzso zzso which both zzso zzso activity and has effects on growth factor binding has reached clinical trials where it has shown to have promising zzso The scene has clearly been set however for a new generation of compounds, either specific to the zzso or with dual roles, to emerge from the lab and enter the zzso The aim of this review is to describe the current drug discovery status of small zzso sugar and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Potential strategies will also be discussed on the selection of suitable zzso strategies for specific monitoring of in zzso zzso zzso which will be crucial for both animal model and clinical trial zzso
