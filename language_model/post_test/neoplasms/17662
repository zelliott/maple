zzso influence both the initiation of abnormal cells and the subsequent promotion of such cells into zzso Certain other insults seem limited to the stimulation of cellular proliferation and of zzso zzso Common examples include zzso zzso chemical, and temperature wounding of tissue followed by zzso In addition, certain zzso growth induced by some chemicals may also enhance zzso We propose that the zzso of zzso zzso may derive from a zzso estimated according to enhanced cell proliferation resulting from zzso or toxic zzso induced by a specific zzso At this time, it is not possible to zzso in a restrictive sense, the molecular events which are critical to zzso but the processes of cell proliferation resulting from zzso seem to serve as zzso which contain the necessary (and perhaps several zzso biological zzso The unique advantage is that zzso animal, and zzso studies can be used to evaluate certain parameters of the mathematical model for an untested treatment protocol or chemical insult suspected to be a zzso in zzso The main thrust of this paper is to propose that zzso should be studied in terms of zzso zzso in response to a biological challenge rather than according to chemical or energetic parameters of that zzso This approach leads to mathematical equations which can serve as a unifying concept for zzso risk zzso Sample results, to illustrate the utility of this model, are given for zzso aromatic zzso trace metals, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso here, is for acute exposure conditions, but because the model is zzso other exposure protocols can be addressed by simply adjusting some of the mathematical parameters according to factors estimated from a relative potency comparison of in zzso and in zzso studies best suited to the particular application of zzso
