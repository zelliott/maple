The Simon zzso optimal design is often used for phase II cancer clinical zzso A study proceeds to the second stage unless the zzso hypothesis, that the true zzso response rate is below some specified value, is already accepted at the end of stage zzso The conventional optimal design, for given type 1 and type 2 error rates, is the one which zzso the expected sample size under the zzso zzso However, at least some new agents are active, and designs that explicitly address this possibility should be zzso We therefore investigate novel designs which are optimal under the alternative hypothesis, that the zzso response rate is higher than the zzso hypothesis value, and also designs which allow early stopping for zzso We make available, software for identifying the corresponding optimal and zzso zzso zzso savings in expected sample sizes can be achieved if the alternative hypothesis is in fact true, without sample sizes suffering too much if the zzso hypothesis is zzso We present an example discussing the merits of different designs in a practical zzso We conclude that it is relevant to consider optimal designs under a range of hypotheses about the true response rate, and that allowing early stopping for efficacy is always advantageous in terms of expected sample zzso
