On the basis of current knowledge, control of the zzso phase transition is largely a matter of regulating a set of specific zzso dependent zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso specific zzso activities are composed of complexes between D type zzso and either zzso or zzso and between zzso E (and possibly zzso zzso and zzso A variety of internal and external signals regulate zzso specific zzso by modulating zzso zzso the levels of zzso zzso proteins and the zzso status of zzso Although much is now known about the regulation of zzso specific zzso the only well characterized zzso to date is the zzso gene product, zzso zzso of RB by zzso zzso its cell cycle zzso properties, allowing progression of zzso to S zzso Not surprisingly, many components of the cell cycle regulatory machinery, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are important targets of zzso that lead to human zzso
