zzso zzso zzso is frequently found in cancer zzso This study attempted to determine how often the zzso were the source of this infection and the risk factors associated with zzso zzso 

The zzso records were zzso reviewed of all cancer patients having zzso zzso zzso and zzso central zzso zzso seen between January 1998 and January zzso In a zzso analysis the patients' clinical zzso zzso therapy, outcome, and source of zzso that were significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as opposed to secondary zzso were zzso 

A total of 217 zzso were identified in zzso zzso 159 zzso were primary zzso zzso zzso 89 zzso and 17 zzso 11 zzso were primary zzso and 47 zzso were zzso zzso analysis showed the following factors to be independently associated with zzso zzso zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso 2) no prior intensive care unit admission zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 3) zzso status at onset zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The response rate to appropriate antibiotics and zzso removal was zzso in the patients with zzso zzso zzso infections, compared with only zzso in the patients with secondary zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The majority of the zzso zzso zzso occurring in cancer patients with zzso central zzso zzso appear to be zzso and are often zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred more frequently in zzso ill, zzso patients, and prompt removal of the zzso was found to be associated with a better zzso
