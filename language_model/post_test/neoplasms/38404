The synthesis and zzso of three zzso zzso differing in zzso are zzso zzso 1, 2, and 3 are derived from a common zzso zzso 4, and vary in molecular mass from 11 to 73 zzso as a result of zzso with multiple zzso zzso zzso groups of zzso 2, and 5 zzso zzso As expected, elimination zzso increased with an increase in molecular zzso In light of other results, however, molecular mass proves not to be the primary zzso of elimination zzso Instead, these times can be more readily predicted from the number of zzso groups on the zzso the size of the zzso chain contributes to a lesser zzso zzso zzso is observed for all the three zzso in mice bearing prostate cancer zzso
