A zzso model of tumor response to zzso zzso zzso is presented and zzso An important feature of the model is the characterization of different mechanisms by which zzso zzso the cell death zzso The model predicts that the long-term response of the tumor to repeated rounds of therapy is very sensitive to changes in the threshold level of zzso required to initiate zzso at the maximum zzso In fact, zzso of this zzso mediate the difference between effective tumor zzso and minimal growth zzso The model is also used to investigate which parameters are most influential in rendering the tumor drug zzso zzso analysis shows that decreasing cellular zzso as opposed to decreasing zzso rate or increasing cellular zzso is the most effective way for tumor cells to overcome the growth control afforded by successive rounds of zzso
