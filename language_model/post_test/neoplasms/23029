We have tried to answer the still controversial question of whether or not zzso tumor zzso is associated with elevated levels of zzso growth factor II zzso zzso keeping in mind that controversial results may be due to zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso II were determined by a rat liver membrane zzso zzso and by zzso zzso samples were gel filtered at zzso zzso and some zzso were also tested after zzso extraction as an alternative method for zzso and separating zzso from the zzso carrier zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso was performed with a labeled partially zzso zzso preparation zzso zzso activity soluble in zzso zzso zzso that was used by a group reporting elevated zzso levels in about zzso of their patients with tumor zzso Mean serum levels of zzso zzso II and zzso zzso II zzso zzso were zzso zzso 169 and 540 zzso 256 zzso in 22 patients with tumor zzso as compared with zzso zzso 155 and zzso zzso 217 zzso in 28 normal zzso This pattern of slightly, but not significantly lower mean zzso II values in tumor zzso was unchanged when a less pure zzso preparation zzso zzso was used as a zzso or when the zzso were extracted with zzso Thus, zzso resulting from zzso tumors is not likely to be associated with increased zzso or zzso zzso II zzso
