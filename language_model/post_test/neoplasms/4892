Cell growth is a prerequisite for cell zzso and zzso zzso is a limiting factor for cell zzso In zzso cells, the tumor zzso zzso has been shown to induce zzso arrest in response to impaired zzso zzso Recently, zzso mechanisms of zzso arrest in response to zzso of zzso zzso have been zzso These findings provide a rational basis for the use of drugs that specifically impact zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso lacking active zzso and extend the scenario of mechanisms involved in the relationship between cell growth and cell zzso
