Mechanical complications in zzso zzso central zzso zzso zzso often involve a risk of zzso zzso procedures are, therefore, of primary zzso We zzso evaluated the zzso of zzso mechanical and infectious complications observed in devices fixated with the Sri zzso zzso 

All zzso inserted in children with cancer at our Institution from October 2005 to January 2007 were zzso monitored for zzso mechanical and infectious zzso The Sri zzso fixation technique was used in all zzso The complication rate per 1,000 days was calculated as 1,000 times the number of complications divided by the total number of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were positioned in 84 zzso The overall length of observation ranged between 41 and zzso days for a total of zzso zzso zzso Mechanical complications occurred in zzso of the devices zzso rate zzso infections were observed in zzso of the devices zzso rate zzso No complications were observed during the first 30 days after zzso zzso 

The results, we obtained with the Sri zzso technique are extremely zzso Yet, zzso studies are required to prove these preliminary zzso
