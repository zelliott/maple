In clinical zzso zzso zzso zzso studies for zzso it is occasionally required to differentiate a diffuse increase in bone zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso due to the involvement of zzso or zzso disease and that due to the administration of zzso zzso an inflammation reaction, or stimulation by some types of zzso The objectives of this study were to clarify the relationships between zzso zzso zzso zzso and blood parameters as well as age, and also to determine the degree of zzso zzso zzso that constitutes an abnormal level referring to blood zzso 

Records of 65 patients, 32 with benign diseases and 33 with zzso without zzso in bone and liver until a half year after the PET examination, were analyzed zzso zzso of interest were placed on the liver and the lower zzso and zzso zzso to measure the standardized zzso value zzso and zzso zzso were averaged as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was divided by the liver zzso to calculate the zzso zzso The relationships among the zzso zzso or zzso ratio, and blood parameters and age were tested using multiple zzso zzso 

In both patients with and without zzso a multiple zzso model using the zzso ratio showed a higher zzso of determination value than that using the zzso zzso indicating that the correction by the liver zzso reduced the zzso variation in the zzso zzso The zzso ratio was zzso correlated with age zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and positively correlated with serum zzso protein zzso level zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in both groups of zzso Every patient with benign disease who had a ratio greater than or equal to 1 had an increased zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso zzso depends on the patient's age and serum zzso level, both with and without zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso greater than or equal to that of the liver may indicate zzso zzso
