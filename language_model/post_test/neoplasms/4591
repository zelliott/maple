Increased body iron stores have been suggested as a risk factor for cancer and zzso heart disease zzso However, all studies carried out to date have focused on relatively young populations although the elderly may also be at increased zzso 

We investigated the association between body iron stores and mortality due to cancer and zzso in a 17-year follow-up study of 260 zzso elderly people aged zzso zzso Iron status was assessed in 1971 by means of the zzso level, zzso zzso and total iron binding capacity zzso Information about the vital status and causes of death was obtained in zzso 

Among women mortality due to cancer was zzso related to zzso the relative risk for the highest zzso of zzso adjusted for age, smoking and alcohol intake was zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso The risk of mortality due to zzso was also zzso associated with zzso Among men, no association between body iron stores and mortality due to cancer was zzso zzso due to zzso was not clearly associated with body iron zzso Among men, the adjusted relative risk decreased slightly per zzso of zzso zzso but this trend was only of borderline significance zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggest that body iron stores are a risk factor for mortality due to cancer in zzso zzso This may be due to zzso of stored iron among women after zzso No clear associations with mortality due to zzso were observed in either elderly men or elderly zzso
