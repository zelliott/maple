The formation of new blood vessels is an essential process in embryonic development and wound healing, for tumor growth and zzso In zzso zzso studies have revealed that the zzso zzso is expressed in zzso cells at the beginning of blood vessel formation, in normal and pathological zzso zzso encodes a zzso factor, a protein which binds specifically to DNA and which regulates the zzso of genes containing these specific binding sequences in their zzso Thus, in zzso experiments suggest that zzso may activate the zzso of genes zzso zzso 1, zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso A working hypothesis is that zzso takes part in regulating zzso by controlling the zzso of these genes whose activity is necessary for the migration of zzso cells from pre-existing zzso This hypothesis is discussed with respect to current experimental evidence and to the complexity of the regulatory network controlling gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso
