The main objective of the present study was to investigate whether exposure to zzso fumes could enhance the risk of cancer in asphalt zzso 

A historical prospective cohort study was performed including zzso male asphalt workers from all main asphalt companies in zzso zzso date of birth, and unique personal identification number, address, job type, and start and stop of employment in specific jobs was obtained for the zzso Information was complied from payroll and personnel records in the zzso The cohort was then linked to the Cancer zzso of Norway, which has complete records of individual cases of cancer in the Norwegian population since zzso zzso was from 1 January 1970 to 31 December zzso The zzso age and period adjusted general male population in Norway served as reference zzso 

Lung cancer was found elevated with standardized zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso zzso zzso in the overall zzso Lung cancer was found more elevated in workers first exposed in the 1950s and 1960s and in zzso asphalt workers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10, based on four zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was a zzso in the zzso of zzso melanoma with 13 cases versus 26 zzso 

zzso of lung cancer was found enhanced among the asphalt zzso Some of the enhanced risk could probably be explained by the smoking habits of the zzso Exposure to coal zzso may also have contributed to the enhanced zzso
