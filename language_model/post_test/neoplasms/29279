Cancer models relating basic science to clinical care in zzso may fail to address the zzso of tumor behavior and therapy, as in the case, discussed zzso of the complex zzso dynamics leading to the zzso enhanced zzso paradoxically induced by the very zzso therapy designed to destroy the zzso Studies would benefit from approaches that zzso link the multiple physical and zzso scales from zzso to tissue in order to offer outcome predictions for individual zzso Physical zzso is an approach that applies fundamental principles from the physical and biological sciences to explain certain cancer behaviors as zzso characteristics arising from the underlying physical and zzso zzso For example, the transport of oxygen molecules through tissue affects zzso characteristics such as cell zzso zzso and zzso which in turn zzso the zzso tumor growth and zzso Our review of physical zzso illustrates how tumor behavior and treatment response may be a quantifiable function of marginally stable molecular and/or cellular conditions modulated by zzso By incorporating zzso zzso zzso zzso and cellular data into zzso physical models, physical zzso could complement current clinical practice through enhanced understanding of cancer behavior, thus potentially improving patient zzso
