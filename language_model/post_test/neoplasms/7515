Rates of zzso synthesis from zzso zzso via zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso are compared in zzso of 13 zzso most of which are deficient in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In all zzso zzso zzso zzso entered zzso more rapidly via zzso zzso zzso than via zzso zzso zzso with a relatively low rate of zzso synthesis via zzso zzso showed no zzso increase in the rate of synthesis via zzso zzso zzso The rates at which tissue zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso via zzso zzso increase as zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are more active than zzso zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, all the tissue zzso possessed an apparently greater capability to zzso zzso via zzso zzso than via zzso zzso zzso but did not express this zzso This result is discussed in relation to in zzso zzso zzso
