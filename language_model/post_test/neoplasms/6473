We have studied the regulation by zzso and zzso zzso of the amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a Mr approximately zzso zzso zzso inhibitor accumulated in zzso zzso culture fluid by a human zzso a human zzso and a human melanoma cell line zzso zzso and zzso For the zzso of zzso and zzso we used zzso zzso with a combination of zzso and zzso zzso For an zzso of variations in the amount of the zzso we used sodium zzso zzso gel zzso followed by zzso blue zzso of zzso culture fluid zzso the inhibitor protein band being identified by its selective removal by passage of the zzso culture zzso through a column with zzso zzso against the zzso The zzso of the 3 proteins by the hormonal agents varied greatly between the cell zzso The proteins were independently zzso in the sense that the hormonal agents did not zzso change their levels in the direction expected either to increase or decrease total zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso culture zzso containing both zzso and zzso the two were present in the medium as a Mr approximately 120 zzso zzso In contrast, no zzso inhibitor complexes were found in zzso culture fluid from any of the cell zzso this is likely to be due to the occurrence of zzso in the culture fluid in the zzso zzso form, which, unlike active zzso does not react with the zzso These findings illustrate the complexity of the regulation of zzso zzso zzso activity, and imply that the presumed functional diversity of zzso and zzso may be related to their independent zzso
