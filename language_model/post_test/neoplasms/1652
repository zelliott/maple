An intended consequence of the significant investment to characterize the zzso zzso and its zzso in zzso diseases, has been the discovery and commercialization of new approaches to zzso zzso As a result, the list of available targets, formerly directed against the processes of DNA replication and zzso or in hormonal regulation of growth of zzso has been dramatically zzso Many of the newer targets represent normal or zzso signaling zzso and are present within the cancer cell as second zzso on its surface (as zzso or in the external milieu (as zzso These targets are, therefore, important to the cancer cell zzso and affect zzso zzso and death options for the zzso Another group of targets zzso the cancer cell's relationship to the tissue environment (both zzso and zzso zzso These targets involve interactions with blood supply zzso immune function zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Thus, most targets are directly or indirectly critical to some aspect of cancer cell zzso although a few additional targets are being approached as zzso signals for the delivery of otherwise less specific zzso or zzso zzso The development of new therapeutic approaches has expanded the scope of research required to characterize the mechanism of action for zzso agents in zzso models and in clinical zzso In zzso research, mechanism of action studies have supported the selection of therapeutic agents, appropriate models of zzso and experimental design, as well as rational characterization and prediction of zzso zzso zzso In clinical research, mechanism of action studies have supported the identification of surrogate markers of efficacy zzso for determining zzso of dose and zzso of zzso and the selection of patient zzso and tumor zzso most likely to exhibit clinical zzso Finally, information on mechanism of action may suggest strategies for combination therapies and predict potential mechanisms of disease resistance to zzso
