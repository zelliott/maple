Several zzso and clinical studies have documented that dose or dose intensity of zzso agents are important factors for response of patients' zzso This finding has prompted zzso trials of certain zzso agents in high-dose or regional administration treatment zzso The present study was performed to identify agents that would be particularly good candidates for high-dose or regional administration regimens against particular types of zzso Using a human tumor cloning technique, we constructed dose in zzso response lines for ten different zzso agents against seven different zzso types of zzso zzso of the lines indicated the agents with the greatest increases of in zzso response per zzso in dose of the zzso zzso against which the agents gave the zzso dose response lines included lymphoma, head and neck cancer, zzso cancer, and zzso lung cancer, while the dose response lines for zzso lung cancer, breast cancer, and colon cancer were quite zzso Suggestions for clinical trials based on these findings include the use of high-dose zzso for patients with lymphoma, head and neck, and zzso zzso the use of zzso in high-dose regimens for patients with breast zzso high-dose zzso regimens for patients with zzso lung zzso high-dose zzso regimens for patients with zzso lung and head and neck zzso and regional zzso of liver zzso from zzso cancer with zzso Prospective testing of high-dose or regional administration regimens suggested by this new model should indicate its use for prediction of the best agent to use in high-dose regimens against a particular tumor zzso
