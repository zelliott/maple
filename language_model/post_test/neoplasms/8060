zzso and zzso are emerging infectious zzso bacterial species that can affect zzso zzso The authors sought to determine the zzso and characteristics of zzso infections caused by these organisms in patients with underlying zzso 

All consecutive episodes of zzso zzso and zzso infections recorded from December 26, 1989, to July 27, 2003, were studied zzso 

zzso episodes occurred in 46 zzso 31 patients zzso had zzso zzso and 24 zzso experienced zzso zzso 500 zzso Diabetes zzso was present in 12 patients zzso and high-dose zzso were administered to 12 patients zzso zzso of the 52 infectious episodes zzso were zzso in origin, and 10 patients zzso had zzso zzso zzso zzso was the most common cause of infection zzso of 52 episodes zzso followed by zzso zzso (2 of 52 episodes zzso and zzso zzso (1 of 52 episodes zzso zzso episodes zzso were zzso and 3 patients zzso had concurrent zzso zzso zzso zzso were present in 13 of 52 cases zzso pneumonia was encountered in 6 of 52 cases zzso and urinary tract infections were present in 5 of 52 cases zzso Most zzso exhibited in zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso Resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Seven deaths zzso were attributable to zzso zzso zzso rates for zzso syndrome, zzso dysfunction zzso zzso and zzso Health zzso zzso II score zzso zzso and use of mechanical ventilation and zzso support were significantly higher in patients who died zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso syndrome and high zzso II scores were zzso of increased 30-day zzso 

Most infections caused by this group of zzso zzso bacteria were attributable to zzso zzso and only one-third were acquired during zzso The presence of zzso syndrome has evolved as an independent predictor of poor outcome in patients with high-risk zzso accompanied by zzso zzso zzso
