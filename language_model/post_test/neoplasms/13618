zzso of zzso zzso cells to tumor cells could be an efficient strategy of adoptive zzso The success of this strategy depends on the specificity of the zzso cells and their availability in sufficient zzso The aim of this study was to target the human natural killer cell line zzso specifically to tumor zzso The cell line was modified by zzso with the zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso recognizes carbohydrates containing terminal zzso zzso zzso including the zzso bearing zzso zzso zzso which is found on tumor zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso cell line binds significantly higher to tested target tumor cell lines than the zzso control zzso zzso activity against the tumor cell lines zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso modification of zzso cells could provide a useful tool for tumor targeting in zzso
