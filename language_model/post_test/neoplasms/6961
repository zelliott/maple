The zzso zzso is a zzso of nuclear zzso factor zzso B zzso and actively zzso in expression of zzso genes involved in inflammation and zzso zzso the regulation of zzso is an important strategy to regulate those zzso In this study, we provide data that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso as zzso induced cell death in zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso DNA binding activity zzso but inhibited zzso genes expression zzso It inhibited zzso of zzso A zzso by zzso activity of protein zzso A zzso The zzso zzso was independent of zzso zzso activity or zzso zzso The zzso activity decreased due to zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibited almost zzso zzso activity at 100 zzso zzso having an zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso different zzso zzso cell zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso zzso activity followed by decreased zzso of zzso and zzso activity of zzso thereby decreasing zzso proteins resulting in induction of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The study might help to understand the mechanism of zzso zzso and to design it as new zzso drug for tumor zzso
