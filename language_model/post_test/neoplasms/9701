Natural and synthetic compounds that disrupt zzso dynamics are among the most successful and widely used cancer zzso zzso However, lack of reliable markers that predict sensitivity of zzso to these agents and development of resistance remain zzso zzso There is accumulating evidence that a family of cellular proteins that are associated with and alter the dynamics of zzso can determine sensitivity of cancer cells to zzso agents and play a role in tumor cell resistance to these zzso This growing family of zzso proteins zzso includes products of zzso tumor zzso and zzso regulators, suggesting that zzso of zzso dynamics may be one of the critical events in zzso and tumor zzso The objective of this review is to integrate the knowledge on these seemingly unrelated proteins that share a common function and examine their relevance to zzso therapies and highlight zzso interactions as a novel avenue for new drug zzso Based on the available evidence, we propose that rational zzso cancer therapeutic approaches should zzso include zzso profiling of tumor zzso before administration of zzso agents zzso in combination with agents that zzso the expression of relevant zzso
