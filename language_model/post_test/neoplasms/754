We show on imaging mass zzso zzso data that the Random Forest zzso can be used for automated tissue zzso and that it results in predictions with high sensitivities and positive zzso values, even when zzso zzso is present in the zzso We further demonstrate how zzso Random Fields and zzso median filtering can be applied to reduce noise effects to further improve the zzso results in a zzso smoothing zzso Our study gives clear evidence that digital zzso by means of IMS constitutes a promising complement to chemical zzso zzso
