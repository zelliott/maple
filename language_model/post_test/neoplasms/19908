zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is often zzso in tumor cells and is regarded as a contributor to their drug zzso zzso of zzso zzso are expected to counteract drug resistance and may therefore serve as zzso in the chemotherapy of cancer by increasing the efficacy of zzso zzso Finding useful zzso among compounds used for other indications would be a shortcut to clinical applications and a search for zzso zzso zzso among approved drugs and other compounds was therefore zzso 

We tested zzso zzso compounds as zzso of the zzso activity of zzso human zzso zzso in zzso 

We identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid as the most effective zzso zzso zzso with zzso values in the low zzso zzso For comparison, these compounds were even more potent in the zzso of human zzso zzso an zzso implicated in steroid hormone zzso In distinction from the other zzso which showed conventional zzso patterns, the competitive inhibitor zzso acid zzso strong kinetic zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Apparently, zzso acid serves as an zzso inhibitor of the zzso 

In their own right, the compounds investigated are less potent than desired for zzso in cancer chemotherapy, but the structures of the most potent zzso could serve as leads for the synthesis of more efficient zzso
