We evaluated whether urine beta zzso zzso zzso zzso as a function of zzso correlated with plasma and urine platinum levels in patients receiving zzso Thirty-one patients had urine platinum zzso in urine samples collected at 0 to 6 and 6 to 24 h after zzso administration, 25 of these patients had serial plasma platinum zzso Sixteen of the 31 patients had an increase in urine beta zzso A significant correlation was obtained between urine platinum and beta zzso in the 6- to zzso samples zzso zzso zzso p less than zzso The mean plasma platinum levels were higher zzso zzso zzso zzso in the patients with an increase in urine beta zzso compared to those patients with no change in beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso less than zzso Our study indicates that zzso damage occurs within 24 h after zzso administration and that the damage zzso with urine platinum zzso
