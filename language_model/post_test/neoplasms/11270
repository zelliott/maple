X-ray zzso imaging zzso for the first time allows for the zzso acquisition of three-dimensional zzso zzso cone beam zzso zzso zzso zzso Clinical imaging using the zzso System zzso zzso zzso commenced in July zzso This study evaluated image quality and dose delivered and assessed clinical utility for treatment zzso at a range of zzso zzso 

Single zzso were acquired from 30 patients undergoing zzso for tumors at 10 different zzso zzso Patients were zzso in their setup zzso zzso doses received were measured using zzso on the skin zzso The utility of XVI in zzso target volume coverage was zzso assessed by experienced zzso 

X-ray zzso imaging acquisition was completed in the treatment position at all zzso zzso At sites where a full zzso rotation was not possible, zzso were reconstructed from projection images acquired from partial zzso zzso definition of organ boundaries allowed direct assessment of zzso target volume coverage at all zzso Individual image quality depended on both imaging parameters and patient zzso zzso dose ranged from zzso zzso in the head to zzso zzso in the zzso 

zzso XVI provided zzso zzso images with zzso definition at all zzso sites at zzso low radiation zzso This technology sets a new standard in treatment zzso and will facilitate novel zzso zzso zzso
