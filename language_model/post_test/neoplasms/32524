zzso the zzso protein of zzso has generally been thought to be exclusively a zzso protein in higher zzso We have previously shown that cultured rat kidney zzso cells contain the zzso zzso of zzso in their zzso in the form of an zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso zzso More recently, we examined a variety of zzso and zzso cell lines and found zzso in the zzso of all of the former and only a few of the latter zzso et zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso In order to determine if zzso occurs in the zzso of actual zzso as well as in cancer cell lines, we used the zzso method to look for nuclear zzso in a variety of tumors excised from 201 zzso We found that zzso of these tumors contain zzso in their zzso Distribution of nuclear zzso was highly dependent on the type of cancer, with zzso of the colon and prostate zzso but only zzso of the skin tumors, having nuclear zzso Nuclear zzso was particularly marked in tumors of zzso origin, of which zzso showed nuclear zzso in contrast to zzso in tumors of zzso zzso In many cases, zzso zzso occurred very strongly in the zzso and not in the zzso in other cases, zzso was present in zzso In many cases, particularly zzso otherwise normal cells adjacent to the tumor also showed nuclear zzso suggesting that cancer cells may influence nearby cells to zzso zzso and zzso it to their zzso Our results have implications for the diagnosis, biology, and chemotherapy of zzso
