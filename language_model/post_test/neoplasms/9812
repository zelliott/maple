zzso in the zzso fluidity of zzso increases the turnover number of each zzso unit, but in general decreases its accessibility to zzso zzso As a result, many zzso functions reach a zzso activity at a specific zzso zzso These effects of membrane fluidity bear direct implications on tumor development with significant clinical zzso Two main zzso by which zzso manipulation could be applied in cancer treatment are now being studied in experimental animals and cancer zzso In the first, the zzso of tumor cells in zzso and zzso systems increase upon increase of the membrane zzso which is in line with the findings that membrane zzso become more exposed upon such zzso zzso tumor cells with increased membrane zzso zzso by incorporation of zzso zzso zzso thus act as strong and specific vaccine against the viable zzso tumor cells of the same zzso The second zzso manipulation relates to restoration of suppressed immune zzso A special mixture of lipids zzso zzso zzso designed to efficiently zzso cell zzso was found to restore various zzso functions of zzso from cancer zzso The combination of zzso of tumor zzso and restoration of immune functions by such zzso zzso is expected to constitute an innocuous active zzso regimen for cancer zzso
