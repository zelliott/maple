zzso zzso frequently accumulates in cancer cells and promotes tumor cell invasion, as part of its gain of zzso Its zzso is partially due to enhanced stability, but little is known about how the zzso levels of zzso zzso can be zzso Likewise, the impact of cancer therapy on the levels of zzso zzso is poorly zzso We show here that the zzso zzso zzso and zzso further increase the amounts of zzso zzso zzso and protein in cancer zzso Moreover, we show for the first time that the zzso factor zzso associates with the promoter DNA of zzso Upon zzso treatment, zzso contributed to the expression of zzso zzso both directly and through induction of zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso and also another zzso zzso zzso failed to increase the levels of zzso zzso despite their ability to induce the synthesis of zzso zzso Instead, a natural zzso transcript of zzso zzso was strongly zzso by zzso and zzso but only less so by the other zzso under zzso zzso corresponding to the first zzso of zzso was mainly found in cell zzso and it reduced the levels of zzso zzso Taken together, this suggests a zzso zzso pattern of zzso and zzso by different zzso zzso the levels of zzso zzso by zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso prevented cell survival more efficiently than the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that even closely related zzso induce the synthesis of different, opposing transcripts from the zzso zzso When using these drugs for cancer therapy, the increased levels of zzso zzso may augment its gain of function and thus favor unwanted zzso and tumor zzso
