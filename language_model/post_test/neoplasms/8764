zzso drug delivery vehicles with low zzso and toxicity are needed for cancer zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso by most cell types, can deliver zzso such as zzso zzso to tumor tissue in zzso nude zzso To reduce zzso and zzso mouse immature zzso cells zzso were used for zzso zzso zzso targeting was facilitated by engineering the zzso to express a zzso zzso membrane protein zzso fused to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso were loaded with zzso via zzso with an zzso efficiency of up to zzso zzso zzso showed highly efficient targeting and zzso delivery to zzso zzso breast cancer cells in zzso as demonstrated by zzso imaging and flow zzso zzso injected targeted zzso delivered zzso specifically to tumor zzso leading to zzso of tumor growth without overt zzso Our results suggest that zzso modified by targeting zzso can be used zzso for the delivery of zzso to tumors, thus having great potential value for clinical zzso
