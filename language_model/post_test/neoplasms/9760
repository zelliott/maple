It is well established that zzso of target cell responses to hormonal stimulation can occur through variation of the number of effective hormone receptors per zzso Recent experimental evidence suggests that an alternative or additional zzso mechanism may operate via zzso by the cell of zzso which can bind to, and thereby zzso the concentration of free hormone in the zzso zzso We present here a brief general analysis of this zzso model, together with an example which shows that it can readily account for the phenomenon of zzso growth seen in many zzso in response to sustained hormonal zzso The biological significance of the model is discussed, and the close zzso with zzso regulation pointed zzso Finally, two important implications are considered, for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
