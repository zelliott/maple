A partial deletion of the zzso zzso region, zzso the overlapping zzso zzso has been described for the incorporation of therapeutic genes in zzso zzso zzso This deletion allows the zzso of up to zzso zzso genetic material into the virus and ensures strong expression of zzso without reducing the replication and zzso potency of viruses in zzso zzso and zzso proteins are involved in avoiding recognition and elimination of infected cells by the host immune zzso zzso we have studied the effect of this deletion on the replication and zzso expression of the virus in zzso models based on Syrian zzso zzso were established by zzso injection of pancreatic cancer cells with moderate zzso zzso or low zzso zzso for zzso zzso The zzso human zzso 5 zzso or a modified version containing the zzso gene in the zzso locus zzso were injected zzso We found that elimination of zzso was faster than zzso in zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, no differences were observed when the same tumor was established in severely zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso expression was more stable in these zzso These results suggest that the lack of zzso genes may accelerate the clearance of zzso zzso in some zzso tumor zzso
