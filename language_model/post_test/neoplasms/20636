Only zzso studies and most of the prospective cohort studies showed a reduction of zzso cancer zzso in regular aspirin zzso Nevertheless, the minimum effective doses of aspirin and the duration of therapy remain zzso To date, only one prospective zzso trial has evaluated the influence of aspirin in the prevention of zzso zzso Despite the inclusion of 22,000 subjects and a five-year zzso aspirin failed to show any zzso The mechanism of the potential role of aspirin in preventing cancer, primarily supposed to rely on the zzso effect, is now under zzso Few studies have evaluated the prevention of other zzso such as breast or lung zzso by zzso Data remain too sparse to allow any zzso 

The role of aspirin in the prevention of zzso cancer still needs further studies, such as a prospective zzso study, which should be conducted in a high-risk zzso
