zzso is the first potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso to reach clinical zzso In the majority of solid tumor cell lines and zzso zzso zzso cell cycle arrest and tumor growth zzso This is reflected in clinical zzso across multiple Phase II trials there are zzso of patients with prolonged stable disease, although few responses have been zzso zzso displays zzso zzso zzso with chemotherapy zzso These effects are most marked when chemotherapy precedes zzso In the case of zzso agents that impose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso leading to inappropriate persistence of its activity, inducing zzso zzso This mechanism has been exploited in a Phase I trial of sequential zzso and zzso that has produced promising zzso zzso is also synergistic with zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso exit from an abnormal zzso associated with zzso cell death and reduces the zzso of zzso preventing its stabilization and the cellular protection it zzso after zzso zzso The sequential combination of zzso and zzso has been investigated in a Phase I trial in patients with advanced zzso cell lung cancer, and a zzso Phase II study is under zzso zzso schedules of zzso used prolonged continuous infusions that produced zzso levels of drug thought to be capable of achieving zzso zzso based on results in tumor cell zzso Recently, it has been discovered that zzso zzso are likely to be more effective, and shorter infusions that achieve a higher zzso have now been zzso zzso followed by maintenance infusions are also under development, designed to achieve sustained zzso drug zzso Clinical trials remain complicated by the absence of zzso end points to confirm target zzso
