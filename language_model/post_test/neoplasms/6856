African Americans have higher cancer mortality rates than zzso zzso the relative contribution of cancer zzso stage at diagnosis and survival after diagnosis to the racial gap in life expectancy has important implications for directing future health disparity interventions toward cancer zzso screening and zzso 

We estimated the degree to which higher cancer mortality among African Americans is due to higher zzso rates, later stage at diagnosis or worse survival after zzso 

zzso model of cancer zzso and survival after zzso

Life expectancy if African Americans had the same cancer zzso stage and survival after diagnosis as white zzso 

African-American men and women live zzso and zzso fewer years, respectively, than whites as the result of all zzso zzso Among men, racial differences in cancer zzso stage at diagnosis and survival after diagnosis account for zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso years of the racial gap in life zzso zzso Among women, zzso stage and survival after diagnosis account for zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso years, zzso zzso in stage had a smaller impact on the life expectancy gap compared with the impact of zzso zzso in cancer survival after diagnosis had a significant impact for only two zzso zzso years; zzso zzso zzso to zzso and prostate zzso years; zzso zzso zzso to zzso 

In addition to breast and zzso cancer zzso national efforts to reduce disparities in life expectancy should also target cancer zzso perhaps through smoking zzso and differences in survival after diagnosis among persons with breast and prostate zzso
