zzso zzso was employed for the study of the early zzso of normal and zzso rat cells seeded upon the zzso zzso Lewis rat zzso zzso and two zzso zzso lines, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Although all cells were zzso of approximately the same size, differences in their subsequent zzso was zzso zzso cells showed minimal surface zzso produced zzso towards the side slopes of the groove only and migrated after the reliable attachment had been established, even in the zzso form, directly off the zzso Some zzso cells showed increased surface zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was attempted at the side slopes of the groove only with subsequent migration from the zzso zzso of zzso in comparison with normal zzso was less directional as they eventually returned to the groove zzso zzso cells were seen already scattered around the bottom of the groove in the zzso form with zzso zzso zzso of the whole cell was observed which is suspected to cause their displacement off the groove by elastic rebounding from each other just after zzso They completed spreading into a zzso form within an hour and a half after seeding, even at the bottom of the zzso zzso treatment did not substantially alter migration of either cells off the zzso zzso coating of the zzso surface with carbon strengthened zzso zzso Thus the diminished zzso of the surface at the bottom of the groove and its particular geometrical zzso make the zzso in the direction parallel to the groove bottom less accessible to contacts with the cell zzso These factors together with different zzso and organization of zzso structures of zzso cells appeared to be responsible for their decreased migration from the zzso
