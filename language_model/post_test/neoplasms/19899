zzso signaling networks are believed to determine cancer zzso Although cancer patient zzso was reported to correlate with the zzso connectivity of the signaling networks inspired by theoretical studies on the increase of network zzso due to the zzso zzso other theoretical and data zzso studies suggest an alternative explanation: the impact of modular organization of networks on biological zzso or adaptation to changing zzso In this study, thus, we evaluate whether the zzso hypothesis is zzso to cancer using network zzso We focus on 14 specific cancer types whose molecular signaling networks are available in databases, and show that modular organization of cancer signaling networks is associated with the patient survival zzso In particular, the zzso with less modular signaling networks are more zzso This result is consistent with a prediction from the zzso zzso Furthermore, we show that the network zzso is a better zzso of the patient survival rate than the zzso zzso However, these results do not contradict the importance of the zzso zzso Rather, they provide new and different insights into the relationship between cellular networks and cancer zzso Despite several limitations of data analysis, these findings enhance our understanding of zzso and evolutionary mechanisms of cancer zzso
