Exposure of zzso tumor cell strain zzso chronic zzso zzso cell strain zzso and African zzso normal kidney cell strain zzso to high energy shock waves resulted in zzso changes and a reduction in cell viability as determined by zzso incorporation zzso and zzso zzso was the most sensitive while zzso was the most resistant to the high energy shock zzso By zzso using anti zzso zzso described zzso in the S phase was found to be inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso revealed destruction of zzso over the cell surface and swollen zzso in zzso and zzso These effects were related to the number of high energy shock wave zzso Our study demonstrates that a high energy shock wave has an zzso effect in zzso
