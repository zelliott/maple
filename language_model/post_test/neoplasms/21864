To present a summary of the lifestyle, genetic origin, diet, and disease in the population of zzso indigenous people of northern zzso 

A survey of the available scientific literature and preliminary results from our own study of the Swedish Sami zzso 

The Sami probably have a zzso genetic origin, with a major contribution of zzso or Eastern European tribes and a smaller contribution from zzso The traditional Sami diet, high in animal products, persists in Sami groups still involved with zzso zzso but others have adopted a diet typical of Western zzso Early reports indicated a lower prevalence of heart disease and most zzso except stomach zzso Recent studies have not found a lower risk of heart disease, but have consistently shown an overall reduced cancer zzso Sami have been reported to share some specific zzso genetic zzso with other European zzso but none that would explain the observed differences in disease zzso 

The genetic structure of the Sami population makes it suitable for studies of the genetic and environmental factors influencing the development of common zzso The difference in zzso of heart disease between studies may reflect the ongoing transition from a traditional to a more zzso zzso The ability to compare population segments with different zzso combined with the genetic structure of the population, creates unusual possibilities for studies of the genetic and environmental factors involved in the development of common zzso
