This study aimed to evaluate the ability of the health food supplement zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso effects of chemotherapy on bone zzso function as a model for cancer zzso Mice were treated with zzso (17 zzso body zzso one day before oral administration of a zzso extract of zzso zzso zzso zzso that was given daily for 3 zzso White blood cell counts in peripheral blood of mice receiving zzso were at 50% of normal levels on day 28 but had recovered completely in mice treated with zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso enhanced the zzso ability of both zzso zzso colony forming unit zzso and zzso cells from bone zzso preparations and promoted the differentiation of bone zzso zzso zzso cells into zzso alkaline zzso zzso and bone zzso This result could be attributed to enhanced expression of zzso zzso binding factor a) and zzso zzso zzso zzso with concurrent suppression of zzso zzso differentiation zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso In zzso zzso enhances recovery of mice from zzso caused by zzso zzso It appears to do so by protecting both zzso zzso cells directly and the bone zzso stem cell niche through its effects on zzso zzso
