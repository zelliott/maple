The association between the use of calcium channel zzso zzso and cancer has received ample attention, but is still zzso In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that the observed association between zzso and cancer in earlier studies could be explained by residual zzso or by zzso of exposure because of the use of zzso data on drug zzso Data from the Rotterdam zzso a prospective zzso cohort study in the municipal area zzso were zzso The study population consisted of a cohort of zzso participants aged 71 years or older who were followed from a baseline interview in the period zzso for the occurrence of incident zzso Data on drug use were gathered at baseline and through the seven community pharmacies which served the zzso region during the study period between 1 January 1991 and 1 January zzso zzso cancer events were gathered from a nationwide registry of zzso data and from a zzso cancer zzso in the Rotterdam zzso We performed three zzso First, we followed the method, and adjusted for the same risk factors, as in the earlier zzso In the second analysis, we included all risk factors that were zzso associated with cancer in the Rotterdam zzso In the third analysis, we included exposure to zzso as zzso zzso while adjusting for potential zzso The relative risk zzso of cancer associated with zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the first analysis and lowered to zzso zzso zzso zzso upon adjustment for the different zzso in the zzso In both zzso however, zzso was significantly associated with cancer with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, whereas no associations were found with the other zzso in this study, zzso zzso and zzso A significantly increased risk of cancer was found for intermediate daily doses of zzso and zzso zzso of other zzso such as zzso agents, zzso and zzso was not associated with zzso In the third analysis with exposure to zzso as zzso zzso the risk increase was zzso for use of 2 years or less, zzso zzso zzso zzso and for use for a cumulative period of more than 2 years, zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in all models the hazard ratio was statistically significantly increased for zzso but not for zzso and zzso On the basis of these zzso we found no increase in cancer in users of zzso and zzso nor in users of other zzso In line with earlier studies, however, we found an increased risk of cancer in users of zzso At zzso with the conclusions from several other studies, we think that it is too early to conclude that zzso are not associated with zzso
