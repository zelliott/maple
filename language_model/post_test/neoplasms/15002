Of the many heat shock proteins zzso zzso appears to correlate best with heat resistance, either permanent or zzso We have investigated various approaches to zzso the concentration of zzso and examined the relationship between zzso and zzso zzso sensitivity during the development and zzso of zzso in model zzso Specifically, experiments were performed to determine the possibility of using the rate of synthesis of zzso after a second test heat shock to predict the zzso of zzso in tumor cells in zzso and in animal tumor zzso We found that the zzso ability to zzso zzso synthesis in response to the test heat shock zzso correlated with retained zzso These data suggest the level of zzso in zzso cells regulates the rate of synthesis of additional zzso in response to the subsequent heat zzso Furthermore, the results showed that the rate of zzso of zzso synthesis after a test heat shock can be used as a rapid measure of retained zzso This study suggests an approach for zzso the level of retained zzso during zzso zzso
