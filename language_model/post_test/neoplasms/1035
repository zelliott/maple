zzso zzso zzso are found in only zzso of families with the zzso syndrome zzso and with an even lower frequency in families suggestive of zzso but not meeting clinical criteria of the zzso Despite intense efforts, to date, no other genes have been associated with the disorder in a significant number of zzso zzso zzso A search for defects in zzso other than zzso zzso zzso showed that neither zzso zzso nor sequence zzso in the zzso promoter are frequent in zzso and zzso deletions have been found to be responsible for zzso only in several zzso Another cancer predisposition syndrome, zzso zzso colon cancer, has been associated with zzso zzso of one zzso of the zzso or zzso zzso This prompted us to test the zzso of the zzso gene promoter in a set of 14 families suggestive of zzso using zzso sequencing of three DNA fragments from the zzso region of the zzso We found no zzso zzso at any of the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso of the zzso promoter is not a frequent cause of the disorder in families suggestive of zzso but with no zzso zzso in the coding part of the zzso
