No markers are currently available to indicate the zzso profile of a specific zzso disease nor to predict response to zzso zzso Nevertheless, many different zzso drugs are presently being tested in many clinical trials, with an obvious zzso of useful zzso for treatment outcome beside zzso By means of a quantitative reverse zzso approach, we measured zzso zzso zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2 and zzso zzso in the blood of 14 healthy controls, 3 pregnant women, and 84 newly diagnosed (or zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased in pregnant women and cancer patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was particularly increased in patients affected by zzso zzso and decreased to normal values in patients achieving complete zzso zzso circulating zzso levels of other zzso or zzso zzso markers zzso vascular zzso growth factor zzso 2, and zzso were not significantly increased in either pregnant women or cancer zzso zzso of various surrogate zzso markers indicated a switch toward increased plasma vascular zzso growth factor zzso levels, viable circulating zzso cells, and circulating zzso zzso levels in patients affected by zzso zzso Taken together, our data indicate that the quantitative evaluation of circulating zzso zzso is a specific and highly promising tool with which to investigate the zzso zzso of cancer zzso
