Based on the primer binding site for zzso human zzso zzso zzso have been classified as zzso family members, zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso family was expressed in human zzso zzso We investigated pol fragments of zzso family in various human zzso and cancer zzso The pol gene was expressed in human zzso only among zzso zzso zzso zzso heart, zzso liver, zzso zzso skeletal muscle, zzso zzso zzso but detected in various cancer cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso except for zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and sequencing data of the 37 clones imply that the pol gene of zzso family is active in cancer cells, which may have potential role related to cancer zzso
