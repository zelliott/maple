Cancer cells with elevated levels of zzso and related survival proteins are broadly resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso and more recently small zzso zzso for zzso and zzso are directly zzso or synergistic with standard zzso agents, and in some cases, may demonstrate selectivity for tumor zzso The usual issues for rational drug discovery are writ large upon zzso zzso The molecular functions of zzso are not well zzso such that validation of zzso mechanisms related to zzso as well as identification of surrogate markers for zzso function are significant obstacles for drug zzso Despite these problems, a substantial number of small molecules that bind to zzso or zzso are now available for zzso zzso in turn, basic studies with these zzso should yield new insights about optimal strategies to disrupt zzso survival zzso
