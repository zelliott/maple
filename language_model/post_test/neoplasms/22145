The zzso zzso is a large zzso protein complex found in the zzso and nucleus of zzso cells which plays a critical role in zzso zzso It has been found that the zzso zzso degrades multiple important zzso which are associated with tumor growth and zzso Emerging evidence demonstrates that zzso zzso is an innovative and effective approach for treating some human zzso zzso (also known as zzso or zzso a specific inhibitor of the zzso zzso has been approved for treating multiple myeloma by the zzso zzso mainly exhibits its zzso effect by inducing zzso and has been found to affect several zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso factor nuclear factor zzso B zzso a key survival factor, is dependent on the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso by zzso has been found to induce zzso in several human cancer cells and is considered to be one of the primary targets of the zzso zzso zzso More recently, studies have suggested that, in addition to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso may induce zzso by stimulating zzso zzso zzso stress through zzso zzso In this review, we will mainly discuss recent progress on the zzso of the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso
