zzso statistics are important for zzso zzso We examine if discrepancies between death certificate zzso and hospital discharge condition zzso indicate certification zzso 

From zzso hospital deaths in Sweden in 1995, we randomly selected 600 zzso where DC and zzso were incompatible, and 600 compatible zzso matched on sex, age, and underlying cause of zzso We obtained case zzso for zzso zzso of zzso Using a structured zzso we assessed the accuracy of zzso 

zzso analysis indicated diagnostic group and zzso or zzso as the variables that most affected the zzso zzso zzso zzso had the highest accuracy zzso and benign and unspecified tumor zzso the lowest zzso For all diagnostic groups except one, compatible zzso had better accuracy than incompatible zzso The exception, chronic zzso lung disease, had low accuracy for both zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso between DC and zzso indicates a greater risk of certification zzso For some diagnostic groups, however, zzso are often inaccurate even when DC and zzso are zzso By requesting additional information on incompatible cases and all deaths in high-risk diagnostic groups, producers of mortality statistics could improve the accuracy of the zzso
