Cancer stem cells zzso comprise a minor cell population in a zzso however, they possess zzso capacity and are responsible for tumor recurrence and the emerging issue of tumor zzso Despite recent advances in the study of zzso and mechanisms of zzso disease recurrence and zzso resistance, many questions remain zzso 

To provide an overview of zzso theory and to describe major methods of zzso detection and isolation, with the emphasis on those techniques that are potentially relevant in clinical laboratory zzso zzso attention is given to zzso zzso such as cancer zzso zzso which could become promising targets in the development of zzso in settings of minimal residual zzso 

The review is based on analysis of zzso literature cited in zzso as well as preliminary results of studies conducted in our zzso 

Despite a lack of consensus in the scientific community on research methodology, zzso have demonstrated significant potential as therapeutic targets in the treatment of zzso Further research of zzso biology and markers will eventually lead to the development of novel therapeutic approaches for targeting these cells to treat resistant and zzso tumors and minimal residual zzso
