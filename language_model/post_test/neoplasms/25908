On the basis of their known fine zzso we evaluated the zzso marker qualities of two zzso zzso zzso defining the zzso zzso zzso Gal beta 1-3 zzso This zzso is expressed in certain tumors in correlation with prognosis and zzso The zzso of one of these zzso zzso depends on clustered zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso while the zzso zzso been characterized to bind specifically to zzso zzso linked to a motif within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents an interesting tool for the identification of zzso zzso of zzso which are involved in tumor progression and zzso but also in the recognition of tumor cells by zzso T zzso As references the zzso zzso from peanut zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso The binding patterns of these zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a significantly stronger zzso than zzso zzso especially in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso receptors exhibited an expression in the majority of all cancer types, with the exception of zzso and zzso These results can be explained by the broader fine zzso of the zzso Furthermore, a strong expression of zzso zzso zzso is indicated by the zzso pattern of zzso zzso The marker qualities of both zzso zzso and zzso are combined in the binding specificity of zzso and hence this zzso may have a high impact for the zzso of these zzso zzso
