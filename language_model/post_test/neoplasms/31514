A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was reported to zzso all four natural zzso as well as several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The broad zzso specificity of this zzso together with a high zzso rate makes it unique among the zzso zzso We have in the present study cloned the zzso zzso expressed the zzso protein in zzso coli, and characterized the zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso and clinically important zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso was also efficiently zzso zzso is closely related to human and zzso zzso virus zzso zzso The highest level of sequence similarity was noted with human zzso zzso zzso 2, and these zzso also share many zzso The zzso cloning and characterization of zzso will be the basis for studies on the use of this zzso zzso zzso as a suicide gene in combined zzso of zzso
