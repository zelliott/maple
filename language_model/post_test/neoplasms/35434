The fragile zzso zzso zzso gene was discovered and proposed as a tumor zzso gene for most human zzso It encodes the most active common human zzso fragile region, zzso We studied the prevalence of loss of zzso expression in various tumors and correlated its loss with various zzso zzso 

To determine whether the absence of zzso expression zzso with clinical variables such as grade, stage, and survival time, we assessed zzso expression using zzso More than 1,800 tumors from more than 75 tumor categories were analyzed by zzso in a tissue zzso zzso 

Loss of zzso expression ranged from zzso in zzso tumors to zzso in lung zzso Clinical and zzso features like grade, stage, tumor size, and zzso zzso zzso showed correlation with loss of zzso expression in some zzso No difference was seen in the survival patterns and loss of zzso expression in any of the tumor groups zzso 

Loss of zzso expression is an ubiquitous event in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may be altered at different stages in different types of zzso Most of the tumors with a wider prevalence of loss of zzso expression as an early event show a correlation with zzso zzso However, in some of the tumors, zzso expression is lost as a late event and is only seen in a fraction of the zzso
