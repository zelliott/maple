A number of new approaches are currently being investigated throughout the world which aim at the better simulation of zzso by different zzso However it must be accepted that a remarkable difference exists between the positive results obtained with zzso in experimental tumor systems and current clinical zzso It is suggested that the treatment of zzso zzso and zzso of cancer could be a more rational aim for the application of zzso than the treatment of advanced zzso zzso This hypothesis is based primarily on the theoretical understanding of the immune system as a biological mechanism whose zzso function is to eliminate zzso zzso cells when they occur as regular biological events during cell zzso zzso should be considered first of all as zzso for the maintenance and restoration of cellular and tissue zzso
