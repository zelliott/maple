The first part of this contribution reviews the current knowledge about zzso and zzso actions of zzso These biological actions are exerted according to zzso zzso and zzso modes of action and involve five distinct types of membrane receptors belonging to the zzso of zzso zzso A new concept concerning a zzso mode of action has recently been introduced to refer to the intervention of zzso and growth factors in zzso zzso zzso The evidence in favor of zzso actions of zzso will be presented in the second part of this review and illustrated by our own results on zzso T interactions in the immune system and zzso cell interactions in zzso zzso Another phenomenon such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulting in zzso (with characteristics different from those of each of the two receptors forming the zzso is also at the origin of a novel mode of zzso zzso The latter will be illustrated by the data obtained on human zzso zzso with zzso zzso specific for either zzso or relevant individual zzso The arguments in favor of the analogous mode of actions among different families of chemical zzso such as zzso zzso and growth factors are discussed in the concluding zzso The emerging unifying concepts on such functional analogies might provide a useful basis for the development of synthetic zzso not only for zzso peptides but also for other types of chemical zzso
