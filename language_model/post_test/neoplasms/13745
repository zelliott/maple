zzso a well-known dietary zzso derived from zzso zzso has been shown to be a potent zzso zzso and zzso zzso The present study was designed to investigate the zzso potential of zzso against a range of human tumor cell lines in an attempt to understand its mechanism of action, which may lead to its possible therapeutic zzso We have shown that different cancer cell lines differ in their sensitivity to zzso Cell lines established from zzso like zzso breast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso underwent zzso in the presence of zzso whereas cell lines from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed resistance to the zzso effects of zzso zzso of the cancer cell lines to zzso correlated with the generation of zzso zzso as determined by the reduction of zzso zzso zzso tumor cell lines showed significantly higher production of zzso thus mounting a stress response and protecting the cells from the zzso cell zzso These observations yield clues toward understanding the regulation of the cell death machinery by the stress zzso Interestingly, zzso had no effect on zzso cell lines, which showed neither zzso generation nor the induction of a stress zzso These observations demonstrate that zzso is an interesting zzso with varied actions, depending on the cell zzso
