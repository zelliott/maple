In the last decade intensive research has confirmed the long standing hypothesis that some zzso point zzso acquire novel activities able to cooperate with zzso zzso zzso attention has attracted the ability of several such zzso to actively promote the development of aggressive and zzso tumors in zzso This knowledge opens a new dimension on rational therapy design, suggesting novel strategies based on pharmacological manipulation of those zzso zzso zzso point zzso have several characteristics that make them attractive targets for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been found predominantly in tumor cells and may act zzso by interfering with a variety of cellular zzso zzso drugs targeting zzso zzso may selectively affect tumor cells, zzso simultaneously several mechanisms of tumor zzso Moreover, the high frequency of zzso zzso on the zzso gene suggests that interfering with zzso zzso function may provide a valuable approach for the development of efficient therapies able to target a wide range of tumor zzso
