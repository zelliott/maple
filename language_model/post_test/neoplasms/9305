The aims of the study were to examine the responsiveness of Chinese versions of the Cancer zzso zzso zzso the Schwartz Cancer zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso based on effect sizes and patient perceptions of zzso 

zzso sampling was used to recruit subjects at a chemotherapy treatment center for zzso in zzso Data were collected twice: on the day cancer patients were receiving chemotherapy treatment zzso and 2 days zzso zzso 

zzso were complete at zzso by 148 subjects zzso The differences between zzso and zzso were statistically significant for all three zzso The effect sizes, ranging from a medium to a large change for the zzso zzso and zzso were reported based on four groups zzso no increase, small increase, moderate increase, and large zzso zzso zzso equations were used to compare the fatigue scores based on the four groups by controlling for the fatigue level at baseline and the time zzso The results indicate that the fatigue scores after 2 days of treatment in the three zzso groups were statistically significantly larger than in the zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso fatigue level in the zzso zzso group was significantly higher than in the other three zzso 

zzso indicate that the three scales are sensitive to change over 2 zzso However, the three scales may not effectively discriminate between a moderate and large zzso zzso further testing on cancer patients with severe fatigue to examine responsiveness to detect minimal important differences for the three scales is zzso
