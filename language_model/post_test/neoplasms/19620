Since zzso is a zzso zzso process, involving zzso cell death and zzso mechanisms, during the zzso zzso zzso zzso must be based on understanding the zzso of each zzso Prevention of each phase could reduce the risk to zzso Because reducing the initiation phase to a zero level is impossible, the most effective intervention would be at the promotion zzso Assuming the zzso cells for zzso are the zzso stem cells and their early zzso or transit cells, zzso strategies for zzso the promotion of these two types of zzso zzso cells will require different zzso A hypothesis will be proposed that involves stem cells, which lack gap zzso zzso communication zzso or their early zzso daughter cells, which express zzso and are zzso if zzso will be promoted by agents that either inhibit zzso negative growth regulators or by zzso of zzso zzso agents to each of these two types of initiated cells must have different mechanisms of zzso Assuming stem cells are target cells for zzso an alternative method of zzso would be to reduce the stem cell zzso zzso promoter zzso agents, such as green tea zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso that either zzso zzso in stem cells or prevent the down regulation of zzso by tumor promoters in early zzso cells, will be zzso Human zzso stem cell systems, that can be induced to form zzso zzso structures, will be discussed as a more realistic model system to screen for relevant zzso zzso
