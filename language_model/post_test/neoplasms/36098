Patients with zzso zzso disease zzso have elevated cancer zzso Cancer risk increases with age, but associations of zzso with specific zzso are incompletely studied for older zzso 

We conducted a zzso zzso study zzso cancer and zzso zzso among the zzso elderly using zzso linked zzso We defined zzso as presence of dialysis claims in the zzso prior to zzso 

Although zzso was not associated with excess cancer risk overall zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso risk was specifically increased for zzso of the stomach zzso zzso small zzso zzso zzso colon zzso zzso liver zzso zzso zzso tract zzso zzso lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso kidney zzso zzso and for multiple myeloma zzso zzso and chronic zzso leukemia zzso zzso The association between liver cancer and zzso was attenuated upon adjustment for zzso B and C infection or diabetes zzso Multiple myeloma risk was highest with short zzso duration zzso possibly reflecting reverse zzso while kidney cancer risk showed a borderline rise over time zzso 

Among elderly individuals with zzso the excess risks for some zzso may reflect immune dysfunction or a high prevalence of other risk factors, such as viral infections or diabetes zzso Our results underscore the need for studying biological pathways of zzso in zzso
