zzso observations made during routine examination of eye movement functions zzso zzso reveal that very slow, zzso eye movements in cancer patients are zzso To zzso measure such movements, a zzso system was built to allow analysis of very slow, zzso eye movements zzso degrees zzso Analysis involves zzso of drift and zzso gaze movements that cause zzso in gaze direction from the predicted zzso zzso zzso observed in cancer patients are compared to those for the normal zzso Our results show that zzso are more important in cancer patients than in the normal zzso The difference is statistically significant zzso for zzso ranging between zzso degrees and zzso degrees zzso In the future, the system may possibly be used in the diagnosis of zzso
