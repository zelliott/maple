zzso zzso are low molecular weight proteins present both in normal and in zzso zzso They represent the main mechanism of the cell which protects it from action of heavy metal zzso and the principal zzso zzso zzso act as controllers of zzso zzso zzso zzso in cell proliferation zzso The latter is of basic significance also in zzso zzso Despite the relatively short period of studies on the role of zzso in zzso zzso several data confirm their zzso zzso Such data have been obtained in studies on expression of the proteins in breast, zzso urinary zzso zzso zzso and lung zzso zzso are thought to play certain role in zzso as indicated by results of studies on zzso tumors of large zzso liver and zzso The frequently noted positive correlation between zzso expression and the expression of zzso and zzso zzso points to role of the proteins in the cell proliferation zzso zzso collected and discussed in present paper, obtained by various authors and related to the role of zzso expression in cells of various zzso tumors suggest a potential for using the protein as a zzso factor in zzso zzso
