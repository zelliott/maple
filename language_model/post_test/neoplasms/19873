To demonstrate a zzso zzso strategy based on the spatial distribution of zzso in previously treated zzso The result is a quantitative way to define a dose prescription function, zzso the predicted local control at constant treatment zzso A dose planning study using the zzso dose prescription in 20 patients is zzso 

Patients treated at our center have five tumor zzso from the center of the tumor zzso positive zzso and out zzso The spatial distribution of 48 failures in patients with complete clinical response after zzso is used to derive a model for tumor control probability zzso The total zzso is fixed to the clinically observed zzso zzso zzso at five zzso Additionally, the authors match the distribution of failures between the five zzso to the observed zzso The zzso of the zzso is extracted from the literature and the authors assume zzso and zzso risk of zzso involvement in the zzso zzso The result is a zzso dose response model matching the observed distribution of zzso The model is used to zzso the distribution of dose in individual patients, while keeping the treatment intensity constant and the maximum prescribed dose below 85 zzso 

The vast majority of failures occur centrally despite the small volumes of the central zzso Thus, zzso the dose prescription yields higher doses to the central target volumes and lower doses to the zzso zzso The dose planning study shows that the modified prescription is clinically zzso The zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso as compared to the observed zzso of zzso 

The observed distribution of zzso failures was used to derive an objective, zzso dose prescription zzso The zzso dose is predicted to result in a substantial increase in local control without increasing the predicted risk of zzso
