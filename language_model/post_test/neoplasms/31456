zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the key zzso involved in the complex interactions between the zzso zzso and zzso second zzso zzso Currently, three genes zzso zzso and alternate zzso of these genes gives rise to functionally different zzso which exhibit distinct zzso and regulatory zzso Some zzso have similar kinetic and zzso properties but are zzso regulated by zzso and zzso These zzso also differ in their mechanism of regulation by zzso Analysis of various regulatory reactions involving zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso has revealed the importance of the time dependence of these reactions during cell zzso however, no measurement is available for the time of occurrence of specific regulatory zzso zzso systems provide a pivotal zzso for achieving zzso regulation by various zzso zzso It has been proposed that zzso sequences enriched in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso known as zzso zzso serve as putative zzso signals for rapid zzso degradation by zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso that regulate various zzso zzso factors and structural proteins through limited zzso zzso zzso has a zzso motif and acts as a zzso for zzso In this paper, we have described zzso regulation by zzso and its zzso zzso zzso is an important component of the signal zzso zzso and plays an integral role in various zzso processes such as gene transcription, various zzso functions, cardiac muscle contraction, vascular relaxation, cell proliferation and a host of other zzso It is important to identify the cellular processes where zzso zzso and zzso response are zzso This will lead to better understanding of the pathology of disease states and development of novel zzso The different zzso zzso although similar in kinetic properties, can be distinguished by various pharmacological zzso Our recent understanding of the role of zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso agents are described in this zzso The exact function of zzso zzso in various zzso processes is not clear because most of the studies have been carried out in zzso therefore, it is essential that further research be directed to in zzso zzso
