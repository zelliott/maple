zzso by the Office of International zzso National Cancer Institute zzso the zzso Workshop on zzso zzso in zzso was held in March zzso The workshop was related to a task force launched by the International Society for the Biological zzso of Cancer zzso and the United States Food and Drug Administration zzso to identify strategies for zzso discovery and validation in the field of zzso The effort will culminate on October 28th 2009 in the zzso Workshop on zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso which will be held in Washington DC in association with the Annual zzso The purposes of the zzso workshop were a) to discuss novel approaches to enhance the discovery of zzso and/or zzso markers in cancer zzso b) to define the state of the science in zzso discovery and zzso The participation of Japanese and US scientists provided the opportunity to identify shared or zzso themes across the distinct immune genetic background and the diverse prevalence of disease between the two zzso zzso concepts were zzso enhanced knowledge of zzso pathways was found to be central to the understanding of zzso zzso destruction zzso of which tumor rejection is a representative zzso Although the expression of zzso genes zzso likely mediates the inflammatory process leading to tumor zzso it is insufficient by itself and the associated mechanisms need to be zzso It is likely that zzso immune responses play a broader role in tumor rejection than those strictly related to their zzso zzso their primary role is to trigger an acute and zzso inflammatory response at the tumor site that leads to rejection upon recruitment of additional innate and zzso immune zzso Other candidate systemic and/or zzso zzso were recognized that might be added to the list of known entities zzso in zzso zzso The need for a systematic approach to zzso discovery that takes advantage of powerful zzso technologies was zzso it was clear from the current state of the science that zzso is still in a discovery phase and only a few of the current zzso warrant extensive zzso It was, finally, clear that, while current technologies have almost zzso potential, inadequate study design, limited zzso and zzso among laboratories and zzso zzso of data remain major road zzso The institution of an interactive consortium for high zzso molecular monitoring of clinical trials with voluntary participation might provide cost-effective zzso
