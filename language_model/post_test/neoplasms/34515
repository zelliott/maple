The effects of zzso on natural killer zzso cell zzso against tumor cell targets are not yet fully zzso A more complete understanding of these effects could be important for maximizing the clinical benefits obtained by using zzso for cancer zzso Here, we zzso results in the literature regarding the effects of elevated temperatures on zzso cells and our own recent data on the effects of zzso zzso At treatment temperatures above 40 degrees C, (which is above the zzso body temperatures normally achieved during fever or zzso both enhancing and zzso effects on zzso activity of zzso cells against tumor cells have been zzso Our own results have shown that zzso zzso stress zzso a temperature of zzso degrees zzso enhances human zzso cell zzso against tumor target zzso This effect requires function of the zzso zzso of zzso cells, and is zzso when both zzso and tumor cell targets are zzso zzso heat sensitive cellular targets affected by zzso on tumor cells include heat shock zzso zzso and zzso Class zzso In zzso cells, plasma membrane reorganization may occur after mild heat zzso We conclude this review by listing several unresolved questions that should be addressed for a more complete understanding of the molecular mechanisms which zzso the effects of zzso stress on the function of zzso zzso Altogether, the available data indicate a strong potential for zzso enhancement of zzso cell activity in zzso at least in part, the improved clinical responses seen when zzso is used in combination with other zzso
