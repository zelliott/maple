Combined zzso zzso and hypoxic zzso therapy zzso or zzso have been evaluated with both zzso administered on the same day with only moderate improvement compared with the effects of zzso zzso In a series of studies using oxygen electrodes, zzso and zzso we have demonstrated that zzso zzso a prolonged state of zzso in most tumors, without affecting the zzso levels in normal zzso Using serial zzso zzso through subcutaneous zzso zzso human zzso zzso we established that the median zzso was unrelated to the initial size of the zzso over a range of sizes from zzso to zzso zzso Fourteen days after mice were given a zzso dose of zzso zzso zzso zzso G, their median zzso declined from zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso that accumulates in hypoxic regions, zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso human zzso tumors increased zzso to zzso from day 14 through day 28 zzso but zzso of zzso in zzso tumors remained unchanged after zzso zzso tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not exhibit significant zzso The increase in tumor zzso was also demonstrated visually using zzso zzso of tumor zzso We zzso that sequential delivery of the 2 therapeutic agents, with the hypoxic zzso given 2 weeks after zzso when tumor zzso levels were at their zzso would improve the therapeutic response above either zzso alone or above the 2 agents delivered on the same zzso zzso growth was compared in mice given either zzso or zzso alone, the combined treatment on the same day or with the zzso delivered 14 days after zzso zzso size on day 35 for zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso + zzso were delivered on the same day, tumor size dropped to zzso zzso zzso zzso If zzso was given on day 0 and zzso on day 14, size further declined further to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with same day zzso For zzso tumor size on day 28 for zzso and zzso tumors were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso + zzso were delivered on the same day, size was zzso zzso zzso zzso If zzso was zzso on day 0 and zzso was given on day 14, tumor size was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar results were obtained for zzso but not for zzso zzso Another hypoxic zzso zzso was also more zzso 2 weeks after zzso compared with zzso zzso Thus, information on tumor zzso after zzso therapy could be important for zzso a window of opportunity when the surviving tumor regions are most responsive to hypoxic zzso
