The purpose of many zzso studies is to find the association between gene expression and sample characteristics such as treatment type or sample zzso There has been a surge of efforts developing different methods for zzso the zzso Aside from the high zzso of zzso data, one well recognized challenge is the fact that genes could be zzso zzso thus making many statistical methods inappropriate to use directly on the expression zzso zzso methods such as principal component analysis zzso and zzso are often used as a part of the effort to capture the gene zzso and the derived components or clusters are used to describe the association between gene expression and sample zzso We propose a method for patient population zzso using zzso selected test statistics in combination with the zzso method, which shows favorable zzso The proposed method is compared with a currently zzso zzso
