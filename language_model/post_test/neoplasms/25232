zzso zzso mortality has clinical and financial implications and helps improve the care of patients with advanced cancer and their zzso Models with excellent zzso and reliability are available for mortality prediction in intensive care zzso The purpose of the current study was to determine factors associated with increased likelihood of mortality in an acute zzso care unit zzso 

We zzso reviewed the medical records of 500 patients admitted to the zzso Basic characteristics and information on symptom intensity, vital signs, relevant laboratory tests, and the presence or absence of zzso were obtained from the records of the consultation that preceded the zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses were conducted to compare characteristics of patients who died in the zzso with characteristics of those who were discharged zzso 

Of the 500 patients admitted to the zzso 124 zzso zzso zzso that were jointly zzso for death, using zzso analysis were younger age zzso ratio zzso for older patients zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso admission from another zzso floor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso high blood zzso nitrogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso high heart rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso high zzso rate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and supplemental oxygen use zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

We observed a significant association of certain factors with increased likelihood of zzso death in patients with advanced zzso These findings need to be validated in a larger prospective study to develop a model for predicting zzso mortality for patients with advanced zzso
