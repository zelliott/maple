Cancer is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the USA and despite many recent advances in detection and treatment, over half a million cancer patients in this country will die from their disease each zzso 

Using cancer as a prototype, we provide a conceptual framework to identify and review barriers to optimal zzso care and propose examples of linked process and outcome measures that could be used to evaluate whether standards of optimal zzso care are being zzso 

We propose a conceptual model of zzso care and use this model to review the published literature to identify the key goals of optimal zzso care and zzso existing barriers to optimal zzso zzso We then provide examples of process and outcome measures linked to the goals of optimal zzso care and zzso within the conceptual zzso 

Within all components of care at the zzso attitudes, health care zzso providers, and patients and their zzso are significant barriers to the quality of zzso Some of the most critical barriers to optimal care at the zzso in the USA are limited zzso and coverage of, zzso service zzso poor provider communication and diagnostic zzso limited opportunities for training in zzso care; patient fears and attitudes towards the sick role, and a lack of, or inadequate health zzso zzso patient, zzso and system level measures of the quality of care were guided by goals of optimal zzso care, and focus on communication about prognosis and risks and benefits of treatment, development of clear and informed treatment goals, delivery of services consistent with treatment goals, and promotion of quality of zzso 

At present, there are substantial zzso health care system, zzso and patient barriers to obtaining optimal cancer care at the zzso zzso discussions about appropriate measures of the quality of zzso care are gaining momentum, zzso The proposed process and outcome measures for assessing optimal zzso care use cancer as a prototype, but are broadly zzso to other patient populations with life-threatening zzso
