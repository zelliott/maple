An important goal of zzso therapy zzso for treatment of various zzso is to shorten zzso time and simultaneously enhance zzso zzso Here, we investigated the zzso tissue distribution of and the tumor vascular damage caused by a new zzso zzso in mice with implanted zzso zzso tumor zzso In addition, we performed zzso zzso to evaluate the basic zzso effect of zzso in zzso zzso After administration of zzso the type of cell death was characterized to be zzso and a change in the zzso membrane potential was also observed within zzso On the other hand, tumor growth was remarkably retarded in zzso in mice that received zzso compared with mice in the control group, which were exposed to light zzso zzso Finally, tumors in some mice nearly zzso The zzso drug reached a maximum concentration approximately 3 h after zzso However, zzso was most effective when there was substantial zzso of zzso in the tumor zzso and in healthy zzso The zzso demonstration provided further evidence of tumor vascular zzso On the basis of these findings, we suggest that zzso with the zzso zzso zzso vascular damage with blood vessel shutdown, in addition to direct killing of tumor cells, in zzso
