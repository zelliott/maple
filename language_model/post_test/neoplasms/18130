zzso zzso 1 zzso is a key regulator in many zzso cellular zzso and is often zzso in zzso Several studies have identified zzso as a potentially important target for zzso zzso The low molecular weight compound zzso zzso zzso binds zzso and zzso zzso zzso Here we found that zzso also targets zzso by zzso zzso followed by zzso of its activity in zzso and by zzso of zzso activity in cancer zzso Interestingly, a novel approximately 130 zzso form of zzso presumably representing a stable zzso linked zzso and an increased generation of zzso oxygen species zzso were induced by zzso in cancer cells in a zzso zzso Similarly, the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso induced zzso related to zzso stress, but independently of zzso and without apparent induction of the approximately 130 zzso form of zzso In contrast to the effects observed in cancer cells, zzso did not inhibit zzso or zzso formation in normal zzso zzso The zzso of zzso can sensitize tumor cells to agents that induce zzso stress and may directly trigger cell zzso Thus, our results suggest that a unique zzso effect of zzso on zzso in cancer cells might zzso with zzso induction of zzso genes and zzso stress, thereby leading to a robust induction of cancer cell death, without affecting zzso zzso
