zzso of response of tumor tissue to radiation clearly zzso Major parameters include zzso type, size zzso of tumor rescue units zzso zzso zzso cell proliferation zzso and immune rejection reaction by zzso Further, normal and presumably tumor tissue response is altered in certain genetic diseases, zzso zzso zzso Any assessment of response of tumor tissue to a new treatment method or the testing of a new clinical response predictor is zzso based upon a narrow zzso zzso uniform with respect to known parameters of response, zzso size, zzso zzso Even among tumors of such a clinically defined narrow zzso there will be residual zzso with respect to inherent cellular radiation sensitivity, zzso of zzso zzso cell proliferation zzso The value of a response predictor of an individual tumor will be determined by the zzso of values for these and or other characteristics and by the zzso of variation zzso of the measured values of the individual zzso zzso of one or more parameters of response is reflected in the slope of the dose response curve for local control, zzso the greater the zzso the less steep the zzso To examine for this effect, the slope of dose response zzso for control of model tumors of zzso tumor rescue units zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso fraction after a single dose of 2 zzso has been used to assess the impact of zzso and zzso variation of zzso on zzso defined as gamma 50 zzso The gamma 50 is the increase in local control expressed in percent points for a one percentage zzso in dose, at the zzso on the zzso zzso The gamma 50 was zzso for zzso zzso zzso For zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the gamma 50 rapidly decreased to zzso zzso and zzso zzso variation was less important, zzso for zzso of zzso zzso and zzso the gamma 50 values were reduced to zzso zzso and zzso Combining zzso and zzso variation reduced the gamma 50 only slightly below that for zzso variation zzso For example, were the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso variation, the gamma 50 would be zzso as compared to zzso for zzso variation zzso The number of zzso also affects zzso zzso gamma 50 increased from 1 to zzso as the zzso number increased from zzso to zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
