Multiple complications associated with zzso access ports are a common zzso In an effort to define patterns of sequential complications in our community, we undertook a prospective analysis of adult cancer patients in whom a subcutaneous port was zzso 

One hundred zzso consecutive adult cancer patients in whom a subcutaneous port was inserted were observed zzso for the development of zzso 

zzso were identified in 70 of the 91 zzso patients, while sequential complications were identified in 35 patients zzso In aggregate, 121 complications were zzso The zzso effect, the most frequently identified problem, was found to occur disproportionately as a primary complication zzso of 70 versus 26 of 51, P zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso was identified most frequently as a subsequent complication (11 of 51 versus 4 of 70, P zzso The only identified risk factor for the development of zzso complications was the zzso effect, found to be associated with the subsequent development of zzso zzso zzso (9 of 52 versus 2 of 69, P zzso 

Multiple sequential complications of subcutaneous ports are common and occur in a rather predictable zzso The occurrence of zzso zzso zzso in patients with an earlier, relatively minor vascular complication zzso zzso suggests a zzso zzso Insight into complication sequencing may lead to improved strategies for prevention and zzso
