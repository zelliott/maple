zzso in genes of zzso zzso are largely responsible for zzso differences in ability to activate and zzso zzso agents and therefore may influence individual zzso to environmental zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso requires zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso to generate zzso zzso that induce zzso and zzso In the current study, we investigated the role of the zzso zzso and zzso genes in the zzso of zzso using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso aberration zzso as a zzso Our results, using whole blood cultures from 39 volunteers, indicated that zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso induced a zzso increase in the frequency of zzso zzso The potential role of zzso and zzso in zzso genetic damage in cultured human zzso was characterized using specific zzso zzso Treatment of blood cultures with 25 zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso simultaneously with zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso zzso We also studied the role of zzso and zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso induced a significantly higher level of zzso aberration in cells with the zzso zzso zzso compared to cells with the zzso zzso In contrast, no difference in zzso zzso aberration was observed between cells with the zzso extensive zzso compared to cells with the zzso poor zzso zzso These results underscore the important role of zzso zzso genes in influencing the zzso responses to environmental zzso and provide support to the reported findings linking zzso zzso to zzso lung zzso
