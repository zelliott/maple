The current generation of zzso markers have three characteristics that differentiate them from previous zzso These include the ability to detect zzso at zzso at the cellular and molecular level, to detect earlier zzso changes zzso of disease or disease risk, and to identify a detailed zzso of events between an exposure and zzso zzso If zzso are to enhance cancer zzso they must be zzso reliable, and zzso When these characteristics have not been previously demonstrated, pilot studies should be conducted prior to the primary zzso zzso communication and collaboration is required so that useful markers are selected and that collection and zzso zzso and interpretation are zzso The status of many zzso is that they have been developed in the laboratory but lack validation for field zzso zzso of a marker for use in a population requires attention to issues of background zzso sample size, natural history, zzso zzso zzso factors, and zzso zzso Additionally, practical features such as subject preparation, access to zzso zzso storage aspects, and costs must be zzso Ultimately, the use of zzso markers in zzso studies will depend on how well the markers increase ability to reduce zzso provide for better interpretation of zzso associations, and increase opportunities for zzso zzso studies and general research using zzso also have clinical, ethical, and legal zzso These range from zzso uncertainty about the meaning of a marker to the kinds of zzso response that result when groups or individuals are identified as having an zzso marker zzso
