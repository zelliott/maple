The multiple activities of zzso and zzso are modulated by a family of zzso proteins zzso to zzso Although structurally zzso each zzso has unique properties and exerts specific zzso zzso is the most zzso zzso across species and was identified as an essential regulator of zzso processes in bone, kidney and zzso zzso In addition, zzso appears to play a decisive role in the control of proliferation of specific zzso cell zzso In many situations zzso exerts biological activities in the absence of zzso indicating the existence of zzso zzso This concept was supported by the unexpected zzso of zzso in the nucleus and the description of zzso zzso zzso zzso The scope of this review is to zzso the available information about the structure of zzso and the regulation of its zzso Furthermore, the potential significance of zzso in the regulation of zzso processes will be critically zzso in the light of recent experimental zzso
