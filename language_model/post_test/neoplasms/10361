Over the past few years, molecular zzso research has revealed that abnormalities in both zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be identified in tumors and that the interplay between zzso and zzso is zzso involved in the zzso zzso and zzso of human zzso zzso zzso which are among the most studied zzso are small zzso to zzso genes involved in the regulation of zzso and other zzso With the recent findings of zzso involvement in cancer, zzso zzso can be used to treat cancer patients in two ways: zzso by using zzso or DNA molecules as therapeutic drugs against zzso zzso of genes involved in the zzso of zzso and zzso by directly targeting zzso that participate in cancer zzso In this review, we focus on the possible use of zzso or compounds interacting with zzso as new therapeutic agents in cancer zzso
