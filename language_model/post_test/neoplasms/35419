In the present study, we report the synthesis and human growth factor zzso zzso specific tumor targeting properties of a zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso generation five zzso was labeled with zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso The binding and zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso cells was evaluated by flow zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso demonstrated cellular zzso and zzso in zzso cells as compared to free zzso The time course of zzso and blocking experiments with free zzso suggest that the rapid and efficient cellular zzso of the zzso zzso was achieved without zzso in specificity of zzso Animal studies demonstrated that the zzso targets zzso zzso
