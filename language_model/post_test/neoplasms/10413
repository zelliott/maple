This manuscript examines shifts in patterns of cancer zzso among the zzso Nation of Indians zzso for the zzso zzso compared to zzso 

A retrospective cohort design was used to examine cancer zzso among the zzso during 2 time zzso zzso and zzso zzso at risk were multiplied by cancer zzso rates for New York State, exclusive of New York City, over zzso zzso A zzso match with the New York State Cancer zzso was used to identify incident zzso zzso and zzso standardized zzso ratios zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso were calculated for both time zzso 

During the earlier zzso deficits in overall cancer zzso were noted among males zzso zzso 56, zzso zzso and females zzso zzso 71, zzso zzso and for female breast zzso zzso zzso 21, zzso zzso During the more recent zzso deficits in overall cancer zzso persisted among both genders zzso zzso zzso 63, zzso zzso females zzso zzso 67, zzso zzso zzso were also noted among males for zzso of the lung zzso zzso 60, zzso zzso prostate zzso zzso 51, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 17, zzso zzso zzso and among females for breast zzso zzso 33, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 36, zzso zzso zzso No cancer sites demonstrated increased zzso zzso ages zzso years, zzso years, and ages zzso years tended to exhibit deficits in overall zzso 

Despite marked changes over time, deficits in overall cancer zzso have persisted between the time intervals zzso zzso cancer data are important for the development and zzso of comprehensive cancer control plans which align with local zzso
