This paper provides equations for calculating the sample size necessary to test an interaction effect in an 2 zzso k zzso design when zzso is the outcome of zzso The results are a direct extension of those used by George and zzso and zzso and Simon who provide sample size requirements for comparing two and k treatment groups, zzso zzso of a clinical trial concerned with an interaction is calculated using the results of Rubinstein, Gail, and zzso The results in the present paper can also be used to investigate the impact that an unforeseen interaction has on the power to detect a treatment main zzso This impact can be substantial, even for moderate zzso
