Following different types of zzso zzso zzso stem cell transplantation produces a zzso effect in patients with solid zzso We performed a zzso study comparing low intensity conditioning with reduced intensity conditioning after stem cell transplantation to demonstrate the zzso zzso 

zzso stem cell transplantation was performed in 48 patients with zzso zzso cell cancer zzso zzso cancer zzso zzso advanced primary liver cancer after zzso liver transplantation zzso and other solid tumors zzso zzso response was determined based on the international response evaluation criteria for solid tumors zzso 

No significant difference in the zzso of graft rejection was found between the low intensity conditioning and reduced intensity conditioning zzso zzso occurred earlier in the low intensity conditioning group than in the reduced intensity conditioning group zzso 0 zzso 16 days, zzso zzso Complete donor zzso in B cells occurred earlier after low intensity conditioning than after reduced intensity conditioning zzso 28 zzso 97 days, zzso zzso No significant difference in the zzso of tumor response was found between groups receiving the different types of the zzso The most favorable tumor response rate was found in patients who received donor zzso infusions and developed chronic zzso disease zzso zzso zzso zzso The best zzso effect was demonstrated in patients with advanced primary liver cancer who had previously undergone liver transplantation zzso Patients receiving reduced intensity conditioning had a tendency to better overall survival compared to the low intensity conditioning group zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso cell therapy with donor zzso infusion may augment the zzso effect of chronic zzso zzso Patients with limited tumor load are indicated for zzso stem cell transplantation and reduced intensity conditioning may be favorable compared to low intensity zzso
