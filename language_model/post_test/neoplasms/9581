zzso is a common phenomenon in human solid tumors and has been considered as an important, independent negative zzso factor for response to treatment and survival of tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso is the central zzso factor which is activated by zzso and zzso the expression of many genes involved in cell zzso zzso zzso zzso Recently, it has been reported that zzso contributes to tumor zzso by zzso zzso expression under hypoxic zzso Moreover, in hypoxic tumor cells, zzso dependent signal zzso zzso is activated and could be further enhanced by radiation, thereby providing survival signals to adjacent vascular zzso cells by zzso of zzso and zzso and resulting in tumor zzso through vascular zzso Recent research revealed that the stability of zzso one of the two zzso of zzso determines the whole zzso activity and the zzso zzso domain of zzso could reduce zzso activity when zzso in tumor cells by disruption of the assembly of zzso zzso zzso zzso we zzso that fusion with protein zzso zzso would overcome the inability of zzso zzso domain of zzso to cross cellular zzso Thus the zzso fusion proteins could serve as zzso zzso antagonists, function as both zzso of tumor zzso and tumor zzso and would be widely used in clinical settings to improve tumor response to zzso
