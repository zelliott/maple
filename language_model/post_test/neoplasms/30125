The zzso zzso zzso of zzso a tumor zzso zzso has been shown to be a tumor zzso zzso for various types of zzso Because the significance of this zzso to cancer risk has been zzso there are increasing studies investigating zzso in different types of zzso and ethnic zzso However, there is still uncertainty about the level of risk for a variety of zzso 

To resolve the controversial question raised by these studies as of March 2012 and provide more statistical power for detecting the significance of zzso we performed a zzso of 47 zzso studies in 16 types of zzso zzso cases and zzso zzso A zzso model and zzso analysis were employed to identify the source of zzso zzso bias was zzso and sensitivity analysis and cumulative evidence assessment were also zzso 

Using zzso and zzso models, the zzso zzso was more susceptible to zzso cancer compared with the zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso zzso is an zzso risk factor for prostate and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in Asians and Europeans were more susceptible to prostate cancer, whereas their North American counterparts seemed zzso The zzso zzso plays a protective role for Europeans who develop zzso zzso The stability of these observations was confirmed by a one-way sensitivity zzso However, the cumulative evidence for all cancer types was considered zzso using the Venice zzso 

A zzso indicated that the zzso zzso of zzso provides a higher risk for the development of prostate and zzso zzso and a protective role for zzso cancer in an zzso zzso
