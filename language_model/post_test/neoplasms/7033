The zzso zzso is a highly dynamic zzso complex that is comprised of DNA, zzso zzso proteins and zzso and is termed as zzso The dynamic of the zzso is responsible for the regulation of all the zzso phenomena in the zzso Several factors, including the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors and the zzso zzso mediate the zzso zzso modifications that control the zzso fluidity and, zzso the cellular zzso Among these zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in the highly orchestrated zzso The zzso responsible for the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso not only act on zzso zzso but also on zzso zzso zzso of the zzso is associated with various diseases like cancer, diabetes, zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso and neurodegenerative zzso zzso zzso of these zzso is being considered as an important therapeutic zzso Although substantial progress has been made in the area of zzso zzso we have focused this review on the zzso and their zzso zzso in the context of disease and zzso Recent discoveries from different groups have established the involvement of zzso function in various zzso Furthermore, several new classes of zzso zzso have been identified and their biological activities have also been zzso The scaffold of these small molecules can be used for the design and synthesis of better and efficient zzso with superior therapeutic zzso
