To investigate the zzso in zzso use of electrical zzso zzso zzso as a method for observing the zzso zzso responses of a volume of tissue to zzso Here, we studied the zzso response during the development and progression of zzso zzso necrosis in three diverse human zzso 

A zzso cell response sequence was selectively induced in three types of zzso human tumor zzso by applying zzso at zzso degrees zzso The electrical zzso of the tumors was measured from 100 zzso to 10 zzso zzso in zzso during the zzso From the full spectrum zzso ratios between zzso at selected zzso zzso were used as indicators of the changes in the electrical zzso zzso of each zzso cell zzso 

The zzso consistently demonstrated zzso early, rapid increases which coincided with cell and zzso swelling typical of early zzso These increases subsequently slowed, but no decrease began before the end of treatment, unlike zzso similarly treated, zzso zzso mouse zzso This was consistent with the zzso zzso which revealed zzso zzso zzso zzso with no gross plasma membrane damage at the end of zzso The extent of both the necrosis and zzso changes were similar to those seen early in the zzso tumor zzso Within several days after treatment, the zzso volumes zzso nearly completely, suggesting completion of the cell zzso zzso response zzso during this zzso zzso with this, extended zzso zzso over a zzso zzso period allowed tracking of the zzso response sequence through this zzso phase for one type of zzso 

The change in the electrical zzso of a volume of tumor tissue which occurs during and/or after a zzso treatment can be correlated with the extent of necrosis observed zzso in the cell zzso
