To determine whether cardiovascular abnormalities in childhood cancer survivors are restricted to patients exposed to cardiotoxic zzso and cardiac zzso and how risk factors for zzso disease and systemic inflammation contribute to global cardiovascular zzso 

We assessed zzso characteristics and zzso disease risk in 201 survivors of childhood cancer with and without exposure to cardiotoxic treatments at a median of 11 years after diagnosis zzso 3 to 32 zzso and in 76 sibling zzso 

The 156 exposed survivors had below normal left zzso zzso mass, wall zzso zzso and fractional zzso and above normal zzso zzso The 45 zzso survivors also had below normal zzso mass overall, and females had below normal zzso wall zzso zzso and zzso survivors, compared with siblings, had higher levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, v zzso zzso higher mean zzso serum levels of zzso zzso cholesterol zzso and zzso zzso respectively, v zzso zzso higher insulin levels zzso and zzso zzso respectively, v zzso zzso and higher levels of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso respectively, v zzso zzso P zzso zzso for all zzso zzso zzso 30-year risk of zzso zzso stroke, or coronary death was also higher for exposed and zzso survivors compared with siblings zzso and zzso respectively, v zzso P zzso zzso for both zzso 

Childhood cancer survivors not receiving cardiotoxic treatments nevertheless have cardiovascular zzso systemic zzso and an increased risk of zzso zzso zzso guidelines should address cardiovascular concerns, including the risk of zzso disease and systemic zzso in exposed and zzso zzso
