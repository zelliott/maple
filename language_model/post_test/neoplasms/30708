There is much interest in the range of genetic aberrations which occur in human zzso An zzso study has been carried out to investigate the consistency of expression of zzso accumulated zzso protein in paired samples of archival primary and zzso zzso The zzso of zzso tissue from 136 matched pairs of zzso zzso and 20 zzso from other sites was completed using zzso zzso and zzso in a sensitive zzso zzso zzso The majority of zzso cells were positive in zzso and the zzso were negative in zzso of the primary zzso zzso was zzso in the remaining zzso zzso was identical in zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso carried out on 12 matched pairs of the zzso specimens demonstrated that altered zzso of the zzso zzso protein present in a primary zzso was maintained in its zzso These data indicate that zzso in the zzso gene result in a relatively stable zzso and that progression of disease is not usually accompanied by either further zzso or loss of the zzso zzso
