zzso mouse zzso cells cultured in zzso on zzso tumor cell zzso have been previously shown to become specifically zzso and to mediate zzso against the same type of tumor zzso This complete in zzso system of zzso response has been presently used to test the effect of a zzso zzso factor zzso upon the differentiation process leading to the generation of specifically committed zzso Culture media were supplemented with zzso zzso during either the zzso or zzso phase, or both zzso of the zzso Whereas the addition of zzso during both zzso or during zzso only resulted in a significant increase in the zzso index, zzso added during the zzso phase was zzso The behavior of zzso zzso cells and of zzso cells zzso against zzso transplantation zzso remained unmodified by zzso After showing that the entire reaction is zzso by zzso of zzso origin, zzso was directly tested on T or B zzso zzso It was found that only T cells reacted to zzso by an increased zzso capacity, while B cells remained inactive after addition of zzso It was therefore concluded that zzso activates a zzso population of zzso cells, transforming them into fully competent zzso
