Researchers have described a constellation of cognitive deficits zzso zzso in executive functions, working memory, attention, and zzso zzso associated with cancer treatment, and specifically chemotherapy, for zzso nervous system zzso However, findings have been inconsistent, largely because of measurement and study design zzso 

To propose ways for researchers to more clearly delineate and characterize the mild cognitive deficits and related outcomes that appear to affect a subset of cancer patients and suggest methods to make more effective use of the existing data to understand risk factors for impaired zzso zzso 

We examined the literature on the relationship between chemotherapy and cognitive zzso as well as related literature on zzso zzso structural and functional zzso alternative measures of health zzso and zzso data zzso 

A more comprehensive picture of cognitive functioning might be obtained by incorporating nontraditional ecological measures, zzso zzso zzso new zzso methods, and markers of occupational zzso zzso and zzso data zzso techniques potentially could leverage existing data to identify risk factors for cognitive dysfunction and test hypotheses about the zzso of these zzso 

There is a need to apply new research approaches to understand the real-world functional implications of the cognitive side effects of chemotherapy to develop and implement strategies to minimize and zzso these effects before, zzso and after cancer zzso
