A zzso approach to advanced cancer pain management is proposed, based on the clinically perceived anatomical and zzso mechanisms of pain zzso It is an extension of the World Health zzso zzso zzso zzso in which severity of pain is the principal zzso of zzso zzso The zzso categories are: superficial zzso deep zzso visceral and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso component present or zzso zzso of pain to the different categories is based on clinical history, physical findings and investigations to establish the site and extent of active primary or zzso tumor deposits, and evidence of previous response to zzso Drug choice sequence is determined by the dominant pain mechanism judged to be present and not the severity of the zzso In order to describe this approach, mechanisms of pain, disease distribution and drug treatment have been zzso in the first 20 consecutive patients who zzso to enter a zzso pain description and evaluation study on admission to an zzso hospice zzso Despite a high exclusion rate from research standard monitoring due to severity of illness and related factors, the majority of eligible patients approached to enter the study did so, and the pain scoring was well zzso The implications of this for future research and clinical practice are zzso In 6 patients only 1 pain mechanism was identified zzso 4, deep zzso zzso Two mechanisms were present in 8 patients and 3 mechanisms in 6 zzso The deep zzso mechanism was identified in 15 patients, visceral mechanism in 13, zzso in 10 and superficial zzso in zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
