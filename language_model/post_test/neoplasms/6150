The effectiveness of psychological treatment for distress reduction in cancer patients has been frequently studied and reviewed in systematic reviews but reviewer conclusions vary zzso Clear and consistent evidence is needed to assist clinicians and administrators with their zzso We hypothesized that uneven handling of zzso zzso features are at least partly the reason for disagreements and reviewed the literature in this zzso 

A systematic review of 14 published zzso was conducted to determine whether due consideration of zzso variables in zzso treatments permits clearer zzso Quality of the reviews, treatment type, zzso therapist qualities, outcomes at zzso and screening versus not screening for elevated distress were examined as zzso zzso 

Treatment effects are consistently positive but also vary greatly in zzso There is lacking evidence for many important questions, in particular, differential treatment effects for different cancer types and zzso Regarding zzso of outcome, quality of review had no impact on results for depression but including lower quality reviews actually lead to zzso of treatment effects for zzso The most potent negative zzso zzso however, is a floor effect that arises when patients are recruited for treatment studies without being selected for high levels of zzso Such indiscriminate recruitment is very frequent in zzso and leads to small reported treatment zzso when, however, patients are first screened for elevated distress, the ratio of observed treatment effects sizes is roughly three times zzso 

Sweeping judgments about the effectiveness of zzso treatments for distress reduction are somewhat misleading and zzso Among zzso zzso floor effects are particularly pervasive and have a large zzso effect on observed zzso
