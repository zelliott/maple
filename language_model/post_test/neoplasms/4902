A defining feature of many zzso is zzso zzso zzso Typically, this occurs at the level of recruitment of the zzso zzso to the zzso of cellular zzso zzso zzso the zzso step of protein zzso which is controlled by the zzso zzso initiation complex zzso Thus, zzso in particular, and translation initiation in general, represent an zzso vulnerability and unique opportunity for therapeutic intervention in many transformed zzso In this article, we discuss the development, mode of action and biological activity of a number of zzso zzso that interrupt zzso signaling control of zzso zzso as well as compounds that more directly block zzso zzso
