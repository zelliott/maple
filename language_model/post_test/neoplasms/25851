Progress towards developing vaccines that can stimulate an immune response against growing zzso has involved the identification of the protein zzso associated with a given zzso zzso zzso mapping of zzso zzso for zzso class zzso and class zzso binding motifs followed by zzso with these peptides has induced protective immunity in zzso models against zzso expressing the zzso zzso class I molecules presenting the appropriate peptides are necessary to provide the specific signals for recognition and killing by zzso T cells zzso The principle mechanism of zzso escape is the loss, zzso or zzso of zzso profiles that may render the target cell resistant to zzso zzso even if the cell expresses the appropriate zzso zzso In human zzso zzso loss may be as high as zzso zzso that a reduction in protein levels might offer a survival advantage to the zzso zzso zzso zzso loss may render zzso cells susceptible to natural killer zzso zzso because they are known to act as zzso for killer zzso receptors zzso We review the molecular features of zzso class I and class II zzso and discuss how surface zzso expression may be regulated upon cellular zzso In addition, selective loss of zzso molecules may alter target zzso cell zzso to zzso zzso The development of clinical zzso will need to consider not only the expression of relevant zzso target zzso zzso but also zzso zzso to zzso and T zzso
