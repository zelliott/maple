The unique properties of stem cells are opening the door for the development of new therapeutic approaches notably in zzso and zzso zzso zzso stem cells are theoretically very promising for that zzso However, zzso stem cells derived from blood and bone zzso are the ones which have been tested in clinical zzso zzso these, adult zzso zzso cells zzso possess particularly attracting properties, as they are easily expanded in zzso and possess the potential to differentiate into multiple cell zzso Moreover, zzso can be genetically modified and zzso as a zzso Several research groups are currently investigating both the fundamental properties of zzso and zzso therapies derived from their use, particularly in zzso but also in cancer and zzso Recently, we described that under appropriate zzso zzso can behave as potent zzso cells zzso which is of interest in our understanding of zzso system zzso In addition, the zzso functions of zzso could theoretically be exploited as a new therapeutic tool in cancer therapy in order to amplify immune responses against zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso are widely tested in zzso studies and we will here present our results regarding zzso zzso as an zzso zzso In Canada, the activities within the field of zzso and stem cell zzso has been consolidated within the National Canadian Stem Cell Network which groups researchers, zzso engineers and zzso all dedicated to study this new promising pharmaceutical zzso
