The identification of zzso zzso and new insights into the molecular and cellular basis of tumor zzso have generated a variety of vaccine zzso Although promising in animal models, data from zzso clinical trials have not been zzso These studies have documented the ability of vaccines to prime T cells, but these responses have not correlated with therapeutic zzso Because the location of zzso zzso and zzso activity may impact zzso function significantly, attention has been placed on the tumor zzso There is now evidence that zzso responses may be altered in the setting of established tumor zzso To alter the balance between local immune responses and tumor growth, a vaccine regimen using direct zzso delivery of zzso vaccines expressing zzso molecules was zzso An initial series of clinical trials has documented the safety profile of this approach and has suggested that local and systemic immunity can be zzso zzso we review the general rationale for this approach, discuss the results of ongoing clinical trials, and highlight critical questions that can be addressed in zzso zzso and clinical zzso
