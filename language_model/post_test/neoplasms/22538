Cancer patients with complicated infections following abdominal surgery represent one of the worst clinical scenarios that is useful for testing the efficacy of empirical zzso zzso No study so far has evaluated the performance of zzso zzso when administered as empirical zzso treatment in a homogeneous population of surgical cancer patients with a zzso zzso An zzso review of the data records of 24 sequential patients receiving zzso for a zzso episode following a major abdominal procedure in a single cancer institute was zzso Large zzso surgery represented zzso of all procedures, followed by gastric surgery zzso and zzso surgery zzso zzso following surgery were observed in zzso of zzso episodes, with zzso and zzso accounting for 59% and zzso of zzso zzso Eight patients needed repeat surgery for source zzso The mean duration of zzso treatment was 8 zzso zzso pathogens were detected in 16 episodes zzso and a total of 44 zzso were recovered zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was effective in 12 episodes zzso The success rate was zzso when infectious episodes sustained by zzso resistant bacteria and zzso were zzso Treatment failure was associated with the presence of complications and with zzso documented zzso zzso may be useful as a zzso treatment option in cancer patients requiring zzso treatment following surgery when complications are not present or suspected on clinical grounds and when local microbial epidemiology shows a low zzso of primary resistant zzso
