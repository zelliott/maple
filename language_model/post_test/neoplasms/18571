zzso zzso and zzso aromatic zzso zzso are structurally related classes of zzso that are formed during the combustion of tobacco or during the zzso cooking of zzso Both classes of zzso undergo zzso zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso group to produce a common proposed zzso the zzso zzso which is the critical zzso implicated in toxicity and DNA zzso However, the zzso and chemical properties of these compounds are zzso and different zzso of aromatic zzso and zzso have been developed for human zzso zzso zzso zzso have been extensively used as zzso to monitor occupational and environmental zzso to a number of aromatic zzso however, zzso do not form zzso zzso at appreciable levels, and other zzso have been zzso A number of zzso studies that have investigated dietary consumption of zzso meat in relation to various tumor sites reported a positive association between cancer risk and zzso meat consumption, although some studies have shown no associations between zzso meat and cancer zzso A major limiting factor in most zzso studies is the uncertainty in quantitative estimates of chronic exposure to zzso and thus, the association of zzso formed in cooked meat and cancer risk has been difficult to zzso There is a critical need to establish long-term zzso of zzso that can be implemented in molecular zzso zzso In this review, we highlight and contrast the zzso of several zzso zzso aromatic zzso and zzso to which humans are chronically zzso The zzso properties and the impact of zzso of the major zzso zzso on the biological effects of these chemicals are zzso Lastly, the zzso approaches that have been successfully employed to zzso aromatic zzso and zzso and emerging zzso of zzso that may be implemented in molecular epidemiology studies are zzso
