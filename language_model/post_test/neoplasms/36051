zzso infectious diseases can, in theory, lead to the extinction of host zzso particularly if zzso species are present or if disease transmission is zzso The number of historic or prehistoric zzso that can unequivocally be attributed to infectious disease is relatively small, but gathering firm evidence in zzso is extremely zzso zzso zzso and zzso devil facial zzso disease zzso are two very different infectious diseases that are currently threatening to cause zzso in zzso These provide an unusual opportunity to investigate the processes of zzso extinction and possible management zzso Both diseases are apparently recent in zzso zzso zzso is entirely zzso but potentially able to cause extinction because transmission depends zzso if at all, on host zzso zzso zzso has a broad host range but is highly zzso only to some populations of some zzso At present, both diseases can only be managed by attempting to isolate individuals or populations from zzso Management options to accelerate the process of evolution of host resistance or tolerance are being investigated in both zzso zzso changes including movement of diseases and zzso habitat destruction and fragmentation and climate change are likely to increase emerging disease threats to zzso and it is critical to further develop strategies to manage these zzso
