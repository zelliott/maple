zzso transition zzso is a complex process involved in embryonic development, wound healing and zzso During this process, zzso cells lose their defining characteristics and acquire zzso zzso loss of zzso zzso increased zzso and zzso resistance to zzso and changes in cellular zzso zzso has been implicated as a driver of zzso and zzso invasion, as this process allows cells to zzso from their niche and migrate through blood and zzso vessels to invade different zzso This transition involves a diverse range of zzso factors, including zzso Snail and zzso and downstream zzso targets, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso Recent evidence indicates that cancer stem cells are required for zzso zzso to become established at a distant site, and that cancer cells undergoing zzso may develop stem-cell characteristics as well as increased invasive zzso The role of zzso in cancer biology is newly emerging in the human field, and to date very little has been done in veterinary zzso zzso may therefore be an important molecular zzso of zzso zzso and further understanding of this process may lead to novel drug targets to be exploited in both veterinary and human zzso
