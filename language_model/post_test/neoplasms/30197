zzso risk is increased in patients with cancer and there are important implications for those who suffer a zzso zzso zzso We undertook this study to determine the frequency, clinical patterns, and outcome of zzso in Saudi patients with zzso 

Cancer zzso tumors and zzso patients who developed zzso from January 2004 to January 2009 were studied zzso zzso and clinical characteristics related to zzso and cancer were zzso 

A total of zzso patients with cancer were seen during the study zzso zzso was diagnosed in 47 zzso patients zzso age 52, range zzso zzso Lower limb zzso was the most common type, seen in zzso patients, followed by zzso in zzso and zzso patients had both zzso and zzso zzso was symptomatic in zzso patients while it was an incidental finding on routine zzso in zzso zzso Cancer and zzso were diagnosed at the same time in 38% of patients, and zzso patients developed zzso during the course of disease after the cancer zzso The majority of zzso post cancer diagnoses occurred during the first year zzso 4 months, range zzso Additional risk factors for zzso were present in 22 zzso patients and 14 zzso of these patients were receiving chemotherapy at the time of zzso Only 5 zzso patients were receiving zzso at the time of zzso zzso Most common types of tumors associated with zzso were breast cancer, zzso zzso and lung zzso The majority of the affected patients zzso had advanced stage of zzso After a median follow-up of 13 zzso zzso months, 38 zzso patients had zzso There was no difference in the mortality of patients with symptomatic or zzso zzso zzso vs zzso 

zzso complications can develop in a significant number of patients with cancer, and almost half of the patients have additional risk factors for zzso zzso is usually associated with advanced disease and can be zzso in more than a quarter of zzso zzso in cancer patients is zzso Community based studies are needed to accurately define the extent of this problem and to develop effective zzso zzso
