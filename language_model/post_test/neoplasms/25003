A combination cancer therapy was investigated via zzso of therapeutic gene zzso human tumor necrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using a zzso carrier, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was chosen as the zzso to target the zzso system to the tumor cells expressing zzso zzso The result of zzso scanning showed that about 375 zzso molecules were bound to one zzso zzso The zzso system was constructed based on the zzso interactions between zzso complex and zzso zzso zzso zzso system showed higher efficiency in cellular zzso and gene expression than unmodified zzso system in human liver cancer zzso cells, and accumulated in tumor more efficiently in zzso In comparison with single zzso or zzso delivery system, zzso system induced zzso of tumor cells in zzso and inhibited tumor growth in zzso more zzso In mice bearing zzso zzso lower doses of zzso system (4 zzso zzso about zzso zzso effectively inhibited tumor growth comparable to high doses (5 zzso of free zzso zzso versus zzso These results suggested that zzso zzso system of zzso and zzso was a simply prepared, combined delivery platform which can significantly improve the zzso zzso This zzso system might widen the therapeutic window and allow for the selective destruction of cancer zzso
