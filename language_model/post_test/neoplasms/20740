zzso is a zzso zzso targeting the regulatory zzso alpha of type I protein zzso A, which plays an important role in growth and maintenance of zzso zzso zzso inhibited human cancer zzso either alone or zzso with zzso agents and has demonstrated an improved zzso stability and safety profile compared to the first-generation zzso zzso of this study were to define the safety profile and zzso of zzso administered as zzso IV infusions twice weekly in patients with zzso solid zzso Fourteen patients (13 zzso for zzso received escalating doses of zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso included zzso cell lung cancer, zzso cell cancer, zzso and zzso The plasma zzso of zzso were linear and zzso zzso plasma concentration zzso reached zzso zzso zzso zzso at dose 360 zzso and zzso zzso at dose 240 zzso The plasma zzso was about zzso zzso The only clinical zzso were transient grade zzso fever and fatigue at doses zzso or zzso 240 zzso There was no zzso complement zzso or zzso at any dose level, except with the first dose in one patient who had pre-existing borderline zzso zzso activated partial zzso time zzso occurred at doses zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso included transient activated partial zzso time zzso (one of three patients at 360 zzso and cumulative zzso zzso zzso (three of three patients at 360 zzso and three of six patients at 240 zzso during weeks zzso One patient with colon cancer had stabilization of a previously rising zzso zzso Thus, in this first clinical evaluation of a zzso zzso in cancer patients, high plasma zzso of zzso were well tolerated without significant acute zzso but prolonged treatment was associated with zzso zzso Although 240 zzso by zzso infusion twice weekly was safe for a zzso treatment zzso alternative dosing schedules are being tested to minimize the cumulative zzso which will be essential to extend the duration of therapy at the highest zzso dose zzso
