zzso function as hormone zzso sequence specific DNA binding zzso factors that recruit multiple zzso and other proteins to specific genes and generally stimulate zzso of these zzso zzso may have further zzso actions, that do not involve direct DNA zzso through zzso interactions with other sequence specific zzso factors, although these may still involve weak binding to zzso steroid responsive elements in zzso zzso also appear to have zzso effects zzso through interactions with zzso signaling zzso The major functions of zzso in normal adult zzso appear to involve stimulation of zzso rather than zzso In contrast, the zzso alpha and zzso directly stimulate the growth of breast and prostate zzso respectively, indicating a critical change in their zzso The zzso alpha and zzso appear to undergo further adaptation in tumor cells in response to hormonal therapies, that render these therapies zzso zzso the molecular basis for these changes in zzso function during cancer development and progression may provide new targets for the generation of drugs to prevent and treat steroid zzso zzso
