The authors review how cancer cells may cooperate in zzso by means of zzso zzso The main mechanisms underlying this cooperation are clustered migration of cancer cells, zzso zzso degradation, zzso zzso of released signaling factors and/or induction of zzso molecules on zzso zzso Another critical factor could be zzso zzso successive waves of cancer cells may induce progressive conditioning of the zzso The zzso zzso of cancer cells against the zzso involves successive steps of the zzso process: invasion of the primary tumor zzso collective migration through the zzso zzso blood vessel zzso vascular or zzso tumor zzso establishment of a zzso niche by zzso factors and zzso precursor zzso induction of cell zzso zzso expression in zzso cells, zzso zzso dormancy and establishment of a new growth in distant zzso As a result, after completion of the zzso process, the series of zzso changes from the primary tumor to the zzso site may promote colonization of zzso by zzso cancer cells of the primary zzso
