zzso drug delivery zzso have been investigated over the last several decades as a means to improve upon the lack of tumor targeting and severe systemic zzso associated with intravenous chemotherapy zzso These localized therapies exist in a variety of form factors designed to facilitate the delivery of drug directly to the site of disease in a controlled manner, sparing zzso tissue zzso Many of these zzso are zzso and designed to maintain therapeutic zzso of drug at the tumor site for a prolonged period of zzso Thus a single zzso procedure is required, sometimes zzso with tumor zzso surgery, and thereby zzso following complete release of the loaded active zzso Even though localized zzso depot delivery systems have been investigated, a surprisingly small subset of these technologies has demonstrated potentially zzso zzso results for cancer applications, and fewer have progressed toward zzso The aims of this article are to review the most well-studied and zzso local zzso delivery systems from the last two decades, to examine the rationale for utilizing zzso zzso implants in cancer patients, and to identify the patient zzso that could most benefit from localized zzso Finally, a discussion of the zzso barriers to localized therapy zzso drug zzso zzso technical hurdles, and future outlook of the field is zzso
