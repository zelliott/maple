A phase I study of high-dose zzso given over 2 days, along with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was designed to simulate zzso without the need for zzso zzso 

Schedule A included zzso 100 zzso zzso 400 zzso and zzso 20 zzso (all given IV on days 1 and 15, 28 day zzso zzso was administered orally every 8 h zzso 6 doses, days 1 and zzso Schedule B excluded zzso and zzso maintaining zzso and zzso zzso were performed for zzso for 6 patients on each zzso 

36 patients were zzso The zzso zzso seen included zzso dehydration, fatigue, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso was common, but not a dose limiting zzso The zzso parameters for zzso were zzso 

Using zzso to mimic zzso is feasible and well tolerated with a toxicity profile that differs from standard zzso zzso zzso with less zzso zzso The phase II dose for zzso in combination with zzso zzso and zzso is 1,500 zzso or zzso zzso in the absence of zzso zzso
