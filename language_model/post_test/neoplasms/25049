zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso molecules of zzso zzso zzso length that control gene expression in many cellular zzso These molecules typically reduce the stability of zzso including those of genes that mediate processes in zzso such as zzso cell cycle regulation, stress response, zzso zzso and zzso zzso targeting is mostly achieved through specific zzso interactions between the zzso end zzso zzso of the zzso and sites within coding and untranslated regions zzso of zzso target sites in the 3' zzso lead to more effective zzso zzso Since zzso frequently target hundreds of zzso zzso regulatory pathways are zzso To provide a critical overview of zzso zzso in cancer, we first discuss the methods currently available for studying the role of zzso in cancer and then review zzso zzso organization, zzso and mechanism of target recognition, examining how these processes are altered in zzso Given the critical role zzso play in zzso processes and their zzso zzso they hold potential as therapeutic targets and novel zzso
