zzso tumor zzso is essential for cancer management as patient outcomes improve with use of zzso and zzso zzso Current zzso evaluation is varied in approach, yet standardized diagnoses are critical for determining zzso While gene zzso cancer zzso may potentially meet this need, imperative to determining their application to patient care is validation in rigorously designed zzso Here, we examined the performance of a zzso molecular zzso in a large zzso zzso 

Case selection incorporated specimens from more than 50 zzso including a range of tumor grades, zzso and primary tumors, and limited tissue zzso zzso zzso tumors passed zzso review between three zzso zzso zzso using a zzso quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso was conducted on blinded tumor sections from 790 cases and compared with adjudicated zzso 

The zzso zzso showed overall sensitivities of zzso for tumor type zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso tumors, high-grade tumors, or cases with limited tissue showed no decrease in comparative performance zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso High specificity zzso was showed for ruling in a primary tumor in zzso commonly harboring zzso The zzso incorrectly excluded the adjudicated diagnosis in zzso of zzso 

The zzso zzso showed strong performance for accurate molecular zzso of a diverse set of tumor zzso zzso support potential use of the zzso as a standardized molecular adjunct to routine zzso evaluation for tumor zzso and primary site zzso
