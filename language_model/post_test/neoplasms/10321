During zzso development cells sustain zzso that disrupt normal mechanisms controlling zzso zzso the zzso and zzso pathways are both defective in most, if not all, human zzso which underscores the crucial role of these pathways in regulating cell cycle progression and zzso A simple interpretation of the observation that both pathways are zzso is that they function independently in the control of cell zzso However, a large body of evidence indicates that, in addition to their independent effects on cell fate, there is extensive zzso between these two zzso and specifically between the zzso factors zzso and zzso which influences vital cellular zzso This Review discusses the molecular mechanisms that zzso the intricate interactions between zzso and zzso
