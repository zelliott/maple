To investigate the association between infant mortality at time of birth and mortality from various causes of death in adulthood in men and zzso 

Linked mortality study based on mortality records for 1996 and 1997 and on 1996 population census data of the Region of Madrid zzso Deaths from five cancer sites and from five chronic diseases were estimated for 1 224 zzso people aged zzso years residing in the Region of Madrid who were born elsewhere in zzso 

A zzso in mortality by infant mortality zzso was seen for mortality from stomach cancer, colon cancer, diabetes zzso and chronic liver disease in men, and for stomach cancer, zzso heart disease and chronic liver disease in zzso The association was positive for stomach cancer and negative for all other zzso The relative mortality rates adjusted for age and adult socioeconomic factors for men belonging to infant mortality zzso 3 and 4 zzso versus those belonging to zzso 1 and 2 as baseline were zzso zzso zzso : zzso for stomach cancer, zzso zzso zzso : zzso for colon cancer, zzso zzso zzso : zzso zzso for diabetes zzso and zzso zzso zzso : zzso for chronic heart zzso The relative mortality rates for women were zzso zzso zzso : zzso for stomach cancer, zzso zzso zzso : zzso for zzso heart disease, and zzso zzso zzso : zzso for chronic liver zzso 

Higher infant mortality at time of birth is associated with adult mortality from diabetes zzso and colon cancer in men, from zzso heart disease in women, and from stomach cancer and chronic liver disease in both zzso These results most likely reflect adverse living conditions and/or nutritional deprivation in zzso
