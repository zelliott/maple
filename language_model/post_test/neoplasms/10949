One of the major challenges in zzso stem cell transplantation is to find a balance between the harmful induction of zzso disease and the beneficial zzso and zzso immune zzso zzso transfer of zzso generated donor T cells with specific zzso or zzso activity may be zzso However, in many cases this requires the zzso zzso and expansion of zzso precursor T cells from the zzso donor zzso zzso 

zzso zzso T cells were generated by zzso of zzso regulatory T zzso donor peripheral blood zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso cells, followed by two zzso with zzso zzso zzso Responding T cells were isolated based on zzso expression and further zzso using zzso zzso complex zzso 

Using this method we were able to zzso generate functionally high zzso T cells directed against multiple viral zzso and minor zzso zzso from the zzso zzso repertoire of zzso minor zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we demonstrated that reduction of the regulatory zzso frequency by depletion of zzso zzso cells resulted in improved zzso and expansion of zzso precursor T zzso 

In conclusion, we present a robust method for the zzso induction and isolation of zzso T cells from the zzso zzso We demonstrate that the likelihood of successful generation of primary immune responses is determined by a delicate balance between the numbers of zzso precursor T cells and the numbers and zzso state of regulatory T cells locally at the site of zzso of the immune zzso
