The potential and limitations of targeted delivery of zzso agents with zzso particulate carriers is the subject of this zzso Because over the years zzso have gained the most attention as carrier system in the category of zzso carrier systems, this paper focuses on the utility of the zzso system for tumor zzso It is imperative that an intended therapeutic application of zzso should be well matched with the zzso behavior in zzso zzso the in zzso fate of the first-generation zzso and the more recently developed second-generation zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso and zzso zzso is analyzed in terms of accessibility of target sites, zzso and zzso drug release and potential target sites for rational targeted delivery are zzso A few examples of areas in cancer chemotherapy, with a strong rationale for the use of zzso are zzso It is concluded that, although several options are available on the drawing board, issues such as tumor cell zzso access to the target site, shedding of zzso and target zzso release of the zzso drug need to be addressed early in the development zzso
