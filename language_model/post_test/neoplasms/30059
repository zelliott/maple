zzso zzso zzso Animal Health) is a novel orally administered zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso approved for treatment of canine mast cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to tumor growth, zzso and zzso zzso targets include vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is used commonly to zzso zzso and monitor response to zzso therapy in human zzso In this study, serial zzso imaging with zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to assess response to zzso therapy in dogs with measurable solid zzso Six zzso dogs underwent tumor assessment using both standard zzso criteria and zzso prior to and at a median of 5 weeks zzso of zzso zzso zzso was prescribed initially at a target dose zzso zzso PO zzso zzso with subsequent modifications based on observed zzso Treatment was continued in patients achieving stable disease with acceptable drug zzso One dog was maintained on drug despite dose modification due to zzso measurable clinical and zzso responses were seen after 10 weeks of zzso All others had stable or progressive disease based on clinical restaging and zzso at first zzso zzso Due to zzso with zzso and zzso imaging, further studies are needed to investigate the role of molecular imaging in assessment of drug response and identify other potential molecular targets of zzso
