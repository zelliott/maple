A comparison of expected number of deaths with the observed is a widely used method with an extensive zzso zzso often study the mortality rate from a particular cancer in an initially healthy zzso Using zzso mortality rates from a reference population will overestimate the expected number of deaths because it does not take into account the fact that the study cohort is initially cancer zzso It is more accurate to calculate the expected number of deaths by explicitly considering the probability of getting cancer in a given year and the probability of dying from it before the end of the zzso
