The majority of adult human zzso zzso exhibit evidence of genetic instability, and it is widely believed that the genetic instability zzso by zzso or zzso instability plays an essential role in the genesis of these zzso Indeed, most experimental models of cancer also show evidence of zzso zzso The resulting genetic chaos, which has widespread effects on many genes throughout the zzso confounds attempts to determine the precise cohort of genetic changes that are required for the transformation of normal human cells to a zzso zzso Here we show that genetic transformation of human kidney zzso cells can occur in the absence of extensive zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These observations demonstrate that the in zzso zzso transformation of human cells can proceed without widespread zzso zzso
