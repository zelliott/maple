There is an immediate and critical need for a zzso broad-based zzso method that can evaluate multiple zzso simultaneously in clinical cancer specimens and identify patients most likely to benefit from targeted agents now in use or in late-stage clinical zzso We have implemented a prospective zzso approach to characterize the frequency and spectrum of zzso amenable to drug targeting present in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in zzso Cancer patients were enrolled in a zzso Cancer Medicine zzso that houses both clinical information and zzso data, and zzso screening was performed using a zzso zzso panel with mass zzso analysis to detect 390 zzso across 30 cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso specimens were evaluated from 820 zzso zzso The genes most frequently zzso across multiple cancer types were zzso zzso zzso and zzso Less common zzso were also observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 48 of 77 zzso cases zzso zzso at least one additional zzso in another zzso most often zzso Among zzso only 54 of 73 zzso zzso zzso were the zzso zzso These findings demonstrate the diversity and complexity of zzso in zzso targets among the different cancer types and underscore the need for a zzso prospective zzso approach to personalized cancer zzso
