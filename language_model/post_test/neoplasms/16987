A considerable proportion of patients with moderate or severe intensity at baseline still had symptoms with an zzso score of four or zzso Patients with zzso zzso at baseline complained of symptom zzso at the first follow-up zzso Various strategies are needed to zzso symptom control in advanced zzso
