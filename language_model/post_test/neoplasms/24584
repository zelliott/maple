There is a need for new technologies to study zzso zzso The current gold standard, zzso is compromised by zzso in tissue processing and observer zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are promising alternative technologies but have not yet been zzso or zzso on the same zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso is currently limited by time-consuming zzso and low amounts of zzso protein zzso 

zzso melanoma was surgically excised from 30 patients and zzso dissected from surrounding zzso Each zzso was processed by zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and enrichment zzso and zzso The latter protocol uses zzso to remove zzso cells, thus enriching for melanoma zzso Each sample was measured for the expression of zzso or zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso coupled with zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso and, for zzso zzso strongly with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and moderately with transcript levels, measured by zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, for zzso zzso zzso strongly with transcript level zzso zzso zzso but only moderately strong correlations are noted with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In general, transcript levels show only moderately strong correlations with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso is a promising technology for quantitative grading of tissue zzso however, zzso correlations are zzso
