The preparation of a novel zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso is zzso Conventional zzso of proteins involves the formation of zzso zzso but for in zzso applications such as zzso or stomach zzso the zzso of these zzso to tissue zzso constitutes a serious zzso Using our new compound, which has a particularly zzso aromatic ring, we confirm and extend studies published by other workers indicating the much greater in zzso stability of zzso compounds compared to the more conventional zzso zzso In addition, the zzso group of our zzso gives a stable and specific linkage to zzso groups formed by zzso zzso on the sugar zzso of zzso zzso In zzso favorable binding activity and high stability was obtained with a zzso labeled zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso In zzso using paired labeling experiments in nude mice bearing colon zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared with the same zzso zzso by conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso as percent injected dose per zzso was significantly higher as compared to values obtained with a conventionally labeled zzso zzso Additionally, zzso zzso an indicator of zzso release from the zzso was up to 25 times lower after injection of zzso obtained by the new method as compared to the conventionally zzso zzso
