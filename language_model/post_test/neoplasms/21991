zzso historically has been directed at studying the mechanisms of adverse effects of isolated compounds on living organisms at high levels of exposure, forming the basis for risk and safety zzso One way to zzso and mobilize new research funds would be to better match the priorities in regulatory issues and direct the research within the field of zzso more to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso can only be developed when taking into account zzso insight and will require zzso analysis and a definition of interactions between compounds at realistic doses of exposure, especially in the case of dietary zzso This is because the biological effects at low levels of exposure not only may be adverse but also can be beneficial depending on the target organ, the actual end point zzso the receptors zzso and/or the gene zzso zzso and zzso patterns zzso zzso have the tools and knowledge to study mechanisms of biological effects of chemicals on living organisms, and they should redirect their focus from looking only at adverse effects at high levels of exposure to characterizing the complex biological effects, both adverse and zzso at low levels of zzso This may even result in the notion that beneficial effects can be the result of reaction pathways that are generally considered adverse and vice zzso zzso zzso not only will provide a significant research challenge for the years ahead but also should contribute to better methods for zzso risk assessment for complex zzso of chemical zzso This zzso from zzso to zzso effects turns the field from a science focusing on adverse effects into a science studying the biological effects of chemical compounds on living organisms, taking into account the realization that the ultimate biological effect of a chemical may vary with its dose, the end point or target organ considered, and/or the combined exposure with other zzso By defining the effects of chemicals on living organisms at zzso relevant exposure levels, zzso may contribute not only to better risk and safety assessment but also to preventive medicine, generating knowledge on possible adverse and also beneficial effects of zzso In addition, it will result in an approach for food safety assessment more in line with that for drug safety assessment taking the zzso balance into zzso
