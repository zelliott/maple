zzso are a key chemotherapy component for several zzso including zzso breast cancer zzso zzso cancer, and advanced zzso cell lung cancer zzso Despite the clinical benefit achieved with zzso zzso zzso these agents can be associated with significant and severe zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso has demonstrated higher response rates and improved zzso when compared with zzso zzso in patients with advanced zzso and zzso The technology used to create zzso zzso zzso to deliver zzso resulting in an advantageous zzso zzso zzso This review discusses the proposed mechanism of delivery of zzso including an examination into a hypothesized greater ability to leverage zzso transport relative to zzso An advantageous zzso profile and the more efficient use of zzso transport may contribute to the zzso finding that zzso achieves a zzso higher tumor zzso relative to zzso Another possible contributing factor to the tumor zzso of zzso is the binding of zzso to zzso protein zzso and rich in zzso zzso although the data supporting this relationship between zzso and zzso remain largely zzso at this zzso Recent data also suggest that zzso may enhance tumor zzso of zzso in pancreatic cancer treated with both zzso Additionally, a possible zzso zzso between zzso and zzso has been cited as the rationale to combine the two agents for zzso zzso Thus, zzso appears to interact with tumors in a number of interesting, but not fully zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinical research across a range of tumor types is warranted to answer the questions that remain on the mechanisms of delivery and zzso activity of zzso
