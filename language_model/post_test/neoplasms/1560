zzso zzso and channels zzso the zzso govern cellular influx and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso We used zzso zzso to analyze gene expression of the zzso in 60 human cancer cell lines used by the National Cancer Institute for drug zzso zzso gene expression with the zzso of 119 standard zzso drugs identified known zzso interactions and suggested novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso positively correlated with zzso to their respective drug zzso We validated the positive correlation between zzso zzso zzso zzso expression and potency of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Application of an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso significantly reduced the potency of these two drugs, indicating that zzso plays a role in cellular zzso Three ABC zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed significant negative correlations with multiple drugs, suggesting a mechanism of drug zzso zzso expression correlated zzso with zzso of 19 known zzso zzso and with Baker's zzso and zzso Use of zzso interference reduced zzso zzso levels and zzso increased sensitivity to these two drugs, as expected for zzso zzso Similarly, specific zzso of zzso by small interfering zzso increased sensitivity to several drugs in melanoma cells, implicating zzso as a novel zzso zzso Ion zzso zzso channels, and zzso of zzso and sodium pumps zzso correlated with drug zzso This study identifies numerous potential zzso relationships and supports a prominent role for membrane transport in determining zzso zzso of zzso gene expression may prove useful in predicting zzso drug zzso
