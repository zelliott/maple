In large zzso systems, zzso controllers can aid in steering the heat focus toward the zzso However, the large number of sources can greatly increase the steering zzso Additionally, controller performance can be zzso due to changes in tissue zzso which vary zzso with temperature, as well as with time and spatial zzso The current work investigates whether a zzso controller with the assumption of zzso constant zzso is robust to zzso zzso and achieves steering in a shorter time than required by a zzso zzso The zzso controller assumes that the optimal heating setting lies in a zzso spanned by the best heating zzso (virtual zzso of an initial, zzso patient zzso An initial, zzso zzso model is zzso updated by the zzso using feedback zzso images, until convergence of the heat focus to the zzso zzso tests were conducted in a patient model with a right lower leg zzso heated in a zzso zzso zzso phased array zzso operating at 150 zzso A zzso model was used to simulate zzso zzso zzso magnetic resonance temperature images were used as feedback at each iteration zzso zzso was validated for the zzso starting from four approximate initial models: zzso a zzso constant zzso lower leg model zzso implies a model that exactly models the patient with the exception that zzso is considered constant, zzso not temperature zzso zzso a model with electrical and zzso tissue properties varied from 50% higher to 50% lower than the standard model, zzso a simplified constant zzso zzso lower leg model with zzso deviated properties and zzso a standard model with the tumor position in the leg shifted by zzso zzso zzso to the desired focus of heating in the tumor was achieved for all four simulated zzso The controller accomplished satisfactory therapeutic zzso approximately zzso of the tumor was heated to temperatures 43 degrees C and approximately zzso was maintained at temperatures zzso degrees zzso Compared to the controller without model reduction, a approximately zzso fold reduction in convergence time was accomplished using approximately 2-3 zzso virtual zzso In the situations tested, the controller was robust to the presence of zzso zzso The results of this work can help to lay the foundation for real-time zzso control of zzso zzso systems in clinical situations where zzso can change rapidly with zzso
