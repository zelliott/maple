zzso play a regulatory role in a variety of zzso including cancer, zzso zzso disorders, viral infections and many zzso One of the possible strategies to combat these zzso seems to be the use of zzso zzso zzso I, II, III and IV zzso zzso zzso have been found in zzso to strongly inhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso contributing to zzso invasion and zzso indicated possible zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to check in zzso zzso activity of these four zzso on human lung cancer cell zzso 

In order to assess whether these zzso induced in zzso zzso zzso zzso was conducted with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso I significantly inhibited the cell proliferation of all cells tested and also zzso II was active in all except zzso zzso of cell growth by zzso III and IV was zzso zzso values of zzso I and II for zzso were less compared to other cell lines suggesting that lung cancer cells are more zzso 

These investigations might point to future preventive as well as zzso solutions using plant zzso zzso for various zzso especially in the zzso hence zzso their further zzso
