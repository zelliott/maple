zzso zzso is a zzso isolated from the seeds and skins of zzso Recent studies indicate that zzso can block the process of zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso promotion and zzso zzso can also reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in zzso The molecular mechanisms of zzso in zzso of cancer and cardiovascular disease are interesting and under intensive zzso zzso was found to strongly inhibit zzso oxide zzso generation in activated zzso as measured by the amount of zzso released into the culture zzso and zzso strongly reduced the amount of zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso zzso The zzso of nuclear factor zzso B zzso zzso zzso induced by zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso The zzso and degradation of nuclear factor inhibitor zzso B alpha (I zzso B zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso oxygen species zzso are regarded as having zzso potential and have been associated with tumor zzso zzso may act as a zzso oxygen species scavenger to suppress tumor zzso In addition, zzso may block zzso zzso through zzso signal zzso zzso zzso oxygen species are pivotal factors in the genesis of heart zzso Meanwhile, efficient zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are present in zzso A fine balance between zzso oxygen species and zzso antioxidants is believed to zzso Any zzso of this balance in favor of zzso oxygen species causes an increase in zzso stress and zzso zzso changes, leading to zzso and heart zzso The experimental results indicate that zzso zzso zzso is of value in zzso the development of heart zzso It is urgent that more efforts be made to investigate newer therapies employing antioxidants for the zzso of cardiovascular disease and zzso
