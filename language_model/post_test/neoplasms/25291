The in zzso growth of small zzso to 3 zzso zzso avascular zzso tumor zzso from six zzso and two human tumor lines has been zzso Surprisingly, the zzso increase of zzso tumor zzso is linear with time after a brief initial period of geometric zzso These zzso tumor zzso are shown to have a constant thickness of zzso outer crust and of middle zzso but viable zzso An zzso model for their growth is developed which explains the growth zzso This constant crust thickness model leads to a progressively diminishing growth fraction as radius increases and should be zzso to such early growth of zzso in zzso The model also provides a procedure for determining cell cycle zzso
