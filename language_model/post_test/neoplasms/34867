zzso AND zzso To zzso the current knowledge concerning induction of second zzso by zzso treatments, with specific examples, and to address the consequences with regard to the justification of the indication for the therapeutic administration of zzso radiation according to the radiation protection zzso To identify open questions and to outline practical consequences for the communication with the zzso 

zzso results in a small but significant increase in tumor zzso zzso in secondary zzso This is only relevant, if tumor cure is achieved with the first zzso Collection of data on second tumors requires lifelong follow-up and/or a zzso documentation in cancer zzso The improvement in survival rates by successful zzso clearly outweighs the reduction of survival by the induction of second zzso Moreover, zzso times for second zzso range from years to decades, while the survival after ineffective treatment is substantially zzso zzso the administration of zzso radiation (in the case of clinically proven zzso is zzso zzso would even be warranted, if the zzso of second tumors were clearly higher than currently estimated, based on the difference in survival times for second tumors versus zzso
