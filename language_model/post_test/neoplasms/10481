zzso DNA has been shown to be present both in circulating tumor cells in blood and as fragments in the plasma of zzso cancer zzso The identification of zzso zzso zzso in blood would be the ultimate marker to measure efficacy of cancer therapy and/or early zzso zzso we present a method for detecting zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso comprise about zzso of zzso 

We describe zzso zzso zzso a method of zzso zzso selectivity for detecting zzso The high zzso selectivity of zzso is zzso due to serial zzso of two rare events: zzso zzso and zzso zzso generally has an zzso selectivity of one zzso zzso per zzso billion wild type molecules and an zzso sensitivity of one zzso zzso per zzso The zzso selectivity of zzso is about zzso better than that of our previously described method of zzso zzso zzso specific amplification zzso for detecting zzso The utility of this method is illustrated in two zzso 1) We demonstrate that two zzso deletions commonly found in lung zzso are not present in tissue from four normal human lungs zzso copies of zzso each) or in blood samples from 10 healthy individuals zzso copies of zzso zzso This is inconsistent, at least at an zzso sensitivity of zzso with the hypotheses of zzso zzso or zzso strong selection of these growth zzso cells during normal lung development leads to zzso of zzso cells with these zzso zzso which sometimes can lead to lung cancer in late zzso Moreover, zzso was used for large scale, high zzso zzso zzso zzso No zzso or early embryonic zzso mosaic zzso was detected (at a frequency of zzso for the zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso in zzso individuals, suggesting that early embryonic zzso zzso zzso is very rare, inconsistent with zzso or strong selection of these deletions in the zzso 2) The second illustration of zzso utility is in personalized monitoring of therapy and early recurrence in zzso zzso zzso zzso identified at diagnosis in the plasma of six patients with stage II and III breast cancer were zzso after therapy in four women, consistent with clinical zzso and continued to be detected after treatment in two others, reflecting tumor zzso 

zzso has an zzso selectivity of one part per billion for detection of zzso and an zzso sensitivity of one zzso zzso provides a general tool for monitoring zzso zzso in zzso and zzso As an example, we show that the personalized cancer signature in six out of six patients with zzso breast cancer can be detected and that levels over time are correlated with the clinical course of zzso
