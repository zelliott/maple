zzso drugs are intended for the treatment of zzso The production of such drugs and their administration to the patient is a delicate and expensive zzso The study deals with the acquisition and processing of data regarding the production of intravenous chemotherapy, from the production request (the medical zzso the production itself zzso zzso to the delivery in the health care unit, for the administration of the zzso The goal of this study is to develop a system that can schedule, control and track the chemotherapy preparations and satisfy a certification process of quality management zzso zzso version zzso zzso 

The solution proposed in this paper was developed within the framework of a common certification process at the zzso Unit of the Oncology Clinic zzso of the zzso hospital in Tours zzso The system consists of two software zzso a software to insure zzso and a decision making software to plan the zzso To simplify the data entry process, some mobile entry points with bar code reader have been zzso These tools enable an accurate tracking of the production, a security and control for the schedule production zzso and a full zzso of each operation leading to the administration of the chemotherapy zzso 

The first result is a software that creates the production schedule, allows a real time control of the production process and a full zzso of each zzso zzso experiments are based on real data sets, with a comparison of a time period before and after the zzso of this zzso The results show the positive impacts of this software, like the reduction of delayed deliveries, real time generation of production zzso zzso of the production and a saving of staff zzso 

This intuitive system guarantees a zzso in connection with a high quality system certified zzso zzso (with a rapid data entry), an assistant to schedule the production of preparations in a better way, a permanent follow-up and analysis of zzso This project proves the benefits of implementing computer solutions for the zzso and assistance in decision making in the hospital zzso
