The zzso zzso zzso zzso has since many years been applied for in zzso zzso testing and zzso of human zzso The standard in zzso zzso zzso test is usually performed on human zzso and has become a comprehensive method to assess genetic damage, zzso and zzso The zzso association between the frequency of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and cancer risk has recently been zzso MN zzso can be influenced by inherited (or zzso genetic zzso (or zzso in genes responsible for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and for the zzso of DNA zzso An important advantage of the zzso zzso is its ability to detect both zzso and zzso events by zzso and zzso identification and contributes to the high sensitivity of the zzso The objective of the present chapter is to review the mechanisms of induction of zzso the method of the zzso zzso and its combination with zzso labeling in the FISH zzso Furthermore, an overview is given of recent results obtained by our laboratory by the application of the zzso zzso
