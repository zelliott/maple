Some studies have indicated an increased risk of lung cancer among asphalt zzso This study investigates the risk of lung cancer in Swedish asphalt zzso 

A cohort of zzso asphalt workers, mainly employed in road construction, was compared to the general population, and to a reference group of construction workers not exposed to asphalt zzso The exposure to zzso zzso zzso at paving in Sweden during the 1980s and 1990s were estimated to be in the order of one or a few zzso per cubic meter, but must have been higher in earlier zzso 

zzso lung cancer cases were observed among asphalt zzso The relative risk zzso and zzso confidence intervals were zzso zzso The corresponding relative risk, as compared to a group of construction workers and adjusted for smoking habits, was zzso zzso We found no increased risk for other zzso investigated or death in other lung zzso 

zzso workers do not have any increased lung cancer risk from exposure to fumes and gases from asphalt at the exposure levels that occurred in Sweden during the 1960s and zzso
