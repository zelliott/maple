We developed a job exposure zzso zzso for the Shanghai textile industry constructed along three zzso industry sector, textile process, and hazardous zzso We assessed 35 different categories of dust, chemical, and physical agents for 149 textile processes within nine industry zzso cotton, zzso zzso zzso zzso silk, zzso zzso other mixed zzso zzso and zzso and zzso The zzso was constructed from two zzso a zzso assessment of the textile process by a team of zzso industrial zzso and the prevalence of zzso reported by Chinese industrial zzso in specific textile processes within the zzso The zzso was applied to an ongoing zzso study of cancer in women textile zzso The zzso assessed only zzso exposure zzso and could be coupled with cumulative exposure by years of zzso The most common zzso in cotton zzso were cotton dust and zzso zzso zzso processes had the highest frequency of zzso including zzso zzso bases and zzso zzso agents, zzso dye chemicals and zzso and zzso Only two processes were identified with zzso exposure, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The most prevalent zzso among the zzso occurring in more than zzso of the women, were electromagnetic fields, zzso and cotton zzso More than one-third of zzso subjects were also exposed to synthetic fiber dust, and slightly less than one-third of women were exposed to zzso This zzso could be zzso for zzso research in other textile zzso
