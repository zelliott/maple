The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso regulate important cellular zzso including growth, zzso zzso zzso zzso and gene zzso Although zzso mostly appear to be zzso zzso the transcript levels of some zzso genes increase upon treatment with specific zzso This applies to the zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso By contrast, the zzso regulation of the related zzso has not yet been zzso The zzso promoters of zzso rat and human contain a plethora of putative zzso factor sites, and the zzso expression of zzso suggests zzso zzso of the zzso We examined the zzso pattern of zzso in different zzso and studied the zzso of zzso expression at the zzso and/or translation level in zzso cells exposed to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, serum, zzso zzso temperature zzso and zzso zzso exposed to zzso display a transient increase in zzso zzso despite their zzso zzso protein zzso The zzso promoters of human, mouse and rat contain a zzso element that binds the zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso reporter zzso containing an zzso pair human zzso promoter zzso encompassing the zzso showed a zzso activity that was zzso higher than the corresponding construct in which the zzso motif was zzso zzso depletion of zzso had no effect on the zzso zzso protein zzso Several binding motifs for heat shock factor are dispersed in the mouse and rat promoter, and temperature shock zzso enhanced the zzso transcript zzso None of the other tested stimuli had an effect on the zzso zzso or protein zzso Our results indicate an zzso regulation of zzso zzso in response to specific zzso However, the zzso protein levels remained unaffected by all the stimuli zzso There is still no explanation for the zzso between the increased zzso and unchanged zzso protein zzso
