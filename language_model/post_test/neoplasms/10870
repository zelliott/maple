zzso in zzso holds the promise to personalize cancer zzso However, its clinical application is still limited to a few zzso and, in the large majority of zzso the correlation between zzso and clinical outcome has been zzso One possible explanation is that current zzso studies do not take into account the emerging role of cancer stem cells zzso in drug sensitivity and zzso zzso are a zzso of cells driven by specific zzso zzso but genetic zzso affecting their activity are generally neglected in current zzso zzso Moreover, in several zzso zzso represent a rare zzso therefore, whole tumor profiling might mask zzso gene expression zzso This article reviews current evidence on zzso zzso and shows how common genetic variations in zzso genes may predict individual response to zzso zzso Furthermore, we provide insights into the design of zzso studies to address the clinical usefulness of zzso genetic zzso
