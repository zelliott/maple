zzso genetic zzso are important risk factors for the development of cancer in zzso To determine genetic zzso for 14 common zzso a zzso study of the impact of a family history of cancer in first-degree relatives was zzso The authors further evaluated the effect modification by habitual smoking with adjustment for other zzso environmental zzso 

In total, zzso cancer cases and zzso zzso and zzso controls, confirmed as being free of cancer, were zzso zzso ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals were determined by multiple zzso zzso analysis, including zzso by family history for 14 cancer sites and interactions with a smoking zzso 

The associations between family history and risk of cancer were generally stronger at the same sites than across cancer zzso zzso to first-degree relatives at the same sites were found to be significantly elevated with 8 of 14 cancer zzso especially high zzso were found for prostate and zzso zzso Some zzso associations were zzso in particular, a zzso association between breast and prostate cancer was zzso The interaction between family history and smoking history for breast cancer was found to be statistically zzso There was no statistical evidence for the interactions in other sites, but among subjects with a family history, the zzso were found to be higher in smokers compared with zzso 

The results of the current study support the hypothesis of a genetic zzso to zzso in family zzso For breast cancer, the interaction between family history and smoking history was observed to be zzso
