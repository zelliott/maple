Natural killer T zzso cells have become a major focus for those who study the innate immune response to tumors and infectious diseases, as well as zzso These novel T zzso produce both zzso and zzso zzso recognize zzso and zzso zzso presented by zzso molecules in a similar manner as peptides are recognized by zzso T zzso zzso and kill tumor cell targets by a zzso mechanism like zzso cells and zzso These ascribed functions thus demonstrate that zzso cells are a unique zzso zzso cell zzso with a kaleidoscope of zzso Because they can mediate zzso effects in zzso with or without the collaboration of zzso cells, the study of zzso cells in zzso immunity may lead to novel treatments based on the ability to manipulate the generation and/or activity of these zzso zzso
