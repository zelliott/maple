The transforming growth factor beta zzso signaling zzso plays a key role in different zzso processes such as development, cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or immune responses and its deregulation may result in tumor zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso are emerging as zzso of the zzso response with important roles in zzso zzso is highly expressed in the zzso vascular zzso with zzso significance in selected zzso and with potential to be a prime vascular target for zzso cancer zzso On the other hand, the expression of zzso and zzso in tumor cells themselves appears to play an important role in the progression of cancer, influencing cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso In addition, experiments in zzso and in zzso in which zzso or zzso expression is modulated have provided evidence that they act as tumor zzso The purpose of this review was to highlight the potential of membrane and soluble forms of the zzso and zzso proteins as molecular targets in cancer diagnosis and zzso
