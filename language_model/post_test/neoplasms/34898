The zzso transition from zzso to S phase has been difficult to zzso We have harnessed zzso zzso proteins that mark zzso transitions in order to develop genetically zzso fluorescent zzso for this zzso These zzso effectively label individual zzso phase zzso red and those in zzso zzso zzso We were able to generate cultured cells and transgenic mice zzso expressing the zzso zzso in which every cell nucleus exhibits either red or green zzso We performed zzso imaging to explore the zzso patterns of zzso dynamics during the zzso transition of cultured cells, the migration and differentiation of neural zzso in brain zzso and the development of tumors across blood vessels in live zzso These mice and cell lines will serve as model systems permitting unprecedented spatial and zzso resolution to help us better understand how the cell cycle is coordinated with various biological zzso
