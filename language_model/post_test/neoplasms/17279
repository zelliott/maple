zzso has been recognized as a hallmark of cancer for more than 100 years, yet no general theory to explain the recurring patterns of zzso in cancer has zzso Here, we develop zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso method that analyzes the patterns of zzso signatures in tumors and predicts the likelihood that any individual gene functions as a tumor zzso zzso or zzso zzso By analyzing zzso zzso pairs, we provide statistical evidence suggesting that many more genes possess cancer driver properties than anticipated, forming a zzso of zzso zzso zzso our driver predictions with information on zzso copy number zzso we find that the distribution and potency of zzso zzso zzso zzso and essential genes zzso zzso on zzso can predict the complex patterns of zzso and copy number variation characteristic of cancer zzso We propose that the cancer zzso is shaped through a process of cumulative zzso and zzso
