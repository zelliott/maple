It has long been recognized that the growth of tumor population depends on the initial age distribution of the cells in the tumor and the zzso cellular birth zzso zzso zzso models have been available for zzso these models take into account the effects of the zzso cell zzso Nevertheless, these models ignore various variables significantly affecting the growth, such as those characterizing the zzso inherent properties and environmental zzso zzso or zzso arise when the growth is simulated with the zzso zzso analysis of these fluctuations is the focus of the current zzso Two types of cells are zzso to zzso separately and to transform mutually during the zzso The master equations of the system have been formulated through zzso population balance around a particular state by considering all mutually exclusive zzso The governing equations for the means, zzso and zzso of the random variables have been derived through the zzso expansion of these zzso master zzso The zzso pathways of the two different types of cells have been zzso simulated by the zzso derived from the master equation for two different physical situations, one without and, the other, with the zzso zzso The results of the current study illuminate the significance of zzso modeling the responses of the tumor to a variety of medicinal zzso The zzso of variation of the zzso zzso population zzso with time under zzso zzso zzso the impact of the uncertainties in the exact number of zzso cells as expressed by this zzso of variation is highly zzso For example, it becomes increasingly uncertain if or how fast these cells will reactivate to become a full-blown zzso tumor after zzso
