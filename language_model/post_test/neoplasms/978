zzso small cell zzso zzso is a rare cancer and few studies describe its zzso Our objectives were to compare the zzso and survival of zzso in South East England with small cell zzso of the lung zzso to determine the most common anatomical presenting sites for zzso and to compare survival in zzso by disease stage and site of zzso 

We used data from the Thames Cancer zzso database for South East England between 1970 and 2004 to determine the zzso most common anatomical sites, and survival by site, and stage of zzso zzso patients registered with zzso were zzso We calculated the zzso zzso rate for zzso using the European standard population and compared this to that for zzso We calculated survival using the zzso method for zzso and zzso and reported zzso survival for different zzso anatomical sites and disease zzso 

The zzso of zzso was much lower than for zzso similar in males and zzso and stable throughout the study period, with zzso rates of zzso per 100,000 in males and zzso in females during zzso In general, patients with zzso had a better zzso survival zzso than zzso zzso The most common anatomical sites for zzso were zzso zzso other gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso head and neck zzso and breast zzso Breast zzso had the best zzso survival zzso and gastrointestinal zzso the worst zzso 

This study suggests that zzso has a stable zzso and confirms that it presents widely, but most commonly in the zzso and zzso Site and extent of disease influence survival, with breast zzso having the best zzso Further studies using zzso diagnosis, prospective case registers for uncommon diseases and European cancer zzso are needed to understand this zzso
