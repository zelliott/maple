zzso acids zzso are involved in many biological activities and frequently exist as zzso zzso at the zzso terminal end of zzso Occasionally, zzso structures in the form of zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso acid zzso are also found in zzso In particular, zzso which is an zzso zzso zzso from sea zzso to humans, is one of the most biologically important zzso in zzso The biological functions of zzso especially on neural cell zzso zzso have been well studied and an in-depth body of knowledge concerning zzso has been zzso However, considerably less attention has been paid to zzso containing zzso and zzso zzso However, advances in zzso methods for detecting zzso structures have allowed the identification and characterization of an increasing number of zzso containing zzso chains in zzso In addition, sophisticated genetic techniques have also helped to zzso the underlying mechanisms of zzso zzso In this review, recent advances in the study of the chemical properties, distribution and functions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso on zzso are zzso
