One of the most difficult problems arising during cancer therapy is the emergence of unique tumor cell zzso that express altered zzso and therapeutic zzso In model tumor systems zzso therapies that eliminate all but a few tumor cells seem to stimulate cell diversification to yield zzso cell populations with divergent zzso zzso the use of repeated cycles of zzso therapies followed by intervening recovery periods often results in the eventual emergence of highly resistant and increasingly zzso tumor zzso To circumvent tumor cell diversification during therapeutic recovery periods we suggest that zzso agents might be zzso Although zzso agents such as differentiation zzso hormones, growth factors, zzso and other natural products are unlikely to be effective therapeutic agents if used alone, they could be used during therapeutic recovery periods to zzso the diversification of surviving tumor cells so that these periods might be characterized by less extensive tumor cell zzso At the end of recovery periods after the removal of zzso agents, surviving tumor cells could be briefly zzso by growth factors, hormones or zzso just prior to initiation of new cycles of therapy using zzso zzso
