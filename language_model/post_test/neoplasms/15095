zzso sequencing of cancer zzso has uncovered thousands of DNA zzso but the functional relevance of the majority of these zzso to zzso is zzso We have developed a zzso method, called zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to identify and prioritize those zzso zzso most likely to generate functional changes that enhance tumor cell zzso The method has high sensitivity and specificity when discriminating between known driver zzso zzso and randomly generated zzso zzso zzso under receiver operating characteristic curve, zzso area under zzso curve, zzso zzso substantially outperformed previously described zzso zzso function prediction methods at discriminating known zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso We applied the method to 607 zzso zzso found in a recent zzso zzso sequencing zzso Based on a model that assumed the zzso zzso zzso are a mixture of drivers and zzso we estimate that zzso of these zzso are drivers, zzso contributing to zzso
