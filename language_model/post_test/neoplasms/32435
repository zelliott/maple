The zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein that binds to and zzso the tumor zzso zzso Several reports describe the presence of different zzso as well as, zzso spliced transcripts of the zzso zzso in a variety of human zzso that have lost the ability to bind zzso Due to the transforming ability of at least some of the zzso it has been suggested that they might contribute to zzso Here we show that shorter zzso transcripts are also widely expressed in normal zzso including lung and zzso zzso and in zzso zzso in zzso zzso transcripts were found in the majority of the zzso Although we cannot exclude that zzso in zzso zzso occur during cancer development, our data rather indicate that in this context the commonly observed transcript zzso may also possess a normal zzso zzso
