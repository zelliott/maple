Although the transfer of zzso genes into zzso stem cells zzso offers many opportunities to treat a wide range of human disease, the low efficiency of transfer and limited expression of the transferred gene have so far largely prevented any direct beneficial effect from being zzso However, gene marker studies in which the transferred genes are used simply to track the individual components of the infused zzso have already shown their zzso zzso marking may be used to identify cells capable of causing zzso after zzso bone zzso transplantation and to distinguish cells in the graft capable of preventing zzso zzso Marking may also be used to analyze the consequences of ex zzso or in zzso zzso of the zzso which are intended to accelerate zzso or augment gene transfer zzso Information obtained from these studies should therefore not only improve the outcome of zzso based therapies, but also aid in the introduction of successful gene therapy zzso
