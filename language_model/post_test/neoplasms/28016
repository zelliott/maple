zzso zzso is a new zzso agent which zzso zzso zzso To provide a rational basis for clinical trial design of the combination of zzso and zzso we studied the zzso effects of this combination using various schedules in zzso and four human colon cancer cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso Cell growth zzso after 5 days was determined by using zzso zzso zzso reduction zzso The effects of drug combinations at the concentration producing zzso cell growth zzso zzso level were analyzed by the zzso zzso zzso exposure to zzso and zzso for 24 zzso and sequential exposure to zzso followed by zzso produced additive effects in the zzso zzso and zzso cells, and additive and synergistic effects in zzso zzso zzso exposure to zzso followed by zzso produced additive effects in the zzso cells and zzso effects in other three cell zzso zzso and continuous exposure to both agents for 5 days produced additive effects in all four cell zzso These findings suggest that the simultaneous administration of zzso and zzso or the sequential administration of zzso followed by zzso generally produce the expected zzso at the cellular level and are optimal schedules, while the sequential administration of zzso followed by zzso produces zzso effects and is inappropriate for this zzso Further in zzso and clinical studies will be necessary to determine the toxicity and zzso effects of this zzso
