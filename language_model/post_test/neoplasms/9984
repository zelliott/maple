It was previously shown that a common zzso zzso designated as zzso DNA zzso was zzso active in human zzso zzso and only slightly active, if at all, in normal zzso cells, including the zzso cell line immortalized by zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso cell line, zzso corresponded to zzso distinct zzso units, arbitrarily defined as zzso zzso chains of 1000 zzso zzso In the present study, radioactive zzso cell zzso was isolated by a recycling procedure which eliminates transcribed DNA sequences common to both the zzso cell and the zzso cell, and was used as a probe for zzso zzso The major part of this probe could be zzso to zzso from all the human zzso zzso cultured cell lines derived from zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells or solid tumors zzso and zzso recovered from zzso In contrast, only a minor portion of zzso cell zzso could be zzso to zzso from zzso cells, normal human zzso cells or zzso grown in culture, fetal and zzso zzso It is concluded that a common zzso set is activated in a wide variety of, and perhaps in all, human zzso
