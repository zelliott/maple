To determine the safety, zzso zzso maximum tolerated dose, and zzso and zzso profiles of the novel zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso named zzso in patients with advanced zzso solid zzso 

zzso zzso zzso of three to six patients received zzso administered as a zzso zzso infusion on days 1 to 5 of a zzso zzso zzso variables were evaluated at all dose zzso zzso zzso included zzso of zzso extracted from peripheral blood zzso cells, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso patients received zzso at one of six dose levels zzso zzso zzso zzso were grade 3 fatigue (one patient at 600 zzso one patient at 1,200 zzso grade 3 zzso combined with fatigue (one patient at 1,200 zzso grade 3 zzso zzso (one patient at 1,200 zzso one patient at 1,000 zzso and grade 2 zzso leading to inability to complete a full zzso cycle zzso patients at 1,000 zzso The maximum tolerated dose was 1,000 zzso zzso zzso displayed linear zzso with respect to zzso and zzso The intermediate elimination zzso was zzso to zzso h and was independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed after each infusion and was sustained for 4 to 24 h in a zzso zzso zzso in zzso levels were detected following zzso zzso zzso disease was observed in a total of 18 zzso patients, including 15 treated for zzso or zzso cycles, and this was associated with zzso zzso of zzso Of the 24 patients treated at the maximum tolerated dose zzso zzso 50% achieved stable zzso 

zzso zzso is well zzso exhibits zzso zzso effects, and has promising zzso zzso
