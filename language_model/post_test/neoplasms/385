A twin crossover zzso of oral zzso and intramuscular zzso was completed in 159 cancer patients with zzso zzso zzso was a surprisingly effective oral zzso in these patients, 100 zzso orally being roughly equivalent to 16 zzso intramuscular zzso zzso data indicate that the peak effect for oral zzso may occur slightly later than that for zzso but that zzso is relatively rapidly effective after oral zzso Side effect occurrence was roughly in the same range for both drugs, with zzso zzso dry mouth, and feelings of weakness being observed after both drugs while sweating was observed more frequently after zzso The zzso further provided a demonstration of the effectiveness of the twin crossover design as a clinical zzso method, providing increased sensitivity of crossover data in a patient population available for only a limited number of study zzso
