zzso of many zzso factors is associated with the development of human zzso zzso factors regulate cell growth, zzso and zzso by binding to specific DNA sequences within the promoter regions of zzso genes and modulating expression of these zzso This simple model is complicated by the fact that zzso zzso factors are often members of large protein families that bind to similar DNA zzso This raises the question as to whether members of a particular family regulate expression of overlapping or unique sets of zzso This review is focused on addressing this question using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor families as zzso zzso activity of some, but not all, members of these families is observed in zzso Here, we zzso the data illustrating the concept that binding of individual members of these families of factors can result in zzso responses and review the studies that have provided some insight into how target gene specificity is zzso zzso for all of these zzso zzso factors, it remains unclear exactly which target genes are important in zzso we have also reviewed the many approaches researchers are using to identify target genes of the various zzso zzso and zzso family zzso
