To determine if zzso bacteria can target tumors in mice and provide positive contrast for zzso using magnetic resonance zzso 

The ability of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to from here as zzso to zzso positive magnetic resonance imaging contrast was determined in zzso and in zzso For the latter studies, zzso were injected either zzso or zzso zzso growth conditions were manipulated to produce small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which were observed using transmission electron zzso zzso targeting was confirmed using zzso bacteria and zzso zzso zzso and by determination of viable cell counts recovered from different zzso and the zzso 

We show that zzso bacteria with small zzso particles generate zzso positive contrast, enhancing in zzso zzso by magnetic resonance zzso Following zzso injection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging revealed increasing colonization of tumors and decreasing infection of zzso after 4 zzso zzso cell counts showed that, by day 6, the bacteria had zzso tumors but were cleared completely from other zzso zzso resonance imaging showed a zzso zzso zzso zzso increased positive contrast in tumors on day 2 and a zzso increase zzso zzso zzso on day zzso 

zzso bacteria can produce positive magnetic resonance imaging contrast and colonize mouse tumor zzso providing a potential tool for improved magnetic resonance imaging zzso in zzso and zzso studies to track zzso
