zzso is a member of a gene family that encodes a group of putative zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene complex was originally identified on the basis of DNA sequence zzso to a zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso This study reveals a novel, functional zzso zzso for zzso and demonstrates that two distinct zzso gene transcripts arise from two overlapping zzso units, resulting in proteins that differ by 25 zzso zzso By utilizing functional zzso reporter zzso two distinct promoters for zzso zzso for the zzso promoter zzso of zzso 1) and zzso for the zzso promoter zzso of zzso zzso were zzso zzso of zzso prevalence and tissue zzso with particular focus on adult zzso revealed that production of zzso from zzso was selective and relatively zzso zzso of zzso from zzso was demonstrably higher and was expressed by a greater number of zzso In zzso zzso expression directed by zzso was zzso in some zzso populations as opposed to their normal human counterparts, suggesting a potential role as a tumor zzso zzso zzso sites were identified for several zzso factors, with multiple sites for zzso and zzso present within both the zzso and zzso zzso In transient zzso zzso zzso from both zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso by the zzso tumor zzso zzso These findings suggest that an zzso zzso zzso may play a role in development and zzso
