It is unclear to what extent cancer history affects zzso mortality in solid organ transplant zzso 

We identified a Swedish zzso cohort of solid organ transplant recipients in the National Patient Register 1970 to 2008 and linked it to the Cancer and zzso zzso zzso and zzso mortality was estimated using Cox zzso 

Of zzso eligible recipients, 416 zzso had a prior zzso unrelated to the indication for transplantation diagnosed 2 months or more before surgery zzso zzso zzso zzso among cancer history recipients was zzso increased after zzso compared with other recipients zzso hazard ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso driven by zzso death with no increase in zzso zzso or other zzso zzso An increased rate of death due to cancer history was primarily observed among zzso recipients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rates were greatest for patients with waiting times of 5 years or less but persisted with waiting times more than 10 years among kidney and zzso recipients with prior aggressive cancer types zzso breast, zzso and zzso zzso 

We conclude that organ transplant recipients with cancer history are at a moderately increased rate of death after zzso driven primarily by death due to cancer zzso
