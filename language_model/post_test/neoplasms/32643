It is difficult to zzso the zzso zzso zzso in patients with zzso failure caused by zzso for abdominal or pelvic zzso zzso draining the kidney with zzso is the only method for the zzso However, external zzso impacts on life quality of the zzso We reported our experience in zzso the zzso zzso using minimally invasive zzso zzso combined with zzso and investigated viability of zzso treatment for bilateral zzso strictures following zzso 

zzso double zzso zzso in zzso by minimally invasive zzso zzso combined with zzso was carried out in 19 patients with bilateral zzso strictures following zzso The clinical outcomes including zzso drainage and zzso function were zzso 

zzso retrograde placement of double zzso zzso was performed in 2 zzso zzso different size double zzso zzso in unilateral zzso were carried out in 17 zzso The patients were zzso for zzso zzso Renal function was improved zzso in 17 cases, with serum zzso level of 45 zzso to 113 zzso Two patients had poor zzso function improvement after zzso zzso and were converted to zzso zzso for draining the zzso 

zzso different size double zzso zzso simultaneously in unilateral zzso by minimally invasive zzso zzso is safe, simple, and effective in treating bilateral zzso obstruction following zzso
