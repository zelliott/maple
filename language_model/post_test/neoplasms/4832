zzso from a linear accelerator zzso zzso zzso in zzso which has recently been shown to produce zzso spectral signatures that can be interpreted to estimate tissue zzso and oxygen zzso or molecular zzso from zzso The zzso optical light levels are in the range of zzso to zzso zzso which limits the practical utility of the signal in routine radiation therapy zzso However, due to the fact that the radiation is zzso zzso of the signal allows detection in the presence of ambient lighting, as is demonstrated zzso This observation has the potential to significantly increase the value of zzso zzso zzso during radiation therapy to monitor tissue molecular zzso
