This phase I study evaluated the safety of zzso a potent and selective inhibitor of the vascular zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in combination with weekly zzso and zzso in patients with advanced solid zzso 

The patients received zzso 30 zzso and zzso 50 zzso weekly from week 1 to week 4, with zzso at either 65 zzso zzso level zzso or 85 zzso zzso twice weekly for 6 weeks (1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso scans were zzso 

13 patients were treated (7 on zzso 6 on zzso 7 patients completed at least 1 cycle of zzso 3 patients experienced zzso toxicity zzso at zzso zzso 3 zzso and grade 3 zzso causing treatment zzso grade 3 zzso No objective responses were observed at zzso which was determined to be the maximum tolerated dose zzso 1 partial response zzso was observed at zzso zzso responses were documented but did not predict response according to the Response zzso zzso in Solid zzso zzso 

zzso at 65 zzso twice weekly combined with zzso and zzso weekly for 4 of 6 weeks is well tolerated but without evidence of clinical zzso zzso may be a useful zzso marker of zzso zzso but requires additional zzso
