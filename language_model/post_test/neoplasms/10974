zzso of pulmonary embolism zzso for different cancer types in zzso zzso is zzso The purposes of the current study is to determine the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and to investigate whether the zzso for zzso is higher in certain zzso 

A cohort of zzso zzso who had imaging studies at zzso Cancer Institute, a zzso zzso cancer zzso from January 2004 through December 2009 was identified using research patient data zzso zzso reports were reviewed to identify patients who developed zzso zzso of zzso in the total population and in each of 16 zzso cancer groups were zzso zzso of zzso for each cancer was compared using Fisher exact zzso 

A total of zzso patients was identified, of which 395 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso developed zzso The zzso of zzso was highest in the central nervous system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso and upper gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The risk of zzso was significantly higher for zzso zzso zzso zzso odds ratio zzso zzso pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso upper gastrointestinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso There was significantly lower risk of zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso and breast zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso in zzso zzso in a zzso cancer center during a zzso period was zzso zzso zzso upper zzso and zzso zzso had a significantly higher risk for zzso than other zzso whereas zzso and breast zzso had a significantly lower zzso
