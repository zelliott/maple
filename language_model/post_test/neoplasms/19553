The origin of cancer remains zzso Current models of zzso based on the gene zzso hypothesis have limitations in explaining many aspects of zzso We put forward a new model of zzso zzso and propose that cancer development involves gene zzso and cell zzso Specifically, cancer can result from a fusion between an zzso zzso cell and a bone zzso stem cell zzso zzso which is a hallmark of zzso is a direct consequence of this cell zzso The zzso cell zzso model explains the remarkable similarities between zzso cells and zzso This model also explains why zzso can be zzso and why zzso zzso such as wound healing and chronic zzso can promote zzso zzso This model is readily zzso Cancer has been difficult to treat because of tissue zzso and gene zzso However, if the zzso characteristics of cancer cells are derived from zzso new zzso targets such as zzso receptors for designing novel therapies may zzso
