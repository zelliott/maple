A volume of data that has accumulated for over a century has suggested that zzso may facilitate the persistence and progression of zzso zzso that have been developed recently have shown that zzso is indeed a component of the zzso tissue zzso in human zzso but in only a few tumor zzso However, therapeutic intervention studies with drugs that limit zzso activity or enhance zzso have shown favorable clinical effects in at least one such tumor zzso These favorable findings affirm the concept that zzso relationships do, in fact, exist between zzso generation with zzso formation and tumor zzso and suggest that a rational basis exists for the design of future drug intervention trials that target reactions relevant to specific tumor zzso These findings also provide a basis for the design of experiments capable of defining further the role of zzso in the integrity of these tumor zzso Because zzso is found much more commonly than zzso in the zzso tissue of a variety of human zzso attention might zzso be directed to determining the possible contribution of this zzso as well as of zzso to tumor zzso
