zzso and zzso zzso (the main form of zzso zzso are key elements in cancer progression and drug resistance, as they provide needed population diversity, complexity, and zzso Despite drastically increased evidence of multiple levels of zzso in cancer, the general approach has been to eliminate the zzso of zzso to establish genetic and zzso zzso In particular, the appreciation of new types of zzso regulation like zzso zzso have led to the hope of solving the mystery of cancer that the current genetic theories seem to be unable to zzso In this zzso we have briefly analyzed a number of zzso regarding cancer zzso followed by the zzso of cancer zzso within a framework of the zzso concept of zzso The analysis of the relationship between zzso zzso and zzso level zzso and the challenges of measuring zzso among multiple levels have been zzso Further, we propose that measuring zzso level zzso represents an effective strategy in the study of cancer and other types of complex diseases, as emphasis on the pattern of system evolution rather than specific pathways provides a global and synthetic zzso Compared to the degree of zzso individual molecular pathways will have limited predictability during zzso cancer evolution where zzso dynamics zzso by zzso zzso will zzso
