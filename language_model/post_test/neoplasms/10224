A zzso approach to identify zzso zzso was used for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso inhibitor with a potent zzso effect at zzso relevant doses and is currently in phase I clinical zzso Using zzso data derived from zzso experiments, we identified zzso zzso to test in blood samples from patients in clinical zzso These candidate zzso were chosen based on several criteria: relevance to the mechanism of action of zzso dose responsiveness in zzso models, and measurable expression in blood zzso We identified 26 potential zzso of zzso action and tested their clinical zzso in patient blood samples by quantitative real-time zzso zzso Based on the results, eight genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were selected as zzso zzso zzso for phase II clinical zzso
