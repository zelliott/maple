The overall mechanism of bone zzso stem cell zzso zzso seems to be simple: zzso zzso as referred to the zzso which is given by the tissue zzso zzso the blueprint can be the local tissue zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pattern, zzso it can be a single cell zzso zzso or it can be a combination of zzso In fact stem cell zzso is a complex not yet fully understood zzso In between the zzso and zzso of zzso several gene zzso steps have to occur in a sequential zzso manner, for which a defined set of instructions is a prerequisite to ensure an accurate zzso However, a recent study indicated that the ability of zzso - to adopt tissue function by reading its blueprint - seems to be a double-edged sword since zzso that have received a faulty zzso provided by chronically inflamed zzso zzso into a zzso zzso Here, we review the importance of an accurate blueprint for zzso zzso and discuss a model showing that zzso might contribute to overall tumor development due to recruitment to tumor zzso
