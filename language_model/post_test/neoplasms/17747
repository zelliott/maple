It has become increasingly clear that the induction of zzso in tumor cells can occur by at least three different pathways involving the cell surface zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso drugs and conditions can trigger the zzso response via one of the three known zzso What is less clear is how these three pathways can interact zzso or zzso to influence a common convergence step leading to the programmed cell zzso In this report we present data to show that zzso (a synthetic zzso zzso the zzso effects of zzso (a drug that zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and BAY zzso (an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso This zzso of zzso by zzso is seen in the zzso zzso zzso cells, but not in the parental zzso cells that express a zzso zzso These effects are seen at a concentration of zzso that have little effect by zzso These data strongly suggest that zzso activates or zzso some step or zzso that interacts with the zzso of zzso B zzso required for the zzso zzso Since zzso BAY zzso and zzso are well known drugs in clinical trials, an understanding of the nature of the interactions between or among the zzso pathways could lead to the design of better clinical protocols using these drugs that will promote zzso in tumor zzso
