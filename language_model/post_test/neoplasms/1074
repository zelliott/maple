Two zzso agents zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are approved for the treatment of zzso anemia in patients with zzso zzso controlled trials indicate that the drugs are similarly zzso but that the duration of clinical benefit zzso ranges from 2 to 7 days for zzso zzso and from 7 to 21 days for zzso zzso depending on zzso Given equivalent zzso zzso are increasingly interested in understanding the cost differences for these 2 zzso 

To examine the impact of different zzso approaches on the cost comparison between zzso zzso and zzso zzso users, with cancer from a payer zzso 

zzso of care zzso were constructed for cancer patients treated with zzso using zzso claims zzso zzso started with the first zzso claim and ended on the last zzso claim or the claim before a zzso or longer gap in zzso zzso Each episode was zzso with an estimated zzso based on the last dose in the zzso Cost was reimbursed amount observed in the claims zzso zzso weekly cost was estimated using generalized linear models to control for difference in clinical and demographic differences across zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso were created in 324 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso users tended to be younger, had more zzso and had advanced cancer (all p zzso zzso After accounting for zzso the average weekly cost of zzso zzso was significantly lower than that of zzso zzso zzso vs zzso p zzso zzso After zzso adjustment, zzso zzso had lower costs than zzso zzso in the base case and all alternative zzso 

To reduce the risk of potential bias, zzso and different patient characteristics should be taken into account when using retrospective claims data to conduct cost comparisons between agents that have significant differences in dosing zzso
