A shift in zzso metabolism from zzso zzso to zzso is one of the zzso hallmarks of tumor zzso zzso defects have been proposed to play an important role in the initiation and/or progression of various types of zzso In the past decade, a wide spectrum of zzso and depletion of zzso have been identified in human zzso Moreover, it has been demonstrated that zzso of zzso or zzso of tumor zzso zzso such as zzso can lead to the zzso of zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso or assembly of respiratory zzso complexes such as zzso c zzso These findings may explain, at least in part, the well documented phenomena of elevated zzso zzso and zzso defects in zzso In this article, we review the zzso zzso zzso with zzso correlations in human zzso and their potential roles in zzso cancer zzso and zzso The signaling pathways involved in the shift from zzso metabolism to zzso in human zzso are also zzso
