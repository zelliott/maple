A competitive binding zzso based on localized surface zzso resonance zzso of zzso zzso gold zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed to detect zzso to zzso zzso of the widely applied zzso drug, zzso zzso By the nature of the competitive zzso for zzso the zzso shift from specific binding between zzso and the free zzso was zzso zzso to the concentration of zzso In addition, the dynamic range for zzso was tuned from zzso to zzso M by varying the concentration of zzso from 1 to 100 zzso zzso zzso and recovery of zzso spiked in zzso buffer saline (PBS) were zzso Potential zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso did not occur in the concentration range of interest for zzso Clinical samples of human serum from patients undergoing zzso chemotherapy were analyzed following a simple zzso extraction step to isolate zzso from the serum zzso with a limit of detection of 155 zzso zzso of the zzso method was carried out in comparison to Fluorescence zzso zzso zzso a commonly used method in clinical settings, and zzso a reference zzso The results of the zzso competitive zzso compared well to zzso and zzso with a slope of zzso and zzso respectively, for the correlation zzso The method established zzso is intended for therapeutic drug monitoring zzso of zzso levels in patients undergoing chemotherapy to ensure safety and efficacy of the zzso
