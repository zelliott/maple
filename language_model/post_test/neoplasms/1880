A conceptual model is proposed for the genetic evolution of many human solid tumors that is based on the observations that cancer cells may spontaneously double their zzso number; that cells with excessive zzso numbers may be zzso zzso both losing zzso randomly during subsequent cell zzso and often developing structural abnormalities in the zzso that are zzso and that some structural zzso abnormalities may activate zzso zzso The sequence of zzso with zzso loss can occur repeatedly in a given zzso The available evidence supporting the model is zzso A computer simulation system that embodies these concepts is described and the model is used to generate zzso of zzso zzso under various simulated conditions and in a variety of simulated biological zzso A simulation of the time course of changes in zzso number per cell that accompany the spontaneous zzso transformation of mouse zzso in zzso is zzso The best fit to the data was obtained when provision was made for the zzso of at least two zzso zzso The conditions for generating discrete zzso zzso in zzso and flow zzso studies were zzso our modeling studies suggest that the zzso of a growth promoting gene is required in order to produce a discrete zzso zzso Our modeling studies suggest that the overrepresentation of individual zzso zzso in zzso cell lines may require the zzso of gene zzso zzso genes and is not likely to occur in cell lines in which at least two copies of each normal zzso are required for cell zzso Overall, the results obtained using the model are consistent with a wide variety of flow zzso and zzso studies in human solid zzso
