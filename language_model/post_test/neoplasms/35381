Patients with cancer grapple with a confusing array of zzso and zzso symptoms while trying to maintain functioning in usual roles and daily zzso Research is needed to sort out and identify symptom clusters as a basis for a rational approach to symptom zzso 

The aim of this study was to test, through secondary analysis, a mediation hypothesis about the direct and indirect relationships between fatigue and depressive symptoms through a zzso involving functional zzso 

Data from the experimental and control groups of a zzso clinical intervention trial for fatigue management, collected after the second chemotherapy treatment or during the last week of zzso were zzso The mediation zzso from fatigue to depressive symptoms through functional status was tested separately for groups receiving either an energy conservation intervention or a control intervention, zzso for time and zzso 

For the control group, the results indicate support for partial zzso The previously significant relationship between fatigue and depressive symptoms was reduced after functional status was controlled, accounting for zzso of the total zzso zzso The mediation hypothesis was not supported in the energy conservation group, indicating that the intervention may have changed the role of functional status in zzso the effect of fatigue on depressive zzso 

In the control group, when routine activities became more difficult because of fatigue, individuals had more depressive zzso The results suggest that functional status is an important factor to consider in symptom management for zzso An appropriate intervention for fatigue would have two zzso the fatigue and strategies to reduce the likelihood of impaired functioning that could result in elevated depressive zzso
