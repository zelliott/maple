As children complete cancer treatment and enter zzso follow-up care is critical to monitor for and treat zzso secondary zzso and late effects of zzso Relative contributions of cancer and treatment variables and zzso factors in engagement with follow-up care are not fully zzso This study aimed to identify risk factors for inadequate follow-up zzso 

The sample included a cohort of 173 children zzso zzso diagnosed with cancer in 2004 and treated at a children's zzso zzso zzso patient current age, ethnic minority status, distance from hospital, type of zzso cancer and treatment variables zzso age at diagnosis, type of cancer, treatment zzso time off treatment, zzso on clinical trial zzso and follow-up care through 2009 were gathered via the hospital tumor registry and medical zzso 

In simultaneous linear zzso analysis (full model: zzso zzso zzso zzso having a liquid tumor zzso presence of zzso zzso and shorter distance from hospital zzso predicted total number of follow-up visits between completion of treatment and 5 years zzso In simultaneous zzso zzso analysis (full model: zzso zzso zzso zzso being male zzso having a brain tumor zzso longer time off treatment zzso and greater distance from hospital zzso decreased the likelihood of completing a follow-up or zzso visit between completion of treatment and 5 years zzso In simultaneous linear zzso analysis (full model: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso race zzso and having public insurance zzso predicted total number of no shows between completion of treatment and 5 years zzso 

These results extend knowledge of health disparities in pediatric cancer follow-up care suggesting that cancer and zzso variables zzso of cancer, zzso number of treatment zzso and zzso factors zzso from treatment center, zzso race, public zzso are important zzso of engagement in follow-up zzso 

zzso at risk for poor engagement may benefit from targeted interventions designed to increase likelihood of follow-up zzso
