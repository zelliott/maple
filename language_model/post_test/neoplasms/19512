A comparative zzso study of X-ray influence on DNA of zzso of peripheral blood from both cancer patients in the course of chemotherapy and on healthy donors was carried zzso The amount of DNA registered in comet tails of blood samples from 18 healthy donors was between zzso The mean value was zzso zzso zzso In the preparations of cancer patients, an increase in comet tail DNA was observed for each chemotherapy course and in each subsequent course compared to the previous zzso The individual variations were found in the level of DNA damage in the response to the administration of zzso of methotrexate, of zzso zzso zzso The X-ray radiation (4 zzso challenge test of blood cells showed an increase in comet tail DNA, the dynamics of zzso zzso varying between zzso The combined use of X-ray radiation and of the zzso in evaluating the capacity of the zzso systems of the whole blood cells during chemotherapy let us to hold the monitoring of the state of zzso of zzso without their zzso This approach enables additional information on zzso zzso to be rapidly zzso
