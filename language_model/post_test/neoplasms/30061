To evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of zzso for prevention of vomiting induced by high dose zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso patients received zzso 5 zzso plus zzso 10 zzso at the first cycle or zzso zzso zzso plus zzso 10 zzso respectively, each administered 30 zzso before the initiation of high dose zzso zzso To observe the zzso rate of acute zzso episodes and delayed zzso episodes, adverse effects and daily zzso in the patients after the zzso 

The complete response zzso rates for acute vomiting were not significantly different between the zzso and zzso cycles zzso zzso zzso zzso The complete control rate of delayed vomiting in the zzso cycle was significantly higher than that in the zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso decrease rate of zzso cycle was zzso significantly lower than the zzso of the zzso cycle zzso The toxicity in the two cycles was similar and no grade zzso toxicity was zzso 

zzso is superior to zzso with a lower zzso rate of delayed zzso induced by high dose zzso chemotherapy and with tolerable zzso Moreover, the apparent zzso control of zzso treatment seems to provide an adequate zzso in these zzso
