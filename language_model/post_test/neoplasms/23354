zzso zzso was successfully zzso within zzso zzso and zzso zzso composite zzso using the zzso extraction zzso The effects of zzso to zzso ratio, zzso ratio as well as zzso inherent zzso zzso on zzso efficiency were zzso The degradation and drug release rates of the zzso were studied for 5 weeks in zzso in zzso zzso solution of pH zzso at 37 zzso The drug release profile followed a zzso pattern with a small initial burst followed by a zzso release for up to 35 zzso The initial burst release decreased with increasing zzso zzso The potential of zzso in limiting the initial burst release makes the incorporation of zzso into zzso zzso advantageous since it reduces the risk of drug overdose from high initial zzso The linear sustained drug release profile over the course of 5 weeks makes these zzso zzso composite zzso a promising delivery system for the controlled release of chemotherapy drugs in the treatment of zzso
