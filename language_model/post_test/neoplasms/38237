In exercise, as well as cancer and zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso activates hundreds of genes vital for cell zzso and zzso While potentially beneficial in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso factor has been linked to zzso poor prognosis in many zzso and decreased zzso of tumors to zzso and zzso Considering zzso function, zzso protein and its zzso zzso look increasingly attractive as therapeutic zzso zzso antioxidants have shown promise in lowering the risk of some zzso and improving neurological and cardiac function following zzso The mechanism of how different antioxidants and zzso oxygen species influence zzso expression has drawn interest and intense zzso Here we present an zzso based zzso model of zzso protein degradation that represents how zzso oxygen species and antioxidants likely affect the zzso zzso zzso in cancer and zzso We use the model to demonstrate effects on zzso expression from combined doses of five potential zzso targeted compounds zzso zzso hydrogen zzso zzso and zzso influenced by cellular zzso and involved in zzso zzso zzso justify the hypothesis that zzso oxygen species work by two opposite ways on the zzso zzso We also show how tumor cells and cells under zzso conditions would zzso respond to zzso oxygen species via changes to zzso expression over the course of hours to days, dependent on zzso hydrogen zzso levels and largely independent of initial zzso levels, during zzso
