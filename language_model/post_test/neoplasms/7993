zzso technologies make it increasingly possible to identify patients most likely to benefit from a zzso targeted zzso This creates the opportunity to conduct targeted clinical trials with eligibility restricted to patients predicted to be responsive to the zzso 

We evaluated the relative efficiency of a targeted clinical trial design to an zzso design for a zzso clinical trial comparing a new treatment to a zzso Efficiency was evaluated with regard to number of patients required for zzso and number required for zzso 

The effectiveness of this design, relative to the more traditional design with broader zzso depends on multiple factors, including the proportion of responsive patients, the accuracy of the zzso for predicting zzso and the degree to which the mechanism of action of the drug is zzso zzso formulas were derived for computing the relative efficiency of targeted versus zzso zzso 

zzso clinical trials can dramatically reduce the number of patients required for study in cases where the mechanism of action of the drug is understood and an accurate zzso for responsiveness is zzso
