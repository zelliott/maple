Driving has been regarded as an activity of daily living that is important in maintaining a person's independence in the community, access to zzso and social zzso Many patients, however, using zzso medications on a regular basis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso their intractable pain have been restricted from driving out of concern that skills would be impaired and driving safety compromised by these zzso Yet there are no driving studies which have explored the effects of using zzso analgesics for an extended period of zzso This pilot study was designed to determine the effects of medically zzso stable zzso use on the driving abilities of patients with persistent, zzso zzso Sixteen patients with chronic zzso pain on zzso who met criteria for participation in the study, underwent a comprehensive off-road driving evaluation using measures which have been shown to be sensitive in predicting zzso driving zzso The evaluation consisted of a zzso evaluation zzso a simulator evaluation zzso and behavioral observation during simulator zzso Patients in the zzso group were compared to a historical control group of zzso zzso compromised patients zzso who had undergone the same evaluation and then passed an zzso zzso evaluation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or failed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso patients generally outperformed the zzso patients as a group by zzso or exceeding zzso and zzso scores of the zzso zzso patients as well as the zzso Pass patients on all measures that differentiated the zzso zzso zzso patients had a relatively poorer performance than zzso patients on specific zzso tests in the zzso however, the differences were not statistically significant and did not imply a systematic pattern of scores that reflected zzso zzso zzso zzso patients were generally superior to zzso patients, zzso however, zzso patients had greater difficulty in following instructions and as well as a tendency toward zzso like the zzso fail zzso While there was general support for the notion that zzso did not significantly impair the perception, zzso zzso and behavior measured in off-road tests that have been regarded as requisite for zzso driving, zzso problems may limit the zzso of results and recommendations are made for research beyond a pilot zzso
