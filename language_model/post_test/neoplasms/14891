zzso zzso in dogs has been reported in association with a variety of zzso zzso calcium zzso concentration is a more accurate measure of zzso than total serum calcium or corrected serum calcium zzso The severity of zzso has been zzso to suggest the most likely differential diagnosis for the zzso 

Diseases causing zzso zzso may be different than those that cause increases in total or corrected serum calcium zzso The severity of zzso zzso in specific diseases cannot be used to determine the most likely differential diagnosis for zzso zzso 

zzso and nine zzso dogs with a definitive cause for their zzso zzso evaluated between 1998 and 2003 were included in this zzso 

zzso medical records zzso 

zzso specifically zzso followed by zzso failure, zzso and zzso were the most common causes of zzso zzso Dogs with zzso and zzso zzso zzso have higher serum zzso zzso than those with zzso failure, zzso and other types of zzso The magnitude of zzso zzso did not predict specific disease zzso 

zzso zzso was most commonly associated with zzso specifically zzso Although dogs with zzso and zzso zzso zzso had higher serum zzso zzso than dogs with other diseases, the magnitude of the serum zzso concentration could not be used to predict the cause of zzso Total serum calcium and corrected calcium zzso did not accurately reflect the calcium status of the dogs in this zzso
