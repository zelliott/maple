During the early stage of cancer clinical trials, when it is not convenient to construct an explicit hypothesis testing, a study on a new therapy often calls for a response rate zzso zzso zzso with or right before a typical phase II zzso We consider a zzso process, where the acquired information from Stage I (with a small sample size zzso would be zzso for sample size zzso recommendation for Stage II study aiming for a more accurate zzso Once a sample size design and a zzso zzso protocol are applied, we study the overall utility zzso in connection with the cost due to patient recruitment and treatment as well as the loss due to mean squared error from zzso zzso Two approaches will be investigated including the zzso mixture method (a zzso zzso and the empirical zzso method (a zzso zzso We also discuss response rate zzso under truncated zzso space using maximum likelihood zzso with regard to sample size and mean squared zzso The profiles of zzso expected sample size, mean squared error and risk under different approaches motivate us to introduce the concept of zzso sample size zzso
