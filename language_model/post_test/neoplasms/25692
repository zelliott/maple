A retrospective study of the in zzso zzso of skin zzso derived from two groups of patients treated by definitive zzso for a variety of tumors who either displayed or did not display severe zzso 

Seven zzso patients were zzso three were treated for head and neck, prostate and zzso zzso tumors, and did not develop any significant complications zzso zzso four patients were treated for zzso zzso head and neck and zzso canal tumors and developed serious acute and especially late reactions zzso zzso zzso cell cultures of skin zzso were established and their zzso studied by the zzso zzso after exposing to single radiation doses ranging between 1 and 8 zzso 

The survival fraction at 2 zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso with a mean of zzso for the control group, and from zzso to zzso with a mean of zzso for the hypersensitive zzso The zzso zzso test showed that the difference between the two means was statistically significant zzso zzso zzso 

The data are in favor of a correlation between the zzso of patients' zzso and the reactions of different normal zzso to zzso This association supports the use of the zzso survival, or a surrogate test, as a zzso zzso The zzso of normal zzso and zzso implicated in this association suggests the existence of genetic factors that zzso at least in part, the zzso of target cells involved in the expression of normal zzso complications following zzso
