In this paper we introduce a new growth model called T growth zzso This model is capable of representing zzso growth as well as zzso zzso This dual capability is achieved without introducing additional zzso The T model is useful in modeling cellular proliferation or zzso of cancer cells, stem cells, bacterial growth and drug zzso zzso We recommend usage of the T growth model for the growth of tumors as part of any system of differential zzso Use of this model within a system will allow more flexibility in representing the natural rate of tumor zzso For zzso we examine some systems of zzso interaction in which the T growth rate is zzso We also apply the model to a set of tumor growth zzso
