To explore potential indicators of the quality of zzso services for cancer patients that could be monitored using existing administrative zzso 

Quality indicators were identified and assessed by literature review for proposed zzso focus groups with cancer patients and family members to assess candidate indicators and generate new ideas, and an expert panel ranking the zzso and importance of each potential indicator using a modified zzso zzso 

There were three major concepts of poor quality of zzso cancer care that could be examined using zzso administrative data (such as Medicare zzso institution of new zzso therapies or continuation of ongoing treatments very near zzso a high number of emergency room visits, zzso hospital admissions, or intensive care unit days near the end of life; and a high proportion of patients never enrolled in zzso only admitted in the last few days of life, or dying in an acute-care zzso Concepts such as access to zzso and other multidisciplinary services and pain and symptom control are important and may eventually be zzso but they cannot currently be applied in most data zzso zzso based on limiting the use of treatments with low probability of benefit or indicators based on economic efficiency were not acceptable to patients, family members, or zzso 

Several promising zzso quality indicators were identified that, if found to be valid and reliable within data systems, could be useful in identifying health-care systems in need of improving zzso zzso
