Members of the zzso protein zzso family are characterized by an approximately 40 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso by zzso zzso and one of many zzso act as zzso zzso that control the zzso transition of the zzso cell zzso The zzso specificity of zzso complexes is determined by the presence of different zzso zzso that recruit specific zzso for zzso zzso degradation of cellular regulatory proteins has been observed in certain tumors and it is possible that zzso zzso zzso play a role in the altered degradation of cell cycle zzso We have recently identified a family of human zzso As a first step aimed at determining if zzso genes could be involved in human zzso we have mapped the zzso positions of 5 zzso genes by zzso in zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso alias zzso zzso zzso alias zzso zzso zzso alias zzso zzso zzso alias zzso and zzso zzso alias zzso Since most of these are zzso zzso frequently altered in tumors, we have screened 42 human tumor cell lines and 48 human tumor samples by Southern zzso and zzso While no gross zzso of the genes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found, zzso deletion of the zzso gene was found in four of 13 small cell zzso cell zzso This is the first evaluation of genes zzso zzso in human zzso
