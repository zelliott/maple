Fetal growth has been linked with increased risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease later in zzso The zzso growth factor zzso axis has recently been proposed as a predictor of risk of subsequent cancer and cardiovascular zzso However, only few data are available on the possible association between fetal growth and levels of zzso later in zzso We examined the association between markers of fetal growth, zzso birth weight, birth length and zzso Index, from birth records and serum zzso zzso and zzso binding protein 3 zzso levels in zzso middle-aged Danish men and zzso We fitted separate zzso models including birth weight, birth zzso zzso Index and serum zzso zzso and zzso zzso After adjustment for age, alcohol zzso smoking, diabetes zzso zzso and zzso blood pressure, serum total cholesterol and current height and weight, we found negative associations between birth weight and zzso Index, respectively, and serum zzso in men, zzso the mean zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in men birth weight was zzso associated with the zzso + zzso and zzso ratios, which are believed to be indicators of zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, no other associations were found in any of the zzso Between 1 and zzso of the zzso in serum zzso zzso and zzso respectively, could be explained by the statistical models used in the zzso We found very little support to the hypothesis of an association between fetal growth and the zzso axis throughout zzso
