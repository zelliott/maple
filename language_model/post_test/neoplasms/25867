zzso zzso zzso are efficient vehicles for delivering therapeutic genes into zzso zzso However, the high doses required to produce effective gene transfer in zzso can also cause unwanted cellular zzso To improve zzso zzso zzso expression while minimizing adverse zzso we have tested zzso compounds for their ability to enhance zzso zzso We demonstrate increased zzso expression after mixing zzso preparations with zzso zzso zzso and zzso prior to zzso in zzso An zzso zzso zzso was zzso with various zzso and zzso zzso activity was zzso The optimal zzso zzso for zzso zzso gene transfer were zzso zzso zzso 400 zzso zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso expression in three of six established cell zzso Similar results were obtained using primary tumor cell cultures, where zzso expression was increased zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiency in two primary leukemia zzso was improved by 3- and zzso We were unable to demonstrate any benefit when zzso was zzso with zzso zzso prior to zzso injection in a zzso severe combined zzso mouse melanoma tumor zzso Further studies will determine whether zzso can improve zzso gene zzso
