The identification of proteins that are zzso expressed on the membrane of zzso tumor cells is of fundamental importance in cancer zzso Here, we report the systematic comparison of the membrane zzso of two closely related zzso zzso cell lines zzso and zzso of which only one zzso is capable of forming liver zzso in zzso The zzso methodology used in this study featured the surface protein zzso on tumor cells followed by protein zzso on zzso zzso and relative zzso of corresponding zzso peptides by mass zzso zzso The study allowed the identification of zzso proteins and the determination of their relative zzso zzso previously known to be associated with zzso spread were found to be either zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso A dramatic increase in abundance at the cell membrane was observed for a broad variety of proteins zzso zzso group protein zzso which were mainly thought to reside in zzso zzso a finding that was confirmed using zzso laser scanning zzso and zzso analysis of cell zzso Furthermore, we showed by zzso analysis that certain target proteins can readily be reached by zzso administered zzso zzso Finally, we showed that the most promising zzso for zzso zzso approaches are strongly and selectively expressed on the surface of tumor cells in three different zzso mouse models of liver zzso Taken together, our results indicate that the expression of zzso proteins on the membrane of zzso cells is a feature much more common than previously zzso
