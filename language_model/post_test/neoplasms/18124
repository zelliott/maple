zzso of the cell membrane is a basic requirement for maintaining the biological characteristics of a zzso In this study, changes in the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso cervical zzso zzso zzso zzso liver zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells were studied by atomic force zzso zzso both before and after treatment with the zzso drugs, zzso or zzso In response to both drugs, the zzso of the cell membrane of all three cell types displayed similar changes; that is, with increases in drug concentration and reaction time, the degree of zzso changes on the surface of cell membrane zzso These changes included increases in the fluctuation of the surface components of the cell zzso increase in zzso or even the appearance of zzso Cell viability was zzso as determined by optical microscope observation of gross cell zzso and by zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the cell membrane zzso zzso zzso showed that under the action of zzso and zzso zzso values for the cell zzso of all three tumor cell types were positively correlated to the drug concentration and reaction zzso This research has great significance for the visual diagnosis of early stage zzso in tumor cells in response to zzso drugs, as well as in the studies on the interaction between drugs and zzso The use of zzso can be a rapid and sensitive visual method for studying the interaction between cells and zzso
