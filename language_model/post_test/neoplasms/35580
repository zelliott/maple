zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso terminal zzso human zzso chain of type IV zzso is derived from the zzso zzso specifically by zzso Recently we determined the in zzso and in zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso its role in cancer therapy is under zzso To characterize zzso as a potential candidate for drug development and to test its efficacy in animal models, an effective method to produce a zzso active form of zzso is zzso In the present study, expression of zzso in zzso cells using zzso expression system was discussed, this method was found to be effective in the production of a functionally active soluble form of the zzso zzso The zzso protein showed its characteristic activities such as zzso cell zzso migration, and tube formation in zzso zzso
