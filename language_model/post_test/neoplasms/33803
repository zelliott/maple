Human zzso have been identified either by the ability of normal or tumor zzso to induce transformation of cells in culture or as the targets of zzso zzso or DNA amplification in zzso By the combination of these approaches, approximately 40 different genes have been implicated as potential contributors to the development of human zzso The proteins which are zzso by these potential human zzso include plasma membrane proteins with zzso zzso activity, plasma membrane zzso zzso binding zzso zzso proteins with zzso zzso activity and nuclear zzso In many tumors, more than 1 potential zzso has been zzso suggesting that multiple genes may contribute to zzso zzso I will discuss the identification of these zzso their modes of zzso the diversity of their protein products and their potential roles in both zzso and normal zzso
