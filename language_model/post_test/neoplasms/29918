Human peripheral blood zzso cells from normal healthy volunteers were exposed to elevated temperatures of zzso degrees for up to 6 zzso zzso the cells were zzso with zzso in zzso in order to measure indirectly the surviving zzso DNA replication in heated cells in response to zzso was found to be a sensitive indicator of zzso zzso Exposure to even 40 degrees for 2 zzso lowered zzso incorporation at early time points after zzso zzso but the cells were able to recover from zzso injury after exposure for up to 4 zzso at 42 zzso At 43 degrees, exposure for even 1 to 2 zzso caused irreversible zzso The changes in zzso incorporation were not due to changes in zzso zzso pools since parallel changes were observed in DNA zzso zzso Thus, the heat sensitivity of normal human zzso could be a limiting factor for use of zzso as an adjunct to zzso and chemotherapy of human zzso
