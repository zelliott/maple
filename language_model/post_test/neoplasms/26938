zzso cells are the interface between zzso fluid flow and vascular tissue zzso They actively translate physical and chemical stimuli into zzso signaling zzso which in turn regulate cell function, and zzso dysfunction leads to inflammation and diseased zzso For example, zzso a chronic vascular disease, favorably develops in regions of disturbed fluid flow and low zzso zzso zzso or programmed cell death, must be properly regulated to maintain zzso in the vascular zzso The loss of zzso control, as seen in low zzso stress regions, is implicated in various diseases such as zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso is a zzso regulator for various cell types that is localized in the cell zzso and regulates changes in zzso associated with zzso Yet its role in zzso cells remains zzso zzso zzso stress zzso zzso zzso stress, and serum zzso induced zzso zzso while extended zzso elicit structural changes and cell zzso We zzso that zzso potentially plays a role in attenuating zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso We found that zzso stress regulates zzso expression and zzso activity in zzso zzso In fact, zzso stress alone zzso zzso and zzso but has the opposite effect in the presence of zzso triggers such as tissue necrosis factor zzso zzso This review summarizes mechanisms of zzso zzso and zzso and explores the potential of zzso as a novel signaling zzso involved in zzso protective effects of zzso stress on the zzso
