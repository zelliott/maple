The zzso inhibitor zzso remains the only zzso zzso zzso to become a drug zzso and has become a successful treatment for zzso zzso While producing a global cellular effect, zzso zzso have not triggered the catastrophe articulated initially in terms such as zzso of cellular zzso zzso zzso in fact, do have a therapeutic window, although in the case of the zzso zzso it is small zzso to peripheral zzso zzso and, as recently reported, zzso zzso Currently, several second-generation molecules are undergoing clinical evaluation to increase this zzso An alternative strategy is to target zzso zzso zzso acting at zzso zzso zzso and zzso associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso act locally on selected targets rather than on the whole zzso zzso (or zzso in some zzso of these zzso should be developable as selective zzso agents with toxicity profiles superior to that of zzso Various therapeutic hypotheses follow from known cellular mechanisms of these target zzso most hypotheses relate to cancer, reminiscent of the zzso protein zzso zzso now zzso Since zzso tagging controls the cellular content, activity, or zzso of proteins associated with disease, zzso or zzso of zzso zzso or zzso are predicted to have an impact on zzso For practical and empirical reasons, zzso of zzso zzso zzso have been the favored therapeutic zzso In approximately the time that has elapsed since the approval of zzso in 2003, there has been some progress in developing potential zzso drugs that target various zzso zzso zzso An E1 inhibitor and zzso of zzso are now in clinical trial, with some objective responses zzso zzso zzso and/or rational design may uncover improved zzso of these zzso as well as zzso and zzso for further zzso zzso it should become clear whether one or both of the two general strategies for zzso drug discovery will lead to truly superior new medicines for cancer and other zzso This article is part of a Special zzso zzso zzso Drug Discovery and zzso
