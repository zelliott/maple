To improve human primordial zzso zzso 

Thin or thick zzso slices were cultured on zzso scaffolds or in zzso zzso with or without zzso zzso which prevents the conversion of zzso zzso to zzso zzso or zzso which converts zzso to zzso zzso growth was evaluated by zzso counts, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso had a destructive effect on cultured zzso zzso samples had more primordial zzso than samples cultured in basic medium and fewer developing zzso than samples cultured in zzso zzso with zzso There were more zzso zzso in samples cultured on zzso scaffolds than in zzso zzso and in samples cultured in zzso zzso with zzso than in zzso zzso with basic zzso zzso zzso was higher in zzso zzso than on zzso zzso zzso levels were higher in thick than in thin zzso 

zzso zzso appear to have an advantage over zzso scaffolds for zzso human primordial zzso zzso is not increased in the presence of substances that enhance zzso production or with thin rather than thick zzso
