The zzso zzso contains structural features that make it a powerful tool for cancer therapy zzso an extremely high specificity and binding affinity for the target zzso that results in low zzso Several approaches have been zzso zzso zzso targeting a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso zzso targeting a zzso zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso vaccines targeting a zzso zzso zzso zzso or a cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Another approach attempts to harness the cellular arm of the immune response zzso zzso T cells, natural killer zzso for specific killing of tumor zzso The putative underlying mechanism of zzso strategy is the zzso of zzso signaling pathways and induction of zzso Clinical evidence suggests that while most of these zzso achieve limited zzso activity as zzso they are significantly more zzso than single agents when combined with zzso Future use of these agents will include zzso combination zzso regimens as well as zzso zzso zzso to zzso molecules and zzso
