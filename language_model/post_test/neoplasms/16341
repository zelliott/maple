Natural killer zzso T cells are restricted by zzso and play an important role in the rejection of zzso tumors, but how kill these tumors is zzso To investigate this, we cultured zzso zzso T cells in human zzso zzso blood, which was enriched by zzso zzso In short-term (4 zzso zzso zzso the zzso T cells could kill only those targets expressing zzso In longer zzso zzso (20 zzso however, the zzso T cells were able to kill all the tumors, regardless of zzso zzso When each of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso mechanisms were zzso it was apparent that zzso killing dominated in both the zzso and long-term zzso In the short-term zzso zzso killing required that the targets expressed zzso but killing was more efficient if zzso was present because then the zzso mechanism was also zzso Thus, cells that lacked zzso and zzso and were not killed in the zzso zzso were instead zzso in zzso zzso through a combination of zzso and zzso zzso zzso T cells can kill tumor targets by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso killing requires longer contact between zzso and targets, suggesting that zzso acts by enhancing zzso zzso
