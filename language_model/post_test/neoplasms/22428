zzso especially through the use of naturally occurring zzso capable of zzso the process of zzso at one or more steps, is an ideal approach for cancer zzso Despite accomplished outcomes in zzso settings, its zzso to humans has met with limited success for many reasons including inefficient systemic delivery and zzso of promising zzso zzso We have recently introduced a novel concept of zzso that zzso zzso for enhancing the outcome of zzso zzso Res 69, zzso zzso To establish the usefulness of zzso in cancer management, we studied the efficacy of a well identified zzso agent zzso zzso zzso in zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso in zzso zzso zzso was found to retain its biological effectiveness, with over zzso dose advantage compared to zzso zzso for exerting its cell growth zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was also observed to be effective in zzso tumor cell growth in zzso nude mice, with over zzso dose advantage compared to zzso zzso The rate of degradation of zzso zzso was zzso with a complete degradation within 4 zzso whereas zzso had a significantly longer zzso This study provides a foundation for the use of zzso delivery of natural products to enhance the zzso of active agents for their enhanced effective and zzso zzso In doing this, it is hoped that perceived toxicity concerns associated with prolonged use of agents could also be zzso zzso consumption is the most desirable and acceptable form of delivery of zzso zzso One disadvantage of using zzso zzso is its unstable nature in zzso zzso and therefore, it is not recommended for oral zzso To overcome this obstacle, it will be important to develop zzso zzso zzso that are suitable for oral zzso
