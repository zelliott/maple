The purpose of this study was to develop a measure of learned zzso Based on a review of the literature, 50 items were developed for inclusion in the proposed zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of independent reviews by three experts, 20 items were selected for inclusion in the zzso An zzso response to each item was zzso using a zzso zzso A standardized alpha reliability zzso of zzso was obtained for a sample of zzso healthy zzso There was a positive correlation between the zzso scores and zzso zzso zzso zzso scores zzso zzso zzso and a negative correlation between the zzso scores and Rosenberg's zzso zzso zzso scores zzso zzso zzso These correlations were in the direction zzso by various zzso A zzso factor analysis of the zzso data yielded five zzso Three of these factors tapped content relevant to the zzso styles of learned zzso Clinical data were also obtained on samples of zzso zzso and spinal zzso zzso Because the alpha reliability zzso of the zzso and the zzso product moment correlation zzso between the zzso and the HS and the zzso and the zzso were in the same direction, the instrument is believed to have adequate internal zzso
