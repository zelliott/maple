Most early publications on integrated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso devices have reported the new scanner generation to be superior to conventional zzso However, few of these studies have zzso the situation where, in addition to zzso a current CT scan is available for side-by-side zzso This fact is important, because combined zzso or a software-based fusion of the two zzso may improve diagnosis only in cases where side-by-side reading of PET and CT data does not lead to a definitive zzso The aim of this study was to zzso which patients will profit from integrated zzso in terms of zzso zzso 

A total of zzso zzso admitted patients referred for PET in whom a current CT scan was available were included in the zzso The zzso of all pathological PET zzso as well as possible zzso of adjacent anatomical structures, was zzso 

Of zzso pathological zzso zzso were correctly assessed with respect to zzso and zzso by either conventional PET alone zzso or combined reading of PET and the already existing CT scans zzso zzso in only zzso of all zzso affecting zzso of all patients, could evaluation have profited from integrated zzso 

We conclude that side-by-side viewing of PET and CT scans is essential, as in zzso of all cases, combined viewing was important for a correct diagnosis in our zzso In up to zzso of patients, integrated zzso might have given additional information, so that in nearly 50% of patients some form of combined viewing of PET and CT data is needed for accurate zzso zzso
