Previous studies have indicated that proteins that bind zzso can also inhibit the growth of tumor zzso To determine if synthetic peptides also possessed these properties, we tested a series of zzso containing structural motifs from different proteins for their ability to bind zzso and identified one compound termed zzso that had a particularly strong zzso Further studies revealed that zzso also inhibited the growth of tumor cells in tissue culture as well as on the zzso zzso of chicken zzso In addition, expression zzso for zzso caused tumor cells to grow slower in nude mice and reduced their zzso The zzso zzso also inhibited zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of chicken zzso Studies on cultured cells indicated that zzso induced zzso which was blocked by a zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that shortly after its zzso zzso became associated with zzso zzso indicated that zzso could bind to zzso and zzso which are associated with zzso and regulate zzso This was also supported by the fact that zzso induced the release of zzso c from preparations of zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso binds to zzso and related proteins and this activates the zzso zzso
