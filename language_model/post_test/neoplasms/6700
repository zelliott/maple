A range of new zzso structurally related to zzso zzso has been zzso and studied in zzso Three compounds described in this paper zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are all zzso In the mouse zzso zzso cell line, zzso using a 1 h drug exposure followed by colony formation as the response zzso we found zzso zzso and zzso zzso to be 2-3 zzso and zzso zzso more potent then zzso whilst zzso zzso was zzso zzso less zzso For continuous drug exposure and suppression of population growth as the zzso the potency of zzso zzso was similar to that of zzso whereas that of zzso zzso was zzso zzso higher and that of zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso The potency ratios for continuous drug exposure of a human small cell lung cancer line were similar to those for continuous exposure of zzso zzso of the two cell lines selected for resistance to zzso were also zzso These zzso also showed considerable resistance to zzso zzso and zzso zzso but much less resistance to zzso zzso (a zzso zzso A zzso of zzso made resistant to zzso zzso by continuous growth in this drug was more resistant to zzso than it was to zzso zzso Human cells resistant to zzso contained 6 zzso less zzso after 24 h exposure than did the parent line, whereas the ratio of drug content for zzso zzso was only zzso
