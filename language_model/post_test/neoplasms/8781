Recent progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms of zzso immune responses, which may further clarify the immune status of cancer zzso In this study, we performed a detailed evaluation of the zzso status of 47 patients with advanced solid cancer, who had received no zzso treatment, and compared the results with 32 healthy zzso zzso data for peripheral blood were obtained using 19 zzso zzso against various cell surface and zzso zzso Absolute numbers of T cells, several T cell subsets, B cells, and zzso cells were significantly decreased in patients compared with healthy zzso The percentage of zzso T cells was lower and that of zzso T cells was higher in patients compared with zzso Regulatory and type 2 helper T cells were elevated in patients relative to healthy zzso The percentage of zzso zzso cells was significantly lower in patients than in zzso These results suggest a dysfunctional zzso immune response in cancer zzso Furthermore, peripheral blood from 26 of 47 cancer patients was analyzed after adoptive T cell zzso zzso ATI increased the number of T cell subsets, but not B and zzso zzso The number and percentage of regulatory T cells decreased zzso These results suggest that ATI can restore impaired and zzso T cell immune zzso
