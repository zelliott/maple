The finding that zzso like normal zzso are endowed with varying degrees of cellular zzso has far-reaching consequences for our understanding of zzso The cancer stem cell and zzso evolution models have both been proposed to explain zzso cellular zzso Here, we briefly review these two zzso models with special emphasis on how they aid our understanding of cancer and their implications for therapeutic zzso Finally, we discuss the close association between basic stem cell biology and cancer, focusing on the role of zzso
