To determine the way religious coping relates to the use of intensive zzso zzso care among patients with advanced zzso 

A US zzso zzso zzso cohort of 345 patients with advanced cancer, who were enrolled between January 1, 2003, and August 31, zzso The zzso zzso assessed positive religious zzso zzso interviews assessed zzso and zzso measures, advance care planning, and zzso treatment zzso Patients were followed up until death, a median of 122 days after baseline zzso
