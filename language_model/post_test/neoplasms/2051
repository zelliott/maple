We have developed a method of in zzso stimulation of zzso and zzso using immobilized anti zzso zzso instead of zzso zzso After this treatment, proliferation of T cells was greatly zzso zzso zzso were cultured by zzso coated 96 well culture plate for about one week with zzso human serum and zzso of zzso supplemented zzso zzso and then transferred to plain zzso zzso increased in number by more than zzso after 3 zzso zzso obtained from 10 zzso of peripheral blood were cultured in zzso culture flask (75 zzso with 10 zzso of medium for about one week, and then in plain zzso and finally expanded by culture in zzso culture zzso zzso proliferated by more than zzso after 2 zzso zzso or zzso cultured by this method contained over zzso activated T cells positive for the zzso marker, and zzso About zzso of these were zzso and about zzso were zzso Only a small number of zzso zzso cells were detected in every zzso
