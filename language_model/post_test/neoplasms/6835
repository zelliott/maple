One of the major decisions that germ cells make during their development is whether to differentiate into zzso or zzso In mice, the germ zzso decision to develop as male or female depends on zzso zzso molecules in the embryonic zzso environment rather than the sex zzso constitution of the germ cells zzso In response to these zzso cues, germ cells in female zzso initiate zzso and enter zzso whereas germ cells in male zzso initiate zzso and inhibit zzso until after zzso However, it is not clear whether the zzso molecules that mediate germ cell sex determination act in the developing zzso or the developing zzso or what these zzso molecules might zzso Here, we review the evidence for the existence of zzso and zzso substances in the developing zzso and more recent studies aimed at identifying these molecules in zzso In addition, we discuss the possibility that some of the reported effects of these factors on germ cell development may be indirect consequences of zzso sexual differentiation of zzso zzso cells or germ cell zzso zzso the molecular mechanisms of germ cell sex determination may provide candidate genes for zzso to germ cell zzso and zzso in zzso
