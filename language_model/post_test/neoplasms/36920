Id genes zzso members of the zzso zzso family of zzso factors that inhibit zzso by forming inactive zzso with basic zzso zzso zzso There are four members of the Id gene family recognized in zzso and the proteins they zzso share zzso primarily in their zzso zzso zzso proteins typically form zzso with other zzso zzso and their basic domain binds to a DNA sequence element, the zzso zzso zzso Products of Id genes lack the basic DNA binding domain of the zzso zzso factors, and when they zzso with zzso zzso the complexes are zzso Generally, high levels of Id zzso are detected in zzso zzso zzso cells and lower levels are detected in zzso mature, adult zzso In zzso these genes are generally expressed at lower levels in cells after the induction of zzso Recently, high levels of expression of Id genes have been identified in cell lines derived from a wide variety of different tumors and in tumor zzso as zzso These findings suggest that not only the inappropriate proliferation of tumors but also the zzso characteristics that contribute to their zzso behavior may be regulated by Id gene zzso
