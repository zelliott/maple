zzso research concerning electric and magnetic fields in relation to cancer has focused on the potential zzso roles of residential exposure on childhood cancer and occupational exposure on adult leukemia and brain zzso Future residential studies must concentrate on exposure assessment that is enhanced by developing models of historical exposure, assessment of the relation between magnetic fields and wire codes, and consideration of alternate exposure zzso Study design issues deserving attention include possible biases in random zzso zzso control selection, consideration of the zzso course of exposure and disease, and acquisition of the necessary information to assess the potential value of zzso zzso zzso priorities are comprehensive evaluation of exposure patterns and sources and examination of the sociology and geography of residential wire zzso Future occupational studies should also concentrate on improved exposure assessment with increased attention to zzso worker populations and development of historical exposure indicators that are superior to job titles zzso Potential zzso in the workplace that could act as zzso need to be more carefully zzso The zzso relation between exposure and disease and possible effect modification by other workplace agents should be incorporated into future zzso The most pressing need is for measurement of exposure patterns in a variety of worker populations and performance of traditional zzso evaluations of cancer zzso The principal source of bias toward the zzso is zzso zzso of exposure with improvements expected to enhance any true zzso association that is zzso zzso away from the zzso might include biased control selection in residential studies and chemical zzso acting as zzso in occupational zzso
