zzso is a zzso protein involved in tumor growth and zzso However its zzso value for survival in patients with solid tumor remains zzso 

Several databases were zzso including zzso zzso and Cochrane zzso The zzso were overall survival zzso zzso survival zzso The pooled hazard ratio zzso or odds ratio zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso were calculated employing zzso or zzso models depending on the zzso of the included zzso 

zzso eligible trials involving zzso patients were ultimately zzso A summary hazard ratio zzso of all studies and zzso hazard ratios were zzso The combined zzso suggested that a positive zzso expression had an impact on overall survival zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso in all eligible studies and progress free survival zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Similar results were also observed in zzso analysis, according to tumor types, regions, patients' number and publication zzso 

Our findings suggested that zzso protein expression might be a factor for a poor prognosis in patients with solid zzso So large zzso prospective studies are now needed to confirm the clinical utility of zzso as an independent zzso zzso
