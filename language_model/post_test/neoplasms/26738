Despite considerable effort, application of zzso zzso technology has had only modest success in improving treatment outcomes in patients with solid zzso zzso the cancer zzso activity of zzso through zzso to highly potent zzso zzso to create zzso zzso zzso offers a strategy for developing zzso drugs of great zzso Early zzso exhibited zzso profiles similar to those of zzso zzso agents and their performance in clinical trials in cancer patients was generally zzso However, the recent clinical development of zzso that have highly potent zzso agents as their zzso have profoundly changed the outlook for zzso zzso Twenty-five such zzso are in clinical development and one, zzso zzso was approved by the zzso in August, 2011, for the treatment of patients with Hodgkin's zzso and patients with zzso large cell lymphoma, based on a high rate of durable responses in single arm phase II clinical zzso More recently, a second zzso zzso zzso has shown excellent zzso activity with the presentation of results of a zzso zzso phase III trial in patients with zzso zzso breast zzso Treatment with this zzso zzso zzso resulted in a significantly improved zzso survival of zzso months compared with zzso months for zzso plus zzso in the zzso arm and significantly prolonged overall zzso Besides demonstrating excellent zzso these zzso were remarkably well zzso Thus these, and other zzso in development, promise to achieve the long sought goal of zzso technology, that is, of having compounds with high zzso activity at doses where adverse effects are generally zzso
