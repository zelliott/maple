The aim of this research was to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that selectively target zzso zzso zzso and clear rapidly from the whole zzso 

zzso zzso antagonists, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso with zzso at the zzso zzso and labeled with zzso The zzso labeled zzso and zzso were subjected to in zzso zzso zzso zzso and imaging studies using nude mice bearing the zzso zzso human melanoma zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso specifically bound in zzso to zzso zzso zzso at a zzso zzso This zzso binding was completely blocked by a zzso excess of cold zzso to zzso The higher zzso affinity of the zzso zzso was reflected in higher tumor zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso at zzso and 2 zzso The tumor zzso were inhibited by the zzso of 200 zzso of zzso indicating that the zzso was zzso zzso These zzso were zzso primarily via the zzso zzso The zzso activity retained in the whole body was quite comparable between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso at 2 zzso The higher peak tumor zzso and longer retention resulted in higher zzso ratios for the zzso zzso at 2 h with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for blood, liver, zzso zzso heart, stomach, zzso bone and muscle, zzso The imaging studies with the zzso zzso also clearly zzso the zzso tumor at 4 zzso 

The zzso zzso showed an improve tumor targeting zzso with rapid zzso and prolonged retention in the zzso zzso zzso This together with the rapid zzso clearance zzso warrants further studies on this zzso analog for molecular imaging of zzso zzso vessels and various zzso human tumors expressing the zzso
