The work in biomedical laboratories is associated with exposure to a mixture of known and potential chemical zzso zzso and zzso Previous studies have suggested an excess of brain tumors and zzso system zzso as well as breast zzso in zzso 

This retrospective cohort study investigated the standardized mortality ratio zzso and the standardized zzso ratio zzso for cancer in biomedical research laboratory personnel in Swedish universities zzso The cohort comprised zzso laboratory and, as an internal reference group, zzso zzso zzso 

The overall death rate was lower in both groups than in the general zzso The zzso for brain tumors among male laboratory workers was zzso zzso and among male laboratory scientists, after more than 10 years of work (4 zzso it was zzso zzso There was an elevated zzso for zzso melanoma among female scientists in laboratories zzso zzso and for male scientists in zzso departments zzso zzso The zzso for breast cancer among female laboratory scientists was zzso zzso 

The present findings lend some support to an excess of brain tumors among male scientists and of breast cancer in female scientists in biomedical research zzso
