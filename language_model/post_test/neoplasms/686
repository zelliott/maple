zzso zzso was used to identify zzso differences in B cells from patients with melanoma and normal zzso In zzso zzso B cells were assessed for responsiveness and also used as zzso of zzso T cells in mixed zzso zzso 

We show zzso zzso in patients with advanced melanoma zzso zzso 26) and other solid tumors zzso zzso zzso marked by a relative and absolute loss of zzso zzso B cells and associated with an zzso systemic zzso zzso B cells from patients with melanoma zzso zzso zzso molecules and zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso and zzso zzso 9 zzso zzso B cells from patients induced proliferation of zzso zzso T cells, but these T cells poorly zzso zzso and zzso These effects were zzso by using zzso normal donor zzso B cells in these same zzso linking the predominance of zzso B cells in patients with the observed functional zzso Indeed, zzso dysfunction in patients strongly correlated with the extent of loss of zzso B cells in peripheral zzso 

zzso zzso zzso is a previously zzso feature of patients with advanced melanoma and other zzso and may represent an unanticipated mechanism of immune incompetence in zzso
