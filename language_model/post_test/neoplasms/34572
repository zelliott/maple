zzso are a group of specific proteins that zzso bind to carbohydrates inside and outside zzso To date, an increasing number of animal zzso have been found and zzso into several families in terms of the significant primary structural zzso while the zzso is not always zzso These zzso can exert immense biological functions mainly through their specific zzso interactions in a variety of zzso In cancer biology, zzso zzso changes on many zzso and zzso are often observed and numerous experimental zzso have revealed that these structural changes are related to tumor zzso zzso which are broadly expressed animal zzso can play crucial biological roles in tumor zzso or zzso interactions through their binding activities to the tumor cell surface zzso zzso Certain zzso family proteins have also shown to affect tumor cell survival, signal zzso and proliferation mainly inside the zzso zzso which are one of the zzso zzso and expressed zzso and/or vascular zzso can also play an immense role in tumor cell zzso and zzso In addition, certain zzso family zzso which are originally known as zzso binding zzso have been revealed to possess the zzso binding activity, and these novel functions in tumors are being zzso zzso how zzso interactions function in tumor cells will be one of the important goals in cancer zzso This review focuses on the role of these zzso and their zzso in cancer progression and zzso
