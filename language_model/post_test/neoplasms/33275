If one envisions zzso cells zzso as nature's zzso then it is easy to predict that they would be advantageous for cancer zzso Advances in culture processes that generate large numbers of zzso and functionally mature zzso raised the possibility that zzso might be promising clinical agents to generate effective immune responses against zzso The use of mature zzso as cellular vaccines was proposed to be superior to conventional strategies aimed at treating cancer, yet a phase III clinical trial in patients with melanoma demonstrated no increased benefit of zzso over standard zzso Despite this and other apparent failures, we propose that zzso therapy should not be discarded but rather zzso The zzso of zzso and their interaction with other innate cells and regulatory and zzso pathways must be clearly understood before the full therapeutic benefit of zzso are zzso Several aspects of DC vaccination require zzso including the zzso effective delivery of vaccines to zzso in zzso zzso incorporation of components that induce appropriate DC zzso and zzso of innate and zzso interactions and reduction of regulatory zzso networks or zzso zzso that hinder the function of immune zzso Application of this knowledge is resulting in encouraging new data in zzso settings, where multiple arms of the immune system are targeted for cancer zzso
