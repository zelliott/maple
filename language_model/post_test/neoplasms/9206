zzso of zzso zzso proteins play a critical role in the control of survival and cell death by regulating key signaling events such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Because zzso high expression of zzso proteins represents a frequent zzso event in human zzso therapeutic targeting of zzso proteins is considered as a promising zzso Several zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins that mimic the binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso second zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso proteins have been developed over the past few zzso zzso zzso have been shown in various zzso cancer models to either directly initiate cell death or, zzso to prime cancer cells for zzso therapies by lowering the threshold for cell death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are currently under evaluation in early clinical trials alone or in combination zzso Thus, the concept to zzso target zzso proteins in human cancer has in principle been successfully transferred into a clinical setting and warrants further evaluation as a treatment zzso
