DNA has been identified as a primary target for zzso drug design and remains one of the most promising biological receptors for the development of zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a novel zzso by triggering zzso zzso overproduction in cancer zzso In the present work, the underlying mechanisms of the zzso action of zzso were further zzso by evaluating its DNA interaction properties and the regulating zzso zzso Our results showed that zzso could effectively activate DNA strand breaks in zzso cells in a zzso manner after cellular zzso zzso of a DNA damage marker zzso zzso zzso was thus zzso in treated zzso DNA damage subsequently activated zzso zzso and inhibited the expression of zzso resulting in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso The interactions between the complexes and cancer cell zzso and calf zzso DNA were characterized by zzso zzso zzso intensity and zzso zzso which clearly demonstrated the zzso binding of the complexes to zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso as a promising zzso agent, zzso cancer cell zzso by triggering DNA zzso zzso zzso
