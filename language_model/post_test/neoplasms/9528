Current in zzso culture systems allow the generation of human zzso zzso cells zzso The aim of this study was to assess the effect of zzso zzso zzso on the proliferation of human peripheral zzso zzso zzso and their differentiation into more committed precursor cells zzso using in zzso culture zzso zzso separated zzso cells were cultured in zzso as well as in zzso liquid suspension cultures to investigate the expansion and/or zzso of zzso zzso and more mature zzso cells zzso zzso zzso cells were cultured in zzso to zzso zzso zzso including zzso In the zzso cell culture supplemented with zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor zzso the frequency of zzso was significantly higher in the zzso fraction than in the zzso population, thus suggesting functional zzso expression on zzso zzso suspension culture of zzso cells revealed the potent effect of FL on the expansion of zzso in zzso with zzso and zzso zzso In addition, FL strongly induced the maturation of zzso into functional zzso zzso in zzso liquid suspension zzso Moreover, these zzso zzso showed remarkable potential to differentiate into mature zzso with surface zzso zzso which induced a distinct zzso zzso zzso These results clearly demonstrate that FL supports not only the proliferation of early zzso zzso cells, but also the maturation process of committed precursor cells along with the zzso zzso zzso it is possible to develop a more efficient zzso cancer zzso using this specific zzso zzso zzso in zzso in the near zzso
