zzso zzso were evaluated in children receiving concurrent zzso zzso which enhanced the zzso toxicity of zzso 

zzso was administered orally, daily for 5 days starting at 28 zzso per day with zzso to 40, 55, 75 and 100 zzso per day with zzso zzso daily for 5 days at doses of 60, 90 or 120 zzso per zzso Plasma samples were drawn over 48 h after the day 5 zzso zzso was zzso with a validated zzso mass zzso zzso 

zzso was rapidly absorbed zzso T zzso zzso zzso The mean apparent clearance zzso zzso zzso was similar to the zzso for zzso alone and was not zzso or zzso There was minimal zzso zzso 

The enhanced zzso toxicity resulting from combining zzso with zzso does not appear to be the result of a zzso interaction between the zzso
