zzso which is a common problem in cancer patients, has a negative effect on survival by decreasing the efficacy of chemotherapy and particularly of zzso as well as zzso the quality of life zzso of zzso zzso human zzso zzso decreases a patient's need for zzso and increases their zzso The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of weekly zzso EPO treatment on zzso rates, zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, patients were followed up for a long period to assess the impact of EPO treatment on zzso The study was conducted from December 2001 to December 2002 in patients with newly diagnosed zzso or solid tumors using a prospective and controlled zzso zzso was given as a single dose of 450 zzso once a week for 12 zzso The study and control groups included 16 patients zzso zzso levels measured in the study group at the 4th, 8th, and 12th weeks were significantly higher than the values recorded before the start of zzso In the control group, zzso levels post chemotherapy were significantly lower than values recorded prior to zzso The increased zzso levels in the study group were significant at the 8th and 12th weeks of treatment compared to levels measured prior to zzso In the control group, zzso levels at the 4th and 8th weeks were significantly lower than zzso zzso When the percent increase of zzso levels of the study and control groups with respect to treatment week was zzso the difference was statistically significant at the 4th, 8th, and 12th zzso Although the increase on the performance scale within each group during treatment was significant in both the study and control groups, the increase was more marked in the study zzso The percent increase on the performance scale with respect to week of treatment was higher in the study group than in the control zzso In EPO treatment group, side effects were seen in 38% of patients, with zzso being local pain in the injection area, zzso local zzso and zzso zzso The mean follow-up period of the study and control group was zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso years, zzso no statistically significant difference existed between these zzso zzso survival at the end of 7 years of follow-up was zzso and zzso for the study and control groups, zzso The use of zzso in zzso and solid tumor patients on a zzso regimen zzso zzso was determined to be effective in increasing zzso levels, decreasing zzso rates, and improving zzso This regimen was safe, did not cause serious side effects, and can be recommended because of its high patient compliance and zzso An effect of EPO on prognosis was not zzso We could not have an explanation on the effect of EPO treatment on zzso as there were low number of patients and zzso patients died zzso zzso a larger number of patients are needed to clarify the effect of EPO treatment on zzso
