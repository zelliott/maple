Little information is available on the conditional probabilities of death among patients who survive for zzso years after a diagnosis with zzso The objective of this study was to estimate the conditional probabilities of death for breast cancer, prostate cancer, zzso cancer, and lung cancer in zzso 

The study included data from the French Network of Cancer zzso from zzso patients aged zzso years who were diagnosed with cancer between 1989 and zzso The conditional probabilities of death were calculated by using a relative survival zzso model in which age was included as a zzso 

After the first year and until 10 years after diagnosis, the annual probability of death decreased dramatically for zzso zzso It was the same in all age groups after 3 years, and it was approximately zzso at 10 zzso For prostate cancer, the decrease was not as great, and the conditional probability of death remained higher among younger patients at zzso at 10 zzso During the 3 years after diagnosis, the probability of death was greater for older patients with breast zzso then, it decreased less for younger patients compared with older patients, leading to a greater conditional probability of death among younger patients at 4 years and up to 10 zzso The annual probability of death in patients with lung cancer decreased for both sexes but remained substantially higher for men than for women, reaching approximately zzso and zzso respectively, at 10 zzso 

Further studies would facilitate a better understanding of the observed differences in relative survival within European zzso
