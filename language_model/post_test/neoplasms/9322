The zzso zzso targets the external domain of zzso membrane zzso which is expressed in the zzso of zzso solid zzso This phase I trial tested the hypothesis that zzso could be used as a vascular targeting platform for patients with zzso solid zzso 

Patients with progressive solid tumors were zzso Twenty patients, divided into six dosage zzso of 3 to 6 patients each, were treated every 3 weeks to a maximum of four doses using either 5, 10, 20, 40, 60, or 100 zzso of zzso zzso Two milligrams of zzso were labeled with 10 zzso of zzso 

Patients with a wide variety of solid tumors were zzso all had good tumor zzso No zzso zzso were zzso The serum clearance rate decreased with increasing zzso mass, likely a result of early zzso zzso of zzso zzso for each successive cohort was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso seemed to occur by 60 zzso zzso of 18 zzso patients with soft tissue disease on standard scans showed zzso in the soft zzso on zzso scans as did 6 of 6 patients with bone zzso 

The zzso zzso of a variety of solid tumors can be selectively and safely targeted using zzso In planning for future studies using zzso as a radiation delivery platform, an zzso mass of 60 zzso should be considered, as it would seem to minimize the radiation delivered to the liver while minimizing the radiation dose to zzso
