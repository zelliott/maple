zzso zzso 2A zzso regulates almost all cell signaling zzso It consists of a scaffolding A zzso to which a zzso C zzso and one of many regulatory B zzso zzso Of the more than 80 zzso zzso zzso use zzso as a zzso This study demonstrates the zzso function of the A scaffold zzso zzso have shown the importance of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso Comparisons of zzso and zzso small T zzso zzso zzso in the control of zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso zzso signaling regulated zzso its zzso or zzso promoted or blocked it, zzso zzso bound zzso Enhancement of zzso zzso interaction by zzso small T zzso increased turnover of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso promoted zzso activity and reduced turnover of zzso at zzso of zzso These data provide new insight into the regulation of zzso a protein of extreme importance in zzso Furthermore, our results suggest that the role for zzso in differentiation and perhaps tumor suppression may lie partly in its ability to zzso regulate zzso
