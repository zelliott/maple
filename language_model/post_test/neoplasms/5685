A problem likely to be encountered in any cancer zzso based on vaccination with a single protein or zzso is variation in the host zzso A particularly zzso example is provided by the two zzso zzso one zzso and the other zzso zzso by the avian zzso virus zzso zzso of the zzso hormones zzso zzso and the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso 

zzso to these two proteins were zzso by zzso zzso zzso in zzso from zzso rats zzso by zzso induced zzso 

Among the four zzso tested, zzso rats exhibited a significantly lower response to the zzso zzso than the high zzso zzso and zzso while zzso rat strains had an intermediate zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso indicated that the response is controlled, as expected, by the class II locus of the zzso In contrast, these rat strains responded zzso to the zzso zzso zzso 

These results support the hypothesis that zzso restriction of the response to zzso proteins reflects mainly a tolerance zzso They sound a note of warning for cancer vaccine development, and also one of positive zzso The likelihood of zzso restriction suggests that a widely zzso zzso vaccine should be the final aim in cancer zzso Yet, zzso evidence of zzso restriction can help establish that a candidate vaccine is likely to prove zzso
