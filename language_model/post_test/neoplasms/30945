zzso is an zzso zzso with broad zzso activity in zzso In previous phase I trials, the zzso toxicity of this agent was zzso zzso a phase I and zzso study of a zzso infusion of zzso in combination with zzso stimulating factor was zzso In this article, we report the results of the zzso zzso zzso patients were studied over a dosage range of 150 to 555 zzso The plasma elimination of zzso was zzso with a mean zzso zzso zzso alpha of zzso zzso zzso zzso and a mean zzso zzso zzso beta of 82 zzso 92 zzso zzso was 840 zzso 230 zzso A limited sampling strategy was developed to allow the zzso of total drug exposure zzso under the plasma zzso zzso from the plasma zzso zzso at 30, 60, and 120 zzso after the start of the zzso The zzso behavior of a presumed zzso zzso not previously described in plasma was also zzso Based on in zzso zzso studies with partially zzso extract of this compound, we do not believe that it contributes to the zzso effects of zzso at the zzso observed in zzso Finally, zzso elimination was linear over the nearly zzso dose range zzso indicating that when dose adjustments are made, systemic drug exposure will remain zzso
