We have studied the cellular expression of zzso a zzso proposed to be human zzso tumor associated described zzso Analysis of cells bearing this zzso in zzso zzso shows expression in tumor cells of zzso origin zzso zzso and to a limited degree in breast cancer zzso Within such tumors, there is a weak inverse correlation between labeling index and zzso zzso Furthermore, evidence is presented to show that the cells bearing this zzso are physically zzso from those bearing zzso zzso
