zzso is a zzso target of the tumor zzso zzso and encodes an unusual zzso protein involved in zzso gene zzso zzso is expressed in all cell types investigated so far, with the highest levels in the brain, and is enriched in stem cells as compared with more differentiated cells of the same zzso zzso binds to both long zzso zzso zzso and short zzso zzso We have shown that zzso acts in a positive feedback loop that zzso zzso zzso through an zzso element zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Our preliminary data indicate a more general effect of zzso on zzso zzso Here we shall zzso current knowledge about zzso and discuss possible implications on zzso function and other cellular zzso
