The zzso process zzso cell damage and death by the combined effect of a zzso zzso visible light, and molecular zzso which generate zzso oxygen zzso and other zzso oxygen species that are responsible for zzso The most important application of this process with increasing biomedical interest is the zzso therapy zzso of zzso In addition to zzso drugs, 2nd generation zzso with better zzso properties are now studied using cell cultures, experimental tumors and clinical zzso zzso is a structural zzso of zzso and constitutes an interesting new class of zzso zzso derivatives show higher zzso than zzso in the red spectral region zzso zzso 600 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the lower molecular zzso zzso and zzso properties of zzso make them excellent candidates as zzso showing fast zzso and diverse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Several zzso and the zzso zzso zzso induce zzso and cell death in zzso zzso treatments of cultured tumor cells with zzso and its zzso complex induce zzso changes, zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso cell zzso Some zzso and zzso studies on experimental tumors after intravenous or topical application of zzso zzso zzso derivatives are zzso Taking into account all these features, zzso zzso should be very useful for zzso of cancer and other biomedical zzso
