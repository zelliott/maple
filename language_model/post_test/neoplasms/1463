There has been a lack of powerful tools for systematic analysis of zzso gene function, but zzso interference zzso may now provide such a zzso zzso zzso of zzso triggers from suitable expression zzso integrated into the host cell zzso by viral gene transfer can induce long-term and zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso However, the use of zzso as a genetic tool is limited by difficulties in identifying efficient zzso zzso the problem of effective delivery and zzso effects, as well as potential zzso side effects of viral gene transfer zzso Recent insights into the molecular mechanisms of zzso processes zzso by either zzso or zzso will allow further zzso of zzso triggers as genetic zzso
