In the present study, we aimed to validate the zzso Universal zzso zzso zzso for routine nutritional screening in the radiation zzso setting, thus enabling timely and adequate referrals of patients at risk for zzso or advanced zzso zzso this objective, we conducted a prospective zzso study in 450 zzso cancer patients zzso zzso referred for zzso The following were the nutritional zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso weight loss zzso % in the previous 3-6 months, zzso zzso Global Assessment zzso - zzso for zzso and nutritional risk by zzso zzso zzso zzso values and zzso were calculated to validate zzso zzso zzso and compare single parameters zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a negligible capacity to detect zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value and zzso negative zzso zzso zzso percentage weight loss zzso zzso was highly zzso zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value and zzso negative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso successfully detected patients at risk: zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value and zzso negative zzso value; percentage weight loss zzso zzso proved able to identify patients likely to be at risk: zzso sensitivity, zzso zzso zzso positive zzso value and zzso negative zzso zzso This is the first study in the radiation zzso setting to validate zzso a simple and quick method zzso by any health professional, with a high zzso for early zzso zzso to zzso a comprehensive nutritional assessment and guide for zzso In this study, percentage weight loss in the previous 3-6 months does seem valid to predict nutritional risk, and may be the minimum in a busy zzso
