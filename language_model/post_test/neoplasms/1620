Recent technical advances in zzso chemistry, zzso and zzso have made available large databases of biological and chemical information that have the potential to dramatically improve our understanding of cancer biology at the molecular zzso Such an understanding of cancer biology could have a substantial impact on how we zzso zzso and manage cancer cases in the clinical zzso One of the biggest challenges facing clinical zzso is how to extract clinically useful knowledge from the overwhelming amount of raw molecular data that are currently zzso In this paper, we discuss how the exploratory data analysis techniques of machine learning and zzso zzso can be applied to extract clinically useful knowledge from a zzso assortment of molecular zzso After an introductory overview of machine learning and zzso techniques, we describe two proprietary zzso zzso and zzso that we have found to be useful in the exploratory analysis of large biological data zzso We next zzso by way of three examples, the zzso of these techniques to cancer zzso diagnosis, and management using three very different types of molecular zzso We first discuss the use of our exploratory analysis techniques on zzso mass zzso data for the detection of zzso zzso Next, we discuss the diagnostic use of these techniques on gene expression data to differentiate between zzso and zzso of the zzso Finally, we illustrate the use of such techniques in selecting from a database of chemical compounds those most effective in managing patients with melanoma versus zzso
