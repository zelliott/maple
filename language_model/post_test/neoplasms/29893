Patients with primary zzso zzso and zzso secondary to zzso zzso were compared with regard to circulating zzso zzso zzso cells zzso using in zzso tissue culture zzso Although increased numbers of zzso had previously been well documented in zzso few patients with the secondary variety had been zzso Our data indicate that there is an increase in circulating zzso in patients with zzso but it is significantly lower than in those with zzso It is suggested that in both conditions disruption of the zzso zzso system results in a release of zzso to the zzso In zzso stem cell colonization of the zzso with its zzso zzso zzso may be responsible for the additional increase in zzso The determination of zzso numbers may provide additional data to help to distinguish zzso and zzso in zzso cases where the distinction is zzso
