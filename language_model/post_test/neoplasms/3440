To develop zzso zzso against the zzso zzso of human zzso zzso for its expression detection of human zzso 

A dominant zzso in zzso zzso zzso automatically zzso based on zzso method, and was used to zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated and screened by zzso for specific zzso zzso and the characterization of which were performed by Western zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso was zzso and confirmed by zzso and zzso zzso Three zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso designated as zzso zzso and A11 were established after primary screening and zzso three rounds of limited zzso Both of zzso and zzso were zzso while A11 was zzso in zzso The competitive zzso showed that the zzso were zzso specific, and the affinity of zzso was stronger than that of zzso and A11 zzso by affinity zzso However, in Western zzso both of zzso and zzso stained an about 123 zzso protein band with zzso and zzso cell extracts but not with normal zzso zzso Besides, positive zzso presented in the nucleus of zzso while zzso was zzso zzso The sections from zzso blocks of zzso cases of human cancer, 40 of zzso and 19 of benign tumors were in zzso stained by zzso zzso the results showed that the human cancer zzso were zzso zzso positive in specific nuclear reaction, on the contrary, only a minority of zzso zzso present weak positive zzso zzso and negative in benign tumors zzso 

The zzso zzso developed against synthetic zzso were zzso and could recognize both the native and the zzso zzso Thus their use in zzso or zzso for detecting the zzso zzso expression of cancer cell and zzso was zzso
