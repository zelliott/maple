We present arguments that suggest that historical average calculated fields, which are widely used to estimate biologically relevant exposure to electromagnetic fields, may be less accurate than contemporary spot zzso which are made at a time following the biologically relevant period of zzso We use data from the seminal zzso and zzso study of the health effects of electromagnetic field exposure in a Swedish population to illustrate our zzso We also show how the two types of zzso can produce divergent estimates of risk, and show how in the zzso and zzso study, the less accurate zzso the historical average calculated fields, may have resulted in a zzso increase in the estimates of zzso Finally, we consider the implications of our arguments for other studies that rely on wire codes and historical calculations of personal zzso
