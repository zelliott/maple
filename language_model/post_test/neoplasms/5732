To examine the mortality pattern and the cancer zzso in a cohort of long term zzso workers exposed to zzso 

The cohort consists of zzso male lead battery workers, employed for at least three months in zzso From 1969 the values of all blood lead samples repeatedly obtained from these workers every two to three months, have been collected in a zzso The expected mortality and morbidity zzso was estimated from the county rates, specified for cause, sex, five-year age groups, and calendar zzso Individual exposure zzso have been calculated and used for zzso zzso 

The total cohort showed an increased overall mortality zzso mortality ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso an increased mortality from zzso heart diseases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These risk estimates were unaffected or slightly decreased when applying a zzso period of 15 years, and no zzso pattern was zzso The zzso raised cancer zzso in the gastrointestinal tract (11 zzso in the total zzso increased to a barely significant level in the zzso with the highest cumulative lead exposure zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso No clear dose response pattern was evident when further zzso the data into those first employed up to 1969 v those first employed after 1969 when the blood lead monitoring zzso zzso The risk estimate for zzso in the gastrointestinal tract was not related to zzso zzso The cancer zzso was not increased at other zzso 

A slightly increased zzso of gastrointestinal zzso was found in workers exposed to lead and employed before zzso The lead cohort also showed an increased mortality from zzso heart zzso These risk estimates did not show a zzso pattern and were not associated with zzso zzso The results must also be interpreted with caution because of limited numbers, and lack of dietary and smoking zzso
