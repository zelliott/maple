zzso zzso which have targeting zzso for tumor cells on the zzso no natural zzso and carry a therapeutic payload should be constructed soon and tested in zzso zzso Nevertheless, there are still important considerations for the design and therapeutic use of zzso zzso Perhaps the single greatest challenge in the future, as it was in the past, will be finding zzso that have a higher apparent affinity for tumor and/or tumor zzso cells then normal zzso However, the advent of many rapidly advancing technologies and information including the sequencing of the human zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso display, rapid analysis of gene and protein expression in any context, and new cellular targets such as zzso zzso cells, may provide many opportunities for the discovery of novel and useful zzso In addition, the interests in targeting zzso are rapidly growing with new journals and meetings solely devoted to this subject increasing zzso Within the next 5 years, we should have meaningful clinical data on zzso zzso to reassess our zzso
