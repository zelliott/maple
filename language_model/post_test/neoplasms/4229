To overcome the need for multiple zzso to collect enough zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are used to process multiple blood volumes per zzso We compared the efficiency of zzso cell collection by zzso zzso zzso zzso median blood volumes processed zzso with that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 38; median blood volumes processed zzso To achieve this in patients with different peripheral blood zzso of zzso cells, we analyzed the ratio of zzso cells collected per unit of blood volume zzso divided by the number of zzso cells in total blood volume at the beginning of zzso For zzso zzso zzso of circulating zzso cells were collected per blood volume compared with zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in zzso patients, peripheral blood zzso zzso decreased a median of zzso during zzso zzso data for zzso not zzso The number of zzso cells collected per blood volume processed after 4 and 8 blood volumes and at the end of zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso zzso zzso despite the zzso decrease in peripheral blood zzso zzso throughout zzso A median zzso decrease in the zzso count was also observed during zzso Thus, zzso may be more efficient than zzso for zzso collection, zzso in most patients, the collection in one zzso of sufficient zzso to support zzso zzso
