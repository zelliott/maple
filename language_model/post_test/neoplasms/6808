Cancer is a disease in which many of the characteristics of normal cell behavior are lost or zzso zzso cell proliferation and inappropriate cell survival are common features of all zzso but in addition defects in cellular zzso that lead to tissue zzso the acquisition of inappropriate migratory and invasive characteristics and the generation of zzso instability through defects in zzso also accompany progression of the zzso This volume is focused on the zzso and zzso zzso key players that zzso these cellular zzso zzso and zzso form highly zzso dynamic zzso that are capable of organizing zzso zzso and zzso zzso defining cell polarity and generating both pushing and zzso zzso In the cell cycle, these two zzso structures drive zzso separation and cell zzso During zzso they determine cell shape and zzso and promote stable zzso and zzso zzso through their interactions with zzso and zzso zzso Finally, during cell migration they generate zzso forces at the front and zzso forces at the zzso These are all aspects of cell behavior than often go awry in zzso This volume brings together those interested in understanding the contribution of the zzso and zzso zzso to the cell biology of zzso
