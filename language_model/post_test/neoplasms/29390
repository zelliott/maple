zzso may improve survival in patients with cancer through an zzso effect in addition to the perceived zzso zzso 

To evaluate the efficacy and safety of zzso zzso in patients with cancer with no therapeutic or zzso indication for zzso 

A comprehensive search included zzso an electronic search zzso zzso of the following zzso Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials zzso zzso 1, 2010, zzso zzso and zzso the Web of zzso zzso zzso of conference zzso zzso checking of references of included zzso and zzso use of the zzso zzso feature in zzso 

zzso controlled trials zzso assessing the benefits and harms of zzso zzso in patients with cancer but no therapeutic or zzso indication for zzso 

Using a standardized form we extracted in duplicate data on zzso quality, participants, interventions and outcomes of interest including zzso zzso symptomatic zzso major zzso minor bleeding and quality of life zzso 

Of zzso identified zzso nine zzso enrolling zzso patients fulfilled the inclusion zzso In all included zzso the intervention consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso or low molecular weight zzso Overall, the effect of zzso therapy on mortality was not statistically significant at 12 months zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but it was statistically significant at 24 months zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso therapy was associated with a statistically and clinically important reduction in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso There were no statistically significant effects on major bleeding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso minor bleeding zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso or zzso The quality of evidence was high for symptomatic zzso zzso moderate for zzso major bleeding and minor zzso and low for zzso 

zzso was associated with a significant reduction of death at 24 months but not 12 zzso It was also associated with a reduction in zzso zzso but based on the zzso in this review it had no significant effect on major zzso minor bleeding or zzso Future research should further investigate the survival benefit of different types of zzso in patients with different types and stages of zzso The decision for a patient with cancer to start zzso therapy for survival benefit should balance the benefits and zzso and integrate the patient's values and zzso
