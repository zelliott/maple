The zzso viral integration site 1 zzso gene was identified as a common locus of zzso integration in zzso tumors found in zzso zzso gene is highly zzso through evolution and human gene zzso on zzso zzso encodes zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso but not in normal blood or bone zzso zzso was detected in zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso in mice and several reports documented zzso expression in human zzso syndromes and other zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso is zzso expressed in human zzso zzso that are associated with the zzso zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso is zzso in some zzso zzso and human colon cancer cell lines and may play a role in the initiation and/or progression of solid tumors, as well as zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which zzso transforming growth factor beta zzso family zzso by binding signal zzso zzso zzso and recruiting zzso zzso zzso is an important regulator of zzso zzso zzso and migration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso function by small interference zzso increases the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso or other zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks zzso and zzso differentiation and possess the ability of growth promotion in some types of zzso zzso functions in some cases as a zzso zzso which stimulates for example zzso and zzso zzso The study of zzso target genes will help to clear the mechanism by which zzso zzso cell zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso cell zzso
