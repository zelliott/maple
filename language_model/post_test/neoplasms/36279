The zzso transition zzso zzso zzso properties on zzso cells and has been closely associated with the acquisition of aggressive traits by zzso zzso zzso programs are orchestrated by a set of zzso acting zzso factors zzso The actions of these zzso enable the early steps of zzso local invasion and subsequent dissemination of zzso cells to distant zzso However, in most zzso the subsequent outgrowth of zzso deposits into zzso zzso has the greatest impact on clinical zzso Such zzso zzso reflects the ability of zzso tumor cells to adapt to a foreign tissue zzso The outgrowth of a zzso is also thought to be associated with zzso the defining cellular trait of cancer stem cells zzso also termed zzso zzso zzso molecular links between zzso and zzso have emerged, suggesting that zzso programs play critical roles both early and late in the zzso zzso The genetic and zzso mechanisms that regulate the zzso of zzso and the traits they induce are areas under intensive zzso Such studies may provide new opportunities for therapeutic intervention and help to overcome tumor zzso and therapeutic zzso
