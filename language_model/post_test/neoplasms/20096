The proposition to use zzso zzso based on magnetic resonance diffusion imaging for applications in therapeutic zzso is zzso The measurement of zzso motion predominantly associated with the zzso of water can be characterized by a zzso temperature dependence zzso zzso The zzso energy zzso is on the order of zzso zzso and, for a restricted range zzso 30 zzso at a base temperature of approximately 300 K, the relationship between the effective diffusion zzso and temperature is approximately zzso This response has been zzso demonstrated in zzso gel zzso using magnetic resonance imaging zzso Additionally, it is feasible to have zzso between zzso zzso heating devices and zzso zzso An zzso heating zzso that includes a zzso array of zzso phased zzso was zzso This heating array easily fits into a standard zzso T head imaging zzso zzso 28 zzso The zzso fields associated with heating zzso zzso and imaging zzso zzso were zzso using zzso filters providing isolation in excess of 100 zzso This isolation was sufficient to allow simultaneous imaging and zzso heating without deterioration of the image zzso zzso In this report temperature, spatial and time resolution achieved in phantom are examined in order to assess the potential for using this zzso temperature measurement in applications of zzso zzso Using this system and conventional zzso imaging techniques, zzso degrees C resolution in a zzso size of less than 1 zzso has been achieved using an acquisition time of zzso zzso
