zzso zzso produces strain images of zzso zzso under zzso zzso In zzso strain zzso the local zzso strain resulting from application of zzso zzso zzso to an zzso material is zzso The overall hypothesis of this work is that the pattern of zzso strain distribution around the zzso interface is completely determined by the bonding at the interface after zzso for inclusion size and applied strain levels, and that it is feasible to extract certain features from the zzso strain zzso to zzso this zzso The mechanical model used in this study consisted of a single stiff circular inclusion embedded in a homogeneous zzso zzso First, we performed a zzso study using zzso analysis zzso (no ultrasound zzso to identify possible features that zzso the pattern of zzso strain distribution around an zzso zzso Next, the ability to extract these features from zzso strain zzso estimated from simulated zzso and zzso noisy zzso data, was zzso Further, the feasibility of zzso these features from in zzso breast data of benign and zzso tumors was also zzso It is shown using the zzso study that the pattern of zzso strain distribution is determined by the degree of bonding at the zzso zzso The results suggest the feasibility of using zzso features that capture the region of positive and negative zzso strain area to zzso the pattern of the zzso strain zzso The simulation results showed that it was feasible to extract the features, as identified in the zzso study, from zzso strain zzso However, an effort must be made to obtain zzso strain zzso with the highest zzso ratio zzso possible, without compromising the zzso The in zzso results demonstrated the feasibility of producing and zzso features from the zzso strain zzso from breast zzso Furthermore, the in zzso zzso strain zzso suggest an additional feature not identified in the simulations that may potentially be used for distinguishing benign from zzso zzso proximity of the zzso strain regions to the zzso interface identified in the zzso
