A puzzling aspect of zzso therapeutic strategies is the wide disparity in the doses needed to suppress zzso under different zzso A recent study revealing mechanistically how zzso suppresses zzso provides two explanations for the differential sensitivities to zzso First, zzso exists as two functionally distinct complexes zzso and zzso and while zzso suppresses both, it does so at very different zzso Whereas zzso is suppressed by zzso of zzso in the low zzso range, zzso generally requires low zzso zzso Second, the efficacy of zzso is dependent on the level of zzso acid zzso which is required for the assembly of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso in a manner that is competitive with zzso zzso elevated levels of zzso which is common in cancer cells, increases the level of zzso needed to suppress both zzso and zzso A practical outcome of the recent study is that if PA levels are zzso zzso becomes sensitive to zzso of zzso that can be achieved zzso Since zzso is likely more critical for survival signals in cancer cells, the recent findings suggest new strategies for enhancing the efficacy of zzso therapeutic approaches in cancer zzso
