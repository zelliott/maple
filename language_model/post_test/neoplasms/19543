Much research interest has been shown in recent years for the development of molecular diagnostic strategies based on the analysis of zzso molecules that are present in the zzso of human zzso zzso applications include the diagnosis, zzso or monitoring of zzso and zzso zzso While researchers have speculated that cell death is a potential mechanism that leads to the release of zzso into the zzso studies have demonstrated that indeed increased amounts of plasma DNA and zzso could be detected in patients sustaining acute traumatic zzso The degree of plasma DNA zzso correlated with the severity of zzso Similarly, plasma DNA zzso have been shown to correlate with zzso of zzso significance in patients with acute zzso It is expected that new diagnostic markers based on plasma zzso detection could be developed for the evaluation of acute zzso
