This article is based upon a literature overview of cancer in zzso It involves a comparison of variation in zzso and prevalence rates between Jews and zzso However, the reader must exercise a certain amount of skepticism when considering secular changes in cancer zzso and prevalence and the public health implications of such cancer zzso zzso Jews have a lifetime zzso risk of zzso This elevated zzso risk is similar to that of individuals in the zzso risk'' category, and differs zzso from the zzso zzso risk for zzso members of general Western zzso A zzso search tested the hypothesis that zzso and/or zzso zzso and mortality rates are either higher or lower than expected in zzso Jews worldwide, when compared with reference zzso zzso showed that all cancer zzso and mortality is not higher in zzso Jews when compared to North American zzso zzso Indeed, rates for some zzso such as zzso of the lung in zzso zzso are zzso this example is likely attributable in large part to decreased tobacco zzso Carcinoma of the zzso zzso stomach, and zzso zzso have a higher zzso rate in zzso Even though zzso and zzso founder zzso which zzso to zzso of the breast and zzso appear increased in zzso breast cancer affected women, there was no evidence supporting an elevated risk of breast cancer among zzso zzso Our primary concern, however, is that zzso Jews may have one of the highest lifetime zzso risks of any ethnic group in the world, a risk that zzso significantly from that of the general population; zzso it logically calls for more intensive zzso screening zzso We have emphasized that the reader use caution in the interpretation of statistics which portray variation in zzso and prevalence figures for cancer in any racial, ethnic, or religious group, inclusive, of course, of zzso Clearly, more research will be required in the interest of accuracy in the understanding of these cancer variations, since they portend the need for special cancer control zzso A lesser degree of attention can then be given to zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso which occur very infrequently in zzso We urge our colleagues to continue to probe further into these statistical differences in zzso zzso and prevalence in order to zzso a better understanding of zzso zzso and zzso
