To examine the zzso and mortality of cancer near the Pan zzso Industries factory, zzso zzso after reports of a possible cluster of all zzso and brain cancer in the zzso 

Small area study of cancer zzso zzso and mortality zzso within a zzso zzso radius of the factory zzso zzso cancer registrations and deaths in the study area were extracted from national data sets held by the Small Area Health Statistics Unit and compared with expected numbers zzso by applying national rates zzso for age, sex, and deprivation to the local population zzso and 1991 zzso zzso expected zzso ratios were examined from zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the plant, and tests applied for a decline in relative risk with distance up to zzso zzso 

There were zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and 385 from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso There was an excess of skin melanoma from zzso zzso based on 11 cases zzso zzso zzso to zzso and an excess from zzso zzso of cancer of the zzso stomach and zzso combined, and prostate zzso ranged from zzso to zzso Only the findings from lung cancer were suggestive of a decline in risk with distance, especially in the later period zzso There were zzso cancer deaths zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and 308 from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso deaths zzso zzso zzso to zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso from zzso zzso There was evidence of a decline in mortality with distance for all zzso combined, lung cancer zzso zzso zzso for each), and zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso and also for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mortality analyses suggested a decline in risk with distance for lung cancer zzso zzso zzso but not for all zzso or the site specific zzso zzso There was no evidence of an excess in the zzso or mortality from brain zzso For cancer mortality in the zzso zzso the findings were, for the most part, well within the range of variation across the region as a zzso 

The study provides limited and inconsistent evidence for a zzso excess of cancer in the vicinity of the zzso zzso At present, further investigation does not seem warranted other than continued surveillance of mortality and cancer zzso in the zzso
