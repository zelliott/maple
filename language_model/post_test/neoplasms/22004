Cellular zzso molecules are critical components during zzso and cancer zzso and contribute to the mechanisms underlying resistance to zzso zzso Since drug resistance is associated with a very poor prognosis for patients with cancer, a better understanding of the role of zzso molecules could improve patient outcome by identifying novel mechanisms that promote drug zzso zzso factors, such as cellular zzso are shown to promote the resistance of zzso to various zzso drugs by altering cellular zzso pathways that activate cellular growth and inhibit zzso In addition, cellular zzso molecules can provide a means to specifically target more conventional chemotherapy to the unique zzso zzso However, the expression and function of cellular zzso zzso and the signals activated by zzso are highly interrelated making the development of rational therapies more zzso
