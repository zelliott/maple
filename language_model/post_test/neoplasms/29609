This phase I study was performed to determine the safety profile, maximum tolerated dose zzso and biological activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso 

zzso patients with advanced solid tumors were zzso Each patient received zzso administration on day 1, cycle 1 then switched to a twice daily zzso dosing regimen on days 2-14 of a zzso zzso subsequent cycles continued zzso dosing on days zzso zzso toxicity zzso was assessed during the cycle one; toxicity evaluation was closely monitored throughout the zzso zzso scans were completed to assess tumor zzso Blood and urine zzso were evaluated on days 1 and 14 in cycle zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso was assessed via conversion of zzso A to zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso and most common adverse events were zzso fatigue, zzso and zzso No grade 3 or 4 zzso zzso were zzso zzso of 21 patients were zzso for zzso short-term stable disease was observed in 5 zzso zzso zzso systemic exposure increased with zzso however, drug zzso was higher than zzso Renal zzso of parent drug was zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected at the 200 and 300 zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso and recommended phase II dose is 200 zzso zzso on days zzso of a zzso dosing zzso The plasma concentration profile suggests the zzso of zzso zzso is dose and time zzso zzso zzso target zzso was observed at doses of zzso recommended for further zzso
