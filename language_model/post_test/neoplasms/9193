In this work we investigate a mathematical model describing zzso growth under a treatment by chemotherapy that incorporates zzso related to the conversion from resting to hunting zzso We study the model using values for the parameters according to experimental results and vary some parameters relevant to the treatment of zzso We find that our model exhibits a zzso zzso associated with the suppression of cancer cells, when either continuous or zzso chemotherapy is applied according to clinical zzso for a large range of relevant zzso When the chemotherapy is successful, the zzso zzso of the zzso agent acting on cancer cells varies with the infusion rate of chemotherapy according to an inverse zzso Finally, our model was able to reproduce the experimental results obtained by zzso and collaborators zzso 435 (2005) zzso about the exponential decline of cancer cells when patients are treated with the drug zzso
