zzso administration is frequent in terminal patients with cancer, yet the effects on survival are still under zzso 

The aim of this study was to examine the status of infection and the zzso of zzso administration on the survival of terminal patients with cancer with zzso 

A prospective zzso zzso 

We studied 799 patients with terminal cancer who were admitted to a zzso care unit in Taiwan between January 2008 and the end of April zzso Survival was calculated from the first day of admission to the day of death in the zzso care unit or under home zzso

Four hundred zzso patients were diagnosed as having at least one episode of infection after first zzso A total of 295 of the zzso zzso with infection received zzso treatment upon zzso zzso Cox zzso hazard analyses showed that zzso administration was related to improved survival for patients who were still alive 1 week after admission zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso However, antibiotics would be a hazard to patients' survival if used in the time 2 days prior to death zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results suggest that with good communication between patients, families, and medical staff, withdrawal of antibiotics should be considered if signs of death appear, in order to avoid unnecessary zzso The possible benefit of prolonged survival should be in line with the goal of care, and also take into account preparing the patient for a dignified zzso
