A zzso zzso the zzso zzso protein of zzso Disease zzso zzso was tested for its capacity to stimulate innate zzso activity in zzso zzso We observed that application of the zzso zzso at the ear zzso site zzso of mice zzso higher levels of systemic zzso and reduced tumor growth in the zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor model in comparison to application of a control zzso not zzso the zzso zzso Analysis of the tumor zzso revealed a significant increase in zzso cell zzso and decrease in zzso of zzso zzso cells bearing the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso after vaccination with the zzso DNA compared to a control zzso Finally, innate immunity and partially type I zzso responses were proved important for the reduction of zzso zzso tumor growth after zzso zzso as shown with the use of zzso and zzso zzso These data demonstrate that triggering innate immunity by zzso application at the ear zzso of mice zzso the immune cell compartment in the tumor zzso and reduces tumor zzso This highlights thus the potential zzso activity of the zzso gene in tumor zzso
