zzso in zzso is crossing the threshold to become a standard mode of zzso Whereas in solid tumors in zzso studies, zzso has proven to be superior to conventional chemotherapy, clinical success is still zzso The purpose of this brief review is to analyze recent developments in zzso as well as clinical zzso of solid, zzso zzso Advances in experimental zzso are characterized by the development of zzso rather than zzso tumor models in nude mice, which seem to reflect the actual clinical situation much more zzso Furthermore, the recent development of strategies to reduce the zzso zzso of zzso fragments and peptides enables the use of such smaller molecules for therapy, especially those also labeled with zzso and other forms of zzso retained zzso Recent developments in clinical zzso are characterized by a trend toward the treatment of zzso and zzso disease, as is the case, zzso in zzso zzso Interestingly, despite dramatic differences in size, weight and zzso zzso values, only small differences between animal models and the actual patient situation exist with respect to activity zzso (in zzso in the tumors and zzso Because the activity concentration over time determines the radiation absorbed dose, and thus biological effects, we zzso that animal models should be able to predict actual clinical scenarios fairly zzso These findings could be used as guidelines in the design of future zzso as well as clinical, zzso
