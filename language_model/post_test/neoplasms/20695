Veterinarians come into contact with several potentially zzso zzso in the course of their zzso These zzso include radiation, zzso zzso pesticides zzso zzso and zzso zzso This review aims to zzso what is known about the zzso risks in this zzso 

The levels of exposure to potential zzso in the veterinary profession are examined and evidence is reviewed for zzso of these substances in humans at doses similar to those experienced by zzso The few published studies of cancer in veterinarians are also zzso
