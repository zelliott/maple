It is important to determine the relative contributions of genetic and environmental factors to the zzso of childhood cancer in order to zzso the zzso mechanisms involved and to develop effective means of primary zzso zzso differences in cancer zzso as well as changes in zzso over calendar time have long been used to generate clues to possible zzso zzso The important role of genetic factors in childhood cancer is clear, and is exemplified by the observations in zzso The importance of the contributions of environmental factors in general and of specific factors in particular, to the zzso of zzso in children, has proven more difficult to zzso A variety of environmental factors have been implicated to varying degrees in the zzso of different childhood zzso These factors include physical agents such as radiation, chemical agents such as zzso and organic zzso and infectious agents such as the zzso zzso The observations that certain compounds may act as zzso when a prenatal exposure occurs early in pregnancy and as zzso when the exposure occurs late in pregnancy, suggests that there may be a zzso of zzso and zzso This finding has major implications for the possible zzso mechanisms that could be involved in childhood zzso and for the design of future research of their zzso and zzso The zzso of childhood cancer should be viewed as an interaction of environmental factors to which the child or his parent were exposed together with varying degrees of genetically determined zzso of the child to the zzso effects of these zzso
