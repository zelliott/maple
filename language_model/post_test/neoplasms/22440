Poly zzso zzso zzso are a promising new area in cancer zzso This review summarizes the current understanding of their mechanism of action, their state of clinical development, and possible mechanisms of zzso 

Poly zzso zzso zzso were predicted to cause zzso in cells with zzso in zzso zzso as well as to be synergistic with zzso zzso Recent clinical trial results have validated both of these zzso In addition, studies have begun to examine possible mechanisms of zzso 

Poly zzso zzso zzso were developed with the idea of synthetic zzso in mind, a concept from classical zzso that may be a general approach to finding new targets for cancer zzso They show activity as zzso in zzso with defective zzso zzso and they may zzso the action of conventional zzso zzso
