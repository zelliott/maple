Several methods have been employed to calculate the relative contribution to skin dose due to scattered electrons in zzso zzso zzso Either the zzso differential scattering probability is employed to determine the number and initial energy of electrons scattered into the direction of a zzso or a zzso approximation is used to specify the surface distribution of initial pencil electron beams created by parallel or zzso zzso zzso zzso of these calculations are compared with experimental zzso In addition, that fraction of relative surface dose resulting from zzso interactions in air alone is estimated and compared with data zzso from zzso at large zzso distance zzso The contribution to surface dose from electrons generated in air is 50% or more of the total skin dose for zzso greater than 80 zzso
