Conventional zzso examination has limited sensitivity for detecting tumor cells in zzso body cavity zzso and therefore, zzso techniques are necessary for a reliable zzso zzso zzso has proven benefit in these zzso The aim of our study was to explore the feasibility of zzso zzso an advanced zzso zzso with flow zzso capabilities, for detecting tumor cells in zzso body zzso using zzso zzso zzso which are directed against the zzso marker zzso 

One hundred and five zzso zzso zzso zzso and 66 zzso zzso were analyzed by the zzso zzso using zzso zzso combinations zzso and zzso Of all samples a zzso preparation was made and microscopically zzso the pathology findings served as a zzso 

Using a threshold of zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso identified nine out of 12 cases with tumor cells in the zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas routine zzso found eight cases zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso identified all 12 cases with tumor cells in the zzso fluid zzso zzso The zzso were zzso and zzso zzso 

We demonstrated that it is feasible to run an zzso zzso on zzso zzso for detecting tumor cells in zzso body zzso In addition, this study confirmed that a combination of conventional zzso and flow zzso had a very high diagnostic yield in cases of zzso zzso
