zzso zzso consists of replacing continuous zzso at low zzso with a series of medium zzso zzso in the same overall time and to the same total zzso For example, zzso of 1 zzso given every 2 zzso or 2 zzso given every 4 zzso would deliver the same 70 zzso in 140 zzso as continuous zzso at zzso zzso If higher zzso are used, even with gaps between the zzso the biological effects are always zzso zzso that dose rates in the pulse do not exceed 3 zzso and provided that zzso are given as often as every 2 zzso the inevitable increases of biological effect are no larger than a few percent (of biologically effective dose or zzso response zzso However, these increases are more likely to exceed zzso (and thus become clinically zzso if the zzso of repair of zzso damage is short (less than 1 zzso rather than zzso This somewhat unexpected finding is explained in detail zzso 

The rise and fall of zzso zzso zzso (and hence of Relative zzso for a constant dose in each zzso is calculated during and after single zzso assuming a range of values of zzso the zzso of zzso damage zzso The area under each curve is zzso to zzso zzso zzso and therefore to log cell zzso 

zzso at 3 zzso do yield greater biological effect zzso zzso integrated Relative zzso than lower zzso zzso or continuous zzso at zzso zzso The contrast is greater for the short zzso of zzso zzso than for the longer zzso of zzso zzso 

More biological damage will be done zzso with traditional low dose rate zzso in zzso with short zzso zzso zzso than in zzso with longer zzso zzso
