The binding properties of two zzso important zzso derivatives zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso DNA zzso were investigated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular modeling zzso zzso their biological activities were evaluated with zzso zzso zzso The binding zzso determined with zzso zzso and zzso were found to be in the same order of zzso According to the results of zzso studies, zzso competitive binding experiment and zzso zzso zzso binding was evaluated as the dominant binding modes between the two compounds and zzso Furthermore, the results of molecular modeling zzso those obtained from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso activities of the two derivatives against different tumor cell lines proved that they exhibited significant tumor cell zzso rate, accordingly blocking DNA zzso and zzso The present results favor the development of potential drugs related with zzso derivatives in the treatment of some zzso
