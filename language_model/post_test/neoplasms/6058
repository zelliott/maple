In cancer zzso zzso cells gain invasive behavior through a loss of zzso characteristics and acquisition of zzso properties, a process that can lead to zzso transition zzso zzso is a potent zzso of zzso and increased zzso signaling in cancer cells is thought to drive zzso zzso Here, we examine the zzso requirement for zzso complex 2 zzso in cells undergoing zzso zzso rapidly zzso zzso zzso activity in cells undergoing zzso and controls zzso cell progression through zzso By regulating zzso zzso changes and gene zzso zzso is required for cell migration and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso prevents cancer cell dissemination in zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso is an essential downstream branch of zzso zzso and represents a responsive target to inhibit zzso and prevent cancer cell invasion and zzso
