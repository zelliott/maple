The genetic transfer of zzso receptors provides a means to rapidly generate zzso zzso T zzso However, recognition of tumor zzso by zzso T cells is only one step towards effective cancer zzso Other crucial biological zzso must be fulfilled to expand zzso T cells that retain a functional zzso including in zzso zzso activity and the ability to travel to tumor sites without prematurely zzso to zzso We show that these requirements are met by expanding peripheral blood T cells genetically targeted to the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso T cells expanded in the presence of zzso uniquely persist in zzso severe combined zzso zzso mice and eradicate zzso zzso zzso Their zzso activity is further enhanced by in zzso zzso In addition, zzso T cells from patients with chronic zzso leukemia zzso effectively lyse zzso tumor zzso These findings strongly support the clinical feasibility of this therapeutic zzso
