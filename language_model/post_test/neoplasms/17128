In this zzso study for the period zzso food availability was measured using the food balance sheets of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United zzso zzso mortality rates zzso were obtained from the Swiss Federal Office of zzso Cancer zzso data were obtained from the World Health Organization Health For All database and the zzso Cancer zzso zzso between food availability and zzso were assessed at lags 0, 5, 10, and 15 years by zzso zzso adjusted for total caloric zzso 

zzso beverages and fruit availability were positively zzso and fish availability was zzso zzso with zzso for cardiovascular zzso Animal products, meat, and animal fats were positively associated with the zzso for zzso heart disease zzso For cancer, the results of analysis using zzso and zzso rates were zzso zzso beverages and fruits were positively associated with zzso for all cancer but zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso Similar findings were obtained for all other foods except vegetables, which were zzso zzso associated with zzso and zzso zzso Use of a 15-year lag reversed the associations with animal and vegetal products, weakened the association with alcohol and zzso and strengthened the association with zzso 

zzso associations between food availability and disease vary considerably on the basis of whether mortality or zzso rates are used in the zzso Great care is thus necessary when interpreting our zzso
