Clinical zzso zzso zzso imaging has demonstrated the vast majority of human zzso exhibit significantly increased zzso metabolism when compared with adjacent normal zzso resulting in an zzso zzso zzso Recent studies demonstrated reducing this acidity through systemic buffers significantly zzso development and growth of zzso in mouse zzso 

We apply and extend a previously developed mathematical model of blood and zzso zzso to examine the impact of oral administration of zzso buffer in mice, and the potential impact in zzso We zzso the zzso observed zzso zzso effect of buffer therapy, testing a model prediction in zzso in zzso We zzso the model to humans to determine the zzso safety and zzso and predict patient zzso who could have enhanced treatment response, and the most promising combination or alternative buffer zzso 

The model predicts a previously unseen potentially dangerous zzso in blood zzso resulting from zzso therapy in mice, which is confirmed by our in zzso zzso zzso predict limited efficacy of zzso especially in humans with more aggressive zzso We predict buffer therapy would be most zzso in elderly patients or individuals with zzso zzso in combination with zzso production zzso (such as zzso zzso zzso zzso rate zzso (such as zzso zzso drugs and zzso zzso zzso or with an alternative buffer zzso possessing an optimal zzso of zzso 

Our mathematical model confirms zzso acts as an effective agent to raise zzso zzso but potentially zzso zzso zzso at the high doses necessary for zzso zzso zzso We predict use in elderly patients or in combination with zzso production zzso or buffers with a zzso of zzso is most zzso
