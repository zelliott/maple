Using zzso gel zzso we previously demonstrated that the zzso protein remarkably decreased after zzso of normal human zzso and that this protein caused growth zzso of human tumor cells when forcibly expressed in these cells, suggesting that zzso plays a significant role in tumor zzso The present study was carried out to determine what type of human zzso express zzso zzso and, zzso whether the zzso content in these zzso changes after normal cells have been transformed into cancer zzso We found that zzso cells in various zzso were positively stained with the zzso zzso In comparison, zzso cells in zzso zzso such as the stomach, small zzso and colon were not stained as zzso When 14 pairs of human normal and zzso zzso were stained with the zzso decreases in the zzso levels of zzso were observed in 6 kinds of zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso comparison with zzso in their normal zzso These results suggest that zzso is a new tumor marker zzso the expression of which significantly decreases after zzso transformation of human zzso
