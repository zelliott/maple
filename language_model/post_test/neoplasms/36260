To identify zzso symptom zzso to explore their zzso and to examine the effects of single symptoms and the synergistic effects of symptom clusters on functional performance using path analysis by structural equation zzso in patients with various types of zzso 

Recent studies suggest that cancer patients frequently experience three or more concurrent related symptoms and that this zzso of symptoms is likely to have negative synergistic impacts on zzso because of the complicated dynamics of zzso 

A zzso zzso 

One hundred and ten patients with various types of cancer were recruited as zzso and zzso at a University Hospital in zzso South zzso Data collection was performed using a questionnaire and by direct zzso zzso insomnia, fatigue, depression and functional performance were zzso 

The developed model was composed of zzso symptom clusters and zzso Of the symptoms often encountered as clusters in cancer patients, insomnia, depression and fatigue were found to have significant single zzso effects on functional zzso Seven symptom clusters were identified between pain and functional performance, three between zzso and functional performance and one between depression and functional zzso These single symptoms and symptom clusters were found to have significant synergistic effects on functional performance and to explain zzso of functional performance zzso 

Multiple zzso symptom clusters may occur and the dynamics within symptom clusters is zzso Our findings provide sound evidence regarding the importance of assessing and managing clusters of symptoms simultaneously rather than focusing on single zzso 

A comprehensive understanding of symptom clusters in cancer patients would help establish valid diagnostic symptom cluster entities and aid the development of zzso zzso criteria for symptom cluster based diagnoses and of nursing care protocols for managing symptom zzso
