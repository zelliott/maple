From a fundamental point of view, chemotherapy is the most widely used treatment for zzso despite its side effects on normal cells and zzso zzso zzso is a method for increasing the zzso of cancer cells to drugs and, zzso decreasing their zzso It apparently creates zzso on the cell membrane using electric zzso zzso can decrease tumor zzso but this effect is not zzso and partial regrowth has been zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the potential of magnetic fields in preventing the regrowth of tumors after zzso zzso zzso mice were exposed to a magnetic field zzso zzso for zzso after treating additionally with zzso electric zzso and zzso at the first zzso The magnetic field caused a significant reduction in tumor volumes, while there was no significant difference between the zzso and the zzso with zzso and magnetic field zzso The exploited magnetic field zzso zzso could decrease the tumor growth rate significantly, without any effect on zzso zzso
