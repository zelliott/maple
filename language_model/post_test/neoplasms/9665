The discovery of cancer zzso has become a major focus of cancer research, which holds promising future for early zzso diagnosis, monitoring disease recurrence and therapeutic treatment efficacy to improve long-term survival of cancer zzso Most of the functional information of the zzso genes resides in the zzso Since cancer is a complex disease, it might require a panel of multiple zzso in order to achieve sufficient clinical zzso 

zzso is the most accessible biological zzso collected from zzso zzso serum zzso zzso would be the most promising new test for zzso With the advent of new and improved zzso technologies, such as protein chips and mass zzso coupled with advanced zzso tools, it is possible to develop potential cancer zzso However, zzso collection, zzso study design and data analysis are essential components for successful zzso discovery and zzso zzso case control study should be conducted with extensive clinical validation to minimize the impact of possible zzso variables zzso 

zzso and related zzso such as zzso are promising candidates for cancer zzso
