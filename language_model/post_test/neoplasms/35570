The interaction of the zzso zzso a 26 zzso acid zzso zzso that mimics the zzso zzso zzso has been studied with its zzso zzso zzso by transferred nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso zzso and zzso transfer difference zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is specific to zzso zzso and does not react with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso at sites zzso and zzso on the zzso motif is required for the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the zzso and zzso targeting of the zzso protein zzso the zzso of which has been implicated in various human zzso The three-dimensional structure of the zzso in the bound zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso the zzso adopts a compact structure in the presence of zzso with formation of turns around zzso and zzso with a tight bend created by the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso forming this bend are recognized by the zzso as demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies provide evidence for the existence of a zzso zzso containing tandem repeats of zzso zzso The zzso zzso is predominantly located in the large bend and in the zzso segment, implicating zzso zzso These findings are in excellent agreement with a recently published zzso structure required for the interaction of zzso with the zzso zzso
