zzso zzso zzso in children is a common clinical diagnostic zzso The aim of our study was to zzso zzso fine needle aspiration zzso size and location on the neck to distinguish zzso zzso requiring zzso from those that do zzso 

We zzso studied 43 cervical zzso zzso that were excised from 43 children aged zzso zzso We studied the zzso of the removed zzso zzso and compared them in terms of size, location, zzso and fine needle aspiration zzso Patients were divided into four groups: zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

The cause of zzso was zzso in 30 patients zzso zzso in five zzso and zzso in six zzso of the surgically removed zzso zzso zzso age and zzso findings were not correlated with a higher risk of zzso However, the risk of zzso was significantly higher when the zzso was located in the zzso region than in other cervical regions zzso zzso zzso Fine needle aspiration biopsy was made preoperatively in 27 cases zzso and revealed five zzso zzso to be zzso and 18 zzso to be due to a zzso zzso The positive zzso value for benign and zzso cause was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

We recommend zzso biopsy if zzso is suspected to be zzso or is located in the zzso zzso In case of chronic zzso with no obvious infectious cause or suspected zzso we recommend fine needle aspiration biopsy as a diagnostic zzso Clinical control and diagnosing of children with zzso should lie in few, skilled zzso
