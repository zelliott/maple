zzso of the DNA mismatch repair system, characterized by zzso instability zzso plays an important role in the course of human zzso zzso sequences constitute targets for zzso in zzso cells, and frequent zzso have indeed been reported in such regions within the transforming growth factor beta zzso II zzso gene in genetically unstable zzso and gastric zzso However, other genes that are targets for zzso in zzso cells during the course of zzso have proven zzso Because the zzso growth factor II zzso zzso gene contains several repetitive sequences within its coding region, we examined zzso of this gene in zzso zzso occurring at various primary zzso We found zzso zzso in the zzso tract of zzso in eight tumors, all of which were zzso 4 of 26 zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 of 12 zzso zzso gastric zzso and 1 of 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, no zzso was found in 51 pancreatic zzso 7 of which zzso were zzso These results zzso abnormal zzso growth control in zzso involving the zzso stomach, and zzso but not the zzso
