The high zzso of zzso of some members of the zzso family of zzso in human tumors suggests that zzso these proteins are involved in cancer zzso and zzso they are potential candidates for a therapeutic zzso In recent years, the characterization of downstream zzso to zzso zzso has provided crucial clues on the general cellular effects that permit zzso proliferation and zzso of tumor zzso The zzso of many of these zzso proteins in turn results in the zzso of the activity of several zzso factors that play an important role at various levels of zzso zzso The precise mechanisms by which zzso zzso participate in zzso are still not fully zzso However, it is becoming more evident that the specific role of zzso zzso in tumor zzso progression and zzso as well as the nature and cause of such zzso in specific human tumors zzso transient or zzso tumor zzso genetic or zzso may be linked to the zzso of specific signaling pathways that result in zzso zzso In this review, we zzso the functions of zzso proteins in the regulation of several zzso factors and their relationship to tumor zzso
