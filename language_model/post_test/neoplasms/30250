zzso chemotherapy is frequently given to shrink or decrease the chance of zzso However, chemotherapy has zzso side effects that may complicate the zzso zzso We therefore tested the hypotheses that chemotherapy within 30 days before cancer surgery is associated with an increased risk of mortality and with a composite of major zzso within 30 zzso zzso 

We evaluated zzso patients from the American College of Surgeons National zzso Quality Improvement Program zzso Patients were defined as having chemotherapy when they were given any chemotherapy for zzso within 30 days before zzso We successfully matched zzso pairs of chemotherapy recipients and zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso zzso patients died within 30 days after surgery compared with 30 of the zzso zzso chemotherapy zzso The odds of mortality were not statistically different between groups based on our zzso zzso model zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso The most common complication observed was wound infection in zzso of zzso patients compared with zzso of the chemotherapy zzso There was similarly no difference between groups for the collapsed composite of major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso P zzso zzso 

zzso use of zzso chemotherapy in cancer patients undergoing zzso surgeries was not associated with a higher rate of early zzso complications or zzso
