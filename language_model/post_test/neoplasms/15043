zzso which is commonly observed in areas of primary zzso and of zzso influences response to zzso However, its zzso has so far mainly been restricted to the ex zzso analysis of zzso sections using zzso zzso specific to zzso zzso IX zzso zzso or by zzso zzso after the intravenous administration of this zzso compound in experimental animal zzso 

In this study, we describe the generation of zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso specific to human CA IX, using zzso zzso 

These zzso were able to stain CA IX ex zzso and to target the zzso zzso in zzso In one of the two animal models of zzso cancer studied zzso CA IX imaging closely matched zzso zzso with a preferential zzso of zzso areas zzso by little zzso and low zzso In contrast, in a second animal model zzso distinct zzso patterns were observed for zzso and CA IX zzso We observed a complementary pattern of zzso regions targeted in zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso IX zzso A3, indicating that a zzso pattern of in zzso zzso targeting could be achieved by a combination of the two zzso 

The new human zzso IX zzso are expected to be zzso in patients with cancer and may serve as broadly zzso zzso for the zzso imaging of zzso and for zzso zzso
