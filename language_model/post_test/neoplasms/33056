zzso comparative zzso zzso zzso is a high zzso high resolution technique for studying the zzso of zzso Analysis of zzso data typically involves zzso of the underlying zzso copy numbers from the log zzso ratios and zzso the zzso into regions with the same copy number at each zzso We propose for the analysis of zzso data, a new zzso zzso model and an associated zzso procedure that has attractive statistical and zzso zzso An important benefit of this zzso zzso model is that it yields explicit formulas for zzso means, which can be used to estimate the signal directly without performing zzso Other quantities relating to the zzso distribution that are useful for providing confidence assessments of any given zzso can also be estimated by using our zzso We propose an approximation method whose zzso time is linear in sequence length which makes our method practically zzso to the new higher density zzso zzso studies and applications to real zzso data illustrate the advantages of the proposed zzso
