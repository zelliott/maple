zzso in tumors is associated with zzso zzso zzso spread, and increased resistance to zzso and zzso zzso zzso is required for the cellular production of zzso oxide zzso by the zzso NO zzso zzso and NO may block components of the zzso response to zzso zzso we hypothesized that zzso increases drug resistance in tumor cells by zzso zzso NO zzso 

Human breast zzso zzso and mouse melanoma zzso cells were zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso incubated with a zzso inhibitor of zzso NO production, and then treated with zzso zzso Resistance was assessed by zzso zzso and western zzso analysis was used to measure zzso protein zzso All P values were zzso 

zzso of zzso tumor cells in zzso zzso zzso increased their resistance to zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, compared with incubation in zzso zzso zzso mouse melanoma cells zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for 12 hours exhibited a twofold increase in resistance to zzso zzso The rapid acquisition of drug resistance after exposure to zzso zzso could be zzso by zzso the zzso cells for 12 hours with the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso replacement of NO activity by use of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso NO zzso produced statistically significant zzso in the development of resistance of 59% zzso and zzso zzso respectively, in zzso zzso Treatment of zzso cells with zzso produced a zzso reduction in resistance zzso zzso cells expressed all three zzso of the zzso zzso at levels that were not altered by exposure to zzso 

NO mediates zzso in tumor cells, and zzso drug resistance appears to result, in part, from downstream suppression of zzso NO zzso These results raise the possibility that administration of small doses of NO zzso could be used as an zzso in zzso
