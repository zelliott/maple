During the last decade, increased understanding of the molecular mechanisms responsible for immune zzso to protect against challenges by tumor cells has revolutionized the field of zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that the dysfunction of the zzso immune system represents one of the major mechanisms by which tumors evade zzso This is due, for example, to T cell zzso the existence of regulatory T cells, and systemic defects of zzso cells derived from tumor zzso In addition, escape from zzso can also be linked to zzso factors, including zzso of zzso zzso resistance to zzso and deficient expression of zzso molecules and major zzso complex zzso class I zzso possibly due to zzso Both zzso and zzso mechanisms can lead to a failure to mount a proper zzso immune response, and these are frequently key factors in limiting the success of cancer zzso
