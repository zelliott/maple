zzso appears to play an important role in tumor growth and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has recently been reported as a potential zzso zzso 

A variety of human tumor cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were incubated with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were exposed to caffeine, zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso before exposure to the zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso to human zzso was used for zzso zzso liquid zzso was used to characterize the zzso zzso of zzso after zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of zzso was zzso to 100 times the zzso of zzso depending on the particular tumor cell zzso zzso of zzso cells to caffeine, a competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso did not affect cellular zzso of zzso However, zzso of zzso cells to zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso or cold zzso significantly inhibited cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was inhibited by zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of zzso was significantly inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso was only partially inhibited by zzso and zzso However, zzso and zzso cells had significantly lower zzso of zzso than of zzso but had significantly increased zzso of zzso which was inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso cells were negative, but the zzso cells positive, for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were persistently retained after influx into the cell, predominantly as zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Cancer cell lines evaluated in zzso had significantly elevated zzso of zzso zzso on the order of zzso to zzso in comparison to zzso zzso The mechanism of zzso zzso depends predominantly on zzso zzso zzso after conversion of zzso to zzso by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso retention is due to zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells have low zzso of zzso zzso because of a lack of zzso zzso This in zzso evaluation using zzso with tumor cell lines supports the potential of zzso for use in targeting the zzso transport zzso in PET imaging of zzso
