Human zzso zzso zzso were mixed with cells of an zzso sensitive hybrid cell line zzso A fraction of tumor cells survived this treatment and could be recovered from the zzso These surviving cells were completely zzso and this property persisted for 2-3 weeks after zzso in fresh zzso Treatment of a clone zzso of zzso with zzso mixed zzso culture zzso zzso resulted in a marked reduction in zzso sensitivity after 8-12 h of zzso The zzso of induction of zzso resistance by zzso zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso and was faster than for zzso The active component in the zzso was characterized as a mixture of zzso and zzso based on zzso of activity with specific zzso The role of mycoplasma contamination was investigated and it was found that cell lines free of zzso mycoplasma zzso production of zzso activity by zzso and this activity was neutralized by zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso zzso demonstrated a correlation between the zzso activity of cell zzso and their ability to produce zzso in response to tumor zzso Taken together, the zzso variations in zzso sensitivity, the zzso of zzso production and induction of resistance suggest that tumor cells may be able to escape elimination by zzso cells due to protection by zzso produced by the zzso zzso
