To perform a systematic review of studies evaluating the effectiveness of the World Health Organization zzso zzso zzso as an intervention for cancer pain zzso 

zzso search of zzso from 1982 to 1995, hand search of textbooks and meeting zzso reference lists, and direct contact with zzso 

Studies of any zzso design were included if they evaluated patients with cancer pain treated according to the WHO zzso zzso and if the studies provided enough information to estimate the proportion of patients who achieved adequate analgesia with the use of the zzso The strength of the evidence provided by each study was assessed separately by both authors using current zzso 

From the hard copy of each study report, the first author's name, publication year, study design, number of dropouts per study, and proportion of patients with adequate analgesia in each study were zzso 

Eight studies zzso to evaluate the effectiveness of the WHO zzso were included in the zzso zzso was not performed because the studies were case series with no control zzso The studies had other zzso none provided information on the conditions in which pain was assessed; two were zzso one had short follow-up periods; three had high withdrawal zzso and one had variable follow-up zzso zzso was adequate in zzso to zzso of patients analyzed in the zzso 

The studies available provide valuable information on the course of cancer pain and its zzso However, the evidence they provide is insufficient to estimate confidently the effectiveness of the WHO zzso zzso for the management of cancer zzso Until results from carefully designed controlled trials are available, it would be inappropriate to judge the performance of zzso programs, and institutions or to design policies based on such zzso
