In many tumors of zzso origin specific zzso zzso are a consistent finding not restricted to zzso zzso Often the genes behind those zzso have been zzso zzso gene zzso per zzso is sufficient to contribute to or cause zzso whereas in most cases the two genes of the zzso partners both contribute to the formation of a newly arisen fusion zzso thus enabling the detection of resulting zzso transcripts by highly sensitive zzso Genes participating in zzso may be affected in more than one tumor entity, such as zzso zzso in a variety of benign zzso tumors and zzso in a couple of zzso zzso zzso Certainly, the identification and molecular characterization of specific zzso zzso will not only allow for important insights highlighting the process of zzso but offer also promising new tools to obtain more refined data of diagnostic as well as of zzso zzso
