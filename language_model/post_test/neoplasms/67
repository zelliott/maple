zzso zzso transforming genes have been described in a variety of zzso and zzso zzso zzso proteins with zzso acid zzso at positions 12, 13, and zzso In this report we describe a zzso zzso designated zzso that zzso specifically with synthetic zzso containing zzso at position 12, to a lesser extent with peptides containing zzso at position 12 and not with peptides containing zzso zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso acid or zzso at the same zzso Western zzso and zzso studies showed that zzso specifically zzso with activated zzso or zzso proteins in zzso cells transformed by DNA from the human zzso cells that zzso zzso at position zzso zzso did not react with normal zzso zzso zzso at position 12, nor with activated zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso acid, zzso zzso or zzso at position zzso A survey of human tumor cell lines demonstrated that zzso reacted with the human zzso zzso cell line zzso but not with human tumor cell lines previously shown to contain other zzso zzso at positions 12 or zzso zzso and perhaps additional zzso that specifically react with zzso at positions 12 or 61 of the zzso protein may be valuable in determining the presence and frequency of activated zzso proteins in human zzso
