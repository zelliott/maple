zzso zzso the binding of zzso zzso to human zzso breast cancer cells with an zzso of 8 zzso zzso at 30 zzso changed the apparent zzso for zzso binding from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso with little effect on the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso sites per cell for zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso to this decrease in binding of zzso in the presence of tamoxifen was an zzso of zzso zzso transport of 50 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the presence of 15 zzso zzso the apparent zzso for zzso transport was increased from 390 zzso 30 to 1500 zzso 250 zzso with no change in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso cells zzso The zzso effect of tamoxifen on zzso zzso zzso transport was specific, as similar results were also observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso a similar concentration of tamoxifen had no effect on the zzso zzso transport of zzso in zzso zzso and Morris zzso zzso cells, and on the zzso transport of zzso in zzso zzso In this paper we demonstrate that tamoxifen by itself might have some zzso effects through zzso of DNA synthesis by blocking the zzso salvage zzso
