The goal of this research was to harness a zzso zzso zzso discovery platform to identify zzso zzso highly expressed on cancer and zzso through zzso zzso potent zzso therapies toward these zzso zzso 

Fifty independent zzso targeting the zzso zzso zzso protein were obtained through independent intact zzso zzso using human tissue zzso cells, cancer cell lines, or cell lines displaying cancer stem cell zzso zzso studies revealed this zzso zzso zzso zzso panel to bind a range of independent zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that a subset displayed strong zzso to a broad range of human zzso while exhibiting limited binding to normal human zzso A zzso zzso displaying exquisite zzso differential binding was selected for zzso and incorporation of an zzso domain modified to enhance zzso zzso function via increased affinity for the zzso zzso zzso and decreased binding to the zzso zzso zzso 

zzso the resulting engineered zzso zzso mediates potent zzso cellular zzso against a broad range of tumor cell zzso Furthermore, in human zzso transgenic mice, zzso exhibited potent zzso activity in zzso zzso models of zzso cell and zzso zzso zzso studies carried out in zzso monkeys revealed no significant test zzso safety zzso 

This data supports evaluation of zzso clinical utility in zzso cancer, while zzso a combination of a zzso biased approach of intact cell zzso and zzso to identify novel cancer zzso with zzso zzso engineering to enable potent zzso zzso
