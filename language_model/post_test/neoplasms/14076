Several relative risk models for survival time data in drug combination therapy are derived and their properties are zzso The main intention of this paper is to clarify the differences among the models in order to help to choose the appropriate one in a given zzso The models are motivated by discussing their relation to well-known zzso zzso In an example of zzso treatment the models are compared with each zzso For this chemotherapy animal survival study, zzso surfaces are fitted and optimal drug combinations are zzso zzso for checking the model assumptions are zzso
