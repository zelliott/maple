zzso drug design zzso is a valuable approach for the discovery of new chemical entities in the field of cancer zzso There is a pressing need to design and develop new, selective, and safe drugs for the treatment of zzso resistance zzso cancer forms, specifically active against zzso zzso Recently, a zzso structure for mouse zzso was zzso However, for decades the design of new zzso zzso employed mainly zzso approaches zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso studies used zzso zzso zzso However, some of those results are still the pillars used as a starting point for the design of potential zzso zzso Here, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the discovery of zzso zzso are zzso The importance of these methods for understanding mechanisms of drug resistance at a molecular level, and design zzso zzso drug candidates are zzso The examples mentioned in the review could provide insights into the wide range of possibilities of using zzso zzso for the discovery of efficient zzso zzso
