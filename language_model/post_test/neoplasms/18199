zzso targeted zzso for zzso disease is challenging and zzso Unlike zzso and zzso the zzso zzso zzso analog zzso that exhibits zzso greater than zzso binding affinity offers potential for treating zzso zzso Because zzso cells express zzso more abundantly than zzso zzso likely exerts superior zzso action mainly through zzso However, there is no direct evidence for this zzso and moreover, the zzso effect on zzso zzso is not zzso 

We used zzso mouse zzso zzso tumor cells zzso zzso zzso or zzso and zzso mouse zzso zzso cells zzso or zzso expressing zzso receptors to examine zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso We show that zzso was more potent than either zzso or zzso in mouse zzso zzso zzso potency is not affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment, or zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso also does not induce zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso only at zzso dose zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso potency in zzso zzso Moreover, short exposure to zzso causes prolonged zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso in contrast to zzso and zzso zzso that induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling effects are enhanced by zzso zzso 

The results indicate that zzso determines zzso and long-term enhanced zzso action in zzso cells, whereas the zzso action on zzso is zzso
