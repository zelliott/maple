We report the possibility to transfer marker genes coding for zzso activity using zzso zzso into human peripheral blood zzso cells, peripheral blood zzso and into the growth zzso human zzso cell line zzso Using the zzso and the zzso zzso and various packaging cell lines, we demonstrated zzso transfer and high expression of a bacterial zzso activity induced by the zzso gene or the zzso zzso zzso of expression of the zzso were analyzed both in primary cells and cell zzso zzso of zzso related to the expression of the bacterial zzso was assessed in both cell zzso These results open interesting zzso for the use of the zzso activity to mark and follow the fate of genetically modified cells isolated from patients prior to zzso
