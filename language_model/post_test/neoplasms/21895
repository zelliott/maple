zzso activity recording system has a potential role in clinical practice zzso Nevertheless, up to now, its zzso has been limited by the paucity of its clinical zzso This study describes a procedure for identifying the zzso diagnosis in patients receiving zzso at an ambulatory service in the Piedmont zzso The procedure is based on the record linkage between discharge records zzso and zzso records zzso in order to obtain clinical information from the diagnosis related to possible admissions of the zzso 

The study analyzed zzso zzso records in 2003 related to Piedmont residents and all discharge records in years zzso The quality of the procedure has been assessed by using the information on the real zzso diagnosis as reported in the zzso medical records of a random sample of zzso 

The record linkage with zzso allows to define an zzso diagnosis for zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso between defined diagnosis and the real one is zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of the procedure is affected by the patients' cancer zzso The distribution by cancer site of the patients treated with zzso in Piedmont Region obtained with the record linkage procedure is homogeneous to the real distribution of the random sample used for zzso 

Overall, the record linkage between zzso and zzso PA shows a good performance in defining the zzso diagnosis of the patients receiving zzso at an ambulatory zzso This method allows to increase interest and utility of PA zzso
