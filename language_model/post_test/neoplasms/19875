zzso quality assurance in zzso modulated arc therapy zzso brain zzso zzso raises specific issues on zzso procedures, mainly represented by the small radiation fields associated with the lack of lateral electronic zzso the need of small detectors and the high dose delivered (up to 30 zzso zzso zzso and zzso films may be considered the dosimeter of choice, and the authors here provide some additional data about uniformity correction for this new generation of zzso zzso 

A new analysis method using blue channel for marker dye correction was proposed for uniformity correction both for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of a reference field were analyzed to provide an evaluation in a zzso resolution of the film uniformity for zzso Absolute doses were compared with zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso plans with multiple zzso arcs were generated with a treatment planning system on a selected pool of zzso patients with zzso zzso and then zzso on a zzso plastic phantom by zzso Carlo zzso for zzso zzso zzso quantitative dose comparison parameters were zzso for the zzso and measured dose zzso and tested for statistically significant zzso 

zzso zzso showed a different behavior above dose of 5 zzso for zzso and zzso zzso with the use of zzso zzso correction method, the authors obtained values of zzso for zzso zzso of zzso and a field zzso of zzso zzso for a zzso zzso reference zzso Compared with zzso and selecting a zzso dose zzso the percentage of points with zzso index below 1 was zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso Patients analysis revealed statistically significant differences zzso between zzso and zzso in the percentage of points with gamma zzso zzso and zzso the percent difference as well as the mean difference between calculated and measured zzso zzso and zzso were found not to be significant zzso zzso and zzso 

Excellent performances in terms of dose zzso were obtained using a new blue channel method for zzso correction on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso In comparison with zzso the passing rates for the zzso film were higher than for zzso a good agreement with estimated data by zzso Carlo zzso was found for both films, with some statistically significant differences again in favor of zzso These results suggest that the use of zzso zzso and zzso films is appropriate for dose zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso taking into account the uncertainty associated with zzso film zzso the use of adequate action levels is strongly advised, in particular, for zzso
