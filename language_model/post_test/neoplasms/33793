A wide variety of disorders can result in diminished zzso zzso The zzso appears to be clearly defined in some instances, such as zzso zzso and disorders of zzso vascular obstruction or zzso In others, such as the zzso and zzso disorders, the mechanism remains poorly zzso Further research is zzso The zzso which occurs in many of these disorders has been associated with an increased risk of zzso overwhelming bacterial zzso In other instances, this complication has not been zzso This certainly should not be interpreted to mean that it cannot zzso The risk of zzso in zzso disorders is rarely above 10 to zzso In disorders with minimal zzso of zzso function, the zzso of zzso would presumably be less than the zzso zzso following surgical zzso for zzso Considering these data, a very large number of patients would have to become zzso before it would be likely that one would develop zzso Furthermore, the lack of awareness of the possibility of zzso zzso in many of these disorders may cause such zzso to go zzso Finally, since the risk of zzso is probably less in zzso adults as compared to children, studies on adults may underestimate the zzso of this complication in zzso Many of the disorders reported to cause zzso in adults have not been noted to do so in zzso In instances such as zzso disease, it may take many years for the complication to manifest so that it would be unlikely for a child to manifest zzso during zzso However, in other instances, not enough children have been studied to be confident that the zzso and its associated risk of zzso are not complications that occur in zzso zzso bacterial zzso is a catastrophic zzso If a patient develops a disorder that is potentially associated with zzso the patient should be observed for signs of zzso in the peripheral zzso If the technique is available, zzso of red cell pits should be zzso If not, other studies of zzso function such as zzso scans should be considered, depending on the zzso of zzso in that particular zzso If evidence of zzso develops, zzso vaccine should be zzso zzso prophylaxis should be considered, significant zzso episodes should be managed aggressively, and probably most importantly, the patient and family should be carefully educated about this zzso Most deaths from zzso zzso are zzso
