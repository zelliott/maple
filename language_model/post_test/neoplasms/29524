The efficacy of zzso with DNA plasmids for single truncated zzso zzso zzso zzso or triple repeated zzso peptides in mice was zzso A DNA zzso the truncated zzso gene zzso zzso zzso two helper T zzso zzso zzso was amplified by zzso and cloned for generating zzso plasmids for single zzso zzso or triple zzso zzso zzso zzso groups of zzso female mice were zzso injected with zzso zzso or control zzso zzso zzso Ten days after the last zzso the frequency of zzso zzso and zzso T cells in the mice was determined by flow zzso The zzso proliferation of zzso T cells and zzso production ex zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The levels of serum zzso against zzso in the mice were detected by Western zzso and zzso Although zzso with zzso for the zzso zzso did not alter the frequency of zzso and zzso T cells in mice, vaccination with zzso for zzso zzso induced strong zzso T cell zzso particularly for the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso accompanied by significantly elevated levels of zzso zzso by T cells from the mice zzso with zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso with the zzso for zzso zzso zzso higher levels of zzso zzso responses in zzso zzso with the zzso for the triple repeated zzso peptides induced stronger zzso zzso Our findings may be useful for the development of effective DNA vaccine for the zzso of zzso
