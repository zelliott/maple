The mounting of a specific immune response against the human zzso type 16 zzso protein zzso zzso is important for zzso of zzso zzso cancer cells from the cervical zzso To induce a zzso immune response by oral delivery of the zzso zzso we expressed the zzso zzso zzso on the surface of zzso zzso by employing a novel display system in which the zzso acid zzso zzso complex A zzso from zzso zzso zzso was used as an zzso zzso After surface expression of the zzso zzso protein was confirmed by Western zzso flow zzso and zzso zzso mice were orally zzso with zzso zzso zzso serum zzso and zzso zzso productions were enhanced after oral administration and significantly enhanced after zzso zzso and local cellular zzso were significantly increased after zzso as shown by increased counts of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso zzso 86 zzso zzso among zzso and increased zzso in zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, in an zzso mouse tumor model, animals receiving orally administered zzso zzso showed reduced tumor size and increased survival rate versus mice receiving control zzso zzso zzso These results collectively indicate that the oral administration of zzso displayed on zzso zzso cellular immunity and zzso effects in zzso
