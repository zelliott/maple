Two pain treatment systems that developed soon after the publication of the gate theory are probably a direct result of its zzso zzso zzso administration and electrical stimulation of the spinal zzso and peripheral nerves and zzso Although the use of these zzso has become widespread in managing chronic pain, there is disagreement about their long-term zzso This presentation will attempt to review the data regarding the mechanisms of action of these zzso and their efficacy in treating chronic pain of zzso and zzso zzso 

Data were derived almost entirely from original articles reporting experimental data from both animal and human studies and from series of patients undergoing treatment with the zzso zzso 

Where possible, controlled studies were zzso However, much of the available data regarding treatment results are zzso 

zzso data from studies that were felt to be reasonably well conducted are presented or zzso Because of the lack of control groups in many of the clinical trials, zzso were not carried zzso 

zzso spinal zzso administration has been shown to be more effective than systemic zzso in some patients with cancer pain, but often must be combined with local zzso to provide satisfactory pain zzso Loss of effect over time is a significant zzso Since the identification of spinal zzso receptors and the introduction of zzso administered zzso a number of other receptors that are important in both zzso and suppression of pain projection systems have been zzso zzso and zzso to many of these receptors are being developed, and a few are available for clinical zzso zzso electrical stimulation of the spinal zzso produces substantial analgesia below the zzso spinal segments in some patients with chronic zzso Although initial results are usually encouraging, long-term efficacy may be zzso It is zzso that analgesia associated with spinal stimulation is associated with both stimulation of large fiber ascending tracts and blockade of zzso zzso zzso electrical nerve stimulation zzso has come into widespread use in managing chronic pain and has had limited trials in cancer pain zzso It is well accepted by patients and physicians, but clinical studies of long-term efficacy have yielded variable zzso The zzso action is probably the result of both large zzso fiber zzso and blockade of peripheral zzso
