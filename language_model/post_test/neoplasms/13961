The coordinate induction of distinct genes by heat stress and a considerable number of chemical zzso depend on a common regulatory element in the promoter found in front of related genes of all zzso zzso This element can be used for the construction of universal heat stress expression zzso The increasingly broad interest in the heat stress response and the genes involved also results from medical aspects, zzso the potential application of zzso in cancer therapy, the intricate connections of stress proteins and genes with zzso zzso and the remarkable role of heat stress proteins as dominant zzso of infectious and zzso zzso
