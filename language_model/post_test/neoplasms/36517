Data from an in zzso human zzso zzso suggested synergistic zzso when zzso zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso were zzso To explore this potential, we undertook a zzso zzso zzso trial in a phase I setting with various schedules of zzso and zzso Thirty-one patients were enrolled in the zzso zzso zzso A consisted of oral zzso daily for up to 21 days with cycles repeated every 35 zzso zzso B included oral zzso daily for up to 21 days plus zzso zzso at 5 zzso zzso days zzso zzso C included oral zzso daily for up to 21 days plus zzso with zzso at the same dose for 5 days zzso zzso to zzso zzso was begun at 25 zzso on level 1 and increased to 50 zzso on level zzso zzso patients were zzso for zzso nine on each arm (six patients on each arm on level 1, three patients on each arm on level zzso zzso on arm B zzso zzso and zzso was earlier and more profound than on arm A or zzso The median absolute zzso count and day of zzso for arms A, B, and C were zzso zzso and zzso and days 23, 15, and 26, zzso zzso was generally uncommon except on arm C level 2, where the median zzso count was zzso One partial response zzso zzso in a patient with zzso cell lung cancer was zzso zzso intensity favored arm zzso Neither zzso therapy with zzso and zzso zzso zzso nor zzso with zzso zzso zzso improved dose intensity over zzso alone zzso zzso and arms B and C were complicated by increased zzso and zzso
