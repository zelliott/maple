Signaling by transforming growth zzso zzso zzso zzso to the nucleus is zzso by type I and type II receptors and the zzso signal zzso the zzso zzso of some of the components of these pathways has been observed in human zzso These zzso can be deletions or zzso or zzso of components that act positively in the pathway, or zzso amplification or zzso of zzso of the zzso The selection of these zzso during tumor progression and their correlation with clinical zzso such as survival, risk of recurrence after tumor zzso or tendency for zzso spread, suggest that many are involved in tumor zzso Here, we review the genetic zzso and zzso modifications that occur in different components of the zzso zzso signaling pathways in human tumors and we discuss their correlation with clinical zzso The evidence suggests that not all zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso components in human cancer have an equivalent effect on tumor progression and we discuss what implications this has for our understanding of the role of zzso signaling in human zzso
