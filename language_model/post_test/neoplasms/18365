Monitoring cellular immune responses is one prerequisite for the rational development of cancer zzso 

We describe an extensive effort to zzso and validate zzso an in zzso zzso culture method by determining the zzso and function of both zzso and zzso T cells, including measurement of the zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the functional markers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inflammatory protein zzso tumor necrosis factor zzso and zzso 

zzso peripheral blood zzso cells zzso were potent zzso that expanded zzso zzso zzso T cells during short-term culture with the addition of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cells were zzso using this zzso 

Our culture system represents a robust human zzso culture protocol that permits zzso quantitative and qualitative evaluation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso
