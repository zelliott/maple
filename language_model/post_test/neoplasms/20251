Many fragile sites in the human zzso occur at or near zzso zzso reportedly involved in zzso of DNA material in zzso zzso This fact has led some investigators to zzso that fragile sites have a zzso role in human zzso To learn whether zzso fragile sites relate to zzso found in the zzso cells of an individual patient, we studied zzso from the peripheral blood of 32 patients in zzso from zzso zzso zzso were cultured in medium containing either zzso zzso or zzso plus caffeine, and zzso zzso were examined for zzso zzso zzso of completely zzso zzso cell zzso from 31 of the 32 patients were available for zzso In only once case, a 5-year-old child with acute zzso zzso did a zzso fragile site zzso coincide with a zzso in the zzso cells zzso Our findings suggest that zzso abnormalities in childhood zzso cannot generally be explained by the presence of zzso or zzso plus zzso fragile zzso
