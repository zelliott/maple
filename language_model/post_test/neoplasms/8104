zzso growth and zzso is believed to depend on the zzso ability to induce zzso Recent studies have indicated that zzso zzso zzso We performed a phase I and zzso study of zzso with zzso in children with zzso solid zzso 

zzso was administered as a single intravenous dose once every 21 days at a target area under the zzso curve of 6 zzso zzso was administered daily by zzso The initial dose level was 100 zzso with zzso dose escalation to a maximum dose of 300 zzso The next cohort of patients started at a dose of 300 zzso with zzso dose escalation to a maximum dose of 500 zzso Standard response and adverse event criteria were zzso zzso blood samples for zzso zzso studies were obtained after the first zzso 

Twenty-two patients received 56 cycles of zzso The maximum tolerated zzso dose was 400 zzso The zzso toxicity was zzso There were no objective zzso zzso apparent clearance was 55 zzso 16 zzso and the terminal zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso There was no evidence of zzso zzso in the narrow range zzso 

zzso at a dose of 400 zzso can be safely administered to children with solid tumors in combination with zzso zzso is the major zzso In addition, we have characterized the zzso behavior of zzso in zzso This study can serve as the basis for future investigation of zzso as an zzso agent in zzso
