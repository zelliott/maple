For the purpose of zzso discovery, we originally developed a novel method for quantitative zzso analysis utilizing both zzso stable isotope tagging and mass zzso The method has now been refined by replacing zzso and an enrichment column and further utilizing a novel zzso that is specifically suitable for zzso zzso A total zzso system has been constructed by combining this method with zzso an automatic zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Clinical tissue samples such as zzso zzso and zzso cell zzso were analyzed using this system, and the results demonstrated that it is useful for discovering novel zzso zzso Here, we review a series of these studies and also discuss future directions for development of this zzso
