zzso as a treatment for cancer has zzso much recent zzso However, major difficulties persist both in the technology for heating zzso tumors, and in zzso zzso We have investigated a heating technique for zzso zzso that employs an internal implanted zzso and an external zzso to apply zzso current to a tumor zzso The internal zzso consists of an array of stainless steel needles or wires which define a zzso cage within the zzso while the external zzso consists of a variety of electrical conductors at the skin zzso Phantom zzso have closely reproduced calculated temperature zzso The temperature profiles within the volume enclosed by the internal zzso show relatively zzso zzso zzso zzso in a rat tumor model have demonstrated that significant heating within such an internal zzso array is easily zzso The heating may extend some zzso outside the zzso Using a dog model we have shown that with such a treatment technique the temperature profiles obtained are zzso both zzso and zzso A case report of a clinical application is zzso A 5 zzso zzso zzso was easily heated without significant heating of the surrounding normal zzso and without apparent zzso Such a technique may be zzso to a variety of zzso but zzso zzso The zzso and relative zzso of heating suggest possible usefulness in combined zzso zzso
