The process of zzso development is a complex combination of genetic and zzso changes within a zzso It is, therefore, not surprising that a number of mechanisms exist by which chemicals influence this zzso In designing short-term tests to detect potential zzso the major emphasis to date has been on genetic zzso This is justified on both theoretical and practical zzso zzso evidence exists to support the hypothesis that genetic damage increases the probability of zzso zzso zzso zzso for gene zzso zzso and zzso induction are therefore extremely important tests for zzso Unfortunately, few zzso exist for detecting chemicals that induce gene amplification, and thus, if these are zzso that specifically induce this type of genetic change, they may go zzso Because of a variety of possible differences between a zzso activity in zzso and in zzso it is to be expected that chemicals that are zzso in zzso may not have a significant zzso effect in zzso However, the potential harm of these chemicals to man does exist and may be expressed under different conditions zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso or as zzso zzso
