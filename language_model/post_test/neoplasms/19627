Community respiratory viruses are an important cause of respiratory disease in the zzso patients with zzso To evaluate the occurrence and clinical significance of respiratory virus infections in hospitalized cancer patients at National Cancer Institute, Cairo University, during zzso treatment, we studied cases that developed episodes of lower respiratory tract infections zzso 

Thirty patients with zzso were studied zzso zzso and zzso zzso cultures were done and an zzso search for zzso zzso of influenza A and B, zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3, zzso respiratory zzso virus, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, and zzso zzso were performed on serum samples of zzso 

The main presenting symptom was cough and zzso Hematologic zzso was the underlying disease in zzso of zzso Blood cultures were positive in 11 patients zzso zzso zzso cultures revealed a bacterial pathogen in 13 cases and zzso in 3; whereas viral and zzso bacterial zzso zzso were detected in 13 and 4 zzso zzso zzso virus was the zzso virus zzso being of type B in 4 cases, type A in one case and mixed A and B in another 5 zzso followed by zzso in 5 zzso Taken together, bacteria were identified as a single cause of zzso in 10 cases, viruses in 6, zzso in 3 and mixed causes in zzso Still, there were 4 zzso zzso 

This study showed that respiratory viruses are common in zzso either as a single cause or mixed with bacterial zzso in hospitalized cancer patients receiving zzso zzso tests for respiratory viruses should be incorporated in the routine diagnostic study of patients with zzso zzso Also, it must be emphasized that early CT chest is crucial as a zzso prior to initiation of zzso or zzso zzso In cancer patients with a zzso episode and zzso tailored therapy is recommended according to the clinical findings of the zzso
