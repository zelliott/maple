Paradoxically, DNA sequence zzso in cancer risk zzso rarely correlate with the expression of cancer zzso zzso the molecular mechanism underlying an zzso zzso to cancer has remained largely zzso However, recent evaluations of the correlations between DNA zzso and gene expression levels across healthy and zzso zzso have revealed enrichment of zzso DNA zzso variations within zzso risk zzso Moreover, it appears that zzso enhancers embedded in cancer risk zzso often contain DNA zzso sites that closely define the expression of prominent cancer zzso despite the lack of significant correlations between gene expression levels and the surrounding zzso zzso zzso We suggest that DNA zzso variations may obscure the effect of zzso risk sequence zzso Analysis of zzso zzso data may help to reveal the regulatory circuits underlying predisposition to zzso and other common zzso
