Cancer stem cells zzso or tumor initiating cells were identified and characterized as a unique zzso with stem cell features in many types of zzso Current zzso studies provide novel insights regarding tumor zzso zzso zzso resistance to therapy and interplay with the tumor zzso A cancer stem cell niche has been proposed based on these zzso The niche provides the soil for zzso zzso and zzso stimulating essential signaling pathways in zzso and leading to zzso of factors that promote zzso and long term growth of zzso We present evidence which has emerged over the past 5 years indicating interaction of zzso with zzso in the proposed zzso zzso Based on these findings, targeting the zzso stem cell zzso by combining an individualized zzso approach with treatment of their zzso may represent a novel therapeutic strategy against solid tumor zzso
