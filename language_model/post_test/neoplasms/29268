In this paper, we report a new strategy of zzso resonance energy transfer zzso by using gold zzso zzso as efficient long-range energy zzso in sandwich zzso In the design of zzso system, we chose the highly sensitive zzso zzso reaction of zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso because the zzso spectrum of zzso zzso 425 zzso partially zzso with the visible zzso bands of zzso On the basis of zzso strategy, we developed a sandwich zzso of alpha zzso zzso cancer zzso In zzso two zzso zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso between the zzso zzso and the two different zzso bridged the donors zzso and zzso zzso which led to the occurrence of zzso from zzso to zzso upon zzso zzso We observed that the zzso of zzso signal depended zzso on the zzso concentration within a range of concentration from 5 to 70 zzso zzso and the detection limit of zzso was zzso zzso zzso Our method was successfully applied for determination of zzso levels in zzso from cancer patients, and the results were in good agreement with zzso zzso This approach is expected to be extended to other zzso designs, that is, using other zzso zzso zzso substance, and even other metallic zzso
