Changes in the degree of zzso polarization in the fluorescent zzso of zzso from patients with zzso diseases, patients with zzso diseases, and normal donors were investigated by the zzso polarization zzso In order to confirm zzso cancer test, two kinds of zzso the degree of zzso polarization of zzso zzso with zzso zzso and cancer basic zzso were obtained for each zzso Patients with zzso diseases were easily differentiated from the others without exception by an index, the response ratio of the degree of zzso zzso zzso of this technique was confirmed for the detection of zzso zzso
