zzso dots zzso have zzso optical properties that make them uniquely advantageous for in zzso targeted zzso imaging, traceable delivery, and zzso The use of group zzso zzso zzso zzso for these applications is advancing zzso However, group zzso zzso contain toxic heavy metals that limit their in zzso zzso Thus, replacing these with zzso of a zzso zzso such as silicon zzso is zzso Here, we demonstrate that properly zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used in multiple zzso in zzso applications, including tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso imaging in live zzso This work overcomes zzso and zzso challenges to in zzso imaging with zzso zzso through a unique zzso zzso surface zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso process that produces bright, targeted zzso with stable zzso and long zzso zzso tumor zzso time in zzso Upon the basis of this demonstration, we anticipate that zzso zzso can play an important role in more sophisticated in zzso models, by alleviating zzso toxicity concerns while maintaining the key advantages of zzso imaging zzso
