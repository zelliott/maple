There is currently much interest in generating zzso T zzso zzso responses against tumor zzso as a therapy for zzso In this study mouse zzso zzso were genetically modified to express a zzso zzso and a mature zzso zzso and then loaded with an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as a model zzso and tested for the induction of zzso zzso in zzso mice zzso The genetically modified zzso lacking either zzso or zzso were also zzso zzso with the zzso zzso induced strong zzso activities against zzso zzso zzso tumor cells, but not against other zzso tumor cells such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso The magnitude of the zzso response in mice with the zzso zzso was significantly higher than the response in mice zzso with any other cell zzso zzso T cells with zzso zzso activities were zzso in mice zzso with the zzso zzso Furthermore, treatment with the zzso zzso significantly prolonged the survival period of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso immunity by the zzso zzso could be induced without the help of host zzso cells zzso and zzso cells, whereas partially decreased by the depletion of zzso T cells at the zzso zzso These results support the ability of zzso gene transfer to enhance the zzso capacity of zzso for inducing zzso zzso zzso
