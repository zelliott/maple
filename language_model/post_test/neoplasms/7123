There is experimental evidence from animal models favoring the notion that the disruption of interactions between zzso and zzso plays an important role in the initiation of zzso These disrupted interactions are hypothesized to be zzso by zzso termed zzso which diffuse through the tissue to determine cell zzso and maintain tissue zzso 

We developed a computer simulation based on simple properties of cell renewal and zzso 

Under the computer zzso the disruption of the zzso zzso in the zzso generated zzso precursors of cancer without any zzso in the zzso 

The model is consistent with the possibility that the zzso of genetic and zzso changes found in tumors could arise after the formation of a founder population of zzso cells, defined as cells that are created by low or insufficient zzso levels and that no longer respond to zzso zzso Because the model is biologically zzso we hope that these results will stimulate further zzso
