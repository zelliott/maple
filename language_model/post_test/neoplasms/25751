The aim of this study was to assess the value of serum zzso B in detecting male zzso dysfunction in childhood cancer zzso 27 male zzso zzso zzso stage zzso or zzso and 12 zzso zzso or zzso zzso patients were drawn from the zzso follow-up protocol of childhood cancer patients at the zzso Clinic of zzso University Hospital, Turku, zzso The average time zzso zzso zzso between the diagnosis and this study was zzso zzso zzso years in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso years in the zzso zzso zzso samples for the determination of zzso hormone zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso testosterone, and zzso A and B zzso were zzso The demographic factors, zzso stage and zzso size of the patient were measured at the same routine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were correlated to zzso volume and zzso zzso Strong correlations were observed between zzso size zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso B concentration in the zzso zzso zzso A was not zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso volume measurement was accurately documented in 21 zzso zzso Patients with small zzso zzso 10 zzso had zzso B zzso under 42 zzso and those whose zzso size was over 13 zzso had zzso B zzso exceeding 100 zzso In all 12 zzso survivors, serum zzso B levels were zzso or zzso 94 zzso except in one case of zzso cancer where zzso B was zzso zzso and the zzso concentration was zzso zzso B seems to be an indicator of male zzso function in zzso childhood cancer survivors and could be used in the zzso of zzso function of male survivors earlier than zzso volume or zzso analyses would be routinely zzso However, the correct zzso level of serum zzso B, as well as the details of zzso B physiology during zzso remain to be determined before zzso analysis can be replaced by the measurement of zzso zzso
