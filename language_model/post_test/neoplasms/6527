A historical cohort study evaluated the mortality experience of zzso workers employed in 10 zzso or zzso zzso zzso 600,000 zzso of follow-up accrued as workers were followed to January 1, zzso Estimates of historical exposure to zzso by job were developed by project industrial zzso using monitoring data available from participating plants, comments from long-term workers, and comprehensive monitoring data specifically collected for this zzso zzso from all causes combined was about as expected zzso mortality ratio zzso zzso zzso based on mortality rates of the general zzso zzso zzso fewer deaths occurred from zzso and zzso diseases zzso zzso zzso and from accidents zzso zzso zzso than zzso Cancer overall was not related to zzso zzso Workers exposed to zzso had slight excesses for Hodgkin's disease and zzso of the lung and prostate zzso but these excesses were not consistently related to duration of or average, zzso or peak zzso exposure zzso Recent animal studies found zzso cancer among rats exposed to formaldehyde, but no excess of this tumor occurred in this zzso zzso from brain cancer and leukemia among these industrial workers was not excessive in contrast to reported excesses among professional groups zzso zzso zzso and zzso with exposure to zzso Although there was a deficit for cancer of the zzso cavity and zzso mortality from certain zzso zzso the zzso and zzso was zzso These zzso did not, however, show a consistently rising risk with level of zzso These data provide little evidence that mortality from cancer is associated with zzso exposure at levels experienced by workers in this zzso
