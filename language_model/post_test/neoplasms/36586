The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the measurement of zzso generated from cellular zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso in zzso plates, has been used for determination of zzso drug resistance of tumor cells from patients with zzso and solid zzso In the present study we describe a zzso procedure based on statistically derived zzso limits and zzso response probabilities using zzso zzso Test results at a specified drug concentration were divided into three zzso low, intermediate or extreme drug resistance zzso zzso and zzso zzso using the median and median zzso standard zzso as the zzso zzso When correlated with clinical outcome, zzso samples showed a higher response rate than expected, zzso a lower and zzso samples no response at zzso The sensitivity and specificity of the test, using the median as zzso limit, were zzso and zzso zzso By fitting these test characteristics to a statistical model based on zzso zzso it is possible to calculate response probabilities for each individual patient taking into consideration not only the test characteristics and the particular zzso result, but also the clinical and patient specific characteristics influencing the zzso probability of zzso zzso predicts clinical drug resistance with high specificity and is also observed in tumor types with high response zzso
