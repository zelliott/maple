zzso dose and transmission factors were determined for 6 zzso X-ray fields applied in four conventional external radiation treatments where protection blocks are used to shield zzso at zzso zzso treatments are: head and neck zzso of the zzso breast zzso zzso brain zzso zzso and pelvis zzso zzso Experimental zzso were made using zzso chambers and zzso zzso at different locations in zzso for blocked and zzso zzso zzso absorbed doses, using the treatment planning system and Clarkson method, were compared to those zzso Measured transmission factor values ranged from zzso to zzso It was found that the planning treatment system may underestimate the absorbed dose under the blocks, up to zzso
