The paper reviews methods of studying cell zzso in man, cell population zzso of human tumors and bone zzso drug interactions and the cell cycle, and possible applications to zzso The conclusions drawn are: zzso Cell cycle time and zzso duration for zzso zzso precursors in human bone zzso are poorly defined but are probably shorter than median values for most human tumors, including zzso zzso Most drugs have greater toxicity for cycling cells and some variation in toxicity at different zzso of the cell zzso There is a special need for chemotherapy directed at slowly zzso and hypoxic tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso of tumor cell zzso are of little value in choosing drugs or in predicting zzso zzso zzso in animals have demonstrated that therapeutic index may depend on zzso zzso of cell zzso in animals rarely allows prediction of the optimal schedule and is unlikely to do so in zzso zzso schedules in mice are not directly relevant to zzso zzso zzso of tumor labeling index or DNA zzso by flow zzso to detect cell zzso is of little benefit in scheduling if concurrent changes in bone zzso are zzso these methods are invalid at short intervals after treatment because surviving zzso cells are indistinguishable from a larger number of zzso cells prior to their zzso zzso The major factor determining the outcome of chemotherapy is the availability of drugs with activity for the tumor and acceptable host zzso zzso that complex schedules using several drugs are effective because of zzso or kinetic differences of tumor and normal tissue are at present zzso
