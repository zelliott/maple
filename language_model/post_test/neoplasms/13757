The new field of molecular epidemiology investigates the link between toxic exposure and an associated health effect by defining zzso intermediate stages in the development of the disease based on known zzso In the development of zzso these steps may involve exposure to known zzso and zzso zzso and potential metabolism of a chemical agent, characterization of the interaction of the agent at its site of action (usually zzso characterization of induced zzso changes, and, in certain instances, early detection of the cancer zzso These processes can be monitored through zzso specific to each of the steps in the progression toward disease using any of the host of zzso techniques now zzso An overview of such techniques is zzso with emphasis on techniques offering insight into the zzso zzso Evidence is presented suggesting that although there are many potential contributing mechanisms to zzso zzso remains the dominant driving force behind the zzso Several methods of monitoring zzso have shown promise as zzso of cancer zzso These methods might also be used as monitors of agents designed to intervene in the process to prevent the development of overt zzso
