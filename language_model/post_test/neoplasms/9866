Cell lines which produce zzso and zzso gut peptides have been established from a variety of human and animal zzso arising within and outside the zzso zzso Most of these lines also exhibit other zzso zzso and zzso characteristics of normal and zzso neuroendocrine zzso Studies of lines derived from a number of different kinds of zzso indicate that zzso storage and release of gut peptides by zzso is not truly zzso and that even in cells from highly zzso and poorly differentiated zzso these functions may be regulated to varying degrees by environmental influences that also affect normal cell zzso Cell lines have been valuable models for cellular and molecular studies of neuroendocrine gene expression in normal and zzso zzso
