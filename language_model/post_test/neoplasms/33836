The zzso spectrum of zzso zzso opens valuable insights into the functions of this protein that zzso its zzso nature in human zzso We present the zzso genetic status determined on a new set of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with comparison to the zzso data reported for various tumor zzso 

zzso zzso followed by zzso nonsense or zzso zzso is the zzso form of zzso zzso in pancreatic zzso Among the naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso the zzso domain is the most frequent target zzso of zzso zzso in human zzso A zzso hot spot resides within the zzso domain corresponding to zzso 330 to zzso termed the zzso cluster region zzso A relationship was found between the locations of the zzso zzso (the zzso domain, the zzso and the zzso outside of the zzso and the tumor types, suggesting environmental or selective influences in the development of zzso zzso zzso studies for zzso protein in nine archival zzso (six pancreatic zzso two zzso zzso and one zzso zzso with known zzso zzso indicated that all zzso within the zzso or zzso domain zzso to the zzso zzso of nine zzso had negative or weak zzso whereas two zzso with zzso within the zzso had strong positive nuclear labeling for zzso zzso 

These findings have important implications for in zzso functional studies, suggesting that the majority of zzso zzso zzso zzso by protein degradation in contrast to those that occur within the zzso
