zzso zzso T cells develop as the first zzso lineage within the fetal zzso and disproportionately zzso in zzso zzso such as zzso skin, zzso and zzso of adult zzso These unique zzso features and distribution patterns of zzso T cells enable rapid functioning against various insults from zzso zzso T cells are also able to respond to local inflammation and consequently regulate the zzso of zzso disorders and development of tumors in mice and zzso zzso it is clinically important to understand the mechanisms that regulate zzso T cell zzso Recent evidence has shown that generations of zzso zzso T cell zzso producing zzso zzso and zzso are programmed in the zzso zzso before their migration to peripheral zzso This review outlines our current understanding of the development and function of zzso T cells as they influence both innate and acquired zzso
