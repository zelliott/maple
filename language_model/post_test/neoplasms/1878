The ability to zzso DNA repair has been proposed as an effective method to overcome zzso drug resistance in human zzso However, no studies have shown that it is possible to achieve zzso of DNA repair in humans in zzso This study analyzes zzso of zzso zzso a DNA repair protein that protects cells from zzso DNA zzso formed by zzso zzso has been shown to zzso the zzso in zzso and sensitize tumor cells to other zzso Thus, we determined whether zzso zzso of zzso activity could be documented in patients receiving therapeutic doses of zzso and whether the zzso was specific to zzso or occurred in patients undergoing treatment with other zzso agents as zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso were used to analyze zzso of the zzso We found that zzso zzso activity was significantly decreased 20 h after treatment with zzso zzso zzso or high dose zzso zzso zzso but not after treatment with the other zzso agents or lower doses of zzso A cumulative decline in zzso zzso activity occurred with daily zzso treatment, reaching 26 zzso zzso of control after the third day of treatment zzso less than zzso Thus, the zzso DNA repair protein can be modulated in zzso in humans given systemic drug zzso While further studies are needed to document that zzso zzso can be achieved in the target tumor in humans, this study supports the development of clinical trials using zzso as a zzso zzso of zzso resistance in human zzso
