We discuss evidence indicating how ethanol could generate oxygen free zzso Recent use of techniques such as spin zzso and zzso zzso have demonstrably confirmed that both acute and chronic alcohol use by laboratory animals would generate free radical zzso These zzso are of biological origin and presumably involve zzso However, an exact identification of the zzso produced has not been worked out with the currently available zzso Also not known is the mechanism zzso ethanol could initiate free zzso The relationship between generation of free zzso and cell toxicity or zzso is also not zzso Using a variety of systems that included different species, strains and gender zzso zzso and zzso rats, female zzso mice, male Syrian golden zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we have shown an association of zzso zzso with ethanol tumor zzso However, the process of tumor promotion in general is not very clear and the role played by ethanol in this process is still more zzso Here we are reviewing evidence that could possibly be involved in such promotion zzso
