Due to the absence of safe and effective carriers for zzso delivery, the applications of small interference zzso zzso in clinic for therapeutic purposes have been zzso In this study, a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso and further zzso to zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso delivery, with an average diameter of zzso and a zzso potential of approximately zzso The chemical structures of the zzso were well characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso showed greater cell viability and zzso than those of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso targeted zzso formulated in zzso exhibited approximately zzso zzso of zzso expression on zzso cells in a zzso manner, which was comparable to zzso zzso The results of intravenous administration showed zzso significantly inhibited tumor growth in nude mice zzso zzso tumors, with a remarkable zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, no positive zzso of the innate immune responses and no significant body weight loss was observed during treatment suggested that this zzso zzso delivery system is zzso In conclusion, the present zzso based on zzso zzso zzso would be a safe and efficient zzso for zzso delivery of therapeutic zzso
