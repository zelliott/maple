zzso programmed molecular recognition provides the basis of all natural systems and supplies zzso functional materials from zzso of a limited number of molecular building zzso zzso such as zzso zzso acids and carbohydrates represent a diverse supply of structural building blocks for the chemist to design and zzso new functional zzso zzso In this context, we review here the chemistry we have developed to zzso peptides with zzso zzso zzso and organic zzso as well as combinations zzso using a zzso zzso With this methodology, we have prepared new integrated functional systems exhibiting designed properties in the field of zzso zzso as well as controlled zzso zzso Thus this molecular engineering approach allows for the rational design of systems with integrated zzso properties and zzso the way to more elaborate applications by bottom-up design in the domain of zzso
