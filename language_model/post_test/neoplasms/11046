The checkpoint zzso 1 zzso is one of the major players in the signal zzso zzso set in motion in response to DNA damage which activates different cell cycle checkpoints including the G zzso the zzso G zzso and the zzso zzso checkpoint, contributing to the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso is considered a good molecular target to zzso in combination with other zzso agents, to increase the sensitivity of treatment, especially in tumors with a defective G 1 zzso Experimental evidence highlights the essential role of zzso in normal and cancer cells even under zzso conditions, especially in controlling DNA replication and cell zzso This review looks at the main functions of zzso and the data on zzso zzso at their zzso and clinical development are zzso This information may suggest novel approaches for new treatments with zzso zzso in combination with zzso agents or as single zzso The emergent synthetic zzso approach may help define the genetic background features where zzso zzso alone could be very zzso
