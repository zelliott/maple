Using a sensitive zzso the zzso production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso production was investigated in whole blood cell cultures of 115 control subjects and 225 zzso patients with various solid zzso In the cultures of the tumor patients, significantly lower levels of zzso were found as compared to the controls zzso zzso or zzso zzso and the differences were most evident in those tumor groups containing mostly patients with advanced clinical zzso zzso values were only slightly lower in the cultures of the zzso patients, with p values zzso or zzso zzso zzso there was no correlation between zzso and zzso zzso Since the zzso differences between tumor and controls and the correlation to groups with higher tumor stages were much clearer than zzso differences, we conclude that zzso zzso after zzso induction may be the better zzso for showing a depressed cellular zzso activity in patients with zzso than zzso zzso zzso
