The mechanism of zzso induction by zzso has been studied by many investigators, but their tumor specificity is not zzso To address this point, 10 licorice zzso were subjected to quantitative zzso relationship zzso analysis with zzso zzso with four human oral zzso and three normal cell zzso 

zzso was determined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso parameters were calculated based on the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso had the highest zzso against tumor cells, and zzso zzso and zzso had the highest tumor zzso suggesting an zzso potential for zzso zzso had slightly higher zzso and tumor specificity than zzso The number of sugar units in the zzso was somewhat zzso with zzso but not with tumor zzso zzso that reflect the three-dimensional structure, molecular volume and number of zzso OH groups were significantly correlated with zzso but not with tumor zzso On the other hand, zzso energy was significantly correlated with tumor zzso but not with zzso 

These zzso zzso may be useful to estimate zzso or tumor specificity of zzso compounds to these licorice zzso
