zzso has an immense impact on the tissue zzso regulation of zzso and zzso zzso zzso modification of zzso cell differentiation and function seems a promising target for many zzso zzso are small zzso zzso which recognize and inhibit specific zzso In that way, they can regulate and orchestrate whole zzso zzso It has been shown that zzso can fine-tune zzso cell functions since they have either zzso and zzso activity, regulate expression of zzso zzso molecules or zzso oxide zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso differentiation of embryonic stem cells to zzso cells and their further specialization towards specific vascular zzso This review focuses mainly on the influence of zzso on the zzso and zzso cell zzso
