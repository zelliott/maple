The relationship between cancer and patient health is still of great interest for experimental and clinical zzso The tumor can adversely affect surrounding and distant zzso as zzso However, effects of the tumor on distant zzso are much less studied than its effects on surrounding zzso This study was aimed to test whether the tumor could trigger zzso and/or zzso signals with respect to the distant zzso tissue such as bone zzso 

zzso were zzso implanted with zzso zzso cells, and on the zzso and zzso days after zzso both zzso and zzso effects were assessed by flow zzso in zzso orange stained zzso bone zzso cells isolated from zzso The zzso effect was assessed using ratios of the following cell zzso total zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect was assessed by zzso of zzso zzso zzso within the population of zzso 

A significant zzso effect was observed in zzso animals on the zzso and zzso days after zzso zzso zzso decrease in both zzso and zzso ratios compared with corresponding parameters in control zzso There was also a zzso effect in these animals (a slight increase in the number of zzso however, this effect was zzso The zzso ratio zzso correlated with the tumor weight which is suggestive of the link between zzso zzso and tumor zzso 

zzso insult to the bone zzso is likely to be associated with the zzso triggered by zzso located tumors whose growth may correlate with the zzso zzso
