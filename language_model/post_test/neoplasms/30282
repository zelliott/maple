Respiratory tumor motion is a major challenge in radiation therapy for zzso and abdominal zzso zzso motion management requires an accurate knowledge of the real-time tumor zzso External zzso monitoring devices zzso zzso provide a zzso zzso low-cost and practical approach to obtain the respiratory zzso Due to the highly complex and zzso relations between tumor and surrogate motion, its ultimate success hinges on the ability to accurately zzso the tumor motion from respiratory zzso Given their widespread use in the clinic, such a method is critically zzso We propose to use a powerful zzso learning method to find the complex relations between tumor motion and respiratory zzso The method first stores the training data in memory and then finds relevant data to answer a particular zzso Nearby data points are assigned high relevance (or zzso and zzso distant data are assigned low zzso By fitting relatively simple models to local patches instead of fitting one single global model, it is able to capture highly zzso and complex relations between the internal tumor motion and external surrogates zzso Due to the local nature of weighting functions, the method is inherently robust to zzso in the training zzso Moreover, both training and adapting to new data are performed almost zzso with zzso learning, making it suitable for zzso following variable zzso zzso We evaluated the method using respiratory motion data from 11 zzso The data set consists of simultaneous measurement of zzso tumor motion and zzso abdominal surface zzso as the surrogate signal in this zzso There are a total of zzso respiratory zzso with an average zzso zzso of zzso zzso and average duration of zzso s per zzso Given only 5 s zzso one zzso zzso training data, the method achieved an average zzso error of zzso zzso and 95th zzso error of zzso zzso on unseen test zzso The average zzso error was further reduced to zzso zzso when the model was tuned to its optimal setting for each respiratory zzso In one trace where a few zzso are present in the training data, the proposed method achieved an error reduction of as much as zzso compared with the best linear model zzso zzso versus zzso zzso The zzso learning technique is able to accurately capture the highly complex and zzso relations between tumor and surrogate motion in an efficient manner (a few milliseconds per zzso Furthermore, the zzso is particularly suitable to handle situations where the training data are contaminated by large errors or zzso These desirable properties make it an ideal candidate for accurate and robust tumor zzso using respiratory zzso
