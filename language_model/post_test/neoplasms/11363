Cancer patients receiving chemotherapy experience zzso complications associated with the use of long-term zzso central zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso zzso study evaluated whether zzso treatment with a low molecular weight zzso could prevent clinically relevant zzso zzso 

Patients with cancer undergoing chemotherapy for at least 12 weeks zzso were randomly zzso in a zzso ratio, to receive either zzso zzso zzso or zzso by subcutaneous injection, once daily for 16 zzso Patients underwent upper zzso evaluation with either zzso or ultrasound at the time of a suspected zzso complication zzso or upon completion of study zzso The primary end point, as determined by a blinded zzso committee, was the occurrence of a zzso defined as the first occurrence of any one of the zzso clinically relevant zzso zzso that was symptomatic or that required zzso or zzso zzso zzso clinically relevant pulmonary zzso or zzso obstruction requiring zzso zzso 

There was no significant difference in the frequency of zzso between the zzso arm zzso and the zzso arm zzso zzso corresponding to a relative risk of zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso No difference in the time to zzso was observed between the two arms zzso There was no significant difference between the zzso and zzso groups in terms of major bleeding (1 versus zzso or overall zzso 

zzso prophylaxis did not reduce the frequency of zzso complications after zzso zzso in cancer zzso zzso was demonstrated to be safe over 16 weeks of treatment in these zzso
