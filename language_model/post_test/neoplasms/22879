The zzso zzso apparatus has been applied to the study of the interaction of zzso and tumor cells and their attachment to zzso zzso zzso derived from an zzso zzso tumor zzso 20 line) induced zzso zzso and were included in zzso zzso that deposited on vascular zzso in zzso experiments with zzso human zzso In contrast, zzso of blood samples containing cells from a line derived from a human zzso zzso of the lung zzso zzso which did not interact with zzso resulted in the deposition of zzso alone, with no tumor cells or blood cells other than zzso being observed in the zzso Extremely large zzso cell zzso were found at the vascular surface in zzso 20 zzso using vessel segments which had been treated with zzso These large zzso zzso zzso blood flow through the system and zzso both zzso and white zzso In order to zzso the deposition of tumor cells, zzso 20 cells were labeled with zzso and zzso in whole blood at a concentration of zzso zzso cell incorporation into zzso cell zzso on zzso segments yielded about 30,000 zzso of vascular tissue but this value was reduced some 2 orders of magnitude by the inclusion of zzso (1 zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in parallel zzso Aspirin at 100 zzso reduced tumor zzso zzso zzso but did not decrease the zzso deposition of zzso zzso 20 cells on vascular zzso suggesting the release reaction may not be of major significance in this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not observed in a zzso experiment using blood from a patient with severe von zzso zzso However addition of zzso zzso of zzso zzso plasma as a source of factor VIII to the von zzso blood sample restored the zzso deposition of zzso tumor cells to control zzso
