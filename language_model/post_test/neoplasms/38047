This study was conducted in an ongoing community-based cohort study to examine the prevalence of zzso adverse health conditions among cancer survivors and the association of these conditions with zzso health and functional zzso 

Data were analyzed from zzso II, a community-based cohort study in Washington County, Maryland that began in zzso zzso comparisons were made between zzso cancer survivors and zzso zzso and zzso individuals without a history of zzso Information on zzso adverse health conditions, zzso health, and activities of daily living was based on zzso 

Compared to individuals without a history of cancer, cancer survivors were significantly more likely to report a diagnosis of cardiovascular disease zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso and zzso disease zzso than zzso zzso versus zzso p zzso zzso Further, cancer survivors reporting two or more zzso adverse health conditions had a greater likelihood of reporting fair or poor zzso health zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and difficulty with at least one activity of daily living zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso compared to cancer survivors who did not report other adverse health zzso 

zzso from this zzso data analysis indicate that cancer survivors are at increased risk for zzso adverse health conditions, which are associated with poorer zzso health, more interference with normal activities, and functional zzso 

Increased attention must be given to the preventive care and treatment of zzso adverse health conditions among cancer survivors to decrease zzso morbidity and mortality and to maintain and improve quality of zzso
