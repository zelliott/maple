zzso plays many important roles within the immune zzso zzso signals in zzso via trans zzso where accessory cells such as zzso and zzso cells present zzso bound to zzso in trans to zzso cells and zzso memory T cells expressing zzso and common zzso chain zzso Previously, we showed that the zzso delivery of zzso to zzso mice zzso zzso B, and zzso cell zzso afforded protection against a lethal zzso challenge and zzso of zzso melanoma zzso In this study, we demonstrated that in zzso delivery of an zzso construct zzso for the zzso of human zzso to zzso mice resulted in significant increases in zzso size and cell number, leading us to zzso that zzso signals differently in zzso immune cells compared with zzso for which zzso and zzso expression are zzso Furthermore, treatment with zzso induced zzso production by zzso bone zzso cells, but the presence of zzso did not increase bone zzso cell sensitivity to zzso This zzso zzso production by zzso bone zzso cells occurred independently of the zzso and zzso pathways and instead required zzso signaling as well as zzso of zzso and zzso zzso we also showed that the trans presentation of zzso by zzso boosts zzso zzso production by zzso cells but reduces zzso zzso production by zzso zzso bone zzso zzso Our data clearly show that zzso signaling in zzso cells is different from that of zzso immune zzso Additional insights into zzso biology may lead to novel therapies aimed at bolstering targeted immune responses against cancer and infectious zzso
