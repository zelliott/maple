As an extension of the previously reported observation concerning the existence of zzso zzso zzso in transformed cells a variety of zzso and cell lines have been zzso for this zzso This activity was found in all zzso transformed zzso zzso with rat liver derived zzso zzso cells transformed with a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicated that expression of activity zzso with the extent of transformation and was independent of the zzso used for zzso Compared to previously reported values for normal zzso surprisingly high levels of the zzso zzso zzso were found in the rat adrenal zzso This activity was not seen in mouse or bovine zzso zzso activity was also detected in mouse bone zzso and was strain zzso The levels of activity in mouse bone zzso were lower than previously zzso The zzso zzso zzso activity in rat adrenal and zzso cells may represent tools for studying the regulation of expression of this zzso
