A three-dimensional dose zzso with photographic zzso zzso films) was realized within the zzso therapy project at zzso zzso using carbon zzso We present zzso zzso for 88, 100 and 200 zzso carbon zzso beams as the simplest case of dose zzso An actual patient treatment plan, composed by the zzso of zzso having different energies and zzso was used to perform a three-dimensional dose zzso of an zzso formed target zzso The shape of the measured dose distribution from film closely matches the intended zzso zzso Furthermore, the calculated and measured optical density distribution is in good agreement with a maximum zzso of less than zzso
