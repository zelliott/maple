The zzso zzso signaling zzso regulates embryonic development and may be zzso activated in a wide variety of human zzso Efforts to target zzso zzso signaling have steadily progressed from the laboratory to the clinic, and the recent approval of the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso for patients with advanced zzso cell zzso represents an important zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso have failed to show significant clinical activity in other solid zzso The reasons for these negative results are not precisely zzso but it is possible that the impact of zzso zzso zzso has not been adequately measured by the clinical zzso used thus far or that zzso in zzso signal zzso limits the activity of currently available zzso zzso Further basic and zzso studies to better understand zzso signaling in human tumors and validate putative zzso mechanisms in the clinical setting may ultimately improve the success of zzso zzso zzso to other tumor zzso
