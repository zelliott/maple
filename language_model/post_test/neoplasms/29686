In earlier experiments we had noted that transformed and zzso zzso produced an zzso zzso zzso The formation of zzso is a zzso process in which zzso cells first become detached and attracted to a site zzso and migration along a zzso zzso This is followed by local proliferation and finally by zzso and alignment against a zzso membrane in zzso zzso zzso with the last step is a zzso and zzso differentiation of the zzso cells zzso by the appearance of alkaline zzso zzso zzso factor VIII and the generation of receptors for zzso as well as the capacities to produce zzso and zzso on zzso It is zzso that there may be not one but several zzso zzso zzso for each step of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso for the zzso zzso for the local zzso and zzso for zzso zzso The above zzso aids in the zzso and understanding of a number of zzso syndromes since these reflect different disorders of the zzso vessel zzso The association and the simultaneous proliferation of vascular and zzso elements is a feature that a number of zzso disorders, of otherwise differing nature, have in zzso To this effect they have been grouped in this study as zzso syndromes zzso These are a group of zzso or zzso zzso entities in which proliferation of a zzso element zzso is coupled with the accelerated development of blood zzso and zzso zzso
