zzso membrane proteins contain a zzso zzso domain and mainly locate in the plasma membrane zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso constitute an important group of such membrane zzso which have a profound impact on cancer zzso zzso and patient zzso Although studies of their functions have conventionally focused on their zzso forms, documented observations of the presence of these membrane receptors and their functioning partners in the nucleus have reshaped the zzso geography and highlight the need to modify the central zzso The zzso proteins in the membrane can zzso to the nucleus through different zzso Nuclear zzso regulate a variety of cellular functions, such as cell zzso DNA damage repair, and signal zzso both in normal zzso and in human cancer zzso In addition, they play important roles in determining cancer response to cancer zzso Nuclear presence of these zzso proteins is emerging as an important marker in human zzso An integrated picture of the zzso signaling zzso network extending from the zzso boundary to the nuclear compartment is looming in the foreseeable horizon for clinical zzso
