To identify genes which zzso results into zzso instability zzso we developed a biological approach based on a zzso indicator strain in which zzso can be detected by a zzso zzso zzso in this strain of a zzso zzso library cloned into a high copy zzso led us to zzso among the clones generating zzso of zzso zzso zzso one of the six zzso zzso present in zzso zzso of zzso B2 and zzso zzso the two human zzso of zzso in the zzso indicator strain resulted also into a zzso zzso and zzso like zzso of zzso an abnormal sensitivity to zzso indicating that zzso of zzso zzso alters the zzso zzso In a series of 38 primary zzso zzso we detected in five tumors zzso an zzso of zzso zzso which was neither related to zzso zzso nor to zzso within the coding region, and in five other tumors zzso a zzso increase of zzso B2 zzso which was not related to gene zzso These results suggest that zzso of zzso B, resulting from different mechanisms, could zzso through an zzso of the zzso checkpoint, to the zzso instability observed in zzso
