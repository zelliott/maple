One particular application of zzso data, is to uncover the molecular variation among zzso One feature of zzso studies is the fact that the number zzso of samples collected is relatively small compared to the number p of genes per sample which are usually in the zzso In statistical terms this very large number of zzso compared to a small number of samples or observations makes the zzso problem zzso An efficient way to solve this problem is by using dimension reduction statistical techniques in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso 

We view the zzso problem as a zzso problem with few observations and many predictor zzso We use an zzso dimension reduction method for generalized zzso zzso models that allows us to solve the zzso of zzso zzso arising in the context of expression zzso The zzso performance of the resulting zzso rule is illustrated on two well know data sets in the zzso zzso the leukemia data that is known to contain classes that are easy zzso and the colon data zzso
