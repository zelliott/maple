The crucial role of zzso zzso receptors zzso in the control of zzso functions is well zzso These receptors are the target of zzso zzso (through zzso zzso and zzso (through zzso zzso for the treatment of zzso zzso including zzso zzso It has also become increasingly clear that zzso are expressed in cancer zzso either related zzso zzso breast, zzso and zzso zzso or unrelated zzso melanoma, glioblastoma, zzso and pancreatic zzso to the zzso zzso In zzso tumors, zzso appear to be expressed even when the tumor has escaped steroid dependence (such as zzso prostate zzso These receptors are coupled to a zzso zzso signaling zzso zzso of tumor zzso by means of zzso zzso elicits a strong zzso zzso and zzso (more recently zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso have also been shown to elicit a direct zzso zzso thus, these compounds behave as zzso of zzso at the zzso level and as zzso of the same receptors expressed in zzso According to the zzso zzso theory, zzso might assume various zzso endowed with different activities for zzso zzso and with different zzso signaling zzso according to the cell zzso Based on these consistent experimental zzso tumor zzso are now considered a very interesting candidate for novel zzso zzso zzso targeted strategies for the treatment of tumors expressing these zzso These agents include zzso zzso and antagonists, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso hybrids, and zzso zzso delivering zzso zzso
