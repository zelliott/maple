Potential candidates for lung transplantation undergo a rigorous evaluation before zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels are used as a screening tool for zzso zzso in many lung transplant zzso We reviewed the zzso zzso levels in lung transplant recipients in our institution to determine their zzso zzso 

We performed a retrospective database review of the first 200 patients that had undergone lung or zzso transplant at our institution zzso were zzso Data extracted included zzso levels (in zzso at the time of lung transplant zzso demographic data, and zzso Patients had one of the following diagnoses: zzso zzso zzso fibrosis, chronic zzso pulmonary disease, zzso syndrome, idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis, primary pulmonary hypertension, zzso or zzso 

After excluding zzso zzso results were available for 174 of 193 zzso zzso zzso levels were elevated in 85 patients zzso with a mean value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Solid organ zzso developed in 6 patients, at a median follow-up of zzso months after zzso Their mean zzso zzso level was similar to the rest of the group zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels did not predict zzso zzso Patients with idiopathic pulmonary zzso had the highest zzso zzso levels, whereas patients with primary pulmonary hypertension and zzso syndrome had the lowest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso 

zzso levels are high in patients with zzso lung disease, especially zzso Their levels appear to be a marker of the underlying disease and do not predict the zzso survival or development of zzso
