There has been considerable progress in recent years in developing zzso models for the zzso of toxic chemicals and in the application of these models in cancer risk zzso zzso zzso models consist of a number of individual zzso based on the anatomy and physiology of the zzso zzso of interest, and include specific parameters for zzso tissue zzso and tissue zzso Because of the correspondence between these compartments and specific zzso or groups of zzso these models are particularly useful for predicting the doses of biologically active forms of toxic chemicals at target zzso under a wide variety of exposure conditions and in different animal species, including zzso Due to their explicit characterization of the biological processes governing zzso zzso these models permit more accurate predictions of the dose of active zzso reaching target zzso in exposed humans and hence of potential cancer zzso In addition, zzso models also permit a more direct evaluation of the impact of zzso uncertainty and zzso zzso in cancer risk zzso In this article, we review recent developments in zzso zzso modeling for selected chemicals and the application of these models in zzso risk zzso We examine the use of these models in zzso diverse information on zzso and zzso and discuss challenges in extending these zzso models to reflect more accurately the biological events involved in the induction of cancer by different zzso
