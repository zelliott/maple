Experimental evidence from radiation exposure, zzso drugs or chemicals such as pesticides or metals does suggest the possibility of transmission of zzso zzso zzso effects across zzso The zzso framework is growing with suggestion of transmission of zzso modifications as a mechanism alternative to zzso zzso There is also ample experimental evidence for a specific zzso of the male zzso to the action of zzso zzso In zzso interpretation of zzso findings regarding effects of zzso paternal zzso such as zzso radiation or persistent organic pollutants zzso on zzso development remains zzso Many zzso studies have included paternal zzso as an zzso to existing studies and focused mainly on birth zzso sex ratio, childhood zzso or spontaneous zzso zzso zzso such as zzso parameters or zzso dysfunction resulting from paternal exposure have been barely zzso zzso knowledge on possible consequences of paternal zzso in future generations is needed and has strong implication in terms of regulation, in the workplace for zzso One may expect human studies to be conducted with a particular focus on zzso zzso toxicity making use of biological markers pertinent to hypothesized zzso zzso of early zzso of disease onset has led to the setup of a number of zzso zzso across the world and careful assessment of paternal zzso should be included in these zzso These zzso will also have the power to evaluate the specific impact of in zzso exposure on a number of zzso of zzso toxicity in zzso
