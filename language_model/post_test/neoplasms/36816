To examine risk factors for, and determine the zzso of, zzso infections among patients with an zzso vascular access zzso 

Grady Health System, including a zzso zzso public, teaching hospital and human zzso virus zzso zzso and zzso cell clinics in Atlanta, zzso 

123 consecutive patients who received a zzso zzso zzso access device between January 1 and June 30, zzso

zzso illnesses included zzso infection in 66 patients zzso zzso count, zzso zzso zzso in 51, and zzso cell disease in zzso Mean age of patients was zzso years, 50% were male, and zzso were zzso Thirty-one zzso of 123 patients developed a primary or zzso zzso infection zzso and 3 of the 31 patients experienced two separate episodes of zzso The overall rate of infection was zzso primary zzso per 1,000 device zzso Patients with cancer had a lower rate of infection than those with zzso infection, but the difference was not statistically significant zzso vs zzso zzso device zzso relative risk, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso analysis of patients with different zzso indicated that infection rates differed according to type of cancer, and there was a trend for zzso across the different cancer strata zzso zzso pathogens accounted for zzso of the pathogens zzso Six zzso of 31 patients who developed an infection did so within the first 14 days after zzso In 11 zzso of the 34 zzso the port required zzso two patient deaths were attributed to zzso zzso zzso zzso device zzso 

zzso one fourth of patients who had a vascular access device implanted developed a primary zzso but the overall infection rate zzso 1,000 device zzso was relatively low, even among those with zzso zzso zzso zzso rates in patients with vascular access devices appeared to differ according to the specific underlying zzso
