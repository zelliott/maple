zzso and zzso geometry can be used as auxiliary tools for diagnostic purposes in zzso zzso Whether zzso parameters or zzso functions are more important for the zzso of the texture of biological zzso is not zzso In the present study, volume and surface area per unit reference volume, the pair correlation function and the zzso zzso contact density function of zzso were estimated in three case series of benign and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The information provided by the latter functions was summarized by the total absolute areas between the estimated zzso and their horizontal reference zzso These areas are considered as indicators of zzso of the tissue texture from a completely zzso volume process and from the zzso model with convex zzso zzso We used both areas and the zzso parameters for the zzso of cases using artificial neural networks zzso Learning zzso zzso and zzso zzso networks with zzso were applied as neural zzso zzso included distinction between zzso and zzso cancer (40 zzso between benign zzso zzso and zzso cancer zzso zzso and between chronic zzso and pancreatic cancer zzso zzso The same data sets were also classified with linear zzso zzso The zzso estimates in combination with zzso or zzso analysis provided high accuracy in the zzso of individual zzso The question of which category of zzso is the most zzso cannot be answered globally, but must be explored zzso for each specific data zzso Using learning zzso zzso better results could often be obtained than by zzso zzso networks with zzso
