zzso models are currently bridging the gap between classical cultures and in zzso animal zzso zzso this novel approach zzso the possibility to mimic the tumor zzso in zzso through the establishment of zzso synergistic zzso zzso these zzso models offer a perfect platform for the development and zzso evaluation of candidate zzso loaded with zzso drugs in a high zzso screening mode, with lower costs and absence of ethical zzso However, this evaluation was until now limited to zzso systems established with precise cell ratios, not addressing the natural cell zzso commonly found in different zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso efficiency was characterized in various zzso zzso systems containing different cell ratios, in order to unravel key design parameters that influence zzso performance and the therapeutic zzso The successful establishment of the zzso models was confirmed by the zzso distribution of the different cells in zzso zzso incubation in the various zzso systems reveals that these zzso possess targeting specificity for cancer cells, indicating their suitability for being used in this illness zzso Additionally, by using different zzso ratios, different zzso zzso profiles were zzso These findings are of crucial importance for the future design and zzso of new drug delivery systems, since their real targeting capacity must be addressed in zzso cell zzso such as those found in zzso
