zzso cells zzso were identified and types and forms of their zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso tumors in dog and man were studied by indirect zzso method using highly zzso zzso zzso to smooth muscle zzso and by performing alkaline zzso zzso Operation material from 75 patients and 12 dogs was studied by zzso method and from 26 persons and 12 dogs by zzso zzso Comparative analysis of zzso and zzso identification of zzso revealed differences in the results of zzso in 7 out of 38 observations due to negative test for alkaline zzso in the presence of zzso A high degree of coincidence of positive tests in zzso and zzso methods of the study suggests that the test for alkaline zzso is a sufficiently reliable marker of zzso The principal similarity of types and forms of zzso zzso in canine and human zzso zzso tissue indicates that dogs may be used as an adequate model for the study of various diseases of this zzso In addition to the known zzso and zzso types, a zzso concentric and zzso zzso of zzso were distinguished in parallel zzso and zzso studies on zzso of zzso zzso
