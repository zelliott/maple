zzso zzso volume in one second zzso is zzso associated with mortality in Western zzso but few studies have assessed the associations of peak zzso flow zzso with subsequent zzso zzso or have used populations in developing countries, including China, for such zzso 

A prospective cohort study followed zzso 170,000 Chinese men ranging in age from zzso years at baseline zzso for 15 zzso In the study, zzso zzso zzso which was zzso with zzso was calculated by dividing zzso by zzso zzso ratios zzso for zzso mortality and zzso adjusted for age, area of residence, smoking, and education, were calculated through Cox zzso zzso 

Of the original study population, zzso men died from respiratory causes zzso and 22 zzso died from other causes (including zzso from lung cancer, zzso from other zzso and 10 460 from cardiovascular disease) before reaching the age of 85 zzso Respiratory mortality was strongly and zzso associated with zzso For zzso zzso 250 zzso the association was zzso with a hazard ratio zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso per 100 zzso reduction in zzso The association was stronger but not zzso for lower values of zzso zzso from combined other causes was also zzso associated with zzso and the association was zzso for all values of zzso declining with zzso with zzso per 100 zzso reduction in zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in three consecutive zzso follow-up zzso Specifically, lower values of zzso were associated with higher mortality from cardiovascular disease and lung cancer, but not from other zzso 

A lower value of zzso was associated with increased mortality from respiratory and other causes, including lung cancer and cardiovascular disease, but its associations with the other causes of death declined across the follow-up zzso
