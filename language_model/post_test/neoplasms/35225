Natural killer zzso cells have originally been identified based on their capacity to kill transformed cells in a seemingly zzso zzso Over the last 15 years, knowledge on zzso zzso systems used by zzso cells to specifically detect transformed cells has been accumulating zzso One of these zzso zzso systems, the zzso pathway, has received particular attention, and now serves as a paradigm for how the immune system is able to gather information about the health status of zzso host zzso In addition to its significance on zzso cells, zzso as well as other zzso cell zzso play significant roles on T zzso This review aims at zzso recent insights into the regulation of zzso function, the control over zzso zzso expression and the role of zzso in tumor zzso Finally, we will discuss first attempts to exploit zzso function to improve immunity to zzso
