Although depression is a prevalent and burdensome psychiatric problem in zzso cancer patients, little is known about its zzso to treatment, especially when patients reach very close to the end of zzso This study was conducted to evaluate response rate of that zzso depression to psychiatric intervention and to assess the feasibility of conventional evidence-based pharmacological therapy for zzso 

The medical records of 20 patients who were referred to the psychiatry division for major depressive disorder and died within 3 months after the referral were zzso The Clinical Global zzso zzso zzso was used for each case, and zzso were defined as patients whose scores were much or very much zzso All pharmacological treatments were zzso and the doses of the zzso prescribed were compared to their zzso therapeutic zzso 

Of the 20 patients, seven were responders, but no response was achieved when the survival time was less than 3 zzso Most patients were treated with zzso but the doses prescribed were far less than the defined doses, especially the doses of the zzso zzso zzso 

These results suggested that patients' survival time largely determines zzso to psychiatric treatment, and it is hard to achieve response in patients whose survival time was less than about 1 zzso Implementation of conventional evidence-based pharmacological treatment is difficult, especially with zzso and various zzso which can be zzso by other routes, are needed when oral intake is zzso
