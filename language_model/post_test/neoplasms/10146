Different publications show an increased zzso of zzso in zzso transplant zzso The objective of this study is to determine the zzso of cancer in the recipients of zzso transplants performed in the A zzso Hospital zzso during the period zzso 

During the study period 1967 kidney transplants were performed, corresponding to zzso zzso Patients with zzso prior to the transplant will be excluded zzso zzso zzso A follow-up study was carried out in order to estimate cancer zzso after zzso each patient, information included donor and recipient zzso patients and graft survival and cancer zzso after zzso zzso cancer is considered as new cases of cancer after the transplant with zzso zzso Their location will be classified according to the zzso analysis will be calculated using the indirect zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso rates in the Spanish general population will be obtained from the Carlos III Health Institute, the National zzso Centre of the Ministry of Science and zzso Crude first, second and third-year zzso cancer zzso rates will be calculated for male and female zzso The number of cases of cancer at each site will be calculated from data in the clinical zzso The expected number of zzso will be calculated from data supplied by the Carlos III Health zzso For each zzso location we will estimate the standardized zzso ratios zzso using zzso cancer zzso rates, by dividing the zzso rate for the transplant patients by the rate of the general zzso The zzso confidence intervals of the zzso and their associated zzso will be calculated by assuming that the observed zzso follow a zzso zzso zzso analysis will be performed to examine the variation in the zzso with sex and length of zzso risk survival analysis methods will be applied to estimate the cumulative zzso of cancer and to identify variables associated to its zzso 

Information about cancer zzso in kidney transplant patients could be useful to adapt the guidelines on zzso transplant follow-up on zzso zzso and evaluate the impact of intervention measures for the prevention of cancer in these zzso
