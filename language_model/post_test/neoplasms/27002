Recent tumor zzso sequencing confirmed that one tumor often consists of multiple cell zzso zzso which bear different, but zzso genetic profiles such as zzso and copy number variation zzso Thus far, one tumor has been viewed as a whole entity in cancer functional zzso With the advances of zzso sequencing and zzso analysis, we are able to zzso and zzso dissect clones from tumors, and then conduct zzso zzso Emerging technologies such as zzso zzso sequencing and zzso could profile tumor zzso Thus, we should reconsider how to conduct cancer systems biology studies in the zzso sequencing zzso We will outline new directions for conducting cancer systems biology by considering that zzso sequencing technology can be used for zzso zzso and genetically characterizing clones from zzso Topics discussed in Part 1 of this review include zzso zzso of tumor zzso zzso network zzso cancer zzso networks and their zzso zzso principles and the principles of cell survival networks of fast-growing zzso
