A systematic review and zzso was conducted to test the hypothesis that zzso health care workers are at an increased risk of cancer, zzso complications and acute toxic zzso 

A structured literature search of Index zzso zzso zzso zzso the Cochrane Database of zzso zzso and zzso was performed from 1966 to December 2004 for human zzso studies evaluating the risk of toxic events in health care workers exposed to zzso zzso Raw data and adjusted odds ratios zzso reported in eligible studies were combined using a random effects model to calculate point estimates and zzso confidence intervals zzso for each potential risk zzso 

zzso OR for zzso zzso zzso and spontaneous abortions among health care workers exposure to zzso agents compared to a zzso control zzso 

The systematic review identified 14 studies evaluating the outcomes of interest, seven of which were suitable for statistical zzso Due to lack of evidence, we were unable to estimate a pooled OR for the risk of cancer and acute toxic zzso However, no significant association was detected between exposure to zzso drugs zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, an association was identified between exposure to chemotherapy and spontaneous abortions zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The results of this systematic review identified a small incremental risk for spontaneous abortions in female staff working with zzso zzso Health policy decision makers should effectively communicate the magnitude of this risk to their staff and implement cost effective interventions for its reduction or zzso
