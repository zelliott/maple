Although zzso zzso zzso zzso is but one of more than a thousand distinct zzso zzso present in the zzso zzso this zzso has attracted attention for its role in a diverse range of cellular processes and its positioning at a zzso of several signaling pathways that are important in cancer and other human zzso The association of zzso with widely different functions, from zzso metabolism to fruit fly zzso and slime mold zzso was initially zzso However, as the context of the biological processes involving this zzso has been zzso unifying themes have emerged that begin to explain its zzso zzso Unlike most protein zzso involved in zzso zzso is active in zzso resting zzso Its activity is zzso during cellular responses and its zzso therefore tend to be zzso As more of these targets have been identified and the effects of their modification by zzso determined, most have been found to be functionally inhibited by zzso zzso this zzso appears to act as a general zzso keeping its targets switched off or zzso under resting zzso The rarity of this form of regulation is perhaps related to the diversity of its zzso Over the past decade, the importance of zzso has been established by three significant zzso its remarkable evolutionary zzso allowing analysis in genetically zzso zzso its involvement in the zzso signaling zzso and its zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso 3' zzso zzso zzso This review covers recent advances in understanding the zzso roles of this zzso particularly in the context of zzso
