The goals of chemotherapy in patients with cancer should be both tumor shrinkage and extension of survival zzso zzso that there is a clear correlation between the extent of zzso tumor reduction and survival time, we have made an effort to reduce tumor zzso However, many investigators have found no positive correlation between response rate and median survival time in various zzso including zzso cell lung cancer and gastric zzso If this is the case, we should reconsider our therapeutic zzso We previously reported that doctors should induce a prolonged dormant phase rather than strive to shrink tumor mass in zzso zzso zzso because the survival of most patients with solid tumors depends on the length of the induced dormant phase rather than on induced tumor zzso In this paper, we analyzed two Japanese phase II studies of gastric zzso There were no significant differences between the survival of NC patients with zzso of more than 90 days and zzso + zzso patients in either zzso These results suggest prolonged NC could contribute to longer survival, and we concluded that NC patients with greater than 90 days of zzso that is zzso zzso exhibited similar survival relative to those with effective treatments and tumor zzso and should be evaluated as a positive zzso
