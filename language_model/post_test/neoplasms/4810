zzso zzso zzso low temperature sensitive zzso zzso were combined with a clinical magnetic zzso high intensity focused ultrasound zzso platform to investigate in zzso zzso drug zzso Plasma zzso were determined in 3 zzso Fifteen rabbits with zzso tumors within superficial thigh muscle were randomly assigned into three treatment groups: 1) free zzso 2) zzso and 3) zzso + zzso For the zzso + zzso group, mild zzso zzso zzso was applied to the tumors using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was applied for a total of 30 zzso completed within zzso after zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso analysis of the harvested tumor and zzso zzso was performed to determine zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso was performed to determine zzso spatial distribution in the zzso zzso of zzso tumors resulted in accurate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso temperature control in the target zzso zzso + zzso resulted in significantly higher tumor zzso zzso zzso and zzso greater compared to free zzso and zzso respectively, zzso zzso This improved tumor concentration was achieved despite heating zzso of the tumor zzso Free zzso and zzso treatments appeared to deliver more drug in the tumor periphery as compared to the tumor zzso In contrast, zzso + zzso treatment suggested an improved distribution with zzso found in both the tumor periphery and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was fairly similar between treatment zzso This technique has potential for clinical translation as an zzso method to deliver drug to a solid zzso
