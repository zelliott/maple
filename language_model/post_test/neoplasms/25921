The human zzso resistance zzso zzso contributes to the phenomenon of zzso resistance during cancer and AIDS zzso A potential novel strategy to circumvent the effects of zzso during chemotherapy is to prevent maturation of zzso during zzso so that the zzso does not reach the cell zzso Here we report that zzso zzso zzso that is prevented from reaching the cell surface by processing zzso or by zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso exhibited no zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis also showed that the immature zzso did not exhibit zzso zzso changes as found in the mature zzso In addition, the immature zzso was more sensitive to zzso than the mature zzso These results suggest that zzso is unlikely to be functional immediately after zzso These differences in the structural and zzso properties of the mature and zzso immature zzso could potentially be used during chemotherapy, and should result in the search for compounds that can specifically inhibit the maturation of zzso
