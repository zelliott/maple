A zzso for construction of zzso genetically engineered tumor vaccines and characterization of tumor zzso consists in the difficulty of establishing cell lines from human tumor zzso We have constructed two zzso allowing transient expression of zzso virus 40 large T as an zzso zzso The first zzso contains the genes for zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for positive and negative selection and the gene zzso large zzso They are flanked by zzso sites, the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The second zzso contains the genes for the zzso zzso and zzso as selection zzso By sequential infection of zzso cells with the two zzso we have shown that the newly expressed large T gene can be deleted in a large proportion zzso or zzso of cells by zzso zzso Because the deletion included the zzso zzso selection with zzso against cells not having undergone zzso was zzso By infection with the large T zzso cell lines could be easily established from mouse primary kidney cells, human zzso and cells derived from different surgical specimens of breast or colon cancer zzso One breast zzso cell line was further analyzed and shown to be of zzso origin by characteristic markers zzso zzso This cell line grew continuously in culture for more than a year without any indication of a cell zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso selection resulted in complete zzso of the large T gene as judged from zzso zzso zzso these cells changed zzso and stopped proliferation comparable to the cells obtained from biopsy demonstrating the requirement of large T for zzso zzso this approach may facilitate molecular and cellular characterization of human tumors and other cell types where cell zzso is the limiting step, and gene therapy approaches involving zzso tumor zzso
