The development of tumor cell resistance to conventional zzso is a major clinical zzso There is an urgent need to develop novel zzso to overcome resistance and save patients from tumor zzso Novel zzso are currently being developed based on better understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern resistance and the identification of targets that control zzso One of the major factors that controls resistance is the zzso factor nuclear factor zzso zzso that has been shown to be zzso activated in the majority of zzso and is responsible, in large part, for tumor cell survival, growth and direct zzso of zzso gene zzso The development of zzso zzso of zzso activity may result in diminishing the zzso threshold of resistant tumor cells and leading to zzso of tumor cell growth and cell death or zzso to the zzso effects of zzso zzso The novel zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively prevents the zzso of zzso into the nucleus and, zzso prevents its various zzso zzso Thus, zzso is unlike many other zzso zzso that target gene products of the zzso zzso and it is also unlike zzso zzso that prevent the degradation of zzso zzso is a small zzso shown to be zzso in mice and zzso and exerts direct zzso effects in zzso and in zzso as well as significant zzso and zzso activities in resistant tumor zzso The present review summarizes studies that have used zzso as a novel zzso zzso
