Small birth size may be associated with increased risk of cardiovascular diseases zzso whereas large birth size may predict increased risk of obesity and some zzso The net effect of birth size on long-term mortality has only been assessed in individual studies, with conflicting zzso 

The zzso of zzso Studies in zzso zzso guidelines for conducting and reporting zzso of zzso studies were zzso We retrieved 22 studies that assessed the association between zzso and adult mortality from all causes, zzso or zzso The studies were systematically reviewed and those reporting hazard ratios zzso and zzso confidence intervals zzso zzso per zzso zzso increase in zzso were included in generic inverse zzso zzso 

For zzso zzso zzso deaths were included and the results showed a zzso lower risk zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso higher zzso for men and women zzso For cardiovascular zzso the corresponding inverse association was stronger zzso zzso zzso zzso For cancer zzso zzso per zzso higher zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso for men and zzso zzso zzso zzso for women zzso zzso zzso could not be zzso but is unlikely to account for the main zzso 

These results show an inverse but moderate association of zzso with adult mortality from zzso and a stronger inverse association with cardiovascular zzso For men, higher zzso was strongly associated with increased risk of cancer zzso The findings suggest that zzso can be a useful indicator of processes that influence long-term zzso
