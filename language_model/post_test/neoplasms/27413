It is well established that zzso is a primary target for zzso in human zzso zzso carries out the important task of ensuring that damaged DNA is not passed on during cell division, a duty that it performs by either zzso the cell cycle or inducing zzso However, it is unclear how this decision is zzso The recent identification of the zzso family of zzso which act to direct the cell away from cell cycle arrest and towards death following zzso zzso may explain how this dilemma is zzso Furthermore, the observation that zzso is in fact the full length form of the previously identified zzso protein has clarified the ambiguous data that has been generated in relation to this zzso The further zzso of these proteins will enable us to gain further insights into the response of the cell to DNA damage and the progression of the cell towards zzso
