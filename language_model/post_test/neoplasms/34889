zzso daily patient zzso is becoming increasingly important in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso utilizing a therapy beam and an zzso electronic portal zzso can be used to zzso tumor volumes and verify the patient's position prior to zzso zzso produces a zzso zzso image and therefore can only account for zzso zzso In this work, the feasibility of using the zzso raw data as a zzso series of portal images to monitor tumor changes due to zzso respiratory motion was zzso A method was developed to read and convert the CB raw data into a zzso To improve the zzso ratio on the zzso projection data, image zzso with filtering techniques was zzso Volumes of interest from the planning CT were projected onto the zzso Because of the small exposure and the varying thickness of the patient depending on the projection angle, zzso contrast was zzso zzso visibility as a function of tumor size and projection angle was zzso The method was well suited in the upper chest, where motion of the tumor as well as of the zzso could be clearly zzso In the cases of patients with zzso cell lung cancer with medium or large tumor masses, we verified that the tumor mass was always located within the zzso despite respiratory zzso However for small tumors the method is less zzso because the visibility of those targets becomes zzso zzso of motion in zzso directions might also be limited for small tumor zzso Viewing zzso data in a zzso mode adds to the utility of zzso for zzso of tumor motion and for zzso individualized treatment zzso
