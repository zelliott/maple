Critical for zzso integrity, accurate DNA replication is tightly regulated by the convergence of zzso protein complexes zzso to zzso replicating origins on DNA in zzso and is activated by zzso promoting zzso that selectively target and trigger origin firing in zzso To present, a checkpoint mechanism monitoring zzso complex formation and zzso has yet to be zzso However, zzso of these protein complexes has yielded divergent zzso in recent reports: normal cells arrest in the cell cycle, whereas zzso cells arrest and zzso These data zzso a mechanism by which normal cells sense zzso zzso and then signal for cell cycle zzso The potential for therapeutic exploits of this disparity between normal and cancer cells is zzso Here, we explore recent data supporting the existence of a zzso checkpoint that ensures faithful zzso formation, a cell cycle mechanism that is zzso compromised in cancer zzso
