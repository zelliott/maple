The incorporation of zzso zzso and zzso into protein was studied in zzso and zzso preparations of zzso zzso tumor cells in minimal zzso Although incorporation proceeded at linear rates in both preparations for more than 1 h and into the same spectrum of zzso zzso cells incorporated zzso acid zzso to zzso more rapidly than zzso zzso zzso of approximately 200 zzso zzso in excess of zzso was required to achieve zzso rates of incorporation in zzso zzso zzso by zzso was rapid in onset (several minutes) and slowly zzso by zzso zzso was uniquely potent and specific among zzso occurring zzso in zzso such zzso zzso of zzso acid incorporation by zzso occurred over a broad range of pH and zzso and was facilitated by zzso The effects of zzso in stimulating zzso acid incorporation were not traceable to changes in zzso zzso zzso acid zzso protein zzso cell zzso or zzso content, or zzso of transfer zzso zzso D (1 zzso did not block the zzso effects of zzso although zzso and zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso on protein synthesis were not restricted to zzso in minimal zzso zzso synthesis was reduced by zzso zzso zzso zzso acid 40 to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adrenal zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells incubated under simulated growth conditions with various enriched media and zzso zzso zzso lymphoma, zzso zzso zzso and normal, dispersed chicken zzso cells in enriched medium responded to zzso restoration with increased rates of protein synthesis as did zzso normal rat liver cells in minimal zzso zzso synthesis in rabbit zzso zzso was also inhibited by zzso zzso or by zzso removal by zzso affinity zzso and the zzso was reversed by zzso These findings are consistent with the existence of a zzso requirement in the zzso phase of protein synthesis in zzso zzso
