Among the small round cell tumors differential diagnosis is particularly difficult for their zzso or primitive zzso In this mixed group of tumors, only the primitive zzso tumors, which include Ewing's zzso zzso show the unique and consistent feature of the zzso zzso which can therefore be considered a hallmark of these zzso We analyzed four primitive zzso tumor cell lines, one zzso cell line, and 11 patients by fluorescent in zzso zzso with zzso clones zzso and zzso zzso the zzso at zzso zzso spreads from tumor cell lines, and from biopsy specimens of three patients with zzso were zzso In the remaining eight patients zzso five zzso two small cell zzso and one chronic zzso only zzso preparations were available for zzso We detected the zzso in zzso zzso of the four primitive zzso tumor cell lines, of three patients in which the zzso demonstrated the zzso and in five cases of zzso in which zzso analysis had not been zzso Two cases of small cell zzso and one chronic zzso were also analyzed and were both normal with respect to the zzso By analyzing cell lines and small round cell tumor samples by fluorescent in zzso zzso we established that zzso zzso is a rapid alternative to zzso analysis for the detection of the zzso and represents an invaluable tool for the differential diagnosis of small round cell zzso
