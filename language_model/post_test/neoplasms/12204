To assess the cause of death for zzso offspring and zzso 

zzso zzso 

zzso nationwide zzso 

Family pedigree information was collected on 295 offspring of zzso (from 106 families with a parent already enrolled in the nationwide New England zzso zzso and on 276 controls (from 82 control zzso from 1997 to zzso zzso were individuals whose parents were born in the same year as the zzso but at least one of whom died at the average life zzso 

Age at death and cause of zzso 

zzso offspring had a zzso lower risk of zzso mortality zzso a zzso lower risk of zzso mortality zzso and an zzso lower risk of coronary heart zzso mortality zzso zzso differences were not found for other causes of zzso However of those who died zzso zzso dead at a significantly younger age than zzso 

These findings suggest that zzso offspring have lower zzso mortality rates and zzso mortality rates for cancer and coronary heart zzso These results suggest that mechanisms for survival to exceptional old age may go beyond the avoidance or delay of cardiovascular disease and also include the avoidance or delay of zzso zzso survival advantage of zzso zzso may not be due to factors related to childhood zzso Ultimately, survival to exceptional old age may involve lower zzso to a broad range of age-related diseases, perhaps secondary to zzso of basic mechanisms of zzso
