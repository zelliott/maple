One of the major mechanisms through which zzso cells respond to zzso and environmental signals is by changing their gene expression zzso This complex and tightly regulated process is largely regulated at the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso Within this process an important class of zzso regulators are the zzso zzso zzso proteins that zzso zzso and zzso zzso While zzso of zzso is generally associated with active zzso the effect of zzso of zzso proteins varies between zzso resulting in for example zzso in zzso protein zzso or protein zzso Given the central role of zzso in zzso regulation and other cellular zzso it may not be surprising that genetic zzso in the genes zzso zzso resulting in zzso forms of these regulatory zzso have been linked with various human diseases, including zzso zzso disorders and various forms of cancer, including zzso Here we will review zzso found in genes zzso human zzso and discuss the zzso functional consequences on the function of these zzso So far the lessons learned from naturally occurring zzso in humans have proven to be invaluable and zzso such genetic zzso in various experimental systems will extend our knowledge even zzso This seems particularly relevant given the wide range of diseases in which zzso have been implicated and may help to open up new therapeutic zzso
