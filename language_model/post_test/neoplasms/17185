zzso interactions zzso through the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain of zzso are critical for cell survival and zzso zzso S zzso mixture of compounds resulting from the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso been shown to zzso inhibit the interaction between zzso and zzso in zzso In human breast cancer cell lines, with high zzso expression levels, zzso S reduces the binding of zzso to zzso zzso or zzso and decreases proliferation and zzso Here, we report the development of a protocol for the zzso and isolation of biologically active constituents of zzso S and the characterization of the novel compound zzso zzso blocked the growth of several transformed cell lines, but had much weaker effects on zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the proliferation of melanoma cell lines that had become resistant to treatment with zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso In transformed cells, zzso zzso with zzso signaling at the level of zzso but had no effect on the zzso of zzso zzso decreased binding of zzso to zzso and to a lesser extent zzso in zzso and in zzso suggesting a possible mechanism of zzso Given that tumors frequently develop resistance to zzso zzso during treatment, zzso and related compounds may offer promising alternative strategies to currently available zzso
