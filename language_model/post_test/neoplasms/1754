The American Cancer Society zzso the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention zzso the National Cancer Institute zzso and the North American Association of Central Cancer zzso zzso collaborate annually to provide updated information regarding cancer occurrence and trends in the zzso This year's report features a special section on cancer zzso 

Information concerning cancer cases was obtained from the zzso zzso and zzso and information concerning recorded cancer deaths was obtained from the zzso The authors evaluated trends in zzso cancer zzso and death rates by zzso models and described and compared survival rates over time and across zzso zzso 

zzso rates for all zzso combined decreased from 1991 through 2001, but stabilized from 1995 through 2001 when adjusted for delay in zzso The zzso rates for female lung cancer decreased (although not statistically significant for delay zzso and mortality leveled off for the first time after increasing for many zzso zzso cancer zzso rates also zzso Death rates decreased for all zzso combined zzso per year since 1993) and for many of the top 15 zzso occurring in men and zzso The zzso relative survival rates improved for all zzso combined and for most, but not all, zzso over 2 diagnostic periods zzso and zzso However, zzso survival rates were lower and the risk of dying from cancer, once zzso was higher in most minority populations compared with the white zzso The relative risk of death from all zzso combined in each racial and ethnic population compared with zzso white men and women ranged from zzso in Hispanic white men to zzso in American zzso Native men, with the exception of zzso zzso women, whose risk of zzso was similar to that of zzso white zzso 

The continued measurable declines for overall cancer death rates and for many of the top 15 zzso along with improved survival rates, reflect progress in the zzso early zzso and treatment of zzso However, racial and ethnic disparities in survival and the risk of death from cancer, and geographic variation in stage zzso suggest that not all segments of the zzso population have benefited equally from such zzso
