Animal models are established tools to study basic questions of biology in a systematic zzso They have greatly facilitated our understanding of the mechanisms by which nature forms and maintains zzso Much of the knowledge on molecular changes underlying the development of organisms originates from research in the fruit fly model zzso zzso zzso models including the mouse and zzso model, but also other animal models coming from different corners of the animal kingdom have shown that much of the basic machinery of development is essentially zzso not just in all zzso but in all major zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, key elements of this machinery have been demonstrated to be involved in zzso molecular abnormalities detected in zzso from patients, indicating their implication in the genesis of human zzso Thus, research in this field has become a common topic for both biologists and zzso In this review, we zzso current knowledge on some of these key elements and molecular pathways such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that have been originally described and studied in animal models and which seem to play a major role in the zzso and targeted management of human zzso
