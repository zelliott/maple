zzso of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso is the rule in experimental tumors with acquired resistance to these zzso So far, there is no indication that this phenomenon is due to an zzso mechanism of action common to the two groups of zzso In nearly all reported studies, acquired experimental resistance and zzso are related to a decreased cellular zzso of both types of drugs, although other factors also are zzso In zzso zzso tumors, a number of findings at zzso conditions indicate that the decreased zzso is dependent on a cellular mechanism for active outward drug zzso which is common to zzso and zzso zzso but changes in inward transport and zzso binding capacity also zzso Similar findings have been reported for resistance and zzso in zzso zzso Recent results with zzso of acquired experimental resistance in animal tumors by zzso of outward drug transport and studies on the effect of different zzso derivatives on zzso of zzso in resistant cells are zzso
