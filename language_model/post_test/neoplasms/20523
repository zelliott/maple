The purpose of this report is to present an overview of the use of zzso imaging in zzso with particular emphasis on zzso It is important to note, however, that many of the methods described zzso have been applied to the study of zzso zzso as zzso Modern medicine and biology research has benefited greatly from an ever-expanding assortment of fluorescent markers and zzso These markers and labels have allowed investigators to observe the behavior and properties of cell and molecular entities of interest in the context of complicated biological systems such as a zzso cell or a whole zzso zzso developed to image zzso in whole mice have been valuable in studying patterns of tumor growth and zzso zzso more detailed information and a wide variety of zzso can be obtained using zzso zzso This review focuses on use of zzso imaging for zzso zzso For detail on zzso imaging of whole animals, refer to reviews on this subject zzso For zzso applications, studies have focused primarily on window chamber preparations that allow for real-time zzso of tumor growth, zzso vascular responses to zzso vascular zzso vascular orientation, flow instability, and the zzso These zzso have been used to show that there are functional differences between tumor and normal zzso with respect to these functions under baseline conditions and after therapeutic zzso Examples of some of these differences are provided in this review as a means to illustrate how they can be zzso
