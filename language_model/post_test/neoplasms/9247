Rosa zzso petals are used for production of zzso zzso wines and zzso Despite the wide availability of rose zzso comprehensive information on zzso chemical composition and healthful properties is still zzso zzso the aim of this study was analysis of zzso zzso and zzso activity and chemical composition of zzso rose zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso were evaluated for their zzso effect against cervical zzso and breast cancer zzso cell lines and for zzso activity (with zzso As a result, significant zzso (up to zzso of dead zzso and zzso properties zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso Moreover, notable zzso activity against eight bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso zzso zzso and two zzso strains zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Total zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso content in petals was determined using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso was used to thoroughly analyze zzso acids and zzso zzso in the zzso extract and zzso obtained after its zzso Five zzso acids and six zzso previously not reported in the plant material were zzso 

This is the first such detailed report on chemical composition and biological activity of zzso zzso zzso
