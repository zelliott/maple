The zzso probability of a zzso explanation given that an environmental cancer cluster is statistically significant depends on the prior probability of an environmentally caused zzso the sensitivity of the statistical test and its zzso The prior probability is low, because it is rare to have enough zzso in the general environment to cause a relative risk of cancer high enough to achieve statistical significance in a small geographic zzso The sensitivity and specificity are not zzso The likelihood that a census tract escapes statistically significant zzso in all 80 types of cancer can be zzso Many of the thousands of census tracts will, by chance alone, have at least one type of cancer whose zzso is statistically zzso zzso observation from a large cancer registry confirms this zzso zzso zzso the principles of zzso zzso would suggest that most statistically significant environmental cancer clusters are not due to environmental zzso One would have to investigate hundreds of environmental cancer clusters to find one with a true environmental zzso
