zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso gene on zzso zzso are associated with familial predisposition to melanoma and other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also found in a variety of sporadic zzso and over 140 sequence zzso have already been recorded in the zzso In assessing the relevance of these zzso and for zzso members of affected families, it is important to distinguish zzso zzso from harmless zzso zzso functional zzso have frequently reached conflicting conclusions and no single test appears zzso Here we evaluate a number of alternatives including a novel zzso based on zzso delivery of zzso zzso into human zzso zzso Among the 17 sequence zzso zzso three distinct categories can be zzso those that abrogate the binding of zzso to zzso and zzso those that alter the properties of the protein without preventing it from interacting with zzso and those that have no discernible effect on protein zzso These distinctions can be rationalized by considering the impact of the zzso acid changes on the three-dimensional structure of the zzso
