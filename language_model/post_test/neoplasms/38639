Nerve growth factor zzso is a zzso important for normal development of the nervous system and promotion of survival and differentiation of sensory and sympathetic zzso in zzso The cellular effects of zzso are zzso by a specific cell surface zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso In the present study we have used a zzso zzso against human zzso to zzso by the zzso method, the zzso distribution in a wide range of normal zzso and in more than 200 zzso zzso Our results show that zzso human zzso is expressed in the peripheral nervous system but not in any of the central nervous system areas zzso zzso zzso expression is not restricted to neural zzso but is also found in a number of normal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression changes during normal zzso and zzso zzso expression in zzso tumors generally parallels its normal tissue zzso Thus, zzso is detected in a proportion of zzso tumors, zzso and zzso and also in a characteristic group of small zzso tumors zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings suggest a normal regulatory role for zzso in both zzso and zzso cells and identify a range of human tumors in which the zzso system may contribute to the zzso zzso
