zzso viruses have recently been reported in serum samples from varying percentages of human blood donors and in patients with chronic liver zzso However, no association with human pathology has yet been zzso In a pilot study we zzso 162 biopsy specimens from various human zzso and from colon zzso for the presence of zzso virus related sequences by zzso chain reaction using three sets of zzso zzso for zzso virus zzso All gels were subjected to Southern zzso zzso and DNA from zzso bands was cloned and zzso A total of zzso of zzso specimens contained identifiable zzso virus related zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso positive and gastrointestinal zzso zzso stomach, zzso zzso and colon zzso zzso zzso Lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso and human zzso zzso also revealed a high prevalence of zzso virus related zzso Since normal control zzso were not available for the zzso biopsy specimens tested, these data do not permit conclusions concerning a possible zzso relationship between the virus infections and zzso Another zzso however, deserves attention: the zzso of zzso virus clones obtained from the specimens tested here was zzso 66 novel zzso probably belonging to new types were zzso Only 16 clones corresponded by more than zzso of their sequences to established zzso Even individual zzso commonly contained sequences substantially zzso in zzso acid zzso Up to five different types were identified within an individual zzso The high zzso of these virus types suggests that additional primer combinations within the highly zzso region of the zzso would detect a still higher rate of positive zzso
