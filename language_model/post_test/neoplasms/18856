zzso zzso zzso Woodson zzso is a tree occurring in the Amazon zzso The local population uses its bark against to external tumors and zzso 

zzso the zzso activity of the crude extract and their zzso against human tumors zzso 

The zzso responses of the crude extract and their zzso were zzso evaluated by zzso B zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso as well as against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso data from the crude extract allowed considering active only in the zzso cell zzso However, the zzso activity was much more pronounced at the zzso fraction in all cell lines zzso The zzso fraction demonstrated activity against to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso fraction demonstrated activity only in zzso and the zzso zzso did not present zzso zzso 

Through the popular use we find that the crude extracts of zzso zzso bark displayed weak zzso However, the zzso fraction showed to be active only against to tumor cell lines while zzso fraction possesses high activity being similar to the positive zzso Both zzso have been selected for future zzso zzso and isolation of active zzso
