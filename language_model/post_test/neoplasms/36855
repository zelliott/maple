zzso zzso zzso zzso methods and zzso zzso are techniques that provide information on protein expression in tissue zzso Both methods have been used to investigate the impact of the zzso zzso zzso system in zzso In the present paper we first compared the expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in a compound group consisting of 33 cancer zzso of various origin zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso by zzso and zzso by zzso zzso the same kind of comparison was performed on a group of 23 melanoma zzso and a group of 28 breast zzso zzso The two techniques were applied to adjacent parts of the same frozen tissue sample, enabling the comparison of results obtained on material of almost identical zzso zzso correlation zzso between zzso results and zzso results for zzso zzso zzso and zzso varied between zzso and zzso and were higher for the compound group and the breast cancer group than for the melanoma zzso Although a higher zzso score category was always associated with an increased median zzso value, there was an overlap of zzso values from different scoring zzso zzso for the individual zzso cases the relation between zzso and zzso is zzso This indicates that the two techniques are not directly interchangeable and that their value for clinical purposes may be zzso
