zzso is an immediate cellular response to DNA damage generated either zzso or zzso This zzso modification is zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is proposed that this protein plays a zzso role in many cellular zzso including DNA repair, zzso cell proliferation and death, as well as zzso zzso Chemical zzso of the zzso dominant negative or zzso zzso of zzso cause a high degree of zzso instability in zzso zzso of zzso activity by chemical zzso renders mice or rats susceptible to zzso agents in various tumor models, indicating a role for zzso in suppressing zzso Despite the above zzso zzso knockout mice are generally not prone to the development of zzso An enhanced tumor development was observed, however, when the zzso zzso zzso was introduced into severely compromised zzso mice (a zzso in zzso protein zzso or mice lacking other DNA repair or zzso zzso zzso such as zzso or zzso These studies indicate that zzso functions as a zzso to suppress zzso via its role in stabilization of the zzso and/or by interacting with other DNA strand zzso zzso Studies using zzso zzso and chemical zzso have started to shed light on the role of this protein and of the specific protein zzso modification in the control of zzso stability and hence its involvement in zzso
