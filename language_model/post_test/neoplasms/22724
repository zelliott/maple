To investigate the capacity of two zzso expressions to describe the population tumor response in case of a zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso of the individual tumor control probability zzso models to include the case of a zzso zzso is a trivial zzso However, an zzso solution that results in a closed form population zzso formula for the zzso case is, unfortunately, a very complex mathematical zzso Therefore we applied a zzso approach to the zzso 

zzso data sets are constructed through the generation of dose zzso and population zzso data obtained by a zzso solution of a zzso integral over an individual zzso zzso The capacity of the following two zzso - zzso and equivalent uniform dose zzso based - zzso zzso zzso see zzso to describe the population tumor response in case of zzso zzso is investigated through their fitting to the zzso data zzso zzso AND zzso While both expressions produce statistically acceptable fits to the zzso data within zzso zzso error band, the use of the second expression is preferable since it produces considerably better fits to the data zzso
