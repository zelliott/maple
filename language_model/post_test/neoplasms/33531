The influence of zzso on tumor growth and frequency of zzso in zzso as well as on growth and zzso of zzso cells in zzso was tested utilizing human and zzso cell zzso In mice receiving injections of a zzso mixture twice daily the tumor volume, the number of spontaneous zzso per animal, and the number of mice with zzso was approximately double that of zzso zzso of zzso cells with the zzso mixture doubled the number of zzso zzso in the lungs of mice receiving the cells by zzso zzso zzso of a zzso mixture to the culture medium enhanced zzso of zzso cells about zzso This finding was similar to that observed for zzso zzso The presence of zzso in the culture media for a zzso incubation period about doubled the number of zzso cells as compared to zzso the same was observed for zzso zzso The data are interpreted to indicate that zzso improve growth and zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both events may zzso in enhancing tumor growth in zzso the first by improving zzso the second by direct action on the zzso cell zzso
