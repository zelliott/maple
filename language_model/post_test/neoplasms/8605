Only a small proportion of zzso arising in inherited syndromes such as zzso coli, have an unequivocally inherited zzso Nevertheless, most common zzso show familial zzso much of which may be due to inherited zzso If so, there may be wide variation in genetic zzso to common zzso The precise models of zzso are zzso but for zzso cancer and breast cancer there is some evidence that a small proportion of cases result from highly zzso dominant zzso This has been confirmed recently for breast cancer by genetic linkage zzso Clear evidence for genetic zzso has been obtained for Hodgkin's disease and zzso zzso where the existence of zzso genes at the zzso locus has been demonstrated by linkage zzso These genes could account for the majority of cases of these zzso Identification of other cancer zzso genes should be possible, either directly using linkage analysis, or through identification of constitutional zzso related to cancer zzso
