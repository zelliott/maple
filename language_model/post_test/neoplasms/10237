We previously identified zzso zzso T cells and zzso in cancer patients with zzso zzso zzso tumors and also in some healthy zzso We also demonstrated that these responses may be important in cancer zzso by showing that vaccination against zzso B1 prevents growth of zzso zzso zzso tumors in zzso zzso zzso of zzso B1 was determined to correlate with the lack of zzso zzso This allowed us to use zzso mice as a model that better zzso human zzso These zzso mice spontaneously develop zzso zzso zzso At 5-6 weeks of age, when the mice were still healthy with no evidence of zzso they received the zzso B1 vaccine and were then observed for tumor zzso We demonstrate that zzso B1 vaccination delays spontaneous zzso zzso tumor growth and increases median survival of zzso zzso zzso
