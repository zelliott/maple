Resistance to zzso zzso I zzso has been related to zzso of nuclear target zzso whereas zzso to zzso II zzso may result from induction of zzso II by zzso I zzso Here, we evaluated a zzso administration of a zzso I inhibitor followed by a zzso II zzso 

Twenty-five patients with advanced or zzso zzso were treated with increasing doses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso on days 1 to 3, followed by zzso zzso or 150 zzso on days 4 and zzso At the zzso tolerated dose, 20 additional patients were zzso The median age was 60 years zzso zzso zzso zzso included zzso analyses of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso of zzso I and II expression in peripheral blood zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fatigue were zzso zzso and occurred in six zzso Despite a median number of four prior regimens zzso zzso 2 zzso patients had an objective response and 13 zzso patients had stable zzso In contrast to the expected zzso in zzso I and zzso levels, we observed a decrease in zzso zzso levels, whereas zzso I levels were not significantly altered by zzso zzso 

zzso administration of zzso and zzso is tolerable and zzso However, peripheral blood zzso cells may not be a zzso biological surrogate for drug-induced zzso of zzso levels in tumor zzso and should be further explored in larger zzso
