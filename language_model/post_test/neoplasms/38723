zzso adherence zzso zzso immunity zzso studies were performed on zzso obtained from patients with various stages of breast cancer, colon zzso and lung cancer in order to monitor cell zzso immunity during tumor zzso In the presence of zzso serum, all patients with localized tumors showed positive zzso indexes zzso than zzso while significant reduction of zzso tumor zzso recognition as measured by the zzso responses was observed in nearly all patients with Stage IV breast cancer, Duke C colon cancer and Stage III lung zzso On substituting zzso serum with normal AB serum, zzso from patients with large tumor burdens responded to zzso tumor zzso These results indicate the existence of zzso serum zzso which may mask the zzso sites on zzso cells for tumor zzso Patients with such serum blocking zzso showed significant increase of zzso immune complexes zzso zzso and zzso Application of a protein A affinity column zzso resulted in a major reduction of zzso and other immune zzso but not of zzso The blocking effects of zzso serum, however, were not completely zzso by zzso on the protein A column, thus suggesting that zzso may be zzso in nature and may occur in other serum protein zzso beside the immune zzso
