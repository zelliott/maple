To determine whether there was a sufficient amount of zzso remaining in a patch that had been used continuously for 3 days to warrant establishment of disposal policies to prevent diversion of zzso 

Nine patches were applied and removed by hospice nurses after 3 days of continuous use on hospice patients with zzso zzso were analyzed for the remaining zzso contents using the zzso zzso zzso Five zzso patches and four zzso patches were opened, zzso with zzso diluted with water, and analyzed in zzso An unused zzso patch also was analyzed as a control and showed a zzso recovery of zzso A methanol blank was negative for zzso 

The study determined the amount of zzso in milligrams remaining in a used zzso Using zzso principles, this quantity was compared with a potential lethal dose of zzso 

Analysis showed zzso zzso remaining in the zzso patches and zzso zzso remaining in the zzso zzso These numbers represent zzso of the original zzso Using the zzso values of the volume of distribution of zzso and a potential lethal blood concentration of zzso zzso one can calculate the potential lethal dose for a zzso person to be 1036 zzso This is well within the amount remaining in the zzso This study also demonstrated that a wide patient zzso exists in the zzso of zzso from the zzso 

There is a sufficient amount of zzso available for abuse and misuse after 3 days of therapeutic zzso zzso disposal policies currently are not established and need to be zzso
