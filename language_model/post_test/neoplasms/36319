T cells play a critical role in tumor zzso by eliminating newly transformed zzso zzso However, tumor cell zzso can escape from zzso control after zzso leading to tumor zzso Whether and how T cells respond to tumor growth remain zzso Here, we found that zzso T cells exhibited persistently zzso expression of the zzso protein 1 zzso zzso zzso during tumor zzso The zzso expression of zzso in T cells exacerbated tumor growth, whereas the zzso deletion of zzso reduced tumor zzso This unexpected zzso effect of zzso was zzso through the induced expression of immune zzso zzso programmed death 1 zzso via the direct binding of zzso to the zzso site in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso of this binding site zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso function and zzso tumor zzso Taken together, these findings indicate that zzso zzso subsequently zzso zzso expression in response to tumor progression and that zzso such induction is essential for repression of tumor zzso
