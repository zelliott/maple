Malignancies that occur in excess among human zzso virus zzso individuals may be caused by zzso or zzso Because zzso defined cancer zzso have not been systematically zzso their risk was assessed among people with acquired zzso syndrome zzso 

zzso included zzso people with AIDS from the zzso Cancer Match zzso a linkage of 15 US zzso zzso and cancer zzso during 1980 to zzso zzso zzso ratios zzso were estimated to compare cancer risk in people with AIDS to the general population overall, and zzso by age, calendar period (a proxy of changing zzso zzso and time since onset of AIDS (a proxy of zzso 

Sixteen individual cancer zzso or zzso groupings zzso significantly elevated zzso zzso were most elevated for adult T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and accessory zzso cells zzso zzso zzso giant cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and leukemia not otherwise specified zzso zzso zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso for zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and skin zzso zzso zzso not otherwise zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso germ cell tumors, plasma cell tumors, zzso diseases, acute zzso zzso and zzso zzso For several of these cancer zzso significant declines in zzso were observed across calendar periods zzso with decreasing risk with improved zzso zzso or increase in zzso with time since onset of AIDS zzso prolonged zzso 

The elevated risk of certain cancer zzso in people with AIDS may point to an zzso role of zzso or zzso Future studies are needed to further investigate these associations and evaluate candidate infectious zzso
