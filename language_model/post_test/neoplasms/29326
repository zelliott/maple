zzso is the zzso zzso Its zzso or zzso has been associated with a number of zzso including breast, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Many therapeutic approaches are aimed at the zzso A series of 2, zzso zzso zzso zzso are among the most highly potent and selective zzso of zzso described to zzso For in-depth investigation into the structural and chemical features responsible for the binding recognition mechanism concerned, as well as for exploring the binding pocket of these compounds, we performed a series of automated molecular zzso zzso It was revealed that the binding site consisted of three main areas zzso zzso and zzso composed of most of the zzso zzso acids able to accommodate the zzso arms of the compounds zzso However, the zzso interface did not make much contribution to the binding of the zzso The presence of zzso zzso and zzso may also be responsible for the binding recognition through zzso zzso with zzso through a zzso zzso stacking zzso The interaction model and zzso of zzso zzso were derived that can be successfully used to explain the different zzso activities of these zzso Moreover, the zzso results were quite robust as further validated by molecular zzso It is anticipated that the findings reported here may provide very useful information or clue for designing effective drugs for the therapeutic treatment of zzso zzso
