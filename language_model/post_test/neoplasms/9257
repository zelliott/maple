A new zzso drug delivery system was developed based on the zzso complex of positively charged zzso quantum dots zzso and zzso charged zzso zzso zzso zzso with the model zzso drug zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso capped with zzso were directly zzso by a zzso zzso zzso can zzso the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso through a zzso electron transfer process, thus zzso zzso are in the zzso zzso zzso After the zzso zzso are exposed to zzso or are taken up by cancer cells, PGA is zzso to release zzso inducing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The zzso zzso can deliver zzso to targeted cancer cells and monitor the zzso release based on the zzso zzso signal of zzso zzso and this could be simultaneously used for the imaging of cancer zzso The zzso zzso zzso have great potential in terms of their clinical application for cancer zzso
