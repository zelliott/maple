In phase I studies with oral zzso zzso zzso were primarily zzso supporting the exploration of zzso dosing to achieve optimal drug zzso by increasing zzso 

zzso patients with advanced zzso zzso received zzso zzso via 30-minute infusions zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso samples were collected on days 1 and 8 and evaluated using zzso zzso 

zzso levels evaluated were 10, 20, 30, 45, zzso 100, zzso zzso zzso and 500 zzso The maximum administered dose was 500 zzso whereas the maximum tolerated dose was 225 zzso The most common zzso grade 1 to 2 adverse events were zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso vomiting zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most common grade 3 adverse events were hypersensitivity reactions zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso No grade 4 zzso were zzso Ten of the 53 zzso patients had disease stabilization at their first efficacy evaluation visit (including two with minor zzso A zzso to zzso increase in zzso zzso was noted with a zzso increase in zzso compared with oral zzso at equivalent zzso zzso gastrointestinal adverse events were notably less frequent with this zzso zzso 

zzso was safely given zzso up to 225 zzso on a zzso schedule, with evidence of zzso zzso At equivalent doses, the zzso of zzso zzso is zzso that of the oral zzso Treatment with zzso zzso is feasible and may be warranted when increased drug zzso are zzso
