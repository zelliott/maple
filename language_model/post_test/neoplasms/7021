zzso is a zzso trafficking zzso for bulk destruction and turnover of zzso proteins and zzso via regulated zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso occurs zzso at low levels to perform zzso functions, such as the destruction of dysfunctional zzso zzso occurs in the presence of external zzso zzso zzso hormonal imbalance and zzso zzso and internal needs zzso removal of protein zzso suggesting that the process is an important survival zzso However, the occurrence of zzso structures in dying cells of different organisms has led to the hypothesis that zzso may also have a zzso role in zzso cell zzso The identification within the last decade of a full set of genes essential for zzso in zzso the discovery of human zzso and the definition of zzso pathways regulating zzso have accelerated our molecular understanding and interest in this fundamental zzso A growing body of evidence indicates that zzso is associated with heart disease, cancer and a number of neurodegenerative disorders, such as zzso Parkinson's and zzso zzso Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that zzso plays a role in zzso aging and zzso Recently, it has been shown that zzso can be intensified by specific zzso The pharmacological zzso of the zzso zzso represents a major challenge for clinicians to treat human zzso
