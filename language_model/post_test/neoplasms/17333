zzso of this work was to extend zzso zzso theory of the writer for zzso dosing to include the case of zzso zzso dosing over fixed zzso so as to allow projection of adult dose and schedule of typically administered zzso agents to zzso 

The basis for the zzso is the requirement of zzso likeness of the plasma zzso of an agent for adult and zzso zzso expressions are established for describing the time history of the zzso and formulas for dose and dosing zzso are determined so as to ensure the requirement on zzso 

Scaling results for simple drug behavior are illustrated using clinical data for the zzso agent zzso Basic aspects of the theory are confirmed for dose and dosing zzso of adult and 4-year-old zzso The theory is also shown to describe tolerable doses for children when scaled from adult dosing requirements and to have application in determining dosing conditions for children requiring individualized dosing because of zzso zzso Scaling with more complex drug behavior is illustrated using zzso and clinical data for the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso is demonstrated and shown to be consistent with previously reported clinical zzso Additional consideration is given to the zzso agents zzso and zzso as widely used in pediatric chemotherapy, and also to the modern practice of combination zzso 

Basic theory for zzso adult dose and schedule of zzso agents to children is presented and demonstrated to be plausible in providing insight into existing and proposed pediatric treatment zzso
