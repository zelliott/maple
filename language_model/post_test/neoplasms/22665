Respiratory events are common in zzso and zzso patients and manifest as zzso acute respiratory failure zzso in up to half the zzso zzso the cause of zzso is zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso is an invasive test that may cause respiratory zzso Recent zzso diagnostic tests may have modified the zzso ratio of zzso 

To determine whether zzso in cancer patients with zzso increased the need for zzso and whether zzso testing alone was not inferior to zzso testing plus zzso 

We performed a zzso zzso controlled trial with sample size calculations for both end zzso Patients with cancer and zzso of unknown cause who were not receiving zzso support at intensive care unit admission were zzso to early zzso plus zzso tests zzso zzso zzso or zzso tests only zzso zzso zzso The primary end point was the number of patients needing zzso and mechanical zzso The major secondary end point was the number of patients with no identified cause of zzso 

The need for mechanical ventilation was not significantly greater in the zzso group than in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The proportion of patients with no diagnosis was not smaller in the zzso group zzso zzso zzso difference, zzso zzso to zzso 

zzso performed in the intensive care unit did not significantly increase zzso requirements in critically ill cancer patients with zzso zzso testing alone was not inferior to zzso testing plus zzso for identifying the cause of zzso Clinical trial registered with zzso zzso
