zzso is used in patients with advanced zzso zzso zzso or zzso cancer, and its application in other types of zzso is also undergoing extensive clinical zzso zzso is one of the major zzso of this drug, and reported zzso vary substantially between clinical zzso We did a systematic review and zzso of published clinical trials to establish the zzso of hypertension associated with zzso The aim of this study is to gain a better understanding of the overall risk of hypertension in patients with cancer who receive zzso 

zzso including zzso zzso 1966, to July, 2007), and Web of Science, and abstracts presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meetings from 2004 to 2007 were searched to identify relevant zzso zzso studies were prospective clinical trials of patients with cancer assigned zzso zzso at 400 zzso twice daily with data on hypertension zzso zzso and relative risk zzso of hypertension were calculated using a zzso or zzso model, depending on the zzso of the included zzso 

Nine studies published between January, 2006, and July, 2007, which included a total of zzso patients with zzso or other solid zzso were selected from 223 articles screened for zzso For patients assigned zzso the overall zzso of zzso and high-grade zzso grade 3 or 4) hypertension were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso No significant difference was noted between patients with zzso or a zzso zzso (all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso who were assigned zzso zzso was associated with a significantly increased risk of zzso hypertension in patients with cancer with an zzso of zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso 

Patients with cancer assigned zzso have a significant risk of developing zzso zzso monitoring and treatment is strongly recommended to prevent cardiovascular zzso
