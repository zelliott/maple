Here we report the tumor zzso effects of the zzso charged zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso was zzso to zzso zzso zzso forming zzso zzso The loading efficiency of zzso to zzso zzso was greater than zzso The degree of enhancement of cellular zzso of zzso by treatment in zzso zzso increased with the concentration of zzso showing zzso higher zzso than free zzso at 15 zzso zzso imaging revealed the preferential distribution and retention of zzso in zzso tumor zzso after intravenous administration of zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, localized zzso of mice receiving zzso in zzso zzso resulted in the formation of thick zzso over tumor regions, and complete zzso of tumors after zzso zzso In contrast, continuous growth of tumors was observed in the group treated with free zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso improve the therapeutic effects of zzso cancer therapy as compared to free zzso
