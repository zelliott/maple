Since a certain amount of blood is nearly always present in the material obtained through zzso we have considered it helpful to take advantage of this event, in order to increase the information which is drawn from this type of zzso We have evaluated the material obtained by means of ultrasound guided zzso aspiration of zzso zzso of superficial and deep sites, and we have used 1) a zzso method, which employs zzso fixation and zzso embedding of blood zzso zzso the blood acts as a support of cells and tissue zzso and 2) the classic zzso zzso zzso The percentage of diagnostic accuracy was similar using both methods, but the zzso method presented a few advantages, zzso greater diagnostic zzso and long preservation of the residual material, which can subsequently be used for further special zzso These considerations are particularly true for zzso zzso which are more than a half of all zzso
