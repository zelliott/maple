Two hundred and zzso patients were admitted to this prospective zzso study in order to assess the accuracy of a staging system for cancer zzso The staging system zzso was completed by a trained physician during the initial zzso This system included the assessment of pain mechanism zzso zzso versus zzso pain characteristic zzso continuous versus zzso previous zzso dose zzso cognitive function zzso psychological distress zzso tolerance zzso past history of alcohol or drugs zzso During day 21, a final assessment of pain control was zzso zzso for staging was observed in zzso of cases for investigators 1 and 2 zzso zzso P zzso zzso and in zzso of cases between investigators 1 and 3 zzso zzso P zzso zzso Of 276 zzso patients, zzso Stage I zzso zzso patients achieved good PC zzso versus zzso Stage II and III zzso zzso patients zzso P zzso zzso zzso and specificity of the system were found to be zzso and zzso zzso zzso correlation found significant correlation between pain control and all variables except zzso In zzso regression, zzso and zzso showed no significant zzso zzso therefore, propose a more simple SS of five categories zzso PC, zzso zzso and zzso and two stages zzso and poor zzso We conclude that the SS is highly accurate in predicting patients with good zzso but patients with zzso zzso can still achieve good pain control in more than 50% of zzso
