Various new aspects of zzso processing have been uncovered through the study of tumor zzso One of these is the production of zzso peptides by zzso of two distinct zzso zzso In one of the two cases reported, the zzso was found to be responsible for zzso The presentation of another zzso on major zzso complex class I molecules was found to depend on zzso and zzso of the parent zzso zzso a zzso zzso in melanoma zzso Class II presentation of peptides derived from zzso proteins now appears to result from zzso Based on increased knowledge on zzso processing and zzso new vaccination strategies are aimed at improving the targeting of zzso to zzso cells, promoting zzso (for example, using zzso improving zzso binding to class I molecules and targeting zzso to both the class I and the class II zzso
