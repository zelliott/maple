In this theoretical paper, we present the Edmonton zzso zzso zzso a new framework for the study of zzso fatigue, and exhaustion in advanced zzso 

The zzso zzso Model zzso the starting point for the zzso was drawn from a literature review pertaining to fatigue in depression, chronic fatigue syndrome, cancer, shift workers, and athletes published in the zzso Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature zzso Medical Literature Analysis and zzso System Online zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso between 1995 and 2004, and from seven qualitative studies conducted by our zzso The zzso an zzso of the zzso was constructed after an expansion of our literature review to 2006 and team zzso The zzso provides new insights into possible links between behavioral and zzso zzso of zzso fatigue, and exhaustion as they occur in both ill and zzso zzso In this paper, however, we consider only possible links in advanced zzso 

We propose that zzso associated with advanced cancer and its supportive treatment trigger declines in four systems -- cognitive function, sleep quality, nutrition, and muscle endurance -- and that these declines reduce one's ability to zzso While these systems each likely has its own effect on adaptation, we propose that the most important and serious effects arise from interactions among declines in cognitive function, sleep quality, nutrition, and muscle zzso 

zzso for fatigue have been limited by a lack of understanding about its zzso zzso arising from the zzso suggest a new direction for further study that focuses on interactions among cognitive function, sleep quality, nutrition, and muscle zzso
