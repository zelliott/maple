zzso is widely used for chemotherapy in many types of zzso However, vascular pain frequently occurs during its infusion, which can be serious enough to cause treatment zzso This study was conducted to determine whether dissolution with zzso zzso solution would relieve vascular pain compared with the approved use of saline as the zzso 

Patients with cancer who were treated with weekly zzso were zzso zzso pain was assessed during two consecutive administrations in a zzso zzso crossover zzso One group was scheduled to receive zzso dissolved in saline followed by zzso in zzso zzso zzso In the other group, zzso zzso solution was followed by zzso The primary zzso was frequency of vascular pain for the total infusions of each zzso and the secondary zzso were intensity, as assessed on a visual analogue scale and duration of vascular zzso 

zzso patients were randomly assigned to each treatment zzso zzso of vascular pain was significantly lower with zzso zzso solution compared with saline (40 versus zzso zzso The intensity of vascular pain was also reduced with zzso zzso solution compared with saline zzso zzso versus zzso points; zzso There was no significant statistical difference in duration of vascular pain between the zzso zzso solution and saline solution groups zzso 21 versus zzso zzso
