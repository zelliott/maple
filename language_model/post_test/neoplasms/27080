zzso zzso and zzso may protect against several chronic diseases, but there is little evidence on the relationship between zzso and zzso intake and zzso We investigated the association between both zzso and zzso mortality and intake of zzso and zzso in the Spanish European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition zzso zzso 

The zzso study follows zzso participants zzso zzso aged zzso zzso A validated diet history questionnaire was administered at zzso A food composition database was compiled based on US Department of Agriculture and zzso zzso Cox zzso hazards models, adjusted for zzso were used in the zzso 

During a mean follow-up of zzso years, 1915 deaths were reported, with 416 from cardiovascular diseases zzso and 956 from zzso After adjustment for several potential zzso the hazard ratios zzso for the highest versus the lowest zzso of dietary zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Total zzso intake was also associated with a decrease in zzso mortality zzso zzso zzso intake was not associated with zzso zzso In zzso mortality zzso using competing risk zzso doubling total zzso intake was zzso related to mortality from zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso but not to mortality from either cancer zzso for zzso zzso zzso or other causes zzso for zzso zzso zzso 

A diet high in zzso particularly in zzso and zzso is associated with a reduction in zzso zzso mainly of mortality from zzso
