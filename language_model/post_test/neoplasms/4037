Researchers have proposed a broad range of zzso cellular and zzso markers as surrogate zzso for cancer zzso The effect of an intervention on a zzso SEC is zzso with its effect on cancer zzso The zzso of a potential SEC is determined primarily by the extent to which the marker is a necessary event on the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso formation is an example of a reasonably valid SEC because these zzso are zzso precursors of most large zzso zzso However, the existence of a plausible major alternative zzso zzso bypassing the potential zzso zzso from that marker to zzso Moreover, unless the zzso to cancer operates nearly exclusively through the zzso an SEC that is valid for one intervention or exposure may not be valid for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and intervention studies may yield data that are useful in revealing these zzso zzso of intervention zzso SEC and zzso zzso studies of three questions are zzso zzso What is the relation of the SEC to zzso zzso What is the relation of the intervention zzso to the zzso zzso To what extent does the SEC mediate the relation between the intervention zzso and zzso Data on SEC measurement error are important in zzso the extent to which marker results have been attenuated by such zzso It is essential to carry out these studies to evaluate potential zzso (such as zzso cell zzso with plausible major alternative pathways to zzso At the present time, definitive evidence on zzso and prevention will emerge only from studies with cancer zzso or zzso that are, by and large, necessary steps on the zzso zzso to zzso zzso
