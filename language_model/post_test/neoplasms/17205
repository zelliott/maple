zzso zzso of zzso origin, constitute the majority of all zzso Loss of zzso characteristics is an early step in zzso zzso zzso transformation and zzso involve additional loss of zzso control and gain of migratory zzso zzso the relationships among zzso zzso cell zzso and cell migration is therefore fundamental in understanding zzso Interestingly, these cellular events also occur frequently during animal development, but without leading to tumor zzso Can we learn anything about zzso from zzso zzso In this review, we focus on one aspect of zzso zzso the zzso Transition zzso and provide an overview of how the zzso is involved in normal zzso zzso We discuss 12 zzso and zzso processes that clearly involve the zzso We conclude by emphasizing the diversity of zzso processes both in terms of their zzso context and of their cellular zzso We propose that there is comparable diversity in cancer zzso and molecular regulation of cancer zzso
