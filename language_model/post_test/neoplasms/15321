It is well known that T zzso can mediate significant zzso zzso A limiting factor has always been the ability to expand T cells, whether from the peripheral blood, zzso or zzso The recent availability of zzso zzso zzso has demonstrated the feasibility of expanding T cells and the clinical efficacy of these cells as zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso researchers discovered that zzso killer zzso blood cells functionally distinct from T zzso be zzso expanded, and zzso in patients, with significant clinical zzso For many years, the zzso zzso have been recognized in tumor zzso and known to be zzso zzso Major limiting factors were the ability to culture large numbers of these zzso cells and the limited understanding of the tumor zzso involved for zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso appears to provide the ongoing zzso stimulation needed to maintain selective killing of tumor zzso By defining various factors in the medium that support and enhance zzso growth and zzso the components are becoming available to develop a broad attack on advanced cancer by using this zzso technology of stimulation and expansion of zzso activated zzso
