Over the period zzso 175 zzso zzso from zzso Malawi African females were sent to London for zzso zzso The most common type of primary tumor was benign zzso zzso zzso Only 2 cases of zzso zzso were zzso Overall, zzso zzso tumors formed 37% of the primary zzso tumors, germ cell tumors zzso and sex zzso tumors zzso These results are consonant with data from other studies in sub-Saharan zzso germ cell tumors and sex zzso tumors are seen more frequently in Africa than in developed countries, and conversely, zzso tumors are less zzso Several reasons for this pattern are zzso The predominance in Malawi of zzso probably follows from the fact that 1/2 the population is aged 15 or zzso Since zzso zzso rates increase with age, and old women in Africa form a smaller proportion of the population, fewer zzso tumors may be zzso Also, studies have demonstrated an inverse relationship between marital zzso and rates of zzso zzso thus populations with large families as found in Africa should suffer fewer zzso zzso It appears that the relatively high ratio of zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumors in Africa zzso may be due to a genuinely different pattern of zzso tumor pathology in the zzso though no cause is readily zzso Further detailed study of zzso tumors with the aim of exploring particularly the differences in zzso patterns and their possible associations will provide valuable information on the zzso of tumors in this zzso
