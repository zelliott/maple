Insufficient blood supply of rapidly growing tumors leads to the presence of zzso a well-known feature in solid zzso zzso is known to decrease the efficiency of currently used zzso zzso like surgery, chemotherapy and zzso zzso zzso seems to be a major limitation in current zzso zzso The use of zzso zzso to deliver toxic agents to the tumor cells takes advantage of this unique zzso These strictly zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso after systemic administration, a selective colonization of zzso areas within the zzso Moreover, they can be genetically modified to zzso therapeutic proteins like zzso zzso or tumor necrosis zzso The specificity of this protein delivery system can be further increased when expression is controlled by the use of a zzso promoter, leading to increased spatial and zzso regulation of protein zzso This approach of bacterial zzso systems to target protein expression to the tumor can be considered very safe since bacteria can be eliminated at any moment by the addition of proper zzso The zzso delivery system thus presents an alternative therapeutic zzso to deliver zzso agents specifically to the tumor zzso This high selectivity offers a major advantage in comparison with the classical gene therapy zzso
