To improve the efficacy of zzso therapy of cancer using zzso we developed a novel zzso zzso designated zzso and investigated its zzso characteristics and zzso on tumor zzso zzso exhibited a minimum fluorescent zzso by zzso with light, compared with a strong zzso from zzso which is known to reveal both zzso and zzso According to this zzso when human tumor cells were exposed to light in the presence of zzso in zzso the least zzso was observed, in contrast to the strong zzso of zzso However, zzso exhibited a potent zzso on tumor cells by zzso with ultrasound in zzso This zzso was reduced by the addition of zzso but not zzso thus suggesting that zzso oxygen may be responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated significant zzso against a variety of cancer cell lines derived from different zzso In addition, in a mouse zzso model, a potent growth zzso of the tumor was observed using zzso after the administration of zzso to the zzso These results suggest that zzso therapy with zzso may therefore be a useful clinical treatment for zzso located deep in the human body without inducing skin sensitivity, which tends to be a major zzso of zzso
