Our purpose was to determine the outcome of patients in whom the results of zzso zzso were indeterminate and to examine factors that may affect zzso 

During a zzso period, 619 consecutive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 268 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were performed on abdominal zzso Of these zzso findings from zzso zzso zzso were positive for zzso findings from 21 zzso zzso yielded a benign diagnosis, and findings from 15 zzso zzso were zzso zzso from the remaining 129 zzso zzso were considered indeterminate because the zzso diagnosis revealed benign zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso The frequency of zzso in zzso of patients in this indeterminate group was zzso 

zzso of the 129 patients were lost to zzso Of the remaining 91 patients, 55 zzso had zzso zzso results, and 36 zzso had zzso zzso zzso A history of zzso had no significant effect on the zzso or zzso rate zzso zzso zzso However, the guidance technique had a statistically significant effect: CT and zzso guidance yielded 25 zzso and 11 zzso zzso results, respectively zzso zzso zzso The number of needle passes, needle type and zzso and biopsy site did not have a statistically significant correlation with the zzso zzso The presence of zzso cells in the zzso zzso was highly zzso with a zzso zzso rate zzso zzso zzso 

We found a high zzso of zzso zzso in zzso deemed indeterminate at the time of zzso Thus, close follow-up or additional intervention should be pursued in such zzso zzso guidance resulted in a statistically significant decrease in the zzso rate when compared with CT zzso however, a history of zzso the biopsy site, the needle gauge and type, and the number of passes did not have a significant effect on the zzso zzso
