Our analyses in several different tumor settings challenge the prevailing view that zzso and zzso generally initiate as avascular masses that only belatedly induce vascular zzso Instead, we find that zzso cells rapidly co-opt existing host vessels to form an initially zzso tumor zzso Paradoxically, the zzso zzso does not undergo zzso to support the growing zzso but instead zzso (perhaps as part of a normal host defense zzso via a process that involves disruption of zzso zzso muscle cell interactions and zzso cell zzso This vessel zzso in turn results in necrosis within the central part of the zzso However, robust zzso is initiated at the tumor margin, rescuing the surviving tumor and supporting further zzso The expression patterns of zzso (the natural zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso growth factor zzso strongly zzso these factors in the above zzso zzso is highly induced in zzso vessels, prior to zzso induction in the adjacent tumor cells, providing perhaps the earliest marker of tumor zzso and apparently marking the zzso vessels for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso expression at the tumor periphery is associated with robust zzso Thus, in tumors, zzso and zzso seem to reprise the roles they play during vascular zzso in normal zzso acting to regulate the previously underappreciated balance between vascular zzso and zzso
