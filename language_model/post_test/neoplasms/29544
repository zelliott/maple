The purpose of this study is to demonstrate the zzso controlled, zzso release of low- and zzso weight zzso through zzso zzso by exploiting the zzso interactions presented by zzso 

Silicon zzso were produced with zzso of 5, 13 and 20 zzso using standardized industrial zzso zzso The study of the diffusion zzso of zzso zzso and zzso was performed by employing zzso diffusion zzso The released amount in the sink zzso was monitored by zzso zzso 

Continuous zzso release was demonstrated for zzso zzso and zzso at release rates of 20 and 100 zzso zzso The release rates exhibited by these zzso were verified to be in ranges suitable for human therapeutic zzso 

Our zzso potentially represent a viable zzso approach for the controlled administration of zzso intended to improve the therapeutic efficacy of treatment and reduce many of the side effects associated with conventional drug zzso
