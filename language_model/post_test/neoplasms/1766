Failure of zzso is one of the hallmarks of zzso As an zzso zzso zzso plays a crucial role during zzso To explore the possibility that the genetic zzso of zzso which encodes zzso might be involved in the development of human tumors, we analyzed the entire coding region and all zzso sites of human zzso gene for the detection of zzso zzso in a series of zzso human tumors, including 165 stomach zzso 95 colon zzso 76 breast zzso 80 zzso zzso 181 zzso cell lung zzso 45 acute zzso 28 multiple zzso 12 zzso 15 zzso tumors, 12 zzso cell zzso 40 esophagus zzso 33 urinary zzso zzso 33 zzso zzso and 129 zzso zzso Overall, we detected 14 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso including six zzso and four silent zzso two zzso in the zzso one zzso in the zzso region, and one zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso were observed in four of 98 colon zzso zzso four of 181 zzso cell lung zzso zzso two of 129 zzso zzso zzso two of 165 stomach zzso zzso one of 80 zzso zzso zzso and one of 28 multiple zzso zzso This is the first report on zzso gene zzso in human zzso these data indicate that the zzso gene is occasionally zzso in human zzso
