A system for the zzso measurement and analysis of the periodic zzso organ motion during zzso treatment is proposed and clinically tested in this zzso 

The procedure is based on the acquisition of zzso zzso followed by an automatic detection of the movement using zzso with matched zzso 

The system generates a probability density function zzso of finding a mobile organ in a position at a certain zzso The maximum path of the mobile structures can be determined to define the planning target volume zzso without zzso 

zzso movements can be accurately included in the daily planning routine, which is not essentially zzso without needing previous patient zzso
