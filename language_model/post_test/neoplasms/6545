The zzso activity of two zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso was tested in a human tumor zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso suppressed the colony formation of various human tumors with a slight dose response relation after 1 zzso incubation and with a clear optimum zzso response zzso after continuous exposure in the higher dose range tested (10 zzso zzso did not have substantial activity after 1 zzso of zzso However, when continuous exposure to the compound was used, zzso seemed to have a modest dose response effect and yielded a response in about zzso of the tumor cell samples tested in the higher dose range (10 zzso Thus, both compounds have in zzso zzso activity in the zzso within a dose range of zzso zzso especially during continuous zzso The tumor specific type activity was found in breast cancer, zzso cancer, lung cancer and zzso Both compounds caused decreases in colony formation down to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso In a comparison of specimens in which both compounds were used, only one of five times showed a zzso in sensitivity or zzso therefore the compounds appear similar in their in zzso zzso In a second set of experiments we tested the zzso relationship among a variety of zzso in the zzso incorporation zzso after incubation with zzso zzso blasts and other zzso cells from human zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
