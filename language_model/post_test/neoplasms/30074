zzso zzso function is essential for responsiveness to cancer zzso However, zzso activity is attenuated by the zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso To zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso and zzso negative regulation, we generated a zzso zzso zzso by deleting the zzso and zzso regions of zzso zzso and inserting the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso showed greater zzso than zzso expressing zzso zzso or other zzso zzso in human cancer cell zzso We found that zzso induced zzso through zzso of zzso regardless of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso showed a greater zzso effect and increased survival rates of mice with zzso brain cancer zzso that expressed zzso zzso and high zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study reporting a zzso zzso modified at the N zzso and C zzso that shows resistance to degradation by zzso and zzso zzso as well as negative regulation by the zzso C zzso without decreased zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso shows potential for improving zzso cancer gene zzso
