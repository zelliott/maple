It has been suggested that a decrease in the availability of oxygen to certain zzso may lead to increased metabolism of zzso through the zzso zzso shunt zzso and to increased synthesis of zzso in particular zzso It is further suggested that these zzso zzso result in stimulation of the zzso cycle by increasing zzso availability zzso zzso zzso and zzso A relative decrease in local oxygen availability may therefore play a role in cell proliferation and differentiation and in the zzso of cancer, diabetic zzso and zzso
