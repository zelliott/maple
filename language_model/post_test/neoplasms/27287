zzso A zzso zzso is one of the most common primary zzso zzso Although its clinical course is usually benign, some patients develop zzso zzso failure zzso The role of zzso drugs in the treatment of zzso remains zzso The effect of treatment with zzso and zzso and the clinical and zzso parameters related to a poor outcome are examined zzso in this zzso 

zzso patients with zzso and a follow-up period of 10 years were included in this zzso zzso were treated with zzso zzso 60 zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso in gradually reduced doses for 24 zzso 9 months, whereas 33 patients received no zzso zzso The clinical course was estimated using the zzso of doubling of baseline serum zzso and/or zzso The contribution of clinical and zzso parameters in the clinical outcome was estimated by zzso and zzso zzso 

The overall clinical courses of both groups of patients showed a rather similar zzso zzso of serum baseline zzso was observed in 9 of 41 treated zzso and in 10 of 33 zzso zzso whereas zzso developed in 6 treated zzso and 6 zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso However, treated patients with heavy zzso zzso zzso zzso had a significantly better outcome compared to zzso zzso of serum zzso in 29 zzso zzso and zzso in 17 zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mean blood pressure zzso zzso zzso baseline serum zzso zzso zzso zzso and severity of zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso were identified as independent risk factors related to a poor outcome by zzso zzso Side effects of treatment were not uncommon and observed in 10 zzso zzso 

Treatment with zzso and zzso is beneficial in zzso the clinical course of a subset of zzso patients with heavy zzso or impaired zzso zzso Patients with advanced zzso failure and severe chronic zzso zzso should not be treated by this regimen as no benefit is expected and there is a risk of side zzso
