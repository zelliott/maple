The purpose of this review is to zzso the most important human clinical trials of antioxidants as cancer prevention agents conducted to date, provide an overview of currently ongoing studies, and discuss future steps needed to advance research in this zzso To date there have been several large (at least zzso zzso trials testing the efficacy of zzso supplements in preventing zzso The specific agents zzso direct antioxidants and essential components of zzso zzso tested in those trials included zzso vitamin zzso vitamin C, zzso retinol, zzso zzso and zzso None of the completed trials produced convincing evidence to justify the use of traditional zzso vitamins or minerals for cancer zzso Our search of ongoing trials identified six projects at various stages of zzso Five of those six trials use zzso as the intervention of interest delivered either alone or in combination with other zzso The lack of success to date can be explained by a variety of factors that need to be considered in the next generation zzso These factors include lack of good biological rationale for selecting specific agents of interest; limited number of agents tested to date; use of zzso rather than zzso zzso and insufficient duration of intervention and zzso The latter consideration underscores the need for alternative zzso that are associated with increased risk of zzso zzso zzso of zzso but are zzso prior to tumor zzso Although dietary antioxidants are a large and diverse group of compounds, only a small proportion of candidate agents have been zzso In zzso the strategy of focusing on large zzso studies using cancer zzso as the zzso and testing a relatively limited number of zzso agents has been largely zzso This lack of success in previous trials should not zzso us from seeking novel ways of preventing cancer by modulating zzso zzso On the contrary, the well demonstrated zzso link between excessive zzso stress and zzso underscores the need for new zzso It appears that future large-scale projects should be preceded by smaller, zzso less expensive zzso studies that can serve as a link from zzso and zzso research to human cancer prevention zzso These relatively inexpensive studies would provide human experimental evidence for the likely zzso optimum dose, and long-term safety of the intervention of interest that would then guide the design of safe, more definitive large-scale zzso
