This is a long-term follow-up clinical study of adolescents and adults, survivors of childhood zzso We evaluate and analyze the late zzso zzso of childhood cancer zzso Many such studies are susceptible to a strong selection bias, zzso they employ a limited zzso sample of patients, based on a clinical hospital that provided the cancer treatment or performed the zzso To address the issue of selection bias, we perform here an analysis of late zzso on a systematic database of the entire population of the children treated for cancer in zzso Due to the specifics of cancer treatment procedures in Slovenia, they have all been treated and zzso in the same zzso 

The data are based on the zzso registry of cancer patients in Slovenia and present a controlled and homogeneous zzso Late zzso are evaluated following a modified zzso zzso the National Cancer Institute's Common zzso zzso for zzso Events version zzso We use survival analysis method to estimate the zzso of and risk for late zzso where the time variable is measured in years from the diagnosis date, while we follow the event of zzso of late zzso scored other than zzso Survival analysis is performed using Kaplan zzso zzso and Cox zzso zzso 

The zzso of mild, moderate, or severe late zzso of childhood cancer treatment significantly decreased from zzso in the group of patients diagnosed before 1975 to zzso for those diagnosed after zzso The Cox zzso analysis of the risk factors for the zzso of late zzso identifies three significant factors: treatment zzso age at diagnosis, and primary zzso 

The change of treatment zzso in terms of replacement of surgery and zzso with chemotherapy is the main reason for the decrease of the zzso and the risk for late zzso of childhood cancer zzso treatment zzso including surgery significantly increase the risk ratio of late zzso while those based on chemotherapy only significantly decreases the zzso zzso of late zzso increases with the diagnosis age: younger children are more susceptible to late effects of zzso Finally, primary diagnosis significantly influences the risk for late zzso but mostly due to the dependency of the treatment zzso on the primary zzso
