The cell surface is covered by a dense layer of zzso and zzso zzso Although it has been known that distinct zzso structures are associated with cancer, the whole spectrum of zzso zzso has remained zzso In the present study, we analyzed the zzso cancer zzso by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso profiling of cancer patient tissue zzso In lung cancer, we detected zzso of a novel group of zzso zzso These zzso zzso carried abnormal zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso A similar phenomenon was also detected in structural analyses of zzso zzso This showed that zzso zzso may dramatically change in cancer and that direct zzso analysis can detect the resulting marker zzso Based on the structural knowledge, we further devised a zzso labeling technique for the detection of zzso tumors with a specific zzso zzso In normal zzso terminal zzso zzso are capped by zzso zzso to common zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the newly discovered zzso zzso result from incomplete zzso In conclusion, the identified terminal zzso zzso should be recognized as a novel class of tumor zzso
