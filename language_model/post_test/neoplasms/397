To characterize the long-term effects of zzso zzso zzso on left zzso function, a total of 588 zzso were obtained zzso in 46 children who were treated for zzso We found zzso fraction of the left zzso to be more useful than zzso time intervals for detecting cardiotoxic zzso zzso cardiac function occurred in zzso of patients but only zzso developed zzso heart failure which was zzso There appeared to be strong individual variation in response to the effects of zzso on the heart unrelated to treatment regimen, age of onset of treatment, or total cumulative zzso If the zzso remained normal it was possible to give a dose greater than 550 zzso If cardiac dysfunction occurred following zzso of zzso it did so within five months in zzso of zzso zzso zzso therapy in patients with zzso zzso than zzso who did not have clinical signs of zzso heart failure resulted in improved zzso fraction and administration of zzso did not further improve the zzso zzso zzso evaluation of cardiac function at frequent intervals has proven to be useful during and following treatment with zzso
