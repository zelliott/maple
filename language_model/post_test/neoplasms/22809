zzso is a member of a novel family of cell surface zzso Initially, the expression of zzso zzso was seen only in the zzso derived zzso stem zzso At present, zzso expression is demonstrated in zzso zzso different types of tumors and zzso zzso zzso zzso cells isolated from brain are able to differentiate into both zzso and zzso zzso These data suggested that zzso could be a specific marker for various stem and zzso cell zzso 

The main goal would be to describe the role for zzso as a marker of stem cells able to zzso and zzso to form functional zzso adult lineages and contribute to disease zzso via tissue zzso 

In conclusion, since the rise of zzso zzso as a suitable stem cell marker, the possible use of zzso stem cells in therapeutic applications has opened a new promising field in the treatment of zzso zzso The human circulating cells expressing the zzso zzso behave as a stem cell population capable of commitment to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell therapy may represent a promising treatment for many zzso
