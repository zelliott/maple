zzso is a zzso protein made up of two zzso zzso and zzso It was originally identified as an zzso recognized by the zzso of patients with zzso zzso It is a highly versatile regulatory protein that has been implicated in multiple nuclear zzso zzso DNA repair, zzso maintenance and zzso zzso zzso is thought to play a crucial role in maintenance of zzso integrity and cell zzso Recent reports suggest that there is a positive relationship between zzso and the development of cancer, making zzso an important candidate target for zzso drug zzso Specifically, prior studies suggest that a delicate balance exists in zzso zzso as zzso of zzso proteins promotes zzso zzso including zzso and resistance to zzso whereas deficient or low expression of zzso leads to zzso instability and zzso Such observations through various experimental models indicate that zzso may act as either a tumor zzso or an zzso zzso understanding the link between the various functions of zzso and the development of cancer in different cell systems may help in the development of novel zzso therapeutic agents that target zzso These studies may also increase our understanding of how zzso zzso are generated in zzso zzso
