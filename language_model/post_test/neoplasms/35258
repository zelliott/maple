Much progress has been made in understanding the complex zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso it is clear that zzso is zzso to multiple zzso either locally or into systemic zzso Many of these zzso are thought to have zzso zzso In addition, efforts to develop zzso based zzso zzso models have led to a better quantitative assessment of the zzso of zzso and several of its zzso As part of a zzso on key issues in the health risk assessment of zzso this article is a review of a number of the current scientific issues in zzso zzso and recent zzso modeling efforts with a focus on literature published since zzso zzso attention is paid to factors affecting zzso modeling for application to risk zzso Recent zzso zzso modeling efforts, coupled with zzso advances in characterizing uncertainty and zzso suggest that rigorous application of zzso modeling to zzso risk assessment appears feasible at least for zzso and its major zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso However, a number of basic structural hypotheses such as zzso zzso plasma zzso and zzso or zzso treatment of tissue distribution require additional evaluation and zzso Moreover, there are a number of zzso of potential zzso interest, such as zzso zzso acid, and those derived from zzso zzso for which reliable zzso data is sparse because of zzso difficulties or low zzso in systemic zzso It will be a challenge to develop reliable zzso for such zzso
