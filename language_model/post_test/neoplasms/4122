zzso zzso A type I plays a key role in zzso zzso conveying zzso signals of different growth factors and zzso zzso of protein zzso A type I by zzso zzso targeting its zzso regulatory zzso results in cancer cell growth zzso in zzso and in zzso A novel mixed backbone zzso zzso 190 and its mismatched control zzso 239 were tested on soft zzso growth of several human cancer cell zzso zzso 190 demonstrated a zzso zzso of colony formation in all cell lines whereas the zzso 239 at the same doses caused a modest or no growth zzso A zzso dose of each mixed backbone zzso was used in zzso zzso and zzso colon cancer cells to study whether any cooperative effect may occur between the zzso and a series of zzso drugs acting by different zzso Treatment with zzso 190 resulted in an additive growth zzso effect with several zzso drugs when measured by soft zzso colony zzso A synergistic growth zzso which correlated with increased zzso was observed when zzso 190 was added to cancer cells treated with zzso zzso compounds, and zzso II selective zzso This synergistic effect was also observed in breast cancer cells and was obtained with other related drugs such as zzso and zzso Combination of zzso 190 and zzso resulted in an zzso of cells in late zzso zzso of cell cycle and marked induction of zzso A cooperative effect of zzso 190 and zzso was also obtained in zzso in nude mice bearing human zzso colon cancer zzso These results are the first report of a cooperative growth zzso effect obtained in a variety of human cancer cell lines by zzso mixed backbone zzso targeting protein zzso A type zzso zzso signals and specific zzso zzso
