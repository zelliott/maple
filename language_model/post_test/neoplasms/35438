zzso continuously encounter DNA damage caused either by damaging agents, including oxygen zzso and DNA replication errors caused by stalled replication zzso or by zzso environments such as ultraviolet or zzso zzso Such DNA damage poses a great threat to zzso stability, potentially leading to loss or amplification of zzso activity, which may result in cellular zzso cancer or zzso The DNA damage checkpoints coordinate an arrest in cell cycle progression with the DNA repair process, suppressing either zzso catastrophe or proliferation of cells with damaged zzso Numerous key players have been identified in terms of damage sensor zzso zzso zzso and zzso but their coordination and zzso in damage control have only recently become zzso In this review, we discuss changes in zzso structure, recruitment of zzso proteins and zzso of zzso zzso in response to DNA zzso These cellular responses are important for determining the potential effects of current cancer therapies in terms of toxicity and zzso
