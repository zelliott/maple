To explore the zzso approach to the zzso of the zzso chest tumors, and to evaluate its advantages of operative safety and zzso 

We conducted a retrospective review of the records of 27 patients undergoing zzso of the primary zzso chest tumors from January 1995 to January zzso zzso type included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Data collected included clinical zzso tumor type and involvement, type of zzso complication, and zzso 

A clinical operation for zzso zzso of tumors and invaded structures was performed on six patients by means of a successful anterior zzso Among other 21 patients on whom a clinical operation was performed by zzso approach, only 13 patients obtained zzso zzso There were significant difference between the two groups zzso zzso zzso The mean duration for follow-up was 29 months, and the overall median survival was 21 zzso Median survival in patients undergoing zzso zzso was 29 months, and this is significantly better than in incomplete zzso group zzso zzso zzso 

The anterior zzso approach is a successful technique for the exposure and zzso of these tumors and invaded zzso zzso of symptoms and long-term survival is acceptable if complete zzso can be zzso
