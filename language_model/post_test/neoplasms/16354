zzso replicating zzso zzso represent a promising new platform for the treatment of zzso zzso have been demonstrated to kill tumor cells when other therapies fail, indicating that their zzso properties are complementary to, and distinct from, those of standard treatments such as chemotherapy and zzso In clinic trials zzso have shown encouraging results, demonstrating mild side effects when administered at high doses and via different routes, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso replication has been zzso although as a single agent the efficacy appears to be zzso Interestingly, combined treatment with radiation or chemotherapy has been found to enhance zzso efficacy zzso To date, the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso and the way in which chemotherapy enhances zzso are not well zzso A fuller knowledge of these processes will open up new strategies to improve the zzso potential of zzso Here, we discuss several possibilities that may lead to zzso with enhanced zzso zzso These approaches include strategies to functionally couple tumor targeting and optimal zzso activity, and ways to further increase tumor cell disruption at later stages of infection to facilitate the spreading of virus throughout the tumor zzso In addition, improved methods to evaluate the efficacy of these agents in animal models, and in the clinic, will be required to systematically test and zzso zzso zzso also taking into account the influence of tumor characteristics and the administration zzso
