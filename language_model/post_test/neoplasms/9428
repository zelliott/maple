The aim of this preliminary study was to explore the possibility of using higher doses of zzso zzso zzso than those commonly used and available as manufactured patches, which are based on the assumption that zzso may have a ceiling effect that has never been determined zzso 

Ten patients who were already receiving zzso zzso zzso which is about zzso zzso and were no longer responsive to this dosage were administered higher doses up to a maximum of 140 zzso within 6 days, when the study was zzso 

In six patients, dose increments of zzso were effective, and patients achieved adequate analgesia within 6 zzso Four patients discontinued the treatment due to zzso of zzso 140 zzso and were switched to other zzso until achieving stabilization zzso 320 and 400 zzso zzso 120 zzso zzso zzso 200 zzso This group of patients required higher doses than those chosen for zzso underlying the need to escalate the dose zzso a zzso not accomplished with zzso zzso zzso effects did not change and were similar to those observed before increasing the dose of zzso On the basis of these preliminary data, patients requiring doses higher than 70 zzso of zzso in the range of zzso zzso may still have an zzso benefit without important consequences in terms of adverse zzso It cannot be excluded that even higher doses may be effective, as some patients required rapid zzso with higher zzso equivalent doses, and according to the zzso other zzso were provided to facilitate this zzso Further studies should clarify the role and the benefit of zzso in specific clinical zzso
