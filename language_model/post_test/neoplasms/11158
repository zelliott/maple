Several zzso drugs targeting zzso zzso zzso that were approved by the Food and Drug Administration for many cancer types, including zzso and lung cancer, can effectively reduce tumor zzso However, targeting the zzso signaling zzso will probably influence the normal function of zzso cells in maintaining zzso and can cause unwanted adverse zzso Indeed, emerging experimental evidence suggests that zzso therapy induced less tumor zzso zzso allowing residual cells to become more resistant and eventually develop a more zzso zzso We report an zzso therapeutic zzso fusion protein developed by linking zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Specifically, zzso possesses tumor zzso activity that targets tumor zzso cells, followed by CD, which converts the nontoxic zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso drug zzso zzso in the local tumor zzso Moreover, selective targeting of tumor sites allows an increasing local zzso concentration of zzso thus providing high levels of zzso zzso We showed that treatment with zzso plus zzso compared with zzso plus zzso treatment, significantly increased the zzso concentration around tumor sites and suppressed tumor growth and zzso in human breast and zzso zzso animal zzso In addition, in contrast to treatment with zzso zzso did not induce zzso leading to heart failure in mice after long-term zzso Our results showed that, compared with currently used zzso drugs, zzso possesses potent zzso activity with virtually no toxic effects and does not increase tumor invasion or zzso Together, these findings suggest that zzso could become an alternative option for future zzso zzso
