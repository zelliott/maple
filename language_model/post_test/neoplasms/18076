To monitor the occurrence of cancer in a recently defined cohort of UK rubber zzso 

A cohort of zzso male and female workers from 41 UK rubber factories has been zzso All employees had a minimum of 12 months employment and were first employed at one of the participating factories in the period zzso zzso and cancer zzso data for the period zzso were compared with expected values based on appropriate national zzso 

zzso from lung cancer was close to expectation for males zzso 22, standardized mortality ratio zzso zzso and females zzso 2, zzso zzso zzso from stomach cancer was also zzso in males zzso 4, zzso zzso and females zzso 0, zzso zzso Although based on small numbers, significantly elevated mortality was shown for multiple myeloma in males zzso 5, zzso zzso and females zzso 2, zzso zzso All seven of these latter deaths occurred in workers from the general rubber goods zzso zzso 

The findings should be treated with caution as they relate to a relatively early period of zzso Nevertheless, they hold out the prospect that the elevated zzso for stomach and lung zzso reported for historical zzso of UK rubber workers will not be present in more recent zzso The elevated occurrence of multiple myeloma may represent no more than a chance zzso zzso these findings may reflect the presence of an zzso occupational cancer hazard in parts of the zzso sector of the UK rubber zzso
