zzso zzso to 550 zzso zzso every 3 weeks) was administered as a zzso or zzso intravenous zzso infusion for 5 consecutive days to patients with solid zzso 

On a zzso dosing schedule, zzso zzso zzso and a motor zzso were the principal zzso of zzso These zzso effects were zzso and evolved from complaints of zzso and zzso to more pronounced signs and symptoms of zzso zzso Up to and including doses of 415 zzso these effects were well tolerated and resolved within 2 hours zzso In contrast, both patients treated at the zzso dose level experienced a zzso constellation of zzso zzso and zzso with either zzso of over 2 zzso duration or zzso zzso zzso of the infusion duration to 3 hours at this dose level resulted in less zzso however, delayed zzso zzso toxicity precluded timely administration on this zzso A statistically significant relationship was demonstrated between the development of zzso and maximum plasma zzso of zzso 

zzso was the zzso toxicity zzso of zzso administered as a zzso infusion daily for 5 days every 3 weeks, and the recommended dose for further evaluations was 415 zzso The nature of the principal zzso and the lack of any zzso zzso activity indicate that phase II evaluations of zzso on this administration schedule should be focused on specific disease settings, such as breast cancer and zzso tumors, in which zzso activity has been zzso
