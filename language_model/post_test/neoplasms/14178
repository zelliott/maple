zzso evidence implicates the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso immune escape, as it drains regulatory molecules and zzso from the tumor zzso We asked whether targeted delivery of zzso to the zzso presumably already bathed in tumor zzso could promote zzso immunity and hinder tumor zzso To this end, we used 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso that effectively target zzso cells zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso after zzso zzso These zzso accumulated within the zzso when administered in the limb zzso zzso to the tumor or in the zzso when administered in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso or zzso into the zzso zzso and zzso induced DC maturation in zzso When administered daily zzso and thus targeting the zzso of a zzso melanoma, zzso zzso induced DC maturation within the zzso and reshaped the zzso T cell distribution within the tumor towards a zzso zzso zzso zzso this also led to an increase in the frequency of zzso zzso T cells within the zzso This correlated with slowed tumor growth, in contrast to zzso tumor growth after zzso delivery of zzso zzso zzso a zzso or zzso delivery of free zzso zzso treatment in the zzso limb also was associated with an increase in zzso T cell ratios and zzso of activated zzso zzso T cells within the zzso whereas zzso treatment reduced the frequency of regulatory T zzso zzso cells in the zzso Together, these data zzso the zzso as a delivery target for zzso therapy of solid zzso
