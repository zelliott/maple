The objective of this study was to determine the influence of zzso and zzso fluid on the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Four patients with zzso proof of zzso solid tumor received zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso on several occasions in both the presence and absence of third space zzso zzso plasma and zzso or zzso fluid samples were collected during each dosing and analyzed by zzso liquid zzso for both the intact zzso form of zzso and its zzso zzso zzso The apparent zzso clearance demonstrated substantial zzso zzso but remained unchanged within the same patient in the presence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of eight zzso or absence of zzso and zzso fluid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of seven zzso Similarly, terminal zzso and area under the zzso curve ratios of zzso drug in plasma were similar between courses within each zzso zzso penetration into zzso and zzso fluid demonstrated a mean lag time of zzso h zzso zzso zzso and ratios with plasma concentration increased with time after dosing in all zzso The mean ratio of third space zzso total drug area under the zzso curve to that in plasma was zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso can be safely administered to patients with zzso zzso or zzso and that there is substantial penetration of zzso into these third spaces, which may prove beneficial for local zzso zzso
