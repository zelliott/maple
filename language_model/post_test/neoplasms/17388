In general, parental cancer was not associated with schizophrenia in the offspring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found no zzso associations with maternal cancer in general; neither around the pregnancy zzso However, maternal zzso lung cancer increased the risk of zzso schizophrenia and maternal zzso lung cancer diagnosed within 20 years after childbirth increased the risk of zzso zzso cancer was not associated with child psychiatric disorders zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso except for the smoking related zzso There was a significantly increased risk of child psychiatric disorders in offspring of both mothers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and fathers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with lung cancer of all zzso 

In general, parental cancer did not increase the risk of schizophrenia nor of child psychiatric zzso However, maternal zzso lung cancer increased the risk of schizophrenia in zzso and lung cancer in general increased the risk of child psychiatric disorders, which could be due to risk factors associated with parental zzso
