This study was performed to determine if the zzso and zzso capacity of peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso was altered in cancer patients treated with total body zzso zzso zzso of either zzso or zzso C was induced and maintained for periods up to 6 hours by zzso circulation of the patient's blood through a very sensitive temperature regulating device via a shunt in the patient's zzso In zzso studies performed at 37 C showed that the zzso capacity of the zzso from cancer patients was initially generally lower than values obtained from control individuals, but most of the patients' zzso exhibited an increased zzso capacity following zzso zzso was not diminished by multiple zzso zzso Similar studies performed in zzso at 42 C showed that the zzso capacity of zzso from both control individuals and cancer patients was significantly less than those obtained at 37 zzso These data indicate that the zzso capacity of peripheral blood zzso may be zzso increased after zzso but during the period of elevated temperature, the zzso process may be zzso
