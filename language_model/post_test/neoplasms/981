The zzso and mechanism of action of a series of zzso zzso is evaluated using zzso I and cancer cell growth zzso zzso In previous work, compounds of this type were shown to zzso inhibit zzso II, leading to a zzso phase arrest of the cell cycle and zzso in pancreatic cancer cells in zzso and in zzso The present study expands the potential utility of these compounds in the development of cancer zzso by showing that these compounds inhibit proliferation of cell lines derived from the nine most common human zzso Further results show that at least one of the compounds effectively zzso zzso zzso zzso formation in intact zzso zzso interference experiments, however, indicate that this interaction does not contribute to the drug-induced killing of cancer cells indicating the compounds may be zzso poisons of zzso zzso
