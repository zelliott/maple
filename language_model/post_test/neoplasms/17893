The zzso factors zzso alpha and zzso alpha are structurally similar as regards their zzso and zzso zzso but differ in their zzso zzso and, as is shown by experiments using zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice, in their zzso This implies that zzso alpha and zzso alpha may have unique target zzso To address this zzso and identify zzso zzso target zzso we performed zzso zzso analysis and identified the tumor zzso zzso as a novel target gene product involved in zzso alpha zzso The zzso gene was first identified from a screen in which the mouse zzso tumor virus was employed as an zzso zzso to identify genes whose functions are critical for breast tumor zzso Here, by using zzso analysis, zzso in zzso cells, and zzso zzso we report the specific interaction of zzso alpha (but not zzso alpha or zzso zzso with zzso The results indicate that the direct interaction of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso This degradation was clearly observed in zzso cell zzso zzso cells, and was found to be both zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso protein zzso by zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso C increased zzso zzso alpha zzso even under zzso and induced sets of critical zzso factors zzso vascular zzso growth factor, zzso and basic zzso growth factor zzso These results indicate that zzso is a novel and critical zzso of zzso zzso zzso as well as cancer formation, and that zzso transfer may be an effective therapeutic strategy in pathological conditions such as heart and brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso vessel zzso
