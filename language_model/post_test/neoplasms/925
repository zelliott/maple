We reviewed correlations among zzso zzso aging and zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso occurred with aging in all human zzso except for brain and zzso We investigated the zzso lengths of individual cell types in human zzso using a zzso method and an original software package, zzso zzso zzso revealed that in zzso zzso zzso corresponding to zzso length was significantly highest in zzso cells and lowest in prickle cells, and that zzso length zzso at a certain rate in each cell type except for zzso Mean zzso length was significantly less in background tissue zzso zzso of patients with cancer than in normal controls without zzso We demonstrated zzso zzso and zzso instability in the background and normal control with excessively shortened zzso The data suggest that cancer arises from zzso cells with short zzso
