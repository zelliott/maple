zzso factor zzso zzso blood zzso but its expression in the vascular space requires a finite period of zzso We hypothesized that targeting zzso tissue factor to sites of vascular injury could lead to accelerated zzso Since zzso zzso is exposed on activated cells at sites of vascular injury, we cloned the zzso for a zzso protein consisting of the zzso domain of zzso (called soluble zzso or zzso and zzso zzso a human zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso V zzso had zzso activities consistent with their native counterparts, and the zzso accelerated factor X zzso by factor zzso The zzso exhibited zzso effects upon blood zzso At low zzso it accelerated blood zzso while at higher zzso it acted as an zzso The zzso accelerated zzso in the presence of either zzso or zzso zzso more zzso than factor zzso and shortened the bleeding time of mice treated with zzso The zzso V zzso is a targeted zzso protein that may be useful in accelerating zzso generation where zzso is exposed to the zzso such as may occur at sites of vascular injury or within the zzso of zzso
