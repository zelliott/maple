The interaction of two new zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which zzso is zzso and zzso represents zzso with DNA in solution and immobilized DNA on a zzso zzso composite modified glassy carbon zzso were investigated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In solution zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicate outside binding of these zzso To clarify the binding mode of complexes, it was done competition studies with zzso and zzso red as groove zzso and zzso zzso zzso All these results indicating that, these two complexes zzso and zzso interact with DNA via groove binding and partially zzso zzso zzso The zzso characterization experiments showed that the zzso film of zzso zzso could effectively zzso DNA and greatly improve the zzso reactions of the zzso molecules that latter finding is the result of strong interactions between captured DNA and zzso zzso This result indicates that these complexes could be noble candidates as zzso indicators in further zzso At the end, these new complexes showed excellent zzso activity against zzso zzso chronic zzso zzso cell zzso
