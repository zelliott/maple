Diagnosis of zzso by means of zzso detection is zzso at present, using zzso zzso zzso in the detection of zzso arise from the low fluorescent efficiency of the most widely used drug zzso zzso and from the loss of intensity of the signal within the zzso zzso and the zzso lens of the zzso The electronic zzso carrying a microchip camera at its tip, permits a more sensitive detection of fluorescence, since the signal is drawn directly from the zzso zzso the electronic image, stored in a computer, can be manipulated to produce a more enhanced contrast between the zzso of normal and zzso zzso An example of electronic manipulation would be the zzso of the image obtained under green light zzso from that obtained under violet light zzso
