zzso can proceed by a variety of pathways involving the sequential zzso of normal cellular growth control genes and the zzso expansion of the resulting zzso or zzso zzso Chemical zzso may act by inducing zzso and/or altering cellular growth zzso One class of chemical zzso are the zzso These compounds or their zzso are DNA zzso and directly induce zzso or zzso zzso The observation that most zzso are also zzso is the basis for many current zzso zzso and risk assessment zzso however, there are different classes of zzso zzso that do not interact with zzso zzso directly induce cell proliferation in the target zzso zzso produce cell death followed by zzso cell zzso zzso toxicity and/or growth stimulation induced by zzso and zzso may provide a preferential growth advantage to spontaneous or chemically induced zzso or zzso zzso zzso are much more effective zzso at doses that also induce cell zzso and zzso activity may occur as an event secondary to cell zzso Thus, chemically induced cell proliferation is an important zzso consideration for both zzso and zzso zzso The complex quantitative relationships between chemically induced cell proliferation and zzso activity are under study in many zzso Such information should be considered in setting doses for cancer zzso for zzso chemical zzso and in providing more realistic approaches to risk zzso Of particular concern in zzso cancer risk from zzso models to humans are those zzso agents that exhibit zzso activity only at doses that also produce zzso and zzso cell proliferation in the target zzso
