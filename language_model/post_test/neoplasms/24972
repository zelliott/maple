Since zzso agents zzso were licensed in 1993, more than 70 zzso controlled trials and more than 20 zzso and systematic reviews on their effectiveness were zzso Here, we present a systematic review on the zzso of trials evaluating zzso in cancer zzso 

We included all published zzso of at least five zzso controlled trials that evaluated the effects of zzso versus control in patients with any type of cancer or zzso zzso 

We included a total of 23 systematic reviews and zzso (16 literature based and 7 based on individual patient data zzso that assessed several zzso All 12 zzso reporting on zzso risks demonstrated that zzso significantly reduce the risk of zzso Eleven zzso zzso based on published data and two on zzso evaluated zzso zzso An increased risk of zzso events was observed in all but two zzso zzso risks zzso ranging from zzso to zzso However, potential reporting and publication bias as well as detection bias call for a cautious interpretation of these zzso Survival and mortality were evaluated in 18 zzso with the observed effect changing over zzso While zzso on studies conducted before 2002 showed beneficial effects of zzso on survival, contrary results, zzso worsened survival, was seen in zzso including more recent zzso 

The results from several zzso show that zzso in cancer patients reduce the risk for red blood cell zzso and increase the risk for zzso events and zzso The effect of zzso on mortality risk in patients receiving chemotherapy remains zzso In clinical practice, the benefits and risks of zzso should be carefully considered and decisions should be made based on each patient's situation and zzso
