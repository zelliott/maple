Many applications of zzso gene therapy relate to the immune zzso Several forms of inherited zzso are candidates for treatment by gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes a form of severe combined zzso zzso gene transfer and expression of human zzso has now been obtained in zzso stem cells of mice and, more recently, in large zzso The human zzso has also been introduced and expressed in the primitive human zzso zzso cells that initiate long-term bone zzso zzso Clinical trials of gene therapy for zzso zzso have been zzso The initial protocols were aimed at the correction of peripheral blood T zzso but recent strategies are attempting zzso gene transfer into peripheral blood or bone zzso stem zzso Other zzso that may soon be amenable to zzso gene therapy include zzso zzso zzso and chronic zzso zzso Gene therapy may also be applied to the treatment of acquired zzso In theory, the zzso stem cells of a human zzso virus zzso patient could be genetically modified and used to zzso an zzso zzso zzso Various strategies are currently being investigated to achieve this zzso zzso against zzso These include the transfer of genes zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso suicide genes under the control of zzso promoter, and zzso zzso Gene transfer could also be used in the treatment of cancer to increase the immune response of the host, to activate zzso specifically in tumors, or to protect normal zzso against the zzso of conventional zzso Recent progress in all of these applications of gene therapy is reviewed zzso
