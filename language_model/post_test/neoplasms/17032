For more than two decades, genetically engineered mouse models have been key to our zzso understanding of zzso and cancer zzso Recently, the massive quantity of data emerging from cancer zzso studies has demanded a corresponding increase in the efficiency and zzso of in zzso models for functional testing of putative cancer zzso Already a mainstay of cancer research, recent innovations in zzso interference zzso technology have extended its utility for studying gene function and genetic zzso enabling zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso advances in embryonic stem cell zzso culture and zzso engineering have accelerated several steps of genetically engineered mouse model production and have facilitated the incorporation of zzso technology into these zzso Here, we review the current state of these technologies and examine how their integration has the potential to dramatically enhance the zzso and capabilities of animal models for zzso
