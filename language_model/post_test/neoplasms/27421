It is important to augment the zzso host response in cancer zzso Recent studies suggested that the signaling via zzso receptors zzso which are newly identified zzso molecules recognizing many zzso are involved in the induction of zzso zzso zzso et zzso demonstrated that maturation of zzso cells zzso and zzso induction by the cell wall skeleton of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are induced via both zzso and zzso Akira et zzso discovered a new zzso of zzso family, zzso recognizing zzso bacterial zzso whose clinical use is expected for cancer therapy as a potent zzso of a helper T cell 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso mice did not show any responses to zzso including zzso 1 zzso production and maturation of zzso We have obtained two zzso a zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso agent zzso and a zzso zzso protein that can induce zzso response and elicit a strong zzso effect in zzso and in zzso Our basic experiments demonstrate that zzso signaling is intimately involved in zzso immunity induced by these zzso Our clinical examination in oral cancer patients also suggests the requirement of both zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso host zzso zzso and clinical use of the methodology for human cancer therapy by utilizing zzso signaling is greatly zzso
