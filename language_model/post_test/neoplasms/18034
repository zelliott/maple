The mechanisms of action and drug interactions of oral zzso agents are zzso 

The mechanisms of action, zzso and potential for drug interactions vary for oral zzso Traditional oral chemotherapy agents cause damage to cancer cells by zzso interfering with cellular zzso Many of the newer agents have novel targets on cancer cells zzso resulting in a different spectrum of zzso Since cancer patients are at high risk for drug zzso usually because of age-related organ dysfunction and the need for zzso drug therapy for zzso conditions, understanding these agents and potential for interactions is imperative for all zzso zzso 

zzso of the mechanisms and zzso pathways for the oral zzso agents allows the potential to predict possible drug interactions and response while minimizing the risk of adverse zzso
