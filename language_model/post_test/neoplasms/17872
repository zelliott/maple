A characteristic feature of tumors is high production of zzso acid due to enhanced zzso Here, we show a positive correlation between zzso serum levels and tumor burden in cancer patients and examine the influence of zzso acid on immune functions in zzso zzso acid suppressed the proliferation and zzso production of human zzso T zzso zzso up to zzso and led to a 50% decrease in zzso zzso A 24-hour recovery period in zzso zzso medium restored zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso showed a reduced zzso zzso zzso of tumor zzso with an inhibitor of zzso acid production prevented this zzso zzso T cells themselves use zzso and rely on the efficient zzso of zzso acid, as its zzso zzso zzso their zzso Export by zzso zzso zzso depends on a zzso between zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso and consequently, blockade of zzso resulted in impaired zzso zzso We conclude that high zzso acid zzso in the tumor environment block zzso acid export in T cells, thereby disturbing their metabolism and zzso These findings suggest that targeting this zzso zzso in tumors is a promising strategy to enhance tumor zzso
