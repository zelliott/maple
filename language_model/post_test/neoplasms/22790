zzso wounds within previously zzso zzso are common in zzso surgery and subject to an increased zzso of zzso complications due to vascular dysfunction, including zzso in both zzso zzso and the zzso zzso However, there is no study that has described gene expression patterns in radiated human blood zzso This study aims to determine if radiation can induce changes in gene expression that can promote zzso formation in human zzso recipient zzso 

zzso zzso from radiated recipient veins and zzso zzso veins were simultaneously harvested from 15 patients during zzso zzso zzso weeks from termination of zzso zzso and zzso veins were compared using a custom-made zzso zzso array zzso to zzso differential gene expression in a large number of genes involved in inflammation and zzso zzso were confirmed by real-time zzso chain reaction zzso and zzso 

zzso from zzso indicate an acute increase of zzso and zzso zzso molecules related to zzso of zzso factor nuclear factor zzso zzso confined to the first 3 months after zzso zzso zzso were confirmed by zzso and activity zzso to the zzso by zzso zzso analyses of genes associated with zzso showed sustained expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in radiated zzso 

We found an acute inflammatory response with zzso zzso followed by a sustained zzso gene expression in zzso zzso recipient veins that can explain adverse effects years after radiation, such as zzso zzso and poor surgical wound zzso We believe that the results contribute to the search for therapeutic zzso to cope with the adverse effects of radiation therapy and strongly advocate zzso rather than zzso zzso whenever zzso
