zzso is a hallmark of cancer, and its zzso zzso and zzso are key factors for zzso zzso zzso zzso Using four tumor models characterized by different degrees of aggressiveness and zzso we show that the combination of functional zzso and anatomical zzso X-ray zzso zzso zzso allows highly accurate zzso of relative blood volume zzso and highly detailed three-dimensional analysis of the vascular network in zzso Depending on the tumor model, zzso values determined using zzso zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and zzso well with the values assessed using zzso Using zzso zzso zzso blood vessels as small as zzso zzso and vessel branches up to the seventh order could be zzso enabling a highly detailed and quantitative analysis of the three-dimensional zzso of tumor zzso zzso parameters such as vessel size and vessel branching correlated very well with tumor aggressiveness and zzso In rapidly growing and highly zzso zzso tumors, the majority of vessels were small and zzso only once or twice, whereas in slowly growing zzso tumors, the vessels were much larger and zzso four to seven zzso Thus, we consider that combining highly accurate functional with highly detailed anatomical zzso is a useful tool for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
