We previously established a model to study zzso T cell zzso adoptive zzso of cancer using line zzso mice that develop zzso zzso tumors in the brain due to transgenic expression of zzso zzso 40 large T zzso zzso These mice are tolerant to the three dominant zzso zzso zzso I, zzso and zzso However, adoptive transfer of zzso cells from zzso zzso zzso mice zzso zzso survival following zzso zzso against the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, survival of zzso mice is dramatically increased following transfer of zzso from zzso B6 zzso In the current study, we compared the zzso and magnitude of zzso zzso zzso at the tumor site following adoptive transfer with a high dose of either zzso or zzso donor cells or decreasing doses of zzso zzso Following adoptive transfer of zzso cells, zzso zzso and zzso zzso accumulated to high levels in the brain of zzso mice, zzso at zzso days, while zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso donors required three weeks to achieve peak zzso A similar delay in the peak of zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed when tenfold fewer zzso donor cells were zzso reducing control of tumor zzso These results suggest that efficient and prolonged control of established zzso tumors is associated with high-level early zzso of zzso transferred T zzso We also provide evidence that although multiple zzso are represented in the zzso immune donor zzso zzso zzso donor zzso play a zzso role in control of tumor zzso
