The biological activity of zzso is dependent upon its zzso We aim to integrate zzso zzso and metabolism into a discussion of the mechanisms by which zzso exerts its biological zzso First, we present the current status of zzso in the prevention of cancer, cardiovascular and neurodegenerative diseases with particular attention paid to the results of major zzso trials involving zzso zzso A comprehensive review of the current understanding of the metabolism of common dietary zzso compounds - zzso zzso zzso and zzso - is zzso with discussion of the evidence for the various zzso pathways and their zzso The zzso zzso and other mechanisms of the dietary zzso compounds have been linked to their disease prevention and treatment zzso The evidence for these various mechanisms zzso zzso in cells and in zzso is evaluated with emphasis on the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that dietary zzso compounds should be considered zzso whose biological activity will depend on the activity of the various zzso pathways in, and the zzso status of, cells and zzso These factors should be considered in future laboratory research and in selecting zzso compounds for trials of disease prevention and treatment by zzso zzso
