The clinical development of cancer zzso agents is similar to that of zzso zzso On the basis of promising zzso studies, agents with potential efficacy are introduced to the clinic as a phase I trial to study the zzso relationship of the agent and its human zzso If doses projected to have biological activity have acceptable side effects, the agent proceeds to a phase II trial, which zzso a larger number of participants and zzso the agent for a longer time period (up to 5 zzso Phase zzso trials test the effect of these agents on potential zzso of zzso to get some indication if the agent has zzso The phase II trial also pilots study design, mechanisms of zzso and adherence for future phase III zzso The phase III trial of a zzso agent determines its effect on cancer zzso Close attention is also paid to long-term side zzso The unique features of cancer prevention agents and their evaluation must be considered in this zzso clinical zzso These features include zzso populations recruited to prevention trials are zzso zzso in this population there is a low tolerance for side zzso and zzso the clinical end point of the trial, cancer, is statistically an uncommon zzso The evaluation of zzso and zzso as studied in the zzso and zzso zzso Trial zzso is used to illustrate this zzso clinical zzso
