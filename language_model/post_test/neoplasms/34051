The zzso vascular system in the adult body represents the zzso net outcome of overproduction of zzso zzso zzso and reduced levels of zzso zzso While some zzso zzso are expressed under zzso conditions, they can also be generated in association with tumor zzso zzso is such a specific zzso inhibitor produced by zzso It zzso primary and zzso tumor growth by blocking tumor zzso Having demonstrated potent zzso activity in animal studies, zzso is now in clinical trials for human cancer zzso zzso is not a novel protein zzso coded by novel DNA zzso Instead, it is an internal zzso zzso of a known zzso zzso Surprisingly, most zzso zzso of zzso only inhibit zzso when zzso as fragments from their parent protein that lacks zzso zzso These findings suggest that they are cryptic fragments hidden in large protein zzso Thus, zzso processing plays a critical role in zzso of zzso Despite zzso processing, the zzso mechanism of zzso remains an zzso Without knowing the mechanisms, it is difficult to predict the ultimate outcome of ongoing clinical zzso In this article, we discuss what is known about zzso and how this zzso specifically zzso zzso We hope that the information will be useful for further development of zzso and its related zzso as therapeutic zzso
