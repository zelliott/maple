zzso zzso blood levels are reached approximately zzso hours after the initial application of zzso zzso zzso For this reason, zzso patches should not be used to treat acute zzso of cancer zzso Acute zzso pain can be treated with zzso administered by continuous intravenous infusion zzso in combination with zzso analgesia zzso Patients then can be switched from intravenous zzso to zzso zzso once stable pain relief has been zzso The objective of the current case series was to evaluate and describe the safety and effectiveness of a method for converting hospitalized patients with zzso pain from IV to zzso zzso 

The authors zzso evaluated 15 consecutive cancer patients during the conversion from IV to zzso zzso In all patients, a zzso patch delivering zzso at a rate equivalent to that of the final continuous IV infusion was zzso The zzso rate was decreased by 50% 6 hours after application of the zzso patch and then discontinued after another 6 zzso zzso zzso of IV zzso equivalent in dosage to zzso of the final zzso rate remained available via zzso during the 24 hours after patch zzso zzso intensity (on a scale of zzso sedation (on a scale of zzso and hourly zzso administration zzso were assessed and recorded immediately prior to application of the zzso patch and 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours zzso 

zzso intensity, zzso and hourly zzso administration appeared to remain stable throughout the transition from IV to zzso zzso 

The results of the current study demonstrate that the conversion from IV to zzso zzso can be accomplished safely and effectively using a zzso zzso conversion ratio and a zzso taper of the zzso over 12 zzso
