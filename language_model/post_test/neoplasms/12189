The development of new cancer zzso tests measuring soluble markers can be divided along the lines of single zzso measurement versus multiplex zzso In the measurement of single zzso newly proposed test zzso still struggle with the same issues as their zzso zzso can the measurement of a single zzso be sufficiently sensitive and specific for screening the general zzso Probably the best example of this challenge is in the area of zzso cancer zzso where several newly identified markers are being clinically evaluated in zzso zzso In order to zzso this zzso multiplex analysis has become an increasingly important research zzso By combining the statistical power of measuring many zzso zzso it is hoped that highly specific diagnostic tests can be developed that are suitable for screening the general zzso Some of the most impressive data for multiplex cancer zzso detection derive from a zzso technique - mass zzso zzso analysis has also recently been applied to the measurement of serum zzso to zzso zzso Recent data link the development of zzso to zzso zzso with the presence of solid zzso This strategy is a departure from the more traditional zzso format of measuring the zzso themselves, and is another promising emerging area of investigation for the early detection of solid zzso Solid tumor analysis by quantitative zzso zzso is another rapidly growing area of cancer zzso This field has become especially important in the context of zzso - the zzso of cancer therapy to the outcome of a test measurement from a patient zzso zzso and zzso zzso appear to be the most significant challenges in this zzso In zzso developments over the past several years give reason for excitement and optimism about the potential for cancer zzso to zzso impact cancer patient zzso In this review we take a fresh look at the field of cancer zzso to identify these recent and emerging trends that may impact on clinical practice over the next few zzso
