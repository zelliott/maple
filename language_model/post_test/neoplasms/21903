The zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso has been found to be a new type of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso for this gene in various types of cancer via zzso zzso or zzso zzso leads to growth suppression both in zzso and in zzso The zzso effect of zzso zzso has been presumed to be due to the zzso activity of the zzso zzso but could be due to a number of other mechanisms, including a regulatory effect of the zzso or protein zzso To examine this question, we used zzso zzso to produce a zzso form of human zzso that has a zzso at zzso acid 26 in the active site rather than the usual zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso or zzso zzso of this zzso zzso zzso leads to a large increase in zzso zzso zzso but little or no increase in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso zzso leads to cells with both increased zzso protein and zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso leads to decreased zzso efficiency and zzso These results clearly demonstrate that the zzso effect of zzso protein is largely due to its zzso zzso
