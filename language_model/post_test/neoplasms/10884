High circulating tumor cell zzso counts are associated with poor prognosis in several zzso Enrollment of patients on phase I zzso trials requires a careful assessment of the potential risks and zzso Many patients enrolled on such trials using established eligibility criteria have a short life expectancy and are less likely to benefit from trial zzso We hypothesized that the incorporation of zzso counts might improve patient selection for phase I zzso 

This retrospective analysis evaluated patients who had baseline zzso zzso prior to their starting on a phase I zzso zzso were zzso using the zzso zzso 

Between January 2006 and December 2009 a total of 128 patients enrolled in phase I trials had zzso counts zzso Higher zzso counts as a continuous variable independently correlated with risk of death in this patient population zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso risk model was generated using zzso as a zzso variable zzso or zzso and incorporated other established zzso factors, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso greater than upper limit of normal, and zzso zzso zzso zzso of receiver operating characteristic zzso demonstrated that the addition of baseline zzso counts improved the performance of the zzso validated Royal Marsden Hospital phase I zzso score, which now identifies three risk groups zzso zzso zzso good prognosis zzso zzso median overall survival zzso zzso zzso intermediate prognosis zzso zzso median zzso zzso weeks), and poor prognosis zzso 4, median zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso improved the performance of a validated zzso score to help select patients for phase I zzso zzso
