As zzso treatment moves to zzso settings, required reporting is zzso We undertook a zzso exercise to identify reporting barriers and devise a pilot improvement zzso 

We convened a multidisciplinary group of community-based zzso tumor registry zzso staff, and hospital zzso The group identified three key barriers to reporting: zzso inability to identify correct managing physician, zzso poor communication, and zzso manual reporting zzso Our intervention addressed the first two barriers and involved correcting physician contact information, simplifying contact forms, zzso cases in real time, and zzso physician office staff to respond to zzso zzso 

zzso the zzso did not identify any pilot patients' managing medical zzso and little zzso zzso During the zzso 2012 intervention, 22 patients with breast cancer listed our volunteer surgeon as managing zzso The zzso sent 22 treatment letters to the zzso office and received 19 zzso responses identifying the managing medical zzso Nine of the 19 cases zzso were zzso To close a case required an average of zzso contacts and 28 minutes for electronic medical zzso cases and zzso minutes for community zzso zzso zzso percent of required treatment was zzso zzso staff spent zzso hours per case to identify the zzso prescribing zzso zzso 

The zzso exercise improved identification of managing zzso from zzso to zzso for patients treated by community zzso Treatment reporting increased from zzso to zzso The pilot did not address the burden of reporting, which remains zzso Electronic records can reduce this burden, but this approach is not currently feasible for many zzso
