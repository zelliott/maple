zzso is the process by which new blood vessels are formed from zzso zzso To ensure an adequate blood supply, tumor cells release zzso factors that are capable of promoting nearby blood vessels to extend vascular branches to the zzso In addition, larger tumors have been shown to release zzso zzso factors that prevent blood vessels from sending branches to smaller, more distant tumors that compete for oxygen and zzso zzso is a complex zzso zzso process, and offers several potential molecular targets for zzso zzso zzso Strategies for exploiting tumor zzso for novel cancer drug discovery include: zzso zzso of zzso zzso that breakdown the zzso zzso surrounding existing zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso enhancement of tumor zzso cell zzso There is also a host of zzso agents that inhibit zzso for which the specific mechanisms are not zzso Several methods have been developed for measuring zzso activity both in zzso and in zzso Although there has been intensive research efforts focused at the phenomena of zzso as well as the search for zzso agents for more than two decades, many questions remain unanswered with regard to the overall zzso mechanisms of the zzso process and the potential therapeutic utility of zzso zzso zzso potent zzso zzso capable of blocking tumor growth have been discovered, and appear to have potential for development into novel zzso zzso However there are still hurdles to be overcome before these zzso become mainstream zzso
