One critical step in tumor zzso is tumor cell zzso to the zzso forming the zzso zzso zzso this step may lead to new therapeutic concepts for tumor zzso zzso zzso forming the zzso wall and the zzso layer at its surface are the principal barriers to, and regulators of the material exchange between circulating blood and body zzso The zzso between adjacent zzso zzso zzso is the principal zzso for water and zzso transport through the zzso wall in zzso It is also suggested to be the zzso for high molecular weight plasma zzso zzso and tumor cells across zzso walls in zzso Thus the first part of the review introduced the mathematical models for water and zzso transport through the zzso zzso These models, combined with the experimental results from in zzso animal studies and electron microscopic zzso are used to evaluate the role of the zzso surface zzso the junction strand geometry in the zzso zzso and the surrounding zzso zzso and tissue cells, as the zzso of zzso zzso The second part of the review demonstrated how the zzso zzso zzso factors, zzso geometry and cell zzso molecules affect tumor cell zzso in the zzso
