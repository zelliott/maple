zzso radiation zzso is an important therapeutic zzso used in approximately 50% of all cancer patients and is particularly effective against solid tumors that cannot be removed by surgery or that are zzso to standard zzso zzso zzso is often combined with other zzso agents with the goal of zzso cancer cells to the zzso effects of zzso to produce a synergistic zzso zzso 

This review article describes current and emerging therapeutic agents that are designed to increase the therapeutic efficacy of zzso This includes a discussion of how zzso causes cell death by damaging zzso zzso The involvement of various DNA repair zzso zzso zzso and zzso pathways is also zzso This zzso information provides the framework to understand how combining therapeutic zzso with zzso produces synergistic effects as well as to explain how emerging therapeutic strategies are being designed to inhibit or activate these zzso zzso mechanisms and clinical applications of these chemical entities are zzso Finally, brief descriptions are provided for several emerging chemical entities that show promise as potential zzso agents to sensitize cells to the effects of zzso 

Using DNA damaging agents or zzso zzso to zzso the zzso effects of zzso has significantly improved patient zzso However, several zzso in zzso as well as new molecular targets are changing the landscape of applying zzso as a therapeutic zzso
