zzso killer cells zzso are zzso zzso zzso including zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso zzso has been shown to stimulate zzso proliferation in the presence of T cell zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the synergistic effect of zzso and zzso on expansion of zzso for treating patients with zzso zzso solid zzso 

zzso were cultured with immobilized zzso in the presence zzso zzso or absence of zzso zzso for 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Twenty zzso patients (18 patients with stage IV solid zzso received three cycles of zzso zzso The clinical responses were evaluated using zzso Performance zzso scoring and zzso zzso 

zzso promoted zzso expansion in a zzso manner by zzso zzso and increasing zzso zzso of zzso and zzso amplified more zzso zzso of zzso with activated zzso zzso which displayed potent zzso and increased zzso zzso upon zzso zzso Sixteen zzso patients receiving zzso experienced relief of clinical zzso The overall clinical response rate was zzso zzso and the mean overall survival was zzso zzso No severe adverse events were observed in the clinical zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso promote zzso efficiency of zzso by increasing zzso zzso zzso and enhancing zzso
