We estimated the burden of cancer using mortality and years of life lost according to life tables in a cohort study in zzso 

A cohort of zzso subjects established in the late 1980s in Japan was followed annually for the vital status of all subjects until zzso For subjects who died, the underlying cause of death was zzso from the death zzso Crude mortality rate from cancer per 100,000 zzso was zzso and years of life lost zzso as well as the average years of life lost zzso were zzso using the 1995 life tables in zzso 

During the follow-up period, we recorded a total zzso cancer deaths zzso men and zzso zzso representing zzso of deaths from all zzso zzso crude cancer mortality was zzso per 100 zzso zzso in men and zzso in zzso Total zzso due to cancer was zzso years in men and zzso years in zzso zzso zzso due to all zzso was zzso years less than life expectancy in men and zzso years in zzso 

These results showed that cancer was the leading cause of death in this zzso with stomach, liver and lung cancer the three most frequent zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso reflect the cost of dying from cancer in terms of years of life expectancy zzso The different mortality statistics used here may be useful in public health considerations of cancer zzso
