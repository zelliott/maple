To investigate the relationship between inflammatory zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso and cancer risk during zzso zzso 

A prospective zzso 

zzso patients on continuous zzso therapy zzso in the control arms of three zzso trials zzso were included in an analysis of zzso of cancer zzso type, zzso or zzso zzso ratios for zzso zzso and zzso levels zzso were calculated using Cox models zzso by trial and adjusted for demographics and zzso cell counts and adjusted also for all zzso zzso To assess the possibility that zzso levels were elevated at entry due to zzso cancer, analyses were repeated excluding early cancer events zzso diagnosed during first 2 years of zzso 

During approximately 24,000 zzso of follow-up zzso zzso patients developed cancer zzso zzso 102 zzso The risk of developing cancer was associated with higher levels zzso zzso of zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso and zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso However, only zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso remained associated with cancer risk when all zzso were considered zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso were similar to results for any zzso zzso ratios excluding 69 early cancer events were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso inflammation and zzso pathways are associated with increased cancer risk during zzso zzso This association was stronger for zzso and persisted after excluding early zzso Trials of interventions may be warranted to assess whether cancer risk can be reduced by lowering zzso levels in zzso zzso
