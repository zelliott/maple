zzso zzso typified by zzso zzso are known to induce zzso zzso in transformed mouse zzso zzso but not in normal mouse zzso zzso We now report that this is also the case for human zzso First, we used an zzso zzso cell lineage exhibiting progressive stages of zzso from primary derived cells to zzso immortalized to zzso At the zzso stage, cells became 12- and zzso more sensitive to the zzso antioxidants zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although zzso of these cells was associated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso was not sufficient for zzso these cells to zzso To test whether sensitivity to antioxidants is a general property of immortalized human cells, including fully transformed cells, 12 zzso cell lines were treated with zzso the more potent of the two zzso Ten of 11 zzso tumor cell lines underwent zzso after treatment, whereas primary zzso and zzso were zzso The difference between normal and transformed cells was apparent whether the zzso used measured zzso 3 zzso zzso V zzso or cell zzso zzso cell lines containing zzso zzso were more sensitive than zzso cell zzso The requirement for zzso was tested using the zzso zzso zzso or using stable zzso of a zzso zzso cell line that expresses zzso E6 to bind and degrade zzso In the latter case, zzso or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was dependent on the presence of zzso zzso These studies suggest that treatment with zzso zzso such as zzso may offer a useful approach for preferential induction of zzso in zzso and zzso zzso
