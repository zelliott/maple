zzso DNA zzso plays important roles in zzso However, the functional significance of zzso zzso and zzso of gene promoters in zzso currently remain zzso 

Based on zzso zzso data for five cancer types, we showed that genes with promoter zzso were highly consistent in function across different cancer types, and so were genes with promoter zzso zzso related to zzso zzso and zzso of biology zzso were significantly enriched with zzso genes but were depleted of zzso zzso In contrast, functions related to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso including immune and inflammatory response, were associated with an enrichment of zzso genes and depletion of zzso zzso We also observed that some families of zzso zzso by immune cells, such as zzso family zzso and zzso tended to be zzso in various cancer zzso These results provide new hints for understanding the distinct functional roles of zzso zzso and zzso of gene promoters in zzso 

Genes with promoter zzso and zzso are highly consistent in function across different cancer types, respectively, but these two groups of genes tend to be enriched in different functions associated with zzso zzso we speculate that zzso of gene promoters may play roles in inducing immunity and inflammation disorders in zzso conditions, which may provide hints for improving zzso therapy and zzso of zzso
