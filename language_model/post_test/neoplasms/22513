zzso and other environmental factors induce zzso zzso which may have important consequences for cancer zzso This chapter summarizes current knowledge of the impact of zzso lifestyle, and environmental zzso of cancer risk and proposes that effects of these zzso might be zzso at least in part, via zzso zzso Evidence is presented to support the hypothesis that all recognized zzso marks (including DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are influenced by environmental zzso including diet, zzso alcohol, physical activity, stress, environmental zzso genetic factors, and infectious agents which play important roles in the zzso of zzso Some of these zzso modifications change the expression of tumor zzso genes and zzso and, therefore, may be zzso for zzso Further work is required to understand the mechanisms through which specific environmental factors produce zzso changes and to identify those changes which are likely to be zzso in the zzso of cancer and those which are secondary, or zzso zzso Given the plasticity of zzso marks in response to zzso zzso such zzso marks are attractive candidates for the development of surrogate zzso which could be used in dietary or lifestyle intervention studies for cancer zzso Future research should focus on identifying zzso marks which are zzso validated as zzso for the cancer under study; zzso readily measured in easily accessible zzso for example, blood, zzso cells, or zzso and zzso altered in response to dietary or lifestyle interventions for which there is convincing evidence for a relationship with cancer zzso
