This paper analyzes the feasibility of using zzso modeling techniques in the design of zzso zzso zzso zzso temperature zzso State space zzso models are created based upon a finite difference expansion of the zzso transfer equation model of a scanned focused ultrasound system zzso These zzso state space models are reduced using the balanced realization technique, and an order reduction criterion is zzso zzso show that a drastic reduction in model dimension can be achieved using the balanced zzso The zzso model is then used to design a zzso optimal zzso controller for a zzso zzso two zzso output tissue zzso In addition, a zzso optimal zzso controller is designed for comparison and validation zzso These two controllers are applied to a variety of zzso tissue zzso models to test the robust nature of the zzso zzso A comparison of the two controllers zzso the use of zzso balanced zzso models in the design of zzso zzso zzso
