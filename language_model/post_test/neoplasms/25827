Studies aimed at examining the precise zzso of the zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso have been hindered by the rapid zzso and zzso of zzso expressed RB which occurs in the majority of cell zzso zzso zzso expressed RB is a poor inhibitor of cellular zzso We have designed zzso active RB zzso zzso that cannot be zzso by zzso Using these zzso we show that unlike zzso zzso zzso proteins inhibit cell cycle progression in a broad range of tumor cell zzso Furthermore, unlike zzso zzso is also a potent inhibitor of cell cycle progression in zzso tumor zzso Surprisingly, we identified a tumor cell line that is resistant to the cell cycle zzso effects of zzso This finding challenges the hypothesis that RB must be zzso in all cells for cell cycle progression to zzso Further characterization of this zzso tumor line revealed that proliferation of these cells is still inhibited by zzso We show that this is due to zzso cell zzso As such, these studies are the first to show that RB zzso cellular proliferation through at least two distinct mechanisms - zzso of cell cycle progression and induction of cell zzso
