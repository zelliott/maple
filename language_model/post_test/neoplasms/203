The zzso content of human zzso was studied using a quantitative zzso zzso of bone zzso from 13 individuals were stained with the modified zzso reaction with and without prior treatment with zzso The intensity of the reaction was determined by zzso in 50 zzso from each zzso It was found that zzso are rich in zzso which is not only confined to the intensely zzso zzso and inclusion bodies, but also makes up a good part of the diffuse zzso zzso In the zzso stained zzso zzso makes up zzso of the intensity of the zzso reaction, while it reaches zzso in those with zzso and up to zzso in those with inclusion zzso The total extinction of the zzso zzso is not only dependent on the zzso appearances of the cells, but is also positively correlated with their zzso
