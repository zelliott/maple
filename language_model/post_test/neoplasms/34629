The aim of this review is to draw the attention to the numerous steps of gene expression which operate at the zzso level and which are significant drivers of the transformation zzso The analysis of zzso abnormalities was at first limited to gross zzso zzso and to DNA point zzso Then came the era of zzso which were originally believed, since they were zzso to be a faithful reflection of the expressed zzso As a matter of fact, this first-generation zzso gave only a zzso zzso assessment of gene expression at a given locus but overlooked the qualitative diversity of the zzso population generated by alternative zzso We will show that beyond their essential role in the regulation of functions specific to zzso like development, alternative zzso brings about an important vulnerability to zzso which is at the origin of many zzso including zzso The second aspect covered by this review is that of a rather novel category of zzso the zzso which, although zzso functionally behave as zzso or tumor zzso through the negative control they exert on conventional zzso or zzso Beyond their diagnostic and zzso interest, these two mechanisms offer entirely novel potential therapeutic zzso
