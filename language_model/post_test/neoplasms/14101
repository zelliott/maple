The expression of zzso gene was investigated in human solid tumors with respect to zzso zzso Forty fresh human surgical specimens were analyzed by zzso dot zzso zzso for their expression of the human zzso gene and by zzso zzso using a zzso zzso against zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso level was increased in 11 cases of 40 cancer patients, including three zzso zzso two breast zzso two gastric zzso one colon cancer, one zzso cell zzso one zzso zzso cancer and one zzso zzso of zzso However, considerable variation of the zzso zzso level was noted among zzso of a specific zzso zzso studies with the zzso zzso were shown to be positive in 18 zzso In all tumors tested, the zzso zzso level and the zzso analysis showed a significant zzso However, two of five tumors which resisted zzso treatment were found to be negative in zzso transcript, but positive in zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso analysis would be more sensitive for detecting zzso and that resistance to zzso being zzso can be associated at least, in part with the increased amount of zzso gene zzso
