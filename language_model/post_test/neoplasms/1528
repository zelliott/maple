To compare the zzso efficacy and safety of zzso extended release zzso and zzso controlled release zzso in patients with moderate to severe cancer zzso 

This randomized, zzso zzso zzso crossover study included adult zzso zzso 18 years of zzso with moderate or severe cancer pain who were first zzso for zzso days with zzso zzso or zzso to achieve a stable dose that provided and other efficacy parameters were comparable for adequate analgesia with tolerable adverse events and no requirement for more than 2 doses of rescue medication per zzso The subsequent zzso treatment phase was a 7- to 10-day period of zzso zzso or zzso zzso treatment followed by crossing over to the alternate medication for another zzso zzso During the treatment phase, up to 2 doses per day of zzso zzso zzso zzso were allowed as zzso 

zzso included the zzso zzso zzso global evaluations, zzso performance status, and clinical laboratory evaluations zzso chemistry profile, complete blood count, zzso zzso variables were analyzed using a zzso model with treatment, zzso and period as fixed effects and subject as a random zzso 

zzso patients entered the zzso phase, 44 received at least 1 dose of study drug, 42 completed the first zzso phase, and 40 completed the second zzso zzso Mean pain intensity scores the 2 zzso The mean daily dosage of zzso zzso zzso zzso was twice that of zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso dose ratio of zzso zzso medication use was low in both groups zzso 1 tablet of zzso zzso 15 zzso No significant differences in zzso adverse events were observed between the zzso 

Adult patients with cancer who were taking zzso zzso were readily converted to zzso zzso and required half the zzso dose to stabilize their zzso Within 72 zzso most patients achieved a stable dose that provided adequate relief with similar zzso adverse zzso
