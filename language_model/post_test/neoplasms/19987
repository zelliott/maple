The zzso is the main zzso center in animal cells, and helps to influence the zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso The zzso also templates the assembly of the primary zzso and together they serve as a zzso of cell signaling that provide cells with diverse organization, zzso and sensory zzso The majority of cells in the human body contain a solitary zzso and zzso and cells have evolved regulatory mechanisms to precisely control the numbers of these essential zzso zzso in the structure and function of zzso lead to a variety of complex disease zzso termed zzso while zzso of zzso number has long been proposed to induce zzso instability and tumor zzso Here, we review recent findings that link zzso amplification to changes in zzso number and signaling capacity, and discuss how zzso zzso may be an important aspect of a set of zzso disease zzso
