The objective of molecular profiling of cancer is to determine the differential expression of genes and proteins from human tissue in the progression from normal precursor tissue to zzso tissue to cancer in order to discover zzso zzso and therapeutic zzso With the development of zzso zzso techniques such as zzso and zzso PAGE as well as the development of tools for cell procurement from zzso sections such as laser capture zzso zzso it is now possible to perform molecular analyses on specific cell populations from zzso Since recognition of specific cell populations is critical, there is a need to zzso fixation and embedding not only to improve preservation of zzso but also to maintain excellent zzso We have shown that zzso ethanol fixation of prostate tissue improves the recovery of DNA, zzso and proteins over routine zzso fixation and maintains zzso quality comparable to zzso There is also a need to develop new technologies in order to expand the range of tissue types that can be zzso The development and applications of zzso zzso zzso zzso for the molecular analysis of whole tissue sections are zzso
