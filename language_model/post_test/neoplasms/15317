The zzso of zzso activity were studied in 17 children treated zzso with zzso zzso at 3 zzso as a zzso infusion for 2 consecutive days every 3 weeks, with zzso as a zzso Two patients were treated for a newly diagnosed zzso according to the current zzso zzso Society of zzso zzso zzso The other 15 patients were treated in a phase II study and presented with one of the following zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso soft tissue zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso zzso and acute zzso leukemia zzso Plasma zzso activity levels determined by using zzso showed considerable zzso and zzso variations and decreased zzso with mean alpha and beta zzso of 60 zzso and zzso zzso zzso Probably as a result of liver zzso zzso zzso on the 2nd day of treatment the terminal zzso were zzso the plasma zzso were lower, and the mean plasma zzso were zzso Renal zzso was almost complete after 24 zzso accounting for a mean of zzso of the injected zzso The zzso zzso activity levels, obtained in four children, were always lower than the plasma levels and ranged from 8 to 51 zzso with a mean zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso during the first 12 zzso We conclude that IF zzso activity was zzso cleared from the zzso with significant zzso and zzso zzso that the zzso contribution to the clearance was low, and that high levels of zzso zzso activity could possibly contribute to the zzso toxic side effects observed in pediatric patients treated with high-dose zzso
