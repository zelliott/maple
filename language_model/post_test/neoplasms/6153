The present review describes commonly employed zzso profiling platforms and discusses the current and likely future application of these technologies in zzso 

The zzso adaptations that occur in response to surgical illness and trauma are incompletely zzso Evaluating these will be critical to the development of personalized surgical health zzso zzso is an advancing field in systems biology, which provides a means of interrogating these zzso zzso 

Recent literature regarding zzso profiling technologies and their applications in surgical practice are zzso Future strategies are proposed for the incorporation of these and next-generation technologies in the evaluation of all steps in the patient surgical zzso 

zzso profiling has provided valuable insights into the zzso irregularities that occur in cancer development and progression across a variety of cancer zzso including zzso breast, zzso and lung zzso In addition, zzso modeling has shown considerable promise in other surgical conditions including trauma and zzso and in the assessment of zzso zzso 

zzso offers a zzso view of system activity providing functional information downstream of the zzso and zzso Information at this level will provide the surgeon with a novel means of evaluating major socioeconomic problems such as cancer and zzso In addition, the rapid nature of emerging next generation profiling platforms provides a viable means of zzso zzso zzso assessment and zzso
