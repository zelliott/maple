zzso reactions of a variety of zzso with zzso free zzso in zzso zzso at ambient temperature yielded novel, highly zzso zzso zzso in zzso yields with complete retention of zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso derivatives with sodium zzso in methanol afforded zzso zzso zzso in nearly quantitative zzso Acid zzso of zzso zzso proceeded with a zzso of zzso minutes at pH zzso which is vastly superior to the decomposition rate of conventional zzso under similar zzso The structure of one of the novel zzso was confirmed by X-ray zzso In zzso biological studies showed that zzso zzso may serve as potential zzso zzso for selective treatment of solid zzso
