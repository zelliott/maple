zzso modifications play important roles in the regulation of gene expression and zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in zzso silent zzso formation and zzso regulation, but the molecular basis underlying such effects remains zzso Here we report that zzso possesses an intrinsic protein zzso activity and is capable of zzso zzso zzso on zzso 120 zzso in a zzso zzso zzso is localized to a large set of tumor zzso genes and blocks their transcription, in a manner that is dependent on its zzso activity toward zzso The functional significance of zzso zzso is further underscored by the fact that zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso reactivate growth regulatory genes and impede tumor zzso Our findings establish zzso as a major zzso responsible for zzso in cancer cells and suggest that zzso zzso could be a new strategy for the development of zzso zzso
