Recent clinical trials have indicated that addition of tamoxifen zzso to a combination of zzso zzso zzso and zzso markedly increases the overall objective response rate of patients with zzso zzso zzso Previous studies have determined that there is remarkable zzso between zzso and zzso in a human melanoma cell line zzso Using the technique of median effect analysis, in zzso zzso we observed a highly synergistic interaction between zzso and zzso To determine whether or not this synergistic interaction was unique to human zzso or is generally observed in other types of zzso we examined the nature of this interaction using a human zzso zzso and small cell lung cancer cell zzso zzso was observed in both cell zzso In the case of all 3 types of zzso zzso was observed at zzso of both zzso and zzso that can be achieved in zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso between the zzso and zzso is observed in cell lines established from multiple types of human zzso It is important to note that the zzso between zzso and zzso is not dependent on the presence of zzso or zzso zzso Since zzso is well tolerated by patients, it is particularly attractive as a potential agent with which to sensitize human tumors to zzso
