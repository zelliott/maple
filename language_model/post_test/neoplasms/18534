Signal zzso and zzso of zzso 3 zzso controls a key signaling zzso in the development of many zzso zzso Several genetic studies have proven its central role in the regulation of zzso zzso zzso and immune responses making it an attractive target for cancer zzso 

This article addresses the role of zzso in immune response zzso and highlights the contribution of zzso in zzso zzso We also review the rationale to use novel zzso zzso and list some of these zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and small zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that have been found to be efficient against zzso We zzso the efforts that have been made so far in identifying promising compounds and mention the barriers that need to be overcome for successful application of zzso zzso in zzso 

zzso is an important target in tumor biology based on its frequent zzso in various tumors and its zzso effects on different cell zzso zzso large libraries of logically zzso small zzso zzso is one way to rapidly generate many potential zzso which can then be tested in different biologically relevant zzso The stage is, therefore, set for the identification and development of novel zzso zzso that will, in the very near future, enter the clinical zzso
