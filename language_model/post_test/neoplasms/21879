In this work, we show a mathematical model for the zzso by zzso zzso We present the model at the level of partial differential zzso describing the zzso evolution of the cell population, the zzso zzso zzso the zzso the tumor zzso factors, and the possible presence of zzso We mainly focus, however, on a zzso more zzso zzso hybrid approach in which the cells are treated as individual zzso We examine the model zzso in two-dimensional settings, discussing its comparison with experimental zzso
