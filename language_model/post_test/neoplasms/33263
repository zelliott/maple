zzso agents typified by the zzso class of drug have demonstrated promising activity in Phase II and III clinical zzso 

Data supporting the efficacy of these agents are reviewed and their potential use in zzso disease zzso 

zzso evidence assessing the role of the zzso assembly checkpoint in determining the cellular response to zzso stabilization are presented together with clinical data documenting the efficacy of zzso zzso zzso 

Evidence suggests that zzso agents prolong zzso of the zzso assembly checkpoint which may promote cancer cell death in zzso or following zzso zzso A weakened zzso assembly checkpoint is associated with altered sensitivity to agents targeting the zzso and therefore pathways of drug resistance may be shared by these zzso zzso zzso clinical trial data do suggest modest activity of zzso in truly zzso patient zzso indicating the potential niche for these agents in a zzso undefined patient group, potentially implicating the role of zzso in the acquisition of zzso zzso Trial data of these zzso agents will be presented together with their potential role in zzso disease and the implications for future clinical trial zzso
