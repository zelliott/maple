This article reviews the clinical zzso of a zzso analogue of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and its more potent zzso zzso zzso zzso interfere with zzso DNA zzso I and cancer cell death appears to result from DNA strand breaks caused by the formation of zzso zzso The main clinical adverse effects of zzso therapy are zzso and zzso zzso has shown activity in zzso zzso and the following cancer sites: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stomach and zzso Following the intravenous administration of zzso at 100 to 350 zzso mean maximum zzso plasma zzso are within the 1 to 10 zzso zzso Plasma zzso can be described using a zzso or zzso model with a mean terminal zzso ranging from 5 to 27 zzso The volume of distribution at zzso zzso ranges from 136 to 255 zzso and the total body clearance is 8 to 21 zzso zzso is zzso bound to plasma zzso The areas under the plasma zzso curve zzso of both zzso and zzso increase zzso to the administered dose, although zzso zzso is zzso zzso levels achieved in humans are about zzso lower than corresponding zzso zzso but these zzso are potentially important as zzso is zzso to zzso more zzso than the parent zzso zzso is zzso bound to plasma zzso zzso zzso of zzso are reached about 1 hour after the beginning of a short intravenous zzso zzso plasma zzso follows closely that of the parent compound with an apparent terminal zzso ranging from 6 to 30 zzso In human plasma at zzso the zzso zzso form accounts for 25 to zzso of the total and zzso zzso for 50 to zzso zzso is extensively zzso in the zzso The zzso group of zzso is first removed by zzso to yield the corresponding zzso acid and zzso by zzso zzso can be converted into zzso zzso by zzso zzso Another recently identified zzso is zzso zzso zzso This zzso is a weak inhibitor of zzso cell growth and a poor zzso of zzso I zzso complexes zzso less potent than zzso Numerous other unidentified zzso have been detected in zzso and zzso The mean 24-hour zzso urinary zzso represents 17 to zzso of the administered zzso Recovery of zzso and its zzso in urine is low and represents 1 to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso for zzso zzso for zzso zzso and about zzso for zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso are not influenced by prior exposure to the parent zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso correlate significantly with zzso and sometimes with the intensity of zzso Certain zzso function parameters have been correlated zzso with zzso total body zzso It was noted that most zzso responses were observed at the highest doses administered in phase I trials, which indicates a zzso relationship with this zzso In the future, these zzso relationships will undoubtedly prove useful in zzso the toxicity and zzso the likelihood of zzso response in zzso
