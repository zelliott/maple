In the broad field of radiation therapy zzso both simple and complex problems have their origins in the interaction of the radiation beams with the biological structures of normal and zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso it is no great surprise that many treatment zzso problems are best handled by the use of zzso zzso zzso The classic way of zzso zzso relations for tumors and normal zzso as well as their zzso with each other and their dependence on the underlying genetic and molecular biology of the cell are first briefly zzso zzso objective functions, such as the probability of achieving zzso cure and its expectation value under influence of zzso processes during the course of treatment, are defined and shown to solve many of the problems of radiation therapy zzso Finally, it is shown through the use of these zzso that, simply by introducing biologically optimal intensity modulated dose delivery, the treatment outcome can be improved by about zzso or more in cases with a complex spread of the zzso Once zzso optimal plans have been developed, they can be zzso by ordinary physical planning, but the biological objective functions are still needed to have a figure of merit for the quality of the zzso
