zzso D zzso has been increasingly recognized as a critical regulator of cell proliferation and zzso zzso regulates downstream zzso by generating zzso acid zzso and the expression and activity of zzso are elevated in many different types of human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso followed by zzso of target zzso is linked to a wide range of zzso New studies reveal a direct connection between the zzso and the zzso signaling zzso zzso is a zzso target of zzso factor zzso and reinforces zzso signaling related with cellular zzso In this review, we discuss the emerging importance of zzso and PA in the zzso signaling network, which is associated with zzso and suggest that the zzso signaling zzso is a potential therapeutic target for the treatment of zzso
