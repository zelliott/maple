On the basis of the results of activity studies, previous reports have suggested that vitamin D binding protein zzso is significantly or even completely zzso in cancer patients, eliminating the molecular precursor of the zzso important zzso zzso zzso factor zzso a zzso product of zzso The purpose of this investigation was to directly determine the relative degree of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in human breast, zzso zzso and prostate cancer zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso mass zzso zzso showed that there was no significant depletion of zzso zzso zzso in the 56 cancer patients examined relative to healthy zzso These results suggest that alternative hypotheses regarding the molecular and/or structural origins of zzso must be considered to explain the relative inability of cancer patient serum to activate zzso
