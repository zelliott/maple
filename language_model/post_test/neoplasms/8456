The induction and zzso of zzso zzso cells zzso activated killer cells zzso zzso by zzso zzso is an interesting new approach in cancer zzso So far, zzso alone or in combination with the transfer of in zzso activated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be effective predominantly in zzso cell cancer and zzso melanoma with a response rate of zzso The results in zzso tumors are zzso Clinical experiences with zzso in other tumor entities are limited and/or mostly lack sufficient zzso To improve therapeutic results and to reduce the serious side effects, present trials focus on combinations of zzso with other zzso predominantly zzso zzso or zzso So far, the combination of zzso + zzso seems to be at least as effective as zzso + zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso of chemotherapy and zzso especially in gastrointestinal tumors, have not been shown to exceed the moderate results of chemotherapy alone so zzso Trials with highly activated or specific zzso cells as zzso zzso zzso or zzso are still more zzso The value of zzso for elimination of minimal residual disease in acute zzso after zzso bone zzso transplantation or as consolidation of complete response will have to be zzso The present paper reviews clinical studies with zzso in zzso and its significance for therapeutic zzso
