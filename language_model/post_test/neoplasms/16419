The present review describes a hypothesis for a critical role of cell adhesive interactions in zzso zzso of tissue zzso interactions zzso first of all local (in the zzso and then general (in whole zzso conditions for tumor zzso Otherwise imbalance of zzso zzso factor at the very beginning of zzso is considered to trigger a cascade of pathological reactions responsible for more severe adhesive disorders that are in turn critical for the zzso behavior of a tumor and its zzso of other zzso and zzso zzso zzso is likely to be the key mechanism of zzso since it is significantly associated with the main features of a zzso tissue proliferation control loss, zzso invasion, zzso and immune surveillance zzso The hypothesis is supported by zzso zzso zzso zzso and clinical arguments whose combination does not characterize any other known mechanisms of zzso The concept of zzso opens new possibilities for the diagnosis, zzso and treatment of tumors and also improves a strategy for designing new zzso
