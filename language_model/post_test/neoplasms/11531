zzso ethane zzso was the first widely used synthetic zzso and is extremely persistent in both the environment and the human zzso The introduction of zzso zzso agricultural production and has been credited with the elimination of malaria from the United States and zzso However, zzso is also known to have had major environmental consequences and has been associated with dramatic declines in many animal zzso Although zzso use has generally been restricted since the early 1970s, exposure to the zzso remains zzso In developed countries, slow elimination from the body means a large proportion of the population still have zzso levels of zzso or its zzso zzso in their serum or zzso zzso In developing countries, the zzso continues to be used for zzso control and a significant proportion of zzso babies has daily zzso above recommended zzso This review considers the zzso evidence for possible adverse effects of human exposure to zzso Much of this research is weakened by zzso zzso However, recent methods in breast cancer research using zzso studies in zzso with stored biological samples have allowed a more rigorous assessment of a putative role for zzso in disease zzso While zzso does not appear to play a zzso role in breast cancer development, there is suggestive evidence for a role in the zzso of other conditions such as pancreatic cancer, zzso dysfunction, and zzso zzso Research into these and other conditions would benefit from the same rigorous approaches used in breast cancer zzso Until further high quality evidence is available, it is still too early, even 60 years after the introduction of this once ubiquitous chemical, to pass zzso on the role of zzso in a number of common zzso
