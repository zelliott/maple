The tumor zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as potential sites of regulation by zzso including zzso zzso which may contribute to its ability to zzso cell growth and zzso Several obvious and significant motifs were found in zzso including most notably, a zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso and several potential zzso zzso zzso To examine the functional significance of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were generated with zzso at two putative zzso zzso sites zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso in zzso human zzso cells (which do not normally produce a functional zzso gene zzso resulted in a significant reduction of tumor growth in nude mice, decreased growth rate, zzso density, and colony formation in zzso as well as zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso or zzso to either zzso or zzso zzso the ability of zzso to alter growth rate, zzso density, and colony formation in zzso The ability of zzso to limit tumor growth in nude mice was markedly decreased but not zzso by zzso of zzso or zzso to zzso Thus, zzso and zzso are required for zzso to decrease tumor growth in zzso and in zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso was unable to zzso zzso zzso in zzso Thus, zzso and zzso are involved in the ability of zzso to zzso zzso and regulate tumor cell growth in zzso and in zzso
