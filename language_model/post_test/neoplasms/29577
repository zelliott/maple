zzso evidence demonstrates that zzso is an zzso and zzso marker that is frequently targeted for genetic zzso in many major forms of human zzso zzso data demonstrate that zzso is required for the transformed zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and brain cancer zzso Future studies will be required to determine whether zzso is also an zzso in the many other cancer types that also zzso zzso Studies of zzso using genetically defined models of zzso have revealed a critical role for zzso in multiple stages of zzso including tumor zzso zzso and zzso Recent studies in a genetic model of lung zzso suggest a role for zzso in transformation of lung cancer stem zzso These studies have important implications for the therapeutic use of zzso zzso a highly selective zzso signaling inhibitor currently undergoing clinical zzso zzso progress has been made in determining the molecular mechanisms by which zzso drives the transformed zzso particularly the central role played by the zzso zzso complex in transformed growth and invasion, and of several zzso survival pathways in zzso Future studies will be required to determine the composition and dynamics of the zzso complex, and the mechanisms by which zzso signaling through this complex is zzso Likewise, a better understanding of the critical downstream zzso of zzso in various human tumor types holds promise for identifying novel zzso and surrogate markers of zzso zzso activity that may be clinically useful in ongoing clinical trials of zzso
