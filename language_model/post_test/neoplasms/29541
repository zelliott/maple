The zzso plasma protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can suppress tumor zzso and growth in zzso and in zzso Mice lacking the zzso gene are viable and zzso but have an enhanced zzso resulting in decreased bleeding zzso In addition, the zzso switch is significantly enhanced in zzso zzso 

To address whether zzso zzso affects tumor development, we have crossed zzso knockout mice with the zzso zzso a well established zzso model of zzso zzso zzso zzso mice display significantly larger tumor volume compared to their zzso zzso zzso supporting a role for zzso as an zzso regulator of tumor zzso In the present study we also demonstrate that zzso zzso is increased in mice lacking zzso To address whether this elevated zzso zzso contributes to the increased pathological zzso in zzso mice, they were rendered zzso before the onset of the zzso switch by injection of the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, this treatment suppressed the increase in zzso zzso seen in zzso knockout zzso However, if zzso treatment was initiated at a later stage, after the onset of the zzso switch, no suppression of tumor growth was detected in zzso zzso 

Our data show that increased zzso zzso mediates the accelerated zzso switch in zzso zzso Moreover, we conclude that zzso play a crucial role in the early stages of tumor development but are of less significance for tumor growth once zzso has been zzso
