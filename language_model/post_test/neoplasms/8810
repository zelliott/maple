zzso zzso in zzso products and tumor zzso contributing to tumor progression manifest themselves, at least in part, by zzso zzso cellular processes that play important roles in many cell biological zzso including zzso zzso cell architecture, and primary zzso and zzso zzso zzso An essential characteristic of zzso in the performance of these varied cell processes is their ability to continuously zzso a phenomenon known as dynamic zzso It is therefore conceivable that part of the normal function of certain zzso genes is to regulate zzso dynamic zzso Here, we report the results of a high-resolution zzso zzso zzso interference screen targeting a collection of 70 human tumor zzso genes to uncover cancer genes affecting zzso dynamic zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso dynamics from zzso zzso image sequences identified the products of the tumor zzso genes zzso and zzso as potent zzso zzso Further in-depth characterization of zzso revealed that it binds to and zzso zzso through zzso of zzso turnover by lowering both rates of zzso zzso and zzso as well as by reducing the frequency of zzso zzso The latter function appears to be zzso in part, by zzso of zzso of zzso zzso on the growing zzso plus zzso
