The purpose of this paper is to update zzso research on relations between physical activity and cancer risk, including physical activity measurement and potential mechanisms of prevention of zzso 

Review of recent systematic reviews, zzso and studies on the topic that have been published in the recent zzso 

zzso zzso evidence exists that physical activity reduces colon and breast zzso The evidence is weaker for prostate zzso as zzso lung and zzso zzso zzso as zzso and insufficient for zzso at all other zzso zzso biological mechanisms for the physical zzso association include changes in hormone level, reduced percentage of body fat, enhancement of the immune system, and zzso in free radical damage by scavenger zzso The available data indicate that zzso minutes per day of zzso physical activity is needed to be protective against breast and colon zzso 

A greater understanding of the biological mechanisms operating in the physical zzso zzso complete zzso of physical activity through a zzso life, assessment of all potential zzso and association zzso are needed to confirm a protective role of physical activity in cancer development and allow specific exercise prescriptions for prevention in particular cancer zzso
