zzso zzso that bind to a tumor zzso and the T cell zzso zzso redirect zzso T zzso zzso to lyse tumor cells which have escaped normal immune recognition zzso One zzso tumor zzso the folate zzso zzso is expressed on most zzso zzso and some types of brain zzso Recently, it was shown that zzso of folate and zzso zzso are extremely potent zzso agents that target tumor cells expressing the zzso folate zzso but not normal cells expressing only the reduced folate carrier zzso In this paper, it is shown that the size of these zzso can be reduced to the smallest zzso agent yet described (30 zzso by attaching folate to a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso are as effective as zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso tumor cells by zzso The optimal folate density was in the range of zzso folate molecules per zzso or zzso zzso which yielded zzso zzso values zzso of approximately 40 zzso zzso zzso for zzso Finally, the zzso zzso could efficiently target tumor cells even in the presence of free zzso acid at zzso that are normally found in zzso Compared to conventional zzso zzso the small size of zzso zzso may prove advantageous in the ability to penetrate tumors and in reduced zzso
