The main functions of zzso hormone zzso are concerned with regulation of zzso function, and these functions are today well delineated through previous zzso zzso However, novel information of less well-known aspects of actions of this hormone is currently emerging from studies on genetically modified mouse models, with either enhanced or suppressed zzso zzso zzso zzso The novel functions of zzso include its role, in specific situations, as promoter of formation and growth of zzso and zzso zzso Chronically elevated zzso levels in transgenic zzso mice can also induce responses to this hormone in zzso zzso The knockout zzso mouse for the zzso has zzso various less well-known details in the function of zzso during zzso and adult zzso Finally, studies on zzso promoter function have revealed that the expression of this gene occurs in age, sex and zzso zzso The purpose of this brief review is to zzso some of our recent findings upon studies of zzso and zzso mice with altered function of zzso or its zzso
