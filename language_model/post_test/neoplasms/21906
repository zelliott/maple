zzso commonly zzso solid tumors, and have been implicated in the mechanism of spontaneous zzso in some zzso Conventional techniques for the quantitative zzso of zzso infiltrates in tumors rely on light zzso of zzso thin tissue zzso in which an arbitrary assessment (based on low, medium or high levels of zzso of zzso density is made by the zzso These estimates are relatively zzso and often require the opinion of a second zzso In addition, since thin tissue sections are cut, no data regarding the three-dimensional distribution of zzso can be zzso 

To overcome these problems, we have designed a method to zzso zzso zzso into tumors, using zzso laser scanning zzso of zzso zzso zzso in thick tissue zzso Using image analysis software, a threshold was applied to eliminate zzso tissue and residual zzso The total zzso volume in the scanned tissue was calculated and divided by the mean cell volume zzso by zzso ten individual zzso to obtain the cell zzso Using this method, we compared the calculated zzso counts with those obtained manually by ten laboratory zzso There was no significant difference zzso zzso zzso between the cell counts obtained by either zzso We then compared zzso zzso into seven tumors and matched zzso tissue obtained from the periphery of the zzso zzso There was a significant increase in the zzso of all zzso zzso into the tumors compared to minimal numbers in the zzso zzso 

From these results we conclude that this method may be of considerable use for the zzso of cells in zzso Furthermore, since it can be performed by laboratory technical staff, less time input is required by the pathologist in assessing the degree of zzso zzso into zzso
