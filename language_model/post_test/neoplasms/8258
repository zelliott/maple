zzso zzso is the standard therapy for zzso zzso zzso in cancer zzso The aim of our study was to evaluate the treatment of zzso by a zzso administration of zzso zzso zzso 

From zzso 1, 1997 to zzso 31, 2001 we zzso analyzed 100 episodes of zzso in 94 zzso zzso criteria were: fever zzso or zzso zzso degrees C, zzso count zzso zzso presumed short duration zzso zzso and no zzso treatment within the preceding 72 zzso Treatment consisted of 2 g daily intravenous zzso alone until zzso Success criteria were: zzso within 48 hours under zzso alone and without secondary zzso 

zzso episodes occurred in patients with performance status zzso The median duration of zzso was zzso days zzso zzso zzso of fever was: 75 of unknown origin zzso 6 clinically defined zzso and 19 zzso documented zzso Median zzso treatment duration was 5 zzso zzso response was obtained in zzso of zzso no deaths zzso Treatment efficacy differed between zzso zzso and zzso with, respectively, zzso zzso and zzso success rates zzso Treatment failure was mostly observed in patients with zzso zzso or zzso 2 zzso Among the 13 failures, 4 resolved in less than 4 days with zzso alone and 9 required additional or modified zzso zzso 

Considering the marked practical advantages of zzso alone zzso treatment with minimum side effects, zzso administration, low cost, and high response zzso this zzso regimen appears to be a valuable option in treatment of zzso in patients with solid zzso
