The phenomenon of cellular dormancy has been observed in normal adult stem cells in many different zzso such as the skin, the zzso and the zzso zzso These dormant cells have been proposed to be important for zzso zzso and for the generation of the different cellular zzso As tumor cells can share properties with normal stem cells, dormant cells might also exist within a zzso The term tumor dormancy has evolved from the clinical observation in cancer patients that zzso can occur years to decades after apparently successful treatment, suggesting that some cancer cells might resist chemotherapy and persist in a dormant zzso Several studies investigating the role of cellular dormancy in normal stem cells and in cancer hint towards a complex network involving different pools of zzso These cells might interact with each other or even zzso switch their zzso dependent upon so far unknown zzso and zzso zzso In this review, we will discuss the recent findings related to cellular dormancy in normal adult stem cells and in zzso Furthermore, the clinical relevance of dormancy and its dynamic regulation in tumor cells will be zzso
