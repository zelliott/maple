To review the recent advances in the zzso understanding of the zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We aim to highlight the current and future importance of these studies for the understanding and treatment of zzso where zzso is improperly zzso 

The analysis was conducted on published crystal structures deposited in the zzso Data Bank zzso using the program zzso 

In this review we emphasize how recent zzso zzso domain crystal structures can explain the mechanisms of zzso for zzso and other zzso zzso and compare these distinct zzso mechanisms with those recently described for the zzso zzso We suggest an zzso mechanism for the poor efficacy of zzso against tumors with zzso zzso zzso domain point zzso compared with the efficacy of zzso and zzso and demonstrate how structural insights help our understanding of acquired resistance to these zzso We also highlight how these new zzso structural data are expected to affect the development of zzso targeted small zzso zzso zzso 

There are now more crystal structures published for the zzso domain than for any other zzso This wealth of zzso information is beginning to describe the mechanisms by which proper regulation of zzso is lost in zzso These crystal structures are beginning to show how small molecules inhibit zzso activity and will aid development of zzso zzso targeted zzso
