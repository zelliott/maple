zzso zzso may have a protective role in acute liver disease but a zzso effect in chronic liver zzso It is unknown whether zzso is associated with risk of zzso mortality in zzso 

To determine if zzso is associated with an increased risk of zzso cardiovascular disease zzso cancer, and zzso zzso 

A prospective cohort study included zzso participants who attended a research visit in zzso Multiple zzso were zzso including serum zzso zzso Cox zzso hazards zzso analyses were used to examine the association between serum zzso as a continuous zzso zzso variable with zzso zzso cancer, and zzso zzso Patients with prevalent zzso cancer and liver disease were excluded for zzso zzso 

The mean zzso standard zzso age and zzso zzso of participants was 68 zzso zzso years and 25 zzso zzso zzso zzso During the zzso zzso of zzso the cumulative zzso zzso cancer, and zzso mortality were zzso (N zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The median zzso zzso length of follow-up was zzso zzso zzso zzso In multivariable zzso adjusted for age, sex, alcohol, zzso diabetes, hypertension, total cholesterol, zzso and smoking, zzso zzso in zzso serum zzso was associated with increased risk of zzso zzso cancer, and zzso zzso with hazard ratios of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adjustment attenuated the effects but the association between zzso and zzso and zzso mortality remained statistically zzso independent of zzso zzso 

In zzso older adults, serum zzso is associated with zzso zzso cancer, and zzso zzso
