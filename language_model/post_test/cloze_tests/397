zzso of zzso has been considered to be a reflection of the zzso genetic and cellular aberrations present in tumor zzso Recent studies have suggested that zzso elements can also contribute to the zzso zzso of cancer, and that zzso may be important in this zzso zzso therefore, undertook a study to evaluate the effects of depletion of functional zzso on the zzso zzso Brain and breast tumor cells were depleted of zzso DNA zzso by treatment with zzso zzso These zzso zzso cells showed a distinct change in the zzso zzso including loss of ability to grow in an zzso fashion and, interestingly, a substantial increase in sensitivity to zzso drugs zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso was accomplished with transfer of normal zzso into the diminished zzso zzso zzso No changes in expression of the zzso genes zzso and zzso nor the drug resistance genes zzso zzso or zzso was found in any of the cell types zzso zzso zzso or zzso Further, the type of cell death remained the same, zzso cells with and without zzso underwent zzso in response to exposure to zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso DNA play a direct role in modulating aspects of the zzso zzso although they are not necessarily a sine zzso non for zzso cell zzso This is particularly interesting because most tumor zzso are more dependent upon zzso for energy production, rather than zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells will be useful to study the zzso processes involved in zzso
