Mobile elements that use reverse transcriptase to make new copies of themselves are found in all major lineages of zzso The zzso terminal repeat zzso retrotransposons have been suggested to be the oldest of these eukaryotic zzso Phylogenetic analysis of zzso elements suggests that they have predominantly undergone vertical zzso as opposed to the frequent horizontal transmissions found for other mobile zzso One prediction of this vertical model of inheritance is that the oldest lineages of eukaryotes should exclusively harbor the oldest lineages of zzso zzso Here we characterize the zzso retrotransposons present in one of the most primitive zzso the zzso Giardia zzso Two families of elements were detected in the WB isolate of zzso lamblia currently being used for the genome sequencing zzso These elements are clearly distinct from all other previously described zzso zzso Phylogenetic analysis indicates that these zzso elements zzso Giardia early zzso insertion zzso are among the oldest known lineages of zzso elements consistent with strict vertical zzso zzso elements encode a single open reading frame with a carboxyl terminal endonuclease zzso zzso 1 is site zzso as seven to eight copies are present in a single tandem array of a zzso repeat near the telomere of one zzso The function of this repeat is not zzso One zzso highly zzso element within the zzso 1 lineage is not located in this tandem array but is near a second zzso Four different telomere addition sites could be identified within or near the zzso elements on each of these zzso The second lineage of zzso zzso zzso zzso is composed of about 10 degenerate zzso zzso 2 elements do not appear to be site specific in their zzso An unusual aspect of zzso 2 is that all copies contain inverted repeats up to 172 bp in zzso
