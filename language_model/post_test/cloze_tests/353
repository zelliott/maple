Mobile elements that use reverse zzso to make new copies of themselves are found in all major lineages of zzso The zzso terminal repeat zzso zzso have been suggested to be the oldest of these zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso elements suggests that they have predominantly undergone vertical transmission, as opposed to the frequent horizontal transmissions found for other mobile zzso One prediction of this vertical model of inheritance is that the oldest lineages of zzso should exclusively harbor the oldest lineages of zzso zzso Here we characterize the zzso zzso present in one of the most primitive zzso the zzso zzso zzso Two families of elements were detected in the zzso isolate of zzso zzso currently being used for the zzso sequencing zzso These elements are clearly distinct from all other previously described zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that these zzso elements (for zzso early zzso zzso zzso are among the oldest known lineages of zzso elements consistent with strict vertical zzso zzso elements zzso a single open reading frame with a zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso 1 is site specific, as seven to eight copies are present in a single tandem array of a zzso repeat near the zzso of one zzso The function of this repeat is not zzso One zzso highly zzso element within the zzso 1 lineage is not located in this tandem array but is near a second zzso Four different zzso addition sites could be identified within or near the zzso elements on each of these zzso The second lineage of zzso zzso zzso 2, is composed of about 10 zzso zzso zzso 2 elements do not appear to be site specific in their zzso An unusual aspect of zzso 2 is that all copies contain zzso repeats up to zzso zzso in zzso
