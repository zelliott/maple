Limited data suggest that people with the metabolic syndrome have lower intakes or circulating concentrations of magnesium than those who do not have the zzso The aim of this study was to examine the associations between dietary intake of magnesium and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in a nationally representative sample of zzso zzso 

We used data for zzso zzso or zzso years of age of the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey zzso to zzso The metabolic syndrome was defined using the criteria of the National Cholesterol Education zzso zzso intake was determined from a single dietary zzso zzso 

The unadjusted zzso of the metabolic syndrome were zzso zzso of lowest magnesium zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for increasing quintiles of magnesium intake zzso for trend zzso zzso After multiple zzso the odds ratios for the second through the fifth quintiles zzso zzso of magnesium intake among all participants included in the analysis were zzso zzso confidence interval zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso for trend zzso zzso The associations were similar for men and zzso 

Our results showing an inverse association between dietary magnesium intake and the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome add to the evidence that adequate magnesium intake or a diet rich in magnesium may be important for maintaining good zzso zzso
