We have undertaken a functional analysis of the odorant receptor repertoire in the Drosophila zzso Each receptor was expressed in a mutant olfactory receptor neuron zzso used as a zzso and the odor response spectrum zzso by the receptor was determined in vivo by electrophysiological zzso The spectra of these receptors were then matched to those of defined zzso to establish a zzso zzso In addition to the odor response zzso the receptors dictate the signaling zzso zzso excitation or zzso and the response dynamics of the zzso An individual receptor can mediate both excitatory and inhibitory responses to different odorants in the same zzso suggesting a model of odorant receptor zzso Receptors vary widely in their breadth of zzso and odorants vary widely in the number of receptors they zzso zzso these properties provide a molecular basis for odor coding by the receptor repertoire of an olfactory zzso
