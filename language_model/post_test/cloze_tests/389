zzso is strongly associated with risk for metabolic zzso but there is limited prospective data concerning the impact of race on antipsychotic metabolic outcomes among patients with zzso 

This study is a post hoc analysis of data from a zzso zzso randomized trial of zzso zzso zzso zzso and olanzapine zzso zzso zzso conducted from April 2000 through June 2001 in patients zzso 18 years with acute schizophrenia according to zzso zzso The data were analyzed on the basis of racial zzso white and zzso zzso and zzso outcomes were analyzed separately for each racial cohort across zzso zzso and glucose zzso 

For white subjects zzso zzso zzso olanzapine significantly worsened all metabolic parameters except zzso lipoprotein zzso cholesterol and fasting zzso and this was significantly different than zzso for every outcome except fasting zzso In the zzso cohort zzso zzso zzso olanzapine treatment resulted in adverse metabolic zzso and these changes were significantly different from zzso for zzso total zzso and zzso zzso zzso decreased the odds of endpoint metabolic syndrome compared with olanzapine for all subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso CI zzso zzso to zzso the white cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso CI zzso zzso to zzso and zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso CI zzso zzso to zzso but the zzso result was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso zzso white subjects had significantly lower risk for metabolic zzso but there was no significant difference in metabolic syndrome between white and zzso subjects exposed to zzso 

zzso may be an important zzso of metabolic risk during atypical antipsychotic zzso zzso treatment is associated with greater effects on adiposity and lipids than zzso in both white and zzso zzso suggesting that antipsychotic choice and intensive monitoring are important in minimizing metabolic zzso especially in zzso zzso
