Race is strongly associated with risk for zzso dysfunction, but there is limited prospective data concerning the impact of race on antipsychotic zzso outcomes among patients with zzso 

This study is a post hoc analysis of data from a zzso zzso zzso trial of zzso (N zzso zzso and zzso (N zzso zzso conducted from April 2000 through June 2001 in patients zzso 18 years with acute schizophrenia according to zzso zzso The data were analyzed on the basis of racial zzso white and zzso zzso and zzso outcomes were analyzed separately for each racial cohort across weight, zzso and zzso zzso 

For white subjects (N zzso zzso zzso significantly worsened all zzso parameters except zzso zzso zzso cholesterol and zzso zzso and this was significantly different than zzso for every outcome except zzso zzso In the zzso cohort (N zzso zzso zzso treatment resulted in adverse zzso zzso and these changes were significantly different from zzso for zzso total cholesterol, and zzso zzso zzso decreased the odds of zzso zzso syndrome compared with zzso for all subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso the white cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso but the zzso result was not statistically significant zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso group, white subjects had significantly lower risk for zzso syndrome, but there was no significant difference in zzso syndrome between white and zzso subjects exposed to zzso 

Race may be an important zzso of zzso risk during zzso antipsychotic zzso zzso treatment is associated with greater effects on zzso and lipids than zzso in both white and zzso subjects, suggesting that antipsychotic choice and intensive monitoring are important in minimizing zzso risk, especially in nonwhite zzso
