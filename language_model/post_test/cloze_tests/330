Although the development of gene delivery systems via zzso methods is advancing zzso it remains a challenge to deliver plasmids into zzso zzso such as zzso zzso To develop an efficient transfection zzso we formulated a simple zzso by incorporating poly zzso ester zzso polymers with plasmid DNAs containing a GFP reporter zzso The formed zzso zzso are approximately 200nm in diameter and stable under physiological zzso but become rapidly biodegradable when pH decreases zzso zzso zzso cells were used for transfection assays and resultant gene delivery rates were determined by quantifying GFP zzso Exposure of cells to the zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso resulted in GFP expression in zzso of zzso similar to that mediated by the standard zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso the zzso could achieve GFP expression in up to zzso of zzso zzso an zzso increase over that mediated by zzso These findings demonstrated a zzso efficient method for in vitro gene delivery into zzso zzso The zzso are biodegradable and have minimal zzso suggesting the potential use for in vivo gene zzso
