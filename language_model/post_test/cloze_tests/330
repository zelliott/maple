Although the development of gene delivery systems via zzso methods is advancing zzso it remains a challenge to deliver plasmids into zzso cells, such as zzso zzso To develop an efficient zzso method, we formulated a simple zzso by incorporating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso containing a zzso reporter zzso The formed zzso zzso are approximately zzso in diameter and stable under zzso conditions, but become rapidly zzso when pH decreases zzso zzso zzso cells were used for zzso zzso and zzso gene delivery rates were determined by zzso zzso zzso Exposure of cells to the zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso expression in zzso of cells, similar to that zzso by the standard zzso zzso However, with zzso zzso the zzso could achieve zzso expression in up to zzso of zzso cells, an zzso increase over that zzso by zzso These findings demonstrated a simple, efficient method for in zzso gene delivery into zzso zzso The zzso are zzso and have minimal zzso suggesting the potential use for in zzso gene zzso
