zzso zzso activator protein for zzso functions in priming zzso vesicle zzso but the regulation of zzso activity has not been zzso Here we show that phosphorylation by protein kinase zzso is required for zzso zzso zzso eliminated zzso activity in zzso zzso vesicle exocytosis in zzso and intact zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso were identified by mass spectrometry as the major phosphorylation sites in the zzso residue zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso to Ala substitutions abolished zzso zzso Protein kinase zzso phosphorylated zzso in vitro at these sites and restored the activity of dephosphorylated zzso zzso is the likely in vivo zzso protein kinase based on inhibition of phosphorylation by zzso in zzso cells and by the identity of in vivo and in vitro phosphorylation zzso zzso phosphorylation by zzso was zzso but the elevation of zzso in zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso zzso which terminates zzso zzso These results identify a functionally important zzso phosphorylation site that regulates zzso activity in priming vesicle zzso
