Cardiovascular diseases are a leading cause of death in the majority of zzso as well as in many developing zzso The aim of this study was to determine cardiovascular risk factors in student population and to suggest possible measures for zzso 

The study was carried out during zzso at the School of zzso University of zzso It included zzso students in their final year zzso zzso 604 zzso 

There was no significant difference in prevalence of hypertension among the male zzso and female students zzso The prevalence of obesity zzso Mass Index zzso zzso 30 zzso was significantly higher zzso zzso in the male zzso than in the female population zzso Abdominal obesity was also more frequently encountered zzso zzso in the male zzso than in female population zzso Every fourth student smoked zzso with no significant difference between the male and female zzso Alcohol consumption was a significantly higher problem zzso zzso in the male population zzso than in the female one zzso Physical inactivity was more often found zzso zzso in the female students zzso than in male ones zzso By the bivariate correlation of cardiovascular risk zzso it was determined that in the male student population systolic blood pressure correlated significantly with diastolic blood zzso BMI and waist zzso whereas age correlated with zzso blood zzso waist size and zzso In the female students zzso blood pressure correlated with diastolic blood zzso BMI and waist zzso diastolic blood pressure correlated with BMI and physical zzso cigarette smoking correlated with alcohol consumption and zzso 

Cardiovascular risk factors are present in the zzso students of the School of zzso University of zzso It is necessary to zzso on decreasing obesity zzso cigarette and alcohol zzso and on increasing physical activity of students in order to prevent cardiovascular zzso
