zzso diseases are a leading cause of death in the majority of developed, as well as in many developing zzso The aim of this study was to determine cardiovascular risk factors in student population and to suggest possible measures for zzso 

The study was carried out during zzso at the School of Medicine, University of zzso It included zzso students in their final year zzso zzso zzso zzso 

There was no significant difference in prevalence of hypertension among the male zzso and female students zzso The prevalence of obesity zzso Mass Index - zzso 30 zzso was significantly higher zzso zzso in the male zzso than in the female population zzso zzso obesity was also more frequently encountered zzso zzso in the male zzso than in female population zzso Every fourth student smoked cigarettes with no significant difference between the male and female zzso Alcohol consumption was a significantly higher problem zzso zzso in the male population zzso than in the female one zzso Physical zzso was more often found zzso zzso in the female students zzso than in male ones zzso By the zzso correlation of cardiovascular risk factors, it was determined that in the male student population zzso blood pressure correlated significantly with zzso blood pressure, zzso and waist size, whereas age correlated with zzso blood pressure, waist size and zzso In the female students zzso blood pressure correlated with zzso blood pressure, zzso and waist size; zzso blood pressure correlated with zzso and physical zzso cigarette smoking correlated with alcohol consumption and zzso 

zzso risk factors are present in the zzso students of the School of Medicine, University of zzso It is necessary to insist on decreasing obesity zzso cigarette and alcohol consumption, and on increasing physical activity of students in order to prevent cardiovascular zzso
