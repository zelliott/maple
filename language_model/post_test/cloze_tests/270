MTT zzso zzso method is one of the most widely used methods to analyze cell proliferation and zzso It is taken up through zzso and is reduced by mitochondrial enzymes as well as zzso zzso then is transported to cell surfaces to form zzso MTT zzso however the effect of MTT itself still remains zzso Our objective was to investigate the direct effects of MTT on in vitro zzso zzso Results showed that the zzso of MTT did not cause obvious lesion and induce cell zzso but the metabolism and exocytosis of MTT could dramatically damage zzso Our results also indicated that MTT could activate apoptosis related factors such as zzso zzso or accelerate the leakage of cell contents after the appearance of MTT zzso zzso The present data suggest MTT method should be carefully zzso otherwise the cell viability would be underestimated and zzso
