The mu opioid receptor zzso is expressed in the central nervous system and specific cell lines with varying expression levels perhaps playing important zzso One of the zzso transcription zzso zzso zzso factor zzso has been shown to zzso the expression of zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso we showed here that the zzso zzso element zzso of zzso functions as a critical regulator to zzso the zzso gene expression in specific neuronal cells depending on zzso expression zzso Using zzso zzso we showed that the zzso of the zzso promoter is functional in zzso cells zzso and zzso but not in zzso cells zzso zzso binds to the zzso of the zzso gene in a zzso manner confirmed by zzso and chromatin immunoprecipitation zzso zzso The suppression of zzso activity with either zzso A or a zzso zzso induced zzso promoter activity and transcription of the zzso zzso When the zzso was disrupted in zzso and zzso cells using small interfering zzso the transcription of the endogenous target zzso gene increased zzso This provides direct evidence the role of zzso in the cells and also indicates that zzso expression is regulated by zzso modification in neuronal zzso zzso Our data suggested that zzso can function as a repressor of zzso transcription in specific zzso via a mechanism dependent on the zzso zzso
