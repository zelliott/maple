To determine the types of subcutaneous adiposity represented by different measurements of skinfold thickness that are associated with birth weight in white zzso Black zzso and Hispanic zzso American children aged zzso zzso We also determined the contribution of birth weight to ethnic differences in subcutaneous and central zzso 

Data for this analysis were from the Third US National Health and Nutrition Examination zzso The outcome measures were zzso zzso zzso and thigh skinfold thicknesses at zzso y of zzso Central adiposity was defined as ratios of zzso to triceps zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Partial correlation analyses were used to determine the association between birth weight and measures of subcutaneous zzso while multiple linear regression analyses were used to determine the independent contribution of birth weight to ethnicity variations in subcutaneous and central adiposity adjusting for zzso age and zzso 

zzso birth weight was negatively associated with zzso skinfold and central adiposity in zzso Black and Hispanic American children zzso zzso zzso weight was also negatively associated with zzso skinfold in both Blacks and Hispanics zzso zzso and with sum of the four zzso in Blacks zzso zzso Compared with zzso Black ethnicity was negatively associated with zzso zzso thigh and sum of skinfold thicknesses controlling for birth zzso zzso age and BMI zzso zzso Compared with zzso Hispanic ethnicity was negatively associated with zzso thigh and sum of skinfold thicknesses zzso zzso Both Black and Hispanic ethnicity was positively associated with STR and CPR zzso zzso 

In this population of American zzso the association of birth weights with subcutaneous and central fat accumulation may be due to fetal zzso Since the impact of fetal conditions is likely to be modified by life zzso defining the interaction between factors that are present at birth and subsequent exposures is one of the essential challenges for future zzso
