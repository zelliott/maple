The main objective of this study was to investigate the relation between brain zzso peptide zzso levels within the first 96 hours after zzso elevation acute myocardial infarction zzso and the development of left ventricular zzso dilatation at zzso zzso zzso patients with first zzso reperfused within 12 hours of symptom zzso were prospectively zzso Plasma zzso was determined on admission and at zzso and zzso zzso Clinically significant LV zzso defined as a zzso increase in LV zzso volume at zzso zzso was assessed using echocardiography and cardiac magnetic zzso zzso percent of patients developed clinically significant LV zzso zzso values on admission and at zzso were significantly higher in patients who developed clinically significant LV dilatation at 6 months zzso zzso 117 vs 106 zzso 91 zzso After adjusting for zzso infarct zzso zzso deceleration zzso and the LV ejection zzso zzso on admission was an independent predictor of LV zzso whether assessed by echocardiography zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso or cardiac magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In zzso high zzso levels on admission and at zzso predict LV dilatation after zzso The early determination of plasma zzso upon admission for STEMI could be helpful in identifying patients at higher risk for LV zzso in whom aggressive management is zzso
