To zzso and characterize the colorectal zzso antigen from cultured colorectal cancer zzso 

The colorectal cancer cell lines that highly expressed the associated antigen were selected by flow cytometry with five specific monoclonal antibodies zzso zzso Western blot was used to determine the binding ability of five mAbs to the associated antigens released from colorectal cells zzso with single or zzso zzso The mAb with highest binding ability was employed as the ligand for the zzso zzso The antigens purified through zzso chromatography were identified by Western zzso 

The associated antigens were highly expressed on the colorectal cancer cell lines zzso The binding ability of mAb zzso to the antigen was higher than that of zzso zzso The purified associated antigen binding to mAb zzso was a heterodimer composed of two subunits with relative molecular mass zzso of 60 x zzso and 70 x zzso zzso 

The purified zzso binding to mAb zzso was obtained from the colorectal cancer cell line zzso through zzso chromatography with mAb zzso
