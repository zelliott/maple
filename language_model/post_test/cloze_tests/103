The zzso junction zzso has been defined as an anatomical sphincter with particular physiological behavior that regulates sigmoid and rectum zzso Its function in clinical zzso such as zzso disease has been zzso The aim of our study is to identify the zzso and to compare the morphometric and dynamic features of the zzso between patients with zzso disease and healthy subjects using zzso 

Sixteen zzso eight with uncomplicated zzso disease and eight healthy zzso were studied using zzso to identify the zzso and to compare the morphometric and dynamic features zzso 

In each subject zzso zzso was able to identify the zzso This resulted in the identification of a discrete anatomical entity with a mean length of zzso located in front of the first sacral vertebra zzso and at a mean distance of zzso from the anal zzso with a mean wall thickness of zzso significantly different from the sigmoid and rectal parietal zzso The zzso wall was significantly zzso in patients with zzso disease than the controls zzso showing a unique shape and behavior in dynamic zzso 

Our findings support the hypothesis that zzso plays a critical role in patients with symptomatic zzso zzso further investigation may clarify whether specific zzso zzso such as zzso would predict inflammatory complications of this diffuse and zzso zzso
