zzso is a zzso zzso technique that generates thin slices separated one to the other by typically 1 zzso from source data zzso The relatively high image noise in these thin slices raises the value of zzso thick slices zzso from the set of reconstructed slices for image zzso In an initial zzso we investigated the potential of different zzso for generating thick slices from zzso source data zzso intensity zzso average zzso and image generation by means of a new algorithm, so-called zzso The three zzso techniques were evaluated using a homogeneous phantom with one zzso slab with a total thickness of about 5 zzso in which two zzso zzso contained objects to simulate zzso zzso masses, and round zzso The phantom was examined by zzso zzso zzso zzso were simulated by inclusion of calcium particles of four different zzso The zzso containing the inclusions were examined in two different zzso adjacent to each other and close to the detector and with the two zzso separated by two zzso thick breast equivalent material zzso The reconstructed zzso slices were zzso using zzso zzso and zzso to generate zzso thick slices with a lower noise zzso The three zzso zzso were assessed by calculating the resulting contrast versus background for the simulated zzso and zzso ratios zzso for the other zzso The zzso of the simulated round and zzso masses were most favorable for the thick slices generated with the average algorithm, followed by zzso and zzso zzso of the simulated zzso was best for zzso followed by zzso and average zzso Our results suggest that the additional generation of thick slices may improve the zzso of objects in zzso This improvement differs from the different zzso for zzso speculated objects, and round zzso zzso is a new approach combining features of zzso and average showing image properties in between zzso and zzso
