Tomosynthesis is a zzso mammography technique that generates thin slices separated one to the other by typically 1 mm from source data zzso The relatively high image noise in these thin slices raises the value of zzso thick slices computed from the set of reconstructed slices for image zzso In an initial zzso we investigated the potential of different algorithms for generating thick slices from tomosynthesis source data zzso intensity zzso average zzso and image generation by means of a new zzso zzso zzso The three postprocessing techniques were evaluated using a homogeneous phantom with one textured slab with a total thickness of about 5 cm in which two zzso slabs contained objects to simulate zzso spiculated zzso and round zzso The phantom was examined by tomosynthesis zzso zzso zzso were simulated by inclusion of calcium particles of four different zzso The slabs containing the inclusions were examined in two different zzso adjacent to each other and close to the detector and with the two slabs separated by two zzso thick breast equivalent material zzso The reconstructed tomosynthesis slices were postprocessed using zzso zzso and zzso to generate zzso thick slices with a lower noise zzso The three postprocessing algorithms were assessed by calculating the resulting contrast versus background for the simulated microcalcifications and zzso ratios zzso for the other zzso The CNRs of the simulated round and spiculated masses were most favorable for the thick slices generated with the average zzso followed by zzso and zzso Contrast of the simulated microcalcifications was best for zzso followed by zzso and average zzso Our results suggest that the additional generation of thick slices may improve the visualization of objects in zzso This improvement differs from the different algorithms for zzso speculated zzso and round zzso zzso is a new approach combining features of MIP and average showing image properties in between MIP and zzso
