Recent clinical studies revealed that positive results of cell transplantation on cardiac function are limited to the zzso and zzso restoration phase following myocardial infarction zzso emphasizing the need for zzso zzso These transient effects may depend on the transplanted zzso or its differentiation zzso We have identified a population of zzso progenitor cells zzso capable of differentiating efficiently into zzso zzso endothelial zzso and smooth muscle cells in zzso We investigated whether zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso are able to restore the injured myocardium after MI in zzso 

MI was induced in immunodeficient mice and was followed by zzso injection of zzso zzso or zzso Cardiac function was measured longitudinally up to 3 months zzso using zzso Tesla magnetic resonance zzso The fate of the human cells was determined by zzso Transplantation of zzso or zzso resulted in a higher ejection fraction and reduced the extent of left ventricular remodelling up to 3 months after MI when compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso generated new cardiac tissue consisting of human zzso and blood zzso Fusion of human nuclei with murine nuclei was not zzso 

zzso differentiated into the same cell types in situ as can be obtained in zzso This zzso the need for in vitro zzso making zzso a promising source for zzso zzso zzso
