zzso and cholesterol in zzso have long been associated with breast cancer zzso onset and zzso zzso the causative effects of elevated lipid levels and breast cancer remain largely zzso and were the subject of the present zzso took advantage of zzso in vitro and in vivo models of cholesterol enrichment to exploit the mechanism involved in zzso zzso BC growth and zzso We analyzed its effects in models that mimic different BC subtypes and zzso data show that zzso zzso not zzso promotes BC cells zzso migration and loss of zzso hallmarks of the epithelial to mesenchymal zzso In vivo studies modeling cholesterol levels showed that breast tumors are consistently larger and more proliferative in zzso zzso which also have more frequently lung zzso Microarray analysis revealed an over expression of intermediates of Akt and zzso pathways suggesting a survival response induced by zzso confirmed by WB zzso Gene expression analysis also evidenced an activation of zzso signaling pathway and decreased expression of adhesion molecules zzso family zzso zzso zzso 7 and zzso in the cells exposed to zzso the present work shows novel mechanistic evidence that high zzso levels promote BC zzso These data provide rationale for the clinical control of cholesterol levels in BC zzso
