Human zzso deacetylase zzso can zzso clinical drugs such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso but the role of glycosylation remains zzso In the present zzso we investigated the effect of glycosylation on zzso enzyme zzso zzso analysis of mutant zzso that contained an zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso substitution at either residue 78 or 282 zzso or zzso showed a different migration compared with the zzso zzso A mutant zzso that contained N to Q substitutions at both residue 78 and 282 zzso showed a similar migration to zzso in human liver microsomes zzso treated with zzso H zzso zzso which produces zzso zzso This result indicated that zzso was glycosylated at both zzso and zzso zzso types of zzso with the zzso and the zzso substitutions showed dramatically lower zzso hydrolase activity than did the zzso zzso The treatment of zzso zzso zzso cells with zzso which produces zzso zzso decreased zzso enzyme zzso zzso the treatment of the zzso with zzso H caused no decrease of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso per zzso was not important for zzso activity in the mature zzso The mutant types of zzso containing the zzso and the zzso substitutions were not detected by zzso analysis after zzso zzso suggesting that the glycosylation of zzso at zzso was important for proper protein zzso zzso this study found that the zzso but not zzso zzso of zzso plays a crucial role in regulating zzso enzyme zzso
