We have isolated the embryonic lethal gene zzso zzso as a suppressor of the zzso eye zzso Analysis of clones mutant for zzso during eye development shows that it is autonomously required for photoreceptor zzso zzso cells are recruited into developing zzso and initiate neural zzso but they fail to properly differentiate as zzso Molecular analysis reveals that the zzso locus is large and zzso giving rise to multiple different proteins with common zzso sequences but different zzso zzso zzso proteins are nuclear and share a zzso zzso motif which is also found in the zzso family of proteins and is highly conserved in vertebrates and zzso Functional analysis of zzso the observation that it also zzso suppresses the zzso zzso phenotype and the phenotypic similarity to mutants in the zzso glass gene suggest that zzso is a general factor required for photoreceptor zzso
