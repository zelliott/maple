Fusion of mammalian cells to form zzso zzso zzso results in nuclear reprogramming without the exchange of genetic zzso In this zzso we show that reprogramming in somatic cell zzso involves activation of the canonical skeletal muscle transcription factors as well as zzso zzso zzso the effect of zzso formation on gene expression is to induce a zzso of zzso zzso formed with a relatively refractory cell zzso the zzso cell line zzso revealed the importance of both zzso expression and other unidentified cytoplasmic zzso neither of which are sufficient for efficient muscle gene zzso but are zzso We provide evidence that zzso by transient histone deacetylase inhibition can induce zzso expression and increase the extent and efficiency of muscle gene zzso Taken zzso the results suggest that understanding the mechanistic zzso using a combination of zzso and taking into account cell zzso will facilitate an increase in the efficiency and fidelity of conversion from one differentiated phenotype to another desired cell zzso Inherent advantages of the zzso system merit further investigation in the pursuit of directed zzso
