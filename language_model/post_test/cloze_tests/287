Vascular endothelial growth factor zzso and its homolog zzso influence zzso through activation of VEGF receptor 3 zzso and have been implicated in lymphatic tumor zzso zzso dissemination of gastric adenocarcinomas critically determines clinical outcome and therapeutic options of affected zzso zzso we analyzed expression and prognostic significance of zzso along with zzso and zzso in gastric zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed in 91 zzso primary gastric zzso corresponding noncancerous gastric zzso and lymph node metastases employing immunohistochemistry zzso in situ zzso Blood and lymph vessel densities were assessed after staining with zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were detected in zzso and zzso of gastric zzso zzso Healthy gastric mucosa was negative for zzso and in zzso positive for zzso Presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was correlated with lymphatic metastases and decreased survival zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso was correlated with reduced zzso survival zzso zzso zzso and Cox multivariate regression analysis qualified zzso and zzso but not zzso as independent prognostic zzso In lymph zzso gastric zzso presence of zzso was associated with poor zzso whereas absence of zzso defined a subgroup of patients with clearly favorable zzso 

zzso and zzso are novel independent prognostic marker molecules aiding to identify patients with poor prognosis after curative resection of gastric zzso Combined analysis of the zzso system can be useful to identify patients with unfavorable clinical outcome and thereby may help to refine therapeutic decisions in gastric zzso
