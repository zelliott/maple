Tissue factor pathway zzso zzso has been identified as a tumor suppressor gene in several types of zzso but its role in gallbladder carcinoma zzso is yet to be zzso In the present zzso zzso expression in zzso tissues was zzso and its inhibitory activities against zzso growth were evaluated in vitro and in vivo after zzso gene transfer of zzso zzso was constructed to restore the expression of zzso in zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and xenograft zzso Immunohistochemical staining showed that zzso was significantly downregulated in zzso tissue zzso zzso could significantly inhibit zzso growth both in vitro and in zzso Apoptosis analysis and western zzso assay demonstrated that zzso could induce the apoptosis of both zzso cell lines and tissues by promoting the activities of cytochrome zzso zzso zzso and zzso and suppressing zzso zzso These data indicated that zzso acts as a tumor suppressor in zzso and may have a potential role in gene therapy for zzso
