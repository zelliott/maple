zzso factor zzso zzso zzso has been identified as a tumor zzso gene in several types of zzso but its role in gallbladder zzso zzso is yet to be zzso In the present study, zzso expression in zzso zzso was zzso and its zzso activities against zzso growth were evaluated in zzso and in zzso after zzso gene transfer of zzso zzso was constructed to restore the expression of zzso in zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso was significantly zzso in zzso tissue zzso zzso could significantly inhibit zzso growth both in zzso and in zzso zzso analysis and western zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso could induce the zzso of both zzso cell lines and zzso by promoting the activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso and -9 and suppressing zzso zzso These data indicated that zzso acts as a tumor zzso in zzso and may have a potential role in gene therapy for zzso
