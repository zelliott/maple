Insight into the molecular basis of zzso zzso binding to its zzso has come from zzso zzso and zzso labeling studies, with both contributing to the current hypothesis that the zzso zzso zzso within the zzso is situated adjacent to basic zzso in the second loop of the zzso Here, we refine our understanding of this region of interaction by examining a zzso series of these positions within both zzso and zzso and by performing three-dimensional molecular modeling of key pairs of modified zzso and zzso zzso The important roles of zzso and zzso were supported by the marked negative impact on binding and biological response with their natural partner zzso when the zzso zzso was replaced by zzso zzso or zzso and when the zzso zzso was replaced by basic zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments were unable to regain the lost zzso This was supported by the molecular zzso which demonstrated that the zzso double zzso could not form a good interaction without extensive zzso of zzso zzso The models further predicted that zzso and zzso zzso would lead to zzso changes in the zzso domain, and this was zzso supported by data showing that these zzso decreased zzso zzso and zzso binding and increased zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso also had increased zzso to zzso degradation relative to the zzso zzso In contrast, the relatively conservative zzso zzso had modest negative impact on zzso zzso zzso again consistent with the modeling demonstration of loss of a series of stabilizing zzso and zzso zzso The strong correlation between predicted and experimental results support the reported refinement in the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso
