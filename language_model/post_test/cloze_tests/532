To determine the zzso maximal tolerated zzso and response rates for a combined regimen of the platinum and zzso oral analogues zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso coadministered as a 14 zzso every zzso zzso 

Of 20 patients enrolled in this zzso 17 on the following dose escalation scheme were zzso for toxicity zzso zzso I zzso 300 zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso II zzso 300 zzso zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso III zzso 300 zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso 

All 17 zzso patients were zzso for zzso At dose level III zzso nausea and emesis were observed in one patient despite maximal zzso zzso zzso neurotoxicity and nephrotoxicity were not observed at the zzso dose levels examined in this zzso This observation is consistent with results seen with single agent zzso 

For zzso and zzso administered at 20 zzso and 300 zzso over 14 zzso nausea and emesis were observed as the principal zzso zzso These doses are considerably below the maximally tolerated doses of single agent zzso and zzso Shorter administration schedules should be explored in an attempt to increase the dose intensity and minimize the toxicity of this combination oral zzso
