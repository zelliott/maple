zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are members of three distinct zzso groups with characteristic host zzso Their zzso zzso genes were cloned and expressed in zzso coli as demonstrated by the zzso zzso zzso when colonies of zzso cells were zzso with a lawn of zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the cloned DNA fragments were determined and the individual zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to have varying degrees of zzso within their zzso or zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed them to be zzso genes with zzso beginning zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso and partially zzso and their individual zzso zzso When applied zzso the zzso induced rapid zzso of zzso strains from all species but generally did not affect other zzso Using zzso of zzso zzso cell walls, zzso was characterized as an zzso zzso zzso zzso and shows zzso in its zzso domain to other zzso of this zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso were shown to represent a new class of cell wall zzso zzso which cleave between the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso these were designated as zzso zzso These two zzso share zzso in the zzso domain which we propose determines zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequences are present upstream of zzso and zzso They zzso proteins of structural similarity to the product of zzso zzso gene zzso and are predicted to be membrane proteins which form pores to allow access of the zzso to their zzso zzso This arrangement of zzso zzso genes with downstream zzso genes among the zzso zzso zzso explains why the zzso zzso alone are not zzso since they require a specific transport function across the cell zzso
