T lymphocytes can be activated via the T cell receptor zzso or by triggering through a number of other surface zzso including the zzso zzso zzso Signaling through the zzso molecule was shown previously to be dependent on the zzso zzso zzso we show that zzso activation also functions in T cells which express zzso lacking a functional zzso zzso activation motif zzso zzso T cells that express only the transmembrane part of the zzso protein and thus lack a functional zzso zzso readily produce interleukin zzso when zzso with zzso monoclonal antibodies zzso zzso T cell zzso expressing minimal receptors consisting of an extracellular zzso and an intracellular zzso segment were effectively stimulated via zzso zzso For zzso zzso of zzso zzso two zzso zzso were sufficient to induce zzso when the zzso molecules were zzso with the chimeric zzso zzso Taken zzso our results show that zzso signaling does not necessarily employ the zzso in zzso cells and that zzso zzso in zzso cells can be mediated via two functional zzso zzso
