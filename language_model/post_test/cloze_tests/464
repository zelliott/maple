Regulatory and signaling networks coordinate the zzso complex interactions and processes that control cellular processes zzso as metabolism and cell zzso coordinate response to the zzso and carry out multiple cell decisions zzso as development and quorum zzso Regulatory network inference is the process of inferring these zzso traditionally from microarray data but increasingly incorporating other measurement types such as zzso zzso zzso and mass zzso We discuss existing techniques for network zzso We review in detail our zzso which consists of an initial biclustering zzso designed to estimate zzso zzso a network inference zzso designed to select and parameterize likely regulatory models for the control of the zzso groups from the biclustering zzso and a visualization and analysis zzso designed to find and communicate key features of the zzso Learning biological networks from even the most complete data sets is zzso we argue that integrating new data types into the inference pipeline produces networks of increased zzso zzso and biological zzso
