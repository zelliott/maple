To determine the types of subcutaneous zzso represented by different zzso of zzso thickness that are associated with birth weight in white zzso Black zzso and Hispanic zzso American children aged 5-11 zzso We also determined the contribution of birth weight to ethnic differences in subcutaneous and central zzso 

Data for this analysis were from the Third US National Health and Nutrition zzso zzso The outcome measures were zzso zzso zzso and thigh zzso thicknesses at 5-11 y of zzso Central zzso was defined as ratios of zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlation analyses were used to determine the association between birth weight and measures of subcutaneous zzso while multiple linear zzso analyses were used to determine the independent contribution of birth weight to ethnicity variations in subcutaneous and central zzso adjusting for sex, age and zzso 

Overall, birth weight was zzso associated with zzso zzso and central zzso in White, Black and Hispanic American children zzso zzso Birth weight was also zzso associated with zzso zzso in both zzso and Hispanics zzso zzso and with sum of the four zzso in zzso zzso zzso Compared with White, Black ethnicity was zzso associated with zzso zzso thigh and sum of zzso thicknesses controlling for birth weight, sex, age and zzso zzso zzso Compared with White, Hispanic ethnicity was zzso associated with zzso thigh and sum of zzso thicknesses zzso zzso Both Black and Hispanic ethnicity was positively associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

In this population of American children, the association of birth weights with subcutaneous and central fat zzso may be due to fetal zzso Since the impact of fetal conditions is likely to be modified by life course, defining the interaction between factors that are present at birth and subsequent zzso is one of the essential challenges for future zzso
