zzso breast cancer comprises zzso of all breast zzso Mutations in two zzso susceptibility zzso BRCA1 and zzso along with rare zzso genes and common zzso alleles zzso altogether explain no more than zzso of the zzso breast cancer zzso although the majority of cases are zzso for and are designated as zzso zzso Micro RNAs have called great attention for classification of different cancer types and have been implicated in a range of important biological processes and are deregulated in cancer zzso 

Here we have performed an exploratory zzso study of miRNA expression profiles in a large series of 66 primary hereditary breast tumours by microarray zzso 

Unsupervised clustering analysis of miRNA molecular profiles revealed distinct subgroups of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These findings introduce a new insight in the biology of hereditary breast zzso defining specific zzso zzso which could help in the search for novel susceptibility pathways in hereditary breast zzso 

Our data demonstrate that zzso hereditary breast tumours can be zzso into four previously unknown homogenous groups characterised by specific miRNA expression signatures and histopathological zzso
