One enduring question in evolutionary biology is the extent of archaic zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso In this paper, we present a test for ancient zzso that exploits the asymmetry in the zzso of the two zzso gene trees in a zzso zzso This test was first applied to detect zzso between zzso and modern zzso We derive the zzso expectation of a test zzso called the D zzso which is sensitive to asymmetry under alternative demographic zzso We show that the D statistic is insensitive to some demographic assumptions such as ancestral population sizes and requires only the assumption that the ancestral populations were randomly zzso An important aspect of D statistics is that they can be used to detect archaic zzso even when no archaic sample is zzso We explore the effect of sequencing error on the zzso rate of the test for zzso and we show how to estimate the proportion of archaic ancestry in the zzso of zzso zzso We also investigate a model of subdivision in ancestral populations that can result in D statistics that indicate recent zzso
