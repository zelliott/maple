To determine the incidence of bilateral endolymphatic sac tumors in von zzso syndrome and to describe the technique and results of hearing preservation surgery for small endolymphatic sac tumors in a series of patients with von zzso zzso 

Analysis of the literature to determine the incidence of bilateral endolymphatic sac tumors and a retrospective case review of hearing preservation surgery for removal of small endolymphatic sac tumors in four patients with von zzso zzso 

Tertiary care academic medical zzso 

Four patients with von zzso syndrome zzso with bilateral endolymphatic sac zzso and progressive sensorineural hearing loss in which preoperative imaging studies revealed in situ or small endolymphatic sac tumors without ipsilateral zzso zzso 

All four patients had complete surgical zzso of the endolymphatic sac tumor via one of three surgical approaches with the goal of hearing zzso One patient had bilateral zzso 

zzso and zzso 

Nearly zzso zzso of patients with von zzso syndrome and endolymphatic sac tumors have bilateral zzso All four patients zzso zzso maintained zzso hearing postoperatively after surgical excision of the endolymphatic sac tumor via a variety of approach zzso 

The discovery of a small or in situ endolymphatic sac tumor affords the patient the option of surgical removal with hearing zzso This is critical in the patient with von zzso syndrome who is at risk for bilateral disease and complete bilateral zzso if tumor growth zzso
