zzso a zzso gene that zzso for a zzso zzso is mutated in the zzso of patients affected with the zzso syndrome zzso which have an increased incidence of several cancers including zzso pancreatic and lung zzso Regarding tumors arising in zzso zzso we recently observed that at least zzso of lung adenocarcinomas zzso harbor somatic zzso gene zzso supporting a role for zzso in the origin of some sporadic zzso To characterize the pattern of zzso mutations in zzso zzso we first screened for zzso gene alterations zzso zzso promoter zzso and homozygous zzso in 19 zzso zzso in agreement with our previous zzso five of them zzso were shown to harbor zzso all of which gave rise to a truncated zzso Recent reports demonstrate that zzso is able to suppress cell zzso but little is known about the specific mechanism by which it zzso To further our understanding of zzso zzso we analysed global expression in lung primary tumors using cDNA microarrays to identify zzso variations in gene zzso In zzso 34 zzso 24 of which corresponded to known zzso differed significantly between tumors with and without zzso gene zzso Among the most remarkable findings was deregulation of transcripts involved in signal transduction zzso zzso zzso and zzso cytoskeleton zzso zzso transcription factors zzso zzso zzso metabolism of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso quantitative zzso on 15 tumors confirmed the upregulation of the zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso transcripts in zzso zzso In zzso immunohistochemistry in 10 of the lung tumors showed the absence of phosphorylated zzso protein in zzso zzso indicating that zzso mutations do not lead to zzso protein kinase zzso In zzso our results reveal that several important factors contribute to zzso carcinogenesis in zzso confirming previous observations and identifying new putative pathways that should help to elucidate the biological role of zzso
