zzso a zzso gene that zzso for a zzso zzso is zzso in the zzso of patients affected with the zzso syndrome zzso which have an increased zzso of several zzso including zzso pancreatic and lung zzso Regarding tumors arising in zzso patients, we recently observed that at least one-third of lung zzso zzso harbor zzso zzso gene zzso supporting a role for zzso in the origin of some sporadic zzso To characterize the pattern of zzso zzso in zzso further, we first screened for zzso gene zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso and zzso zzso in 19 zzso and, in agreement with our previous data, five of them zzso were shown to harbor zzso all of which gave rise to a truncated zzso Recent reports demonstrate that zzso is able to suppress cell growth, but little is known about the specific mechanism by which it zzso To further our understanding of zzso function, we zzso global expression in lung primary tumors using zzso zzso to identify zzso variations in gene zzso In all, 34 zzso 24 of which corresponded to known zzso differed significantly between tumors with and without zzso gene zzso Among the most remarkable findings was deregulation of transcripts involved in signal zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors zzso zzso zzso metabolism of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso quantitative zzso on 15 tumors confirmed the zzso of the zzso zzso and of the zzso zzso transcripts in zzso zzso In addition, zzso in 10 of the lung tumors showed the absence of zzso zzso protein in zzso tumors, indicating that zzso zzso do not lead to zzso protein zzso zzso In conclusion, our results reveal that several important factors contribute to zzso zzso in zzso confirming previous observations and identifying new putative pathways that should help to zzso the biological role of zzso
