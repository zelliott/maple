In a recent zzso we presented preliminary evidence for biological activity in a Phase I zzso study zzso zzso of recombinant human zzso in patients with refractory solid zzso zzso we conducted additional biomarker analyses to correlate changes in tumor biology with zzso 

zzso tumor biopsies were obtained at baseline and after 56 days of zzso zzso Laser scanning cytometry zzso was used to quantify biomarker levels in whole tissue zzso Apoptosis in tumor cells zzso and zzso endothelial cells zzso was quantified by fluorescent zzso zzso deoxynucleotidyl zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso densities were measured by zzso vessel zzso Levels of zzso EC zzso and zzso factor zzso were determined by immunofluorescence and zzso zzso The zzso including tumor blood flow measured by positron emission zzso were analyzed using a quadratic polynomial zzso 

Significant increases in EC death and decreases in tumor zzso density were zzso with maximal effects of zzso at a dose of 249 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and 257 zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso In zzso levels of TC death were uniformly low and did not correlate with zzso zzso Maximal nuclear zzso factor zzso and minimal EC zzso levels were observed at approximately 250 zzso although the changes did not reach statistical zzso 

The data suggest that zzso had optimal biological activity at doses approximately 250 zzso in our cohort of zzso zzso failure to induce high levels of TC death may explain its lack of significant clinical activity in this Phase I zzso
