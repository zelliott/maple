In a recent study, we presented preliminary evidence for biological activity in a Phase I zzso study zzso zzso of zzso human zzso in patients with zzso solid zzso Here, we conducted additional zzso analyses to correlate changes in tumor biology with zzso 

zzso tumor zzso were obtained at baseline and after 56 days of zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso levels in whole tissue zzso zzso in tumor cells zzso and zzso zzso cells zzso was zzso by fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso zzso zzso were measured by zzso vessel zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso factor zzso were determined by zzso and zzso zzso The results, including tumor blood flow measured by zzso zzso zzso were analyzed using a zzso zzso zzso 

zzso increases in zzso death and decreases in tumor zzso density were observed, with zzso effects of zzso at a dose of zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso In contrast, levels of zzso death were zzso low and did not correlate with zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso factor zzso and minimal zzso zzso levels were observed at approximately 250 zzso although the changes did not reach statistical zzso 

The data suggest that zzso had optimal biological activity at doses approximately 250 zzso in our cohort of zzso zzso failure to induce high levels of zzso death may explain its lack of significant clinical activity in this Phase I zzso
