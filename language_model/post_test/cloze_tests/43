The zzso behavior of the zzso band relative to the zzso derivatives of some zzso zzso zzso is studied in the temperature range zzso K and compared to that of zzso zzso zzso The band profile at various temperatures is modeled as a zzso function that accounts for homogeneous broadening and for the zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso while zzso broadening is taken into account with a zzso distribution of purely electronic transition zzso The various contributions to the zzso bandwidth are singled out with this analysis and their temperature zzso in turn, gives information on structural and dynamic properties of the system zzso In the zzso and zzso zzso the values of homogeneous bandwidth and of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso modes are not modified with respect to natural human zzso thus indicating that the local electronic and zzso properties of the zzso complex are not altered by the zzso zzso On the contrary, differences in the protein dynamic behavior are zzso The most relevant are those relative to the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso localized in the zzso pocket, which results in decreased zzso with zzso modes and increased zzso zzso zzso involving zzso beta zzso at the zzso and zzso beta zzso at the alpha 1 beta 1 interface have a smaller effect consisting in an increased zzso with zzso zzso zzso at the zzso and at the alpha 1 beta 2 interface have no effect on the dynamic properties of the same zzso zzso
