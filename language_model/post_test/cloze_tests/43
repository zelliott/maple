The thermal behavior of the zzso band relative to the zzso derivatives of some zzso mutant zzso is studied in the temperature range zzso K and compared to that of zzso zzso zzso The band profile at various temperatures is modeled as a Voigt function that accounts for homogeneous broadening and for the coupling with zzso and zzso vibrational zzso while inhomogeneous broadening is taken into account with a gaussian distribution of purely electronic transition zzso The various contributions to the zzso bandwidth are singled out with this analysis and their temperature zzso in zzso gives information on structural and dynamic properties of the system zzso In the zzso and mutant zzso the values of homogeneous bandwidth and of the coupling constants to zzso vibrational modes are not modified with respect to natural human zzso thus indicating that the local electronic and vibrational properties of the zzso complex are not altered by the recombinant zzso On the zzso differences in the protein dynamic behavior are zzso The most relevant are those relative to the zzso zzso beta zzso zzso localized in the heme zzso which results in decreased coupling with zzso modes and increased anharmonic zzso Mutations involving residue beta zzso at the zzso and residue beta zzso at the alpha 1 beta 1 interface have a smaller effect consisting in an increased coupling with zzso zzso Mutations at the zzso and at the alpha 1 beta 2 interface have no effect on the dynamic properties of the same heme zzso
