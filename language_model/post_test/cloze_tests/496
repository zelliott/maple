During chronic injury a population of bipotent hepatic progenitor cells zzso become activated to zzso both zzso and zzso Here we show in human diseased liver and mouse models of the zzso reaction that zzso and zzso signaling direct specification of zzso via their interactions with activated zzso or zzso In zzso we found that during biliary zzso expression of zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso by zzso promoted zzso signaling in zzso and thus their biliary specification to zzso zzso during zzso zzso macrophage zzso of zzso debris induced zzso zzso This resulted in canonical zzso signaling in nearby zzso thus maintaining expression of zzso zzso cell fate zzso within these cells and the promotion of their specification to zzso By these two pathways adult parenchymal regeneration during chronic liver injury is zzso
