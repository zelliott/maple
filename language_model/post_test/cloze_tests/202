We previously reported that zzso zzso zzso induced various types of cell zzso depending on the target cancer cell zzso We investigated here what type of cell death is induced by zzso zzso in two human oral squamous cell carcinoma cell lines zzso zzso TFs produced few zzso zzso TFs induced annexin zzso positive zzso cells and annexin zzso zzso zzso zzso but failed to activate zzso zzso and zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso On the other zzso TFs induced the formation of acidic organelles zzso by zzso orange zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso When zzso and zzso cells that had been transfected with expression vector zzso the zzso protein 1 light chain 3 zzso gene fused to green fluorescent protein zzso were treated with zzso zzso fusion protein was accumulated as granular dots in zzso Pretreatment with zzso an inhibitor of zzso partially inhibited the cytotoxicity of zzso the formation of acidic organelles and zzso accumulation in the zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso may induce zzso cell death in zzso and zzso cells following the early stage of necrosis or zzso zzso
