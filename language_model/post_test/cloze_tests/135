zzso fatty zzso protein zzso plays a key role in zzso insulin resistance and inflammation which may be involved in the pathogenesis of zzso obesity zzso This study examined the association of zzso with serum zzso levels in Korean zzso 

Two hundred zzso eight adults aged zzso years were examined using dual zzso absorptiometry and computed tomography and measuring serum zzso zzso zzso was defined as the zzso skeletal muscle mass zzso divided by weight zzso of zzso SD below the mean values of young adults in both zzso Obesity was defined as visceral fat area zzso â‰¥ 100 zzso 

Serum zzso levels were higher in groups with zzso compared to zzso groups in both men and zzso In the unadjusted zzso serum zzso levels were positively associated with VFA and negatively associated with zzso Even after adjusting for possible confounding zzso zzso was found to be independently and negatively associated with serum zzso zzso In zzso multiple logistic regression analysis showed that increased serum levels of zzso were independently associated with the presence of zzso 

The present findings indicate that serum zzso levels may be valuable markers of the presence of zzso
