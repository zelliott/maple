Changing plasma protein concentrations may affect the protein binding and pharmacokinetics of drugs in the postoperative zzso This study examined the effect of postoperative increases zzso response to zzso in plasma zzso zzso concentrations on the plasma concentrations of the enantiomers of bupivacaine during continuous epidural infusion of racemic bupivacaine for postoperative pain zzso 

Six patients scheduled for total hip surgery with combined epidural and general anesthesia received a bolus dose of bupivacaine zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso epidural infusion of zzso zzso bupivacaine for 48 zzso Total and unbound plasma concentrations of the enantiomers of bupivacaine and plasma AAG concentrations during the zzso epidural infusion were zzso 

Total plasma concentrations of the enantiomers of bupivacaine increased steadily during the infusion zzso zzso zzso whereas unbound concentrations did not change after 12 h zzso zzso zzso Total plasma concentrations of zzso were higher than those of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas unbound concentrations of zzso were lower than those of zzso zzso zzso zzso AAG concentrations initially zzso but thereafter increased steadily zzso zzso zzso zzso free fractions of the enantiomers initially increased and then decreased with time zzso zzso zzso Free fractions of zzso were smaller than those of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The study confirmed that the pharmacokinetics of bupivacaine are zzso During postoperative epidural zzso changing plasma AAG concentrations affect the protein binding of both enantiomers of zzso zzso total plasma concentrations of the enantiomers increase with zzso whereas unbound concentrations reach a zzso
