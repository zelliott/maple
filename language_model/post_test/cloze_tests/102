zzso from zzso mobility studies of zzso peptides suggest that, in some cases, the zzso structures can be related to the zzso structure of the parent zzso The interpretation of zzso mobility zzso is supported by results from molecular modeling and zzso exchange experiments on the same zzso This study clearly illustrates the utility of zzso for screening complex zzso for peptides having zzso stable zzso structures, and/or zzso zzso
