It is unclear whether the increased risk of colon cancer associated with obesity differs for men and zzso by distribution of body zzso or by location of the zzso The primary goal of this study was to address these zzso 

zzso subjects from the Framingham Study cohort were classified according to body mass index zzso and waist size during two age zzso zzso y zzso and zzso y zzso All eligible men and women were zzso at baseline and had complete information on the following potential zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso There were 157 incident lifetime cases of colon cancer among those followed beginning at zzso y of age and 149 lifetime cases among those whose follow up began at zzso zzso Subjects were stratified further by zzso zzso and tumor zzso The Cox Proportional zzso Models were used to adjust for possible confounding by the zzso zzso 

A zzso led to a zzso increased risk zzso zzso zzso of colon cancer among zzso zzso zzso and a zzso increased risk zzso zzso zzso among older zzso zzso zzso The BMI effect was stronger for men than for women and for cases occurring in the proximal zzso These adverse effects generally diminished when waist was added to the multivariable zzso A larger waist size zzso cm zzso zzso and zzso cm zzso zzso for women and zzso zzso was associated with a zzso increased risk of colon zzso this risk increased linearly with increasing waist size and was evident for both proximal and distal colon zzso There was no attenuation of these effects when BMI was added to the multivariable zzso A larger waist had a particularly adverse effect among sedentary subjects zzso risk zzso for zzso zzso zzso for older zzso 

These findings suggest that waist circumference is a stronger predictor of colon cancer risk than is zzso and that central obesity is responsible for an increased risk of cancer of both the proximal and distal zzso
