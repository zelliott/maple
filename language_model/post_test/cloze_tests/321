zzso recordings are a useful zzso method for zzso nucleus zzso during deep brain stimulation surgery for Parkinson's zzso Attempts to zzso and zzso this process, using single zzso measures of neural activity, have been limited by zzso in patient zzso and recording zzso Investigators have suggested that a zzso approach may be necessary for automated approaches to perform within acceptable clinical zzso We present a novel data zzso zzso and several unique features that address these zzso The zzso extracts multiple zzso features from the zzso zzso and zzso them with tools from zzso machine zzso The resulting zzso map of neural activity reveals activity transitions that zzso to the zzso boundaries of zzso zzso Using these zzso a zzso is able to achieve sensitivities of zzso and zzso for zzso entry and exit, respectively, to within zzso zzso accuracy of the current gold zzso The accuracy of this technique is attributed to the zzso zzso This activity map can simplify and zzso the process of zzso the zzso nucleus zzso for zzso Because this method does not require a stationary zzso for careful recording of unit activity for spike zzso the length of the operation may be zzso
