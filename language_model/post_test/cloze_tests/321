zzso recordings are a useful adjunctive method for subthalamic nucleus localization during deep brain stimulation surgery for zzso zzso Attempts to quantitate and standardize this zzso using single computational measures of neural zzso have been limited by variability in patient zzso and recording zzso zzso have suggested that a zzso approach may be necessary for automated approaches to perform within acceptable clinical zzso We present a novel data visualization algorithm and several unique features that address these zzso The algorithm extracts multiple computational features from the microelectrode zzso and integrates them with tools from unsupervised machine zzso The resulting zzso map of neural activity reveals activity transitions that correspond to the anatomic boundaries of subcortical zzso Using these zzso a zzso is able to achieve sensitivities of zzso and zzso for STN entry and zzso zzso to within zzso mm accuracy of the current gold zzso The accuracy of this technique is attributed to the zzso zzso This activity map can simplify and standardize the process of localizing the subthalamic nucleus zzso for zzso Because this method does not require a stationary electrode for careful recording of unit activity for spike zzso the length of the operation may be zzso
