A series of zzso like zzso analogues carrying variety of zzso aryl zzso zzso zzso and zzso carrying an zzso zzso and some zzso like zzso and coumarin zzso were synthesized and screened for their zzso antitumor activity at the National Cancer Institute zzso zzso The tested compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 19 exhibited a broad spectrum of antitumor zzso zzso belonging to the zzso series proved to be more active than those of the zzso and zzso zzso in which the zzso derivatives showed better antitumor activity when compared with their corresponding zzso zzso Compound 7 is considered to be the most active member identified in this study with a broad spectrum of activity against 22 different tumor cell lines belonging to the nine zzso zzso and a particular effectiveness against the breast cancer zzso cell line zzso zzso The zzso zzso system 19 proved to be the most active antitumor agent among the zzso fused zzso with variable activity against 18 different tumor cell zzso and special activity against the zzso cell lung cancer zzso and ovarian cancer zzso cell lines zzso values zzso and zzso zzso
