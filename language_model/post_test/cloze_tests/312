zzso growth factor receptor inhibitors block cell growth in vitro and downstream signaling in zzso but controlled trials in patients with advanced solid tumors have yielded disappointing response zzso To clarify this zzso we compared the patterns of tyrosine zzso expression in human cancer cells and primary zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were combined with mass spectrometry to determine the zzso signatures of 40 matched normal and malignant tissues from patients with breast or liver zzso The identities and abundance of the detected tyrosine zzso were compared with those of zzso zzso zzso 

Patterns of zzso proteins are similar among normal tissues of the same origin but vary markedly between different zzso Primary breast tumors exhibit a strikingly homogeneous tyrosine phosphorylation zzso whereas liver cancers display greater zzso zzso The main zzso tyrosine zzso are zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso and molecular chaperones zzso zzso and zzso In zzso control studies in zzso zzso human cancer cells revealed an additional phosphorylated subset of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and phosphatidylinositol zzso 

Identification of zzso and stress proteins as the most abundant tyrosine zzso in breast tumors implicates these zzso rather than zzso zzso as the prime stoichiometric substrates for zzso anticancer drugs in zzso Because phosphorylated zzso proteins and chaperones mediate cell motility and apoptotic zzso zzso these data raise the intriguing possibility that zzso tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be of greatest value either as adjuvant zzso drugs or as zzso
