The zzso and chromatin zzso of ovarian cells contain important features in discriminating malignant cells from normal zzso In geometric zzso the ovarian zzso and chromatin zzso appear as irregularly shaped dark spots in the nuclear images from specimens zzso stained with antibody to zzso zzso cells often have more active and larger zzso and chromatin zzso zzso estimating the size of the zzso or chromatin zzso is a difficult task since it is not easy to recognize and accurately separate the regions of zzso and chromatin zzso from the rest of the nuclei that are highly irregular and variant in contents and zzso In this zzso we develop a method to derive a parameter called power ratio that is proportionally related to the size of zzso and chromatin zzso based on an ideal nuclear model without the region segmentation of zzso or chromatin zzso Results of characterization of the parameter and comparison between malignant and normal cells are zzso
