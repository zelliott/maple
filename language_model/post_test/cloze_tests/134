The zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells contain important features in discriminating zzso cells from normal zzso In geometric properties, the zzso zzso and zzso zzso appear as zzso shaped dark spots in the nuclear images from specimens zzso stained with zzso to zzso zzso cells often have more active and larger zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso the size of the zzso or zzso zzso is a difficult task since it is not easy to recognize and accurately separate the regions of zzso and zzso zzso from the rest of the zzso that are highly irregular and zzso in contents and zzso In this paper, we develop a method to derive a zzso called power ratio that is zzso related to the size of zzso and zzso zzso based on an ideal nuclear model without the region zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso of characterization of the zzso and comparison between zzso and normal cells are zzso
