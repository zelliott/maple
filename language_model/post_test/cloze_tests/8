zzso zzso of human serum extracts on zzso zzso columns produced two zzso of material zzso with insulin zzso The earlier zzso fraction appeared at the zzso position of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while the second fraction corresponded in zzso volume to zzso In zzso using zzso zzso and an zzso against zzso insulin, human pancreatic zzso was less zzso than human zzso zzso zzso of the serum zzso in the zzso showed zzso identity with the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the serum zzso yielded products with increased zzso zzso as estimated with insulin as the zzso With larger amounts of zzso all the serum zzso was converted to zzso components zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of these results we conclude that the earlier zzso fraction of human serum extracts is zzso The zzso values of zzso in normal subjects ranged between zzso and zzso zzso representing from 5 to zzso of the insulin zzso In one subject the values of zzso were higher than those of zzso After oral administration of 100 g of zzso the zzso levels tended to rise similarly to zzso Three obese patients with zzso had higher zzso levels of zzso and a greater increase after zzso than the normal zzso As the high levels of zzso zzso with raised insulin concentration in these obese subjects, the relative proportions of the two hormones were in the same range observed in the normal zzso Thus zzso in these obese subjects was not accompanied by an increase in the fraction of serum zzso When the values for serum zzso were expressed as percentage of the insulin levels, there was a decrease in the per cent zzso in the first hour of the zzso tolerance zzso After the second hour, the per cent tended to rise towards the zzso zzso
