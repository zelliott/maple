The Philadelphia zzso associated with acute zzso leukemia zzso has been linked to a hybrid zzso protein product that differs from that found in chronic zzso zzso This implies that the molecular structures of the two zzso zzso also zzso zzso of zzso zzso in Philadelphia zzso ALL has been zzso due to the only partial characterization of the zzso zzso We have isolated the entire zzso zzso zzso locus from a human zzso zzso A series of five zzso zzso zzso from the zzso first zzso of zzso were used to zzso zzso in 8 of 10 Philadelphia zzso zzso We have demonstrated that these zzso are all located at the 3' end of the zzso around an unusual restriction zzso length zzso caused by deletion of a zzso zzso containing zzso family reiterated zzso This zzso is unexpected in light of previous theories of zzso in Philadelphia zzso chronic zzso leukemia that would have predicted a random zzso of zzso in the first zzso in Philadelphia zzso zzso The proximity of the zzso zzso to this zzso deletion may indicate shared mechanisms of zzso or that such zzso mark areas of the zzso prone to zzso
