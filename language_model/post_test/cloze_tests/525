The Philadelphia chromosome associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia zzso has been linked to a hybrid zzso protein product that differs from that found in chronic myelogenous zzso This implies that the molecular structures of the two chromosomal zzso also zzso Localization of translocation breakpoints in Philadelphia zzso ALL has been impeded due to the only partial characterization of the zzso zzso We have isolated the entire zzso zzso genomic locus from a human zzso zzso A series of five zzso genomic probes from the zzso first intron of zzso were used to localize rearrangements in 8 of 10 Philadelphia zzso zzso We have demonstrated that these breakpoints are all located at the zzso end of the intron around an unusual restriction fragment length polymorphism caused by deletion of a zzso fragment containing Alu family zzso zzso This clustering is unexpected in light of previous theories of rearrangement in Philadelphia zzso chronic myelogenous leukemia that would have predicted a random dispersion of breakpoints in the first intron in Philadelphia zzso zzso The proximity of the translocation breakpoints to this constitutive deletion may indicate shared mechanisms of rearrangement or that such polymorphisms mark areas of the genome prone to zzso
