Many important problems in cell biology require the consideration of dense nonlinear interactions between functional zzso The requirement of computer simulation for the understanding of cellular processes is now widely zzso and a variety of modelling frameworks have been designed to meet this zzso zzso we present a novel public release of the Gene Interaction Network simulation suite zzso a software designed for the qualitative modelling and analysis of regulatory zzso The main functionalities of zzso are illustrated through the analysis of a logical model for the core network controlling the fission yeast cell zzso The last public release of zzso zzso zzso as well as development zzso can be downloaded from the dedicated website zzso which further includes a model zzso along with detailed tutorial and user zzso
