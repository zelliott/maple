zzso drugs are effective against tumors that depend on the molecular target of the zzso Known targets of zzso zzso drugs are involved in cell zzso drugs acting on such targets are ineffective against zzso tumor cells, survival of which leads to eventual therapy zzso zzso zzso screening identified the zzso protein complex zzso zzso gene as essential for different tumor cell types but not for normal zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso protein complex 1 zzso involved in zzso traffic and zzso The zzso of zzso but not of zzso zzso zzso zzso protein complex zzso caused zzso apparatus collapse, blocked zzso and induced zzso in both zzso and zzso tumor zzso In contrast, zzso of normal cell growth required simultaneous zzso of both zzso and zzso zzso (but not zzso was zzso in the majority of tumor cell lines and in clinical samples of different cancer zzso zzso of zzso protected tumor cells from killing by zzso zzso indicating that tumor cell dependence on zzso is the result of zzso zzso zzso displays no zzso activities, but it harbors zzso 152, which is silenced in tumor cells zzso with zzso and acts as a tumor zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso 152 in different zzso and the ensuing zzso of its host gene zzso offer a therapeutic opportunity for zzso selective killing of tumor cells by zzso zzso
