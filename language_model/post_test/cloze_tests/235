zzso zzso is a widespread environmental zzso carcinogen that zzso DNA by forming zzso This damage along with activation of the aryl hydrocarbon receptor zzso induces complex transcriptional responses in zzso To investigate whether human cells are more susceptible to zzso in a particular phase of the cell zzso synchronised breast carcinoma zzso cells were exposed to zzso Cell cycle progression was analysed by flow zzso DNA adduct formation was assessed by zzso zzso microarrays of zzso human zzso oligos and zzso were used to detect gene expression zzso changes and Western zzso was performed to determine the expression of some zzso including cytochrome P450 zzso zzso and zzso which are involved in zzso zzso 

Following zzso zzso cells zzso G1 arrest and accumulated in zzso Higher levels of DNA damage occurred in zzso and zzso compared with zzso zzso Genes that were found to have altered expression included those involved in xenobiotic zzso zzso cell cycle regulation and DNA zzso Gene ontology and pathway analysis showed the involvement of various signalling pathways in response to zzso zzso such as the zzso pathway in zzso the zzso pathway in G1 and zzso the zzso pathway in S and zzso and the Akt pathway in zzso An important finding was that higher levels of DNA damage in zzso and zzso cultures correlated with higher levels of zzso and zzso mRNA and zzso zzso exposure of synchronised zzso cells to zzso zzso the ultimate carcinogenic metabolite of zzso did not result in significant changes in DNA adduct levels at different phases of the cell zzso 

This study characterised the complex gene response to zzso in zzso cells and revealed a strong correlation between the varying efficiency of zzso metabolism and DNA damage in different phases of the cell zzso Our results suggest that growth kinetics within a zzso population may be important determinants of susceptibility and response to a zzso zzso
