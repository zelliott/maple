zzso synthase zzso mutations in Pneumocystis zzso have been associated zzso with resistance to zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso be zzso inherent drug resistance zzso be zzso This study explores the effects of these mutations in a tractable model zzso Saccharomyces zzso Based on the sequence conservation between the zzso enzymes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso together with the structural conservation of the three known zzso zzso zzso substitutions commonly observed in zzso zzso were reverse engineered into the zzso cerevisiae zzso Those zzso zzso and zzso can occur zzso but are most commonly found together and are associated with zzso treatment zzso Mutations encoding the corresponding changes in the zzso cerevisiae zzso were made in a yeast zzso zzso zzso which encodes the native yeast zzso as part of a zzso protein that also includes the two enzymes upstream of zzso in the folic acid synthesis zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A yeast strain with zzso deleted was employed as the host zzso and transformants having zzso activity were zzso zzso having both zzso and zzso substitutions had a requirement for zzso acid zzso consistent with resistance being associated with altered substrate zzso These mutants could be adapted for growth in the absence of zzso which coincided with increased zzso drug zzso zzso zzso synthesis was thus implicated as a mechanism for zzso drug resistance for mutants having two zzso zzso
