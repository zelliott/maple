zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso have been associated zzso with resistance to zzso zzso Since zzso zzso cannot be zzso inherent drug resistance cannot be zzso This study explores the effects of these zzso in a zzso model zzso zzso zzso Based on the sequence conservation between the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso together with the structural conservation of the three known zzso structures, zzso zzso commonly observed in zzso zzso were reverse engineered into the zzso zzso zzso Those zzso zzso and zzso can occur zzso but are most commonly found together and are associated with zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso the corresponding changes in the zzso zzso zzso were made in a zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes the native zzso zzso as part of a zzso protein that also includes the two zzso upstream of zzso in the zzso acid synthesis pathway, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso strain with zzso deleted was employed as the host strain, and zzso having zzso activity were zzso zzso having both zzso and zzso zzso had a requirement for zzso acid zzso consistent with resistance being associated with altered zzso zzso These zzso could be adapted for growth in the absence of zzso which coincided with increased zzso drug zzso zzso zzso synthesis was thus implicated as a mechanism for zzso drug resistance for zzso having two zzso zzso
