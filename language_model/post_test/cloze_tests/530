DNA methylation is important in cancer development and is a promising biomarker for cancer zzso An zzso approach used in our previous work showed that zzso is zzso in cervical zzso zzso a zzso zzso is known to participate in developmental zzso zzso there are at present no data on the role of zzso in zzso In this zzso we characterized the function of this transcription factor by examining cell zzso animal models and human cervical neoplastic zzso and found that zzso of zzso does not affect cell proliferation or the cell cycle of cervical cancer cell lines but significantly inhibits colony formation and invasion in zzso Analysis of changes in zzso transition zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed involvement of the EMT in zzso cancer zzso this result was validated in a stable zzso zzso zzso with RNA zzso zzso studies using immunocompromised mice confirmed the suppressor effects of zzso on tumour formation and distant metastasis in cervical cancer cell zzso zzso immunohistochemical staining of tissue arrays containing the full spectrum of cervical zzso including normal zzso zzso cervical zzso neoplasia zzso zzso zzso locally invasive and distant metastatic zzso demonstrated the critical role of zzso in invasion and zzso zzso we found by analysing zzso signalling that zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso suppresses cancer invasion and metastasis in cervical cancer through an incomplete zzso
