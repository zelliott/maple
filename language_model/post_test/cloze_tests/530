DNA zzso is important in cancer development and is a promising zzso for cancer zzso An zzso approach used in our previous work showed that zzso is zzso in cervical zzso zzso a zzso zzso is known to participate in zzso zzso however, there are at present no data on the role of zzso in zzso In this study, we characterized the function of this zzso factor by examining cell lines, animal models and human cervical zzso zzso and found that zzso of zzso does not affect cell proliferation or the cell cycle of cervical cancer cell lines but significantly zzso colony formation and invasion in zzso Analysis of changes in zzso transition zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso revealed involvement of the zzso in zzso cancer invasion; this result was validated in a stable zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso studies using zzso mice confirmed the zzso effects of zzso on zzso formation and distant zzso in cervical cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of tissue zzso containing the full spectrum of cervical zzso including normal zzso zzso cervical zzso zzso zzso high-grade zzso locally invasive and distant zzso zzso demonstrated the critical role of zzso in invasion and zzso Furthermore, we found by zzso zzso zzso that zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso The results of this study suggest that zzso suppresses cancer invasion and zzso in cervical cancer through an incomplete zzso
