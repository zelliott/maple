zzso is the first zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor that showed activity in zzso models at low zzso zzso We performed a phase 1 trial of zzso administered to subjects with advanced solid zzso 

Sixty patients received zzso capsules orally on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, and 18 of each course in schedule 1, and on days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25 of each course in schedule zzso The treatment schedules were repeated every 28 zzso In addition to determining the zzso we evaluated zzso of zzso and zzso effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso 

The zzso was 700 zzso twice weekly when zzso was zzso for 3 weeks out of each zzso zzso The zzso for continuous dosing regimen was established at 600 zzso twice zzso zzso zzso zzso hot zzso and zzso zzso events characterize the safety profile of zzso zzso twice weekly, with events mostly mild or zzso Plasma exposure to zzso was zzso zzso occurred at approximately 90 minutes and zzso was approximately 1 hour across dosing zzso of 25 to 800 zzso zzso twice zzso The zzso activity of zzso was demonstrated in serum, zzso and tumor zzso zzso levels were increased zzso from zzso and serum zzso was significantly decreased zzso zzso from zzso 

zzso twice weekly, given with or without the 1 of zzso rest period was tolerated in subjects with advanced solid tumors at doses that are zzso zzso
