Because of unparalleled sensitivity and tolerance to protein size, mass zzso zzso has become a popular method for measuring the solution hydrogen zzso exchange zzso of biologically relevant protein zzso While incorporated zzso can be localized to different regions by zzso zzso of the labeled zzso the assignment of zzso to individual zzso is typically not zzso thereby limiting a detailed understanding of zzso and the dynamics of protein zzso Here we use zzso fragmentation of zzso peptides by electron transfer zzso zzso to measure the zzso of individual zzso linkages in the zzso protein zzso A comparison of the zzso levels of 60 individual backbone zzso of zzso measured by zzso analysis to the corresponding values measured by zzso zzso shows an excellent zzso The zzso labeling pattern of zzso is retained in the gaseous zzso zzso by employing mild zzso conditions for zzso zzso A recently developed model zzso is used to arrive at such zzso source zzso conditions that prevent the occurrence of zzso zzso hydrogen zzso migration zzso hydrogen zzso This article demonstrates that zzso can be implemented in a mass zzso method to monitor the zzso dynamics of proteins in solution at zzso zzso
