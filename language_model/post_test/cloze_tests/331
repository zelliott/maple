zzso zzso binds zzso elements zzso encoded within selected zzso mRNAs and targets these transcripts for rapid cytoplasmic zzso RNA binding by TTP is mediated by an approximately zzso acid domain containing two zzso arrayed zzso zinc zzso Here we show that a zzso acid peptide spanning the TTP zinc finger zzso denoted zzso forms a zzso equimolar zzso complex with a zzso fragment of the ARE from tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso which includes small but significant contributions from ionic zzso Association of zzso with high affinity RNA substrates is accompanied by a large negative change in heat capacity without substantial modification of RNA zzso consistent with conformational changes in the peptide moiety during RNA zzso Analyses using mutant ARE substrates indicate that two zzso residues located zzso bases apart within a zzso sequence are sufficient for high affinity recognition by zzso zzso zzso zzso with optimal affinity observed for RNA substrates containing zzso or zzso Linkage of conformational changes and binding affinity to the presence and spacing of these zzso residues provides a thermodynamic basis for the RNA substrate specificity of zzso
