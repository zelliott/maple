zzso zzso binds zzso elements zzso zzso within selected zzso zzso and targets these transcripts for rapid zzso zzso zzso binding by zzso is zzso by an approximately zzso acid domain containing two zzso arrayed zzso zinc zzso Here we show that a zzso acid zzso spanning the zzso zinc finger domain, zzso zzso forms a zzso zzso zzso complex with a zzso zzso of the ARE from tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso which includes small but significant contributions from zzso zzso Association of zzso with high affinity zzso zzso is accompanied by a large negative change in heat capacity without substantial modification of zzso structure, consistent with zzso changes in the zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso using zzso ARE zzso indicate that two zzso zzso located 3-6 bases apart within a zzso sequence are sufficient for high affinity recognition by zzso zzso zzso zzso with optimal affinity observed for zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso zzso of zzso changes and binding affinity to the presence and spacing of these zzso zzso provides a zzso basis for the zzso zzso specificity of zzso
