zzso factor 4 zzso a zinc zzso transcriptional zzso is a pivotal regulator of cellular zzso zzso has attracted considerable attention for its opposing effect in carcinogenesis as tumor suppressor zzso colorectal zzso or zzso zzso breast zzso depending on tissue zzso with the underlying mechanism remaining largely zzso Here we report that zzso zzso estrogen signaling in breast cancer zzso Accumulation of zzso by inhibiting its turnover triggers zzso zzso We identified Von zzso zzso as the protein that governs zzso turnover in breast cancer cells and demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso facilitates accumulation of zzso We provide mechanistic insights into zzso zzso degradation as well as its elevation in the presence of estrogen and show that elevated levels of zzso or depletion of zzso attenuates the zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso immunohistochemical staining revealed reduced concentration of zzso and accumulation of zzso in breast cancer zzso We thus propose that suppression of zzso in response to estrogen signaling results in elevation of zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso
