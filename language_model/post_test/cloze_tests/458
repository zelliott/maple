Recent research has suggested that the zzso microRNA 155 zzso is zzso in hepatocellular carcinoma zzso In this zzso the authors investigated the zzso mechanism of this zzso in the development of zzso 

Quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was conducted to analyze the expressions of zzso and its potential target genes in paired tumor tissues and adjacent zzso tissues and in zzso liver tissue zzso The in silico predicted target genes of zzso were assessed by zzso reporting zzso zzso zzso and Western blot zzso zzso promoters that drive zzso precursor overexpression and zzso tough decoy zzso constructs were used to study its affects on cell proliferation in vitro and on tumor formation in nude zzso 

Quantitative zzso demonstrated a gradual zzso of zzso expression in cirrhotic liver tissues and in HCC tumor tissues compared with low expression levels in normal liver zzso zzso expression of zzso in HepG2 cells enhanced its zzso whereas depletion of the endogenous zzso reversed these zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso region Y box 6 zzso was able to reverse the zzso property of zzso zzso the results demonstrated for the first time that zzso is a direct target of zzso Further analysis revealed that zzso reduced cell growth by zzso zzso expression in a zzso zzso In zzso a decline in zzso expression caused by zzso could be reversed by zzso zzso 

The current data indicated that zzso is a novel target of zzso and that zzso enhances liver cell tumorigenesis at least in part through the novel zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may be a potential target for HCC zzso
