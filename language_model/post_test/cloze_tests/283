Recent clinical studies revealed that positive results of cell transplantation on cardiac function are limited to the zzso and zzso restoration phase following zzso zzso zzso emphasizing the need for long-term zzso These transient effects may depend on the transplanted zzso or its differentiation zzso We have identified a population of zzso zzso cells zzso capable of zzso efficiently into beating zzso zzso cells, and smooth muscle cells in zzso We investigated whether zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso are able to restore the injured zzso after zzso in zzso 

zzso was induced in zzso mice and was followed by zzso injection of zzso zzso or zzso zzso function was measured zzso up to 3 months zzso using zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso The fate of the human cells was determined by zzso zzso of zzso or zzso resulted in a higher ejection fraction and reduced the extent of left zzso zzso up to 3 months after zzso when compared with zzso zzso zzso and zzso generated new cardiac tissue consisting of human zzso and blood zzso Fusion of human zzso with zzso zzso was not zzso 

zzso differentiated into the same cell types in zzso as can be obtained in zzso This excludes the need for in zzso zzso making zzso a promising source for zzso zzso zzso
