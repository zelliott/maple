Studies were carried out on cholesterol metabolism in 11 zzso patients and 16 obese patients with hypothyroidism and 13 with zzso The patients underwent several investigations under metabolic ward zzso zzso patients usually had an increase in low density lipoprotein zzso Several mechanisms may have combined to cause a high zzso For zzso the obese zzso patients had an increase in cholesterol zzso Absorption of cholesterol also was increased zzso zzso other mechanisms not explored in this study probably contributed to most of the fall in zzso Treatment of zzso patients produced the expected fall in zzso One possible mechanism could be that thyroid hormones enhance the conversion of cholesterol into bile zzso this mechanism has been suggested by other workers from animal zzso zzso no evidence was obtained in either zzso or zzso patients that thyroid hormones alter synthesis of bile zzso On the other zzso the hormones appeared to increase the synthesis of zzso Patients with hypothyroidism frequently had supersaturated zzso The cause was mostly an enhanced secretion of biliary cholesterol associated with a tendency to obesity and increased synthesis of zzso In zzso the usually thin zzso patients did not have supersaturated zzso The studies show that thyroid hormones zzso influence zzso by an action on the zzso of zzso of alterations in zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso stimulate synthesis of zzso and zzso affect biliary lipid metabolism in large part by influencing energy balance and cholesterol zzso
