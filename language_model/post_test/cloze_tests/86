This article concerns one of the most important problems of zzso interfaces zzso based on Steady State Visual Evoked Potentials zzso that is the selection of the zzso most suitable frequencies for zzso Previous works related to this problem were done either with measuring systems that have little in common with actual BCI systems zzso single flashing zzso or were presented on a small number of zzso or the tested frequency range did not cover a broad zzso Their results indicate a strong zzso response around 10 zzso in the range zzso zzso and at high frequencies in the band of zzso zzso In the case of BCI zzso stimulation with frequencies from various ranges are zzso The frequencies are often adapted for each user zzso The selection of these zzso zzso was not yet justified in quantitative zzso study with proper statistical account for zzso zzso The aim of this study is to determine the zzso response zzso that zzso the magnitude of the evoked signal as a function of zzso The zzso response was induced in conditions as close as possible to the actual BCI zzso using a wide range of frequencies zzso zzso in step of 1 zzso The data were obtained for 10 zzso zzso curves for individual subjects and the population curve was zzso Statistical analysis were conducted both on the level of individual subjects and for the zzso The main result of the study is the identification of the optimal range of zzso which is zzso zzso for the registration of zzso zzso The applied criterion of optimality zzso to find the largest contiguous range of frequencies yielding the strong and zzso zzso zzso
