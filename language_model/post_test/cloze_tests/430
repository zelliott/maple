The pathophysiology of zzso the perception of sound in the absence of acoustic zzso is largely zzso although several lines of research implicate zzso zzso loss of zzso The evidence to date suggests that the zzso alterations are likely to be found in multiple brain zzso The present study used zzso magnetic resonance imaging zzso to assess the pattern of neural activity in the central auditory pathway of rats with psychophysical evidence of chronic zzso zzso zzso an zzso paramagnetic contrast zzso zzso in active neurons through zzso calcium zzso primarily at zzso and serves as both a structural and functional zzso Comparison images were obtained from normal subjects exposed to external zzso zzso and from tinnitus subjects treated with zzso a zzso agonist shown to eliminate the psychophysical evidence of tinnitus in zzso MEMRI zzso zzso In rats with evidence of zzso activity was generally elevated in the auditory zzso with significant elevation in the cerebellar zzso the posterior ventral cochlear zzso and the inferior zzso in general forebrain structures showed decreased zzso although MEMRI may be a less sensitive indicator of forebrain activity than brainstem zzso zzso in normal rats exposed to a zzso zzso a similar pattern of elevated brainstem activity and decreased forebrain activity was zzso with the notable exception of the zzso where artificial tinnitus had no effect and zzso zzso decreased brainstem activity to control zzso in rats with prior evidence of zzso and decreased forebrain activity to below control zzso It was concluded that chronic tinnitus in rats is associated with focal activity elevation in the auditory brainstem and increased activity in the zzso that may be unique to zzso
