Human zzso zzso is a zzso chaperone protein with homology to the Drosophila tumor suppressor zzso We report the first case of a zzso mutation at the human zzso zzso which was identified in the zzso glioma cell line giving rise to zzso high levels of a zzso mutant zzso In this zzso we set out to determine whether this change in zzso status influences the response of glioma cells to zzso zzso delivery of the two major isoforms of zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced apoptosis in zzso mutant zzso zzso while causing growth arrest in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso By zzso zzso infection had no apparent effect on glioma cell zzso The apoptosis induced by zzso was accompanied by mitochondrial cytochrome C release and zzso activation and blocked by stable overexpression of zzso Our findings suggest that the status of zzso in gliomas may contribute to their susceptibility to cell death zzso
