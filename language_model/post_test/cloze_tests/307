The p53 tumor suppressor is a key regulator of cell growth and survival upon various forms of cellular zzso p53 is a zzso transcription factor that binds specifically to DNA and activates transcription of target zzso The core domain of p53 holds a zinc atom that protects p53 from oxidation and is critical for DNA zzso A large fraction of human tumors carry p53 zzso allowing evasion of apoptosis and tumor zzso Restoration of wild type p53 expression triggers rapid elimination of tumors in zzso This makes mutant p53 an attractive target for novel cancer zzso Small molecules have been identified that reactivate mutant p53 and induce apoptosis in tumor zzso zzso several of these compounds share the ability to target zzso and affect the redox state of zzso indicating that this is critical for mutant p53 zzso The identification of a common chemical activity among mutant zzso compounds will facilitate the design of even more potent and selective mutant zzso drugs for improved cancer therapy in the zzso
