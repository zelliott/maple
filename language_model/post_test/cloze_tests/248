zzso protein kinase zzso is a tumor suppressor and negatively regulates several activation zzso Consistent with its potential zzso zzso zzso promotes the formation of zzso inhibitor of translation zzso complex that suppresses the translation of selected inflammatory zzso zzso has been found to inhibit tumor necrosis zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso activation and zzso cytokine zzso Inflammation is always associated with T cell zzso while zzso attenuates T cell activation by a selective suppression in T cell zzso zzso zzso Recent zzso zzso also reveal a contribution of zzso to zzso zzso zzso is shown to mediate zzso signaling downstream of zzso zzso zzso or zzso In zzso zzso is required for the full formation of zzso zzso essential for the generation of zzso and zzso These results suggest the complicated role of zzso in the regulation of inflammation that is likely dependent on cell types and environmental zzso
