zzso a subtype of obesity characterized as a metabolically healthy but obese zzso individual has been zzso zzso limited data are available on these zzso zzso metabolic and inflammatory zzso and the effect of weight loss on these zzso We investigated metabolic and inflammatory markers in zzso women to determine the effects of a zzso weight loss on those zzso 

One hundred and zzso zzso Korean women participated for 12 weeks in a clinical intervention study involving a 300 zzso intake zzso The subjects were divided into two zzso zzso and metabolically abnormal obese zzso zzso 

Computed tomography was zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and oxidized zzso lipoprotein zzso as well as blood zzso glucose and insulin concentrations were determined at baseline and after weight zzso 

At zzso plasma CRP zzso zzso zzso and oxidized LDL zzso levels were significantly lower in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso zzso fat at L1 zzso and visceral fat at L4 zzso were significantly lower in the zzso group than in the zzso zzso The treatment induced weight loss averaging zzso of initial body zzso and the degree of weight loss between the two groups was zzso zzso fat at L1 and L4 was reduced from its initial values by zzso and zzso zzso after weight zzso The levels of CRP zzso and oxidized LDL zzso were significantly reduced in the zzso group after the zzso weight zzso whereas these effects were not seen in the zzso zzso 

Our results showed that zzso individuals exhibited lower visceral fat accumulation and more favorable metabolic and inflammatory states than zzso zzso After a zzso weight loss zzso significant reductions in blood zzso CRP and oxidized LDL levels were observed in zzso zzso zzso there was no measurable effect of weight loss on lipid profiles and inflammation in zzso zzso indicating differing effects of weight loss on these markers between zzso and zzso zzso
