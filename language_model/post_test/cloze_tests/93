Assessing the pharmacodynamics zzso of a potential therapeutic through the use of a downstream biomarker is zzso This is traditionally performed in the target tissue but limited volume and invasiveness of sampling pose challenges with solid zzso zzso there are several small molecule receptor kinase inhibitors and large molecule therapeutic antibodies in clinical trials that interfere with TGFbeta signalling to treat various forms of zzso With the advent of these new zzso there is a need for a surrogate tissue that is easily accessible and indicative of tumour zzso We propose the use of an ex vivo zzso stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells zzso coupled with the measurement of phosphorylated zzso zzso Against zzso a downstream transcriptional zzso using a sandwich zzso TGFbeta is involved in many different cellular zzso such as zzso zzso zzso invasion and zzso zzso and zzso are phosphorylated as a result of the canonical cascade through ligand binding and receptor kinase zzso These phosphorylated zzso zzso associate with zzso a zzso and transcriptionally activate zzso zzso This paper describes the novel method for measuring the downstream effects of inhibiting canonical TGFbeta signalling using ex vivo stimulation of surrogate tissue to predict tumour zzso In zzso we present the assay validation rationale and zzso This zzso validated assay can be used to gain insight into clinical trials regarding TGFbeta signal modulation by multiple inhibitor platforms for both large and small zzso
