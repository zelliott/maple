Free radical induced polymerization of vinyl monomers such as the zzso peptides described here is a facile and rapid reaction used zzso for zzso in the polymerization of zzso and zzso for the assembly of polyacrylamide zzso The technology allows the incorporation of many of the same or different peptide determinants into a single polymer zzso In this study large polymers containing multiple copies of peptides representing zzso and zzso determinants of influenza zzso were zzso The determinants retained antigenicity after the polymerization procedure and the polymers were highly zzso the levels of antibody obtained after a single dose of polymeric immunogen were at least as great as those achieved only after repeated doses of the equivalent monomeric zzso The technology has a wide range of potential zzso not the least significant of which is the construction of designer immunogens for third generation vaccine zzso
