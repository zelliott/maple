The comparative characterization of a series of zzso as potent cell entry inhibitors of the hemorrhagic fever zzso Lassa zzso is zzso The resolution and examination of the individual enantiomers of the prototypical zzso cell entry inhibitor 3 zzso is reported and the more potent zzso was found to be zzso more active than the corresponding zzso The absolute configuration of zzso was established by asymmetric synthesis of the active inhibitor zzso zzso A limited deletion scan of zzso defined key structural features required of the prototypical zzso
