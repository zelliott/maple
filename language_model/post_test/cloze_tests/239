A human receptor for the cytotoxic ligand zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was identified recently as a member of the tumor necrosis factor receptor zzso In this report we describe the identification of two additional human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso that belong to the tumor necrosis factor receptor zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso contains a cytoplasmic zzso zzso necessary for induction of apoptosis and is hence designated death zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso the apoptotic pathway independent of the zzso molecule zzso Because of its lack of a death zzso zzso zzso is not capable of inducing zzso zzso by competing for zzso it is capable of inhibiting zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso may function as an antagonistic decoy receptor to attenuate the cytotoxic effect of zzso in most tissues that are zzso zzso and zzso
