zzso multiforme zzso is the most common and lethal primary human brain zzso zzso are characterized by a variety of genetic zzso among which oncogenic mutations of epidermal growth factor receptor zzso is most zzso zzso harboring zzso have increased proliferation and invasive characteristics versus those expressing zzso zzso zzso To identify the molecular basis of this increased zzso zzso we used zzso differential proteomic zzso Among several differentially expressed zzso we selected zzso a protein implicated in cellular invasion that was markedly decreased in zzso expressing zzso for further zzso The differential expression of zzso was confirmed in a panel of human GBM cell lines and operative specimens that express zzso or mutant zzso by quantitative zzso zzso Western zzso and immunohistochemical zzso In human GBM zzso decreased expression of zzso correlated with zzso zzso zzso of zzso by siRNA resulted in increased invasion of zzso expressing human GBM cells zzso and zzso to those found in isogenic GBM zzso Exogenous expression of zzso in these zzso GBM cells promoted their ability to invade and was accompanied by decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso expression decreased invasion of the zzso GBM cells by tilting the balance between zzso and zzso zzso these results show that the loss of zzso contribute to the increased invasive phenotype of human zzso expressing mutant zzso
