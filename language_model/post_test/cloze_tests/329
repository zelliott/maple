To investigate all patients referred to our center with zzso celiac disease zzso to establish a cause for their continued zzso 

We assessed all patients referred to our center with zzso celiac disease over an zzso zzso These individuals were investigated to establish the zzso of their continued zzso The patients were first seen in clinic where a thorough history and examination were performed with routine blood work including tissue zzso antibody zzso They were also referred to a specialist gastroenterology dietician to try to zzso any zzso in the diet and sources of hidden gluten zzso A repeat small intestinal biopsy was also performed and compared to biopsies from the referring hospital where zzso zzso zzso hydrogen breath zzso zzso testing and computed tomography scan of the abdomen were undertaken if the symptoms zzso Their clinical progress was followed over a minimum of 2 zzso 

One hundred and twelve consecutive patients were referred with zzso Twelve were found not to have celiac disease zzso Of the remaining 100 zzso zzso were not adequately adhering to a strict zzso zzso with 24 zzso found to be inadvertently zzso zzso and 21 zzso admitting zzso Microscopic colitis was diagnosed in zzso and small bowel bacterial overgrowth in zzso zzso CD was diagnosed in zzso Three of these were diagnosed with intestinal zzso After 2 zzso 78 patients remained zzso eight had continuing zzso and four had zzso 

In individuals with zzso a zzso cause can be found in zzso with continued gluten ingestion as the leading zzso We propose an algorithm for zzso
