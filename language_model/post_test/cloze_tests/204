The seed of zzso zzso zzso zzso has traditionally been used as a herbal medicine, considered to have zzso zzso Here we examined the ability of zzso seed extract to inhibit inflammatory responses of zzso to bacterial toxin and the mechanism zzso 

In the present study, we prepared four zzso from an ethanol extract of zzso seed and investigated their effects on the production of zzso oxide and zzso and the expression of zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso inhibited zzso zzso oxide production and zzso zzso expression in the zzso The zzso zzso fraction at 100 zzso almost completely suppressed NO production, zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso in cells zzso with zzso The fraction also inhibited zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cells with the attendant suppression of zzso nuclear zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso seed extracts contained a large number of zzso compounds having zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We identified zzso as one of the active compounds responsible for the biological activity of zzso seed zzso 

These results suggest for the first time that ethanol extracts from zzso seed have zzso potential on zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
