The seed of zzso zzso zzso zzso has traditionally been used as a herbal zzso considered to have zzso zzso Here we examined the ability of zzso seed extract to inhibit inflammatory responses of macrophages to bacterial toxin and the mechanism zzso 

In the present zzso we prepared four fractions from an ethanol extract of zzso seed and investigated their effects on the production of nitric oxide and zzso and the expression of inducible nitric oxide synthase zzso in lipopolysaccharide zzso zzso zzso macrophage zzso 

The fractions inhibited zzso nitric oxide production and zzso zzso expression in the zzso The ethyl acetate fraction at 100 zzso almost completely suppressed NO zzso iNOS and zzso zzso and zzso and zzso secretion in cells stimulated with zzso The fraction also inhibited phosphorylation of extracellular zzso kinase zzso and zzso in zzso cells with the zzso suppression of zzso nuclear translocation and nuclear factor zzso zzso zzso zzso seed extracts contained a large number of phenolic compounds having antioxidant potentials against zzso zzso radicals and hydroxyl zzso We identified zzso as one of the active compounds responsible for the biological activity of zzso seed zzso 

These results suggest for the first time that ethanol extracts from zzso seed have zzso potential on zzso macrophages through the zzso of zzso and zzso signalling zzso
