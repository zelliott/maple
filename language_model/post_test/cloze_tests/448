zzso radiation zzso is an important therapeutic modality used in approximately zzso of all cancer patients and is particularly effective against solid tumors that zzso be removed by surgery or that are refractory to standard anticancer zzso IR is often combined with other chemotherapeutic agents with the goal of sensitizing cancer cells to the cytotoxic effects of IR to produce a synergistic zzso zzso 

This review article describes current and emerging therapeutic agents that are designed to increase the therapeutic efficacy of zzso This includes a discussion of how IR causes cell death by damaging nucleic zzso The involvement of various DNA repair zzso zzso kinases and apoptotic pathways is also zzso This mechanistic information provides the framework to understand how combining therapeutic modalities with IR produces synergistic effects as well as to explain how emerging therapeutic strategies are being designed to inhibit or activate these zzso Biochemical mechanisms and clinical applications of these chemical entities are zzso zzso brief descriptions are provided for several emerging chemical entities that show promise as potential adjunctive agents to zzso cells to the effects of zzso 

Using DNA damaging agents or kinase inhibitors to zzso the cytotoxic effects of IR has significantly improved patient zzso zzso several advancements in instrumentation as well as new molecular targets are changing the landscape of applying IR as a therapeutic zzso
