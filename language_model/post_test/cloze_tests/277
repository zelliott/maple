Identification of zzso women with the rare but serious risk of hereditary cancer and their referral to appropriate services presents an important public health zzso We report the results of formative research to reach thousands of women for efficient identification of those at high risk and expedient access to free genetic zzso External validity is maximized by emphasizing intervention fit with the two zzso organizations who must connect to make this zzso This study phase informed the design of a subsequent randomized controlled zzso 

We conducted a randomized controlled pilot study zzso zzso zzso to compare two intervention models for feasibility and zzso The main outcome was receipt of genetic counseling during a zzso intervention zzso Model 1 was based on the usual zzso protocol of an academic hospital genetic risk zzso and Model 2 drew on the screening and referral procedures of a statewide zzso phone line through which large numbers of zzso women can be zzso In Model zzso the risk program zzso calls patients to schedule genetic zzso for Model zzso women are notified of their eligibility for counseling and make the call zzso We also developed and zzso a family history zzso for administration by phone to identify women appropriate for genetic zzso 

There was no statistically significant difference in receipt of genetic counseling between women randomized to Model 1 zzso compared with Model 2 zzso during the intervention zzso zzso when unresponsive women in Model 2 were called after 2 zzso 7 more obtained zzso 4 women from Model 1 were also zzso after the zzso zzso the intervention model that closely aligned with the risk zzso zzso to zzso women was found to be feasible and brought more zzso women to free genetic zzso Our zzso was easy to administer by phone and appeared to identify zzso zzso zzso The model and zzso are now in use in the main trial to test the effectiveness of this screening and referral zzso A validation analysis of the zzso is also zzso 

Identification of intervention strategies and zzso and their systematic comparison for impact and efficiency in the context where they will ultimately be used are critical elements of zzso zzso
