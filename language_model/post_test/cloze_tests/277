Identification of low-income women with the rare but serious risk of zzso cancer and their referral to appropriate services presents an important public health zzso We report the results of formative research to reach thousands of women for efficient identification of those at high risk and zzso access to free genetic zzso External zzso is zzso by emphasizing intervention fit with the two zzso organizations who must connect to make this zzso This study phase informed the design of a subsequent zzso controlled zzso 

We conducted a zzso controlled pilot study zzso zzso zzso to compare two intervention models for feasibility and zzso The main outcome was zzso of genetic counseling during a two-month intervention zzso Model 1 was based on the usual zzso protocol of an academic hospital genetic risk program, and Model 2 drew on the screening and referral procedures of a statewide toll-free phone line through which large numbers of high-risk women can be zzso In Model 1, the risk program zzso calls patients to schedule genetic zzso for Model 2, women are notified of their eligibility for counseling and make the call zzso We also developed and zzso a family history screener for administration by phone to identify women appropriate for genetic zzso 

There was no statistically significant difference in zzso of genetic counseling between women zzso to Model 1 zzso compared with Model 2 zzso during the intervention zzso However, when unresponsive women in Model 2 were called after 2 months, 7 more obtained zzso 4 women from Model 1 were also counseled after the zzso Thus, the intervention model that closely aligned with the risk program's zzso to high-risk women was found to be feasible and brought more low-income women to free genetic zzso Our screener was easy to administer by phone and appeared to identify high-risk zzso zzso The model and screener are now in use in the main trial to test the effectiveness of this screening and referral zzso A validation analysis of the screener is also zzso 

Identification of intervention strategies and tools, and their systematic comparison for impact and efficiency in the context where they will ultimately be used are critical elements of zzso zzso
