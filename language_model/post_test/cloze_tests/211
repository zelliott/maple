The ability to map individual zzso accurately across genomes enables the study of relationships between dynamic changes in nucleosome zzso and gene zzso zzso the highly heterogeneous nature of nucleosome densities across genomes and short linker regions pose challenges in mapping nucleosome positions based on zzso microarray data of zzso zzso zzso digested zzso Previous works rely on additional zzso and careful visual examination to detect zzso zzso which may exist in a subpopulation of zzso We propose a zzso zzso model based on first order differences of experimental data along genomic coordinates that zzso the need for local zzso and can automatically detect nucleosome positions of various occupancy zzso Our proposed approach is applicable to both low and high resolution zzso and zzso zzso throughput zzso zzso and is able to map zzso boundaries zzso This automated algorithm is also computationally efficient and only requires a simple preprocessing zzso We provide several examples illustrating the pitfalls of existing zzso the difficulties of zzso the observed hybridization signals and demonstrate the advantages of utilizing first order differences in detecting nucleosome zzso via simulations and case studies involving zzso and zzso data of nucleosome occupancy in yeast zzso zzso
