To evaluate the effectiveness of the iterative decomposition of water and fat with echo asymmetric and zzso estimation zzso MRI to quantify tumour infiltration into the lumbar vertebrae in myeloma patients without visible focal zzso 

The lumbar spine was examined with 3 T MRI in 24 patients with multiple myeloma and in 26 zzso The zzso fraction was calculated as the mean value from three vertebral zzso A post hoc test was used to compare the zzso fraction in controls and patients with monoclonal zzso of undetermined significance zzso asymptomatic myeloma or symptomatic zzso Differences were considered significant at zzso The zzso fraction and zzso ratio were entered into the discriminant zzso 

zzso fractions were significantly lower in patients with symptomatic zzso zzso zzso zzso than in the other three zzso Discriminant analysis showed that 22 of the 24 patients zzso were correctly classified into symptomatic or zzso myeloma zzso 

Fat quantification using the zzso sequence in MRI was significantly different when comparing patients with symptomatic myeloma and those with asymptomatic zzso The zzso fraction and zzso ratio facilitated discrimination of symptomatic myeloma from zzso myeloma in patients without focal bone zzso 

• A new magnetic resonance technique zzso offers new insights in multiple zzso • zzso fractions were lower in patients with symptomatic zzso than in those with asymptomatic zzso • The zzso ratio also aided discrimination of symptomatic zzso • The zzso fraction may provide information about the myeloma cell zzso
