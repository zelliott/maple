The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of automated nodal quantification in a zzso MDCT of a phantom with 17 synthetic lymph nodes of different sizes zzso zzso zzso was performed at varying tube zzso reconstruction kernels and slice zzso RECIST diameter and volume were measured using an automated software zzso Results were compared with the reference diameter and volume by calculating the absolute percentage error zzso Degree of agreement between software and reference measurements was evaluated by computing corresponding concordance correlation coefficients zzso Under varying tube currents the mean APE zzso varied between zzso and zzso zzso for RECIST diameter and between zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso At different reconstruction kernels the mean APE values ranged between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso zzso With different slice thicknesses the mean APE values differed from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso Regarding RECIST criteria and zzso automated evaluation of lymph nodes in a phantom demonstrated a high accuracy under varying MDCT zzso
