The zzso DNA polymorphism of the gene coding human angiotensin converting enzyme zzso was examined in 109 patients with coronary artery disease zzso and 93 zzso subjects zzso living in a northern part of zzso The presence of risk factors including zzso zzso zzso tobacco zzso diabetes mellitus and zzso were also zzso An insertion zzso zzso deletion zzso polymorphism of the ACE gene was determined by the polymerase chain reaction with oligonucleotide primers encompassing the polymorphic region in intron zzso The template DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes of zzso The frequency of the zzso in NCS was zzso significantly lower than that reported in Caucasians or in Japanese living in the zzso zzso The frequency of the zzso in patients with myocardial infarction zzso and angina pectoris was zzso and was higher than that in zzso The frequencies of genotypes zzso zzso and II were zzso zzso and zzso zzso in CAD except in young patients zzso 40 years of zzso with MI and AP zzso and zzso zzso and zzso respectively in NCS zzso zzso zzso between CAD and zzso Young MI showed similar frequencies in ACE gene polymorphisms to those in zzso a pattern which differed from that seen in subjects with CAD zzso zzso zzso The numbers of risk factors did not alter the frequency of ACE gene genotype among patients with zzso zzso in zzso the odds ratio of zzso was significantly increased to zzso zzso ACE gene polymorphism may be associated with morbidity from CAD in Japanese living in northern Japan as has been noted in zzso despite the lower frequencies of the zzso in the Japanese zzso
