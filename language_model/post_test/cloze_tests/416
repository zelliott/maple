zzso zzso growth factor zzso and its zzso zzso influence zzso through zzso of zzso zzso 3 zzso and have been implicated in zzso tumor zzso zzso dissemination of gastric zzso critically determines clinical outcome and therapeutic options of affected zzso zzso we analyzed expression and zzso significance of zzso along with zzso and zzso in gastric zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed in 91 zzso primary gastric zzso corresponding zzso gastric zzso and zzso zzso zzso employing zzso and/or in zzso zzso Blood and zzso vessel zzso were assessed after zzso with zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso were detected in zzso and zzso of gastric zzso zzso Healthy gastric zzso was negative for zzso and in zzso positive for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso was correlated with zzso zzso and decreased survival zzso P zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso was correlated with reduced zzso survival zzso zzso zzso and Cox zzso zzso analysis qualified zzso and zzso but not zzso as independent zzso zzso In zzso zzso gastric zzso presence of zzso was associated with poor survival, whereas absence of zzso defined a zzso of patients with clearly favorable zzso 

zzso and zzso are novel independent zzso marker molecules aiding to identify patients with poor prognosis after zzso zzso of gastric zzso Combined analysis of the zzso system can be useful to identify patients with zzso clinical outcome and thereby may help to refine therapeutic decisions in gastric zzso
