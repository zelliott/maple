Polar zzso comprise about zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso where they can stabilize structure via native side zzso chain zzso hydrogen bonds between TM zzso However, non-native zzso may be implicated in disease states, through limiting protein dynamics during transport and/or zzso the protein by inducing non-native zzso positions about TM zzso zzso Here we have undertaken an investigation of the presence and strength of zzso interactions within a series of zzso zzso zzso derived from TM zzso 3 and 4 zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso zzso sequence zzso in which zzso zzso in zzso forms an zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2001) zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso In the present work, a library of 21 zzso zzso was prepared, where zzso zzso were placed individually at zzso positions zzso Using gel shift zzso which zzso zzso zzso zzso migrate faster than the zzso forms zzso zzso found that zzso in zzso is able to zzso all 21 zzso D zzso into measurable populations of zzso zzso A similar library of zzso D zzso also containing zzso to zzso migration rates, confirming zzso as the polar partner for zzso D zzso In view of the broad capture range of zzso these results emphasize the potential consequences to folding and dynamics of introducing polar zzso into the TM zzso of membrane proteins in the vicinity of a native polar TM zzso
