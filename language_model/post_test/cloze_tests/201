zzso residues comprise about zzso of the transmembrane zzso domains of zzso where they can stabilize structure via native side zzso chain zzso hydrogen bonds between TM zzso zzso zzso zzso may be implicated in disease zzso through limiting protein dynamics during transport zzso zzso the protein by inducing zzso rotational positions about TM helical zzso Here we have undertaken an investigation of the presence and strength of zzso interactions within a series of zzso zzso constructs derived from TM helices 3 and 4 zzso of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator zzso zzso sequence zzso in which zzso zzso in zzso forms an zzso zzso with zzso mutant zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Biol zzso zzso In the present zzso a library of 21 zzso constructs was zzso where Asp residues were placed individually at zzso positions zzso Using gel shift zzso which zzso hairpins zzso zzso migrate faster than the elongated forms zzso zzso found that zzso in zzso is able to zzso all 21 zzso D mutations into measurable populations of zzso zzso A similar library of zzso D zzso also containing zzso to zzso migration zzso confirming zzso as the polar partner for zzso D zzso In view of the broad capture range of zzso these results emphasize the potential consequences to folding and dynamics of introducing polar mutations into the TM domains of membrane proteins in the vicinity of a native polar TM zzso
