Resolution of displacement measurements based on ultrasound zzso techniques is limited by the center frequency of the transmitted zzso echo sampling zzso quantization zzso and electronic noises in the measurement zzso We developed a new method utilizing the clutter signal in coded excitations to determine the displacement of an object or a desired region of an object with much improved zzso The method includes transmitting a pair of zzso complementary zzso receiving echoes from the object or a region of the zzso compressing the zzso eliminating the main zzso and determining the object displacement between the two transmissions from the residual clutter signal around the main lobe of the compressed zzso Results of computer simulations showed that the new method improved the resolution by several orders of magnitude and was more robust to noise than traditional zzso zzso The new method was also evaluated using an experimental ultrasound system zzso MHz center zzso 100 MHz sampling zzso and zzso sampling zzso A high precision in the displacement measurement was achieved with a measurement error of zzso nm zzso nm zzso Â± standard zzso The method has the potential to be applied in biomedical and industrial measurements of zzso zzso and zzso
