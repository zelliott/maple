Resolution of displacement zzso based on ultrasound zzso techniques is limited by the center frequency of the transmitted wave, echo sampling rate, zzso zzso and electronic noises in the measurement zzso We developed a new method utilizing the clutter signal in coded zzso to determine the displacement of an object or a desired region of an object with much improved zzso The method includes zzso a pair of zzso complementary zzso receiving echoes from the object or a region of the object, zzso the pulse, eliminating the main zzso and determining the object displacement between the two transmissions from the residual clutter signal around the main lobe of the compressed zzso zzso of computer simulations showed that the new method improved the resolution by several orders of magnitude and was more robust to noise than traditional zzso zzso The new method was also evaluated using an experimental ultrasound system (10 zzso center frequency, 100 zzso sampling rate, and zzso sampling zzso A high precision in the displacement measurement was achieved with a measurement error of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso standard zzso The method has the potential to be applied in biomedical and industrial zzso of distance, zzso and zzso
