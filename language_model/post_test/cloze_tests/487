zzso express zzso which is crucial for the development of the zzso lineage and is overexpressed in malignant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso with the expression of zzso being zzso We tested here a direct repression of the zzso zzso promoter by zzso and its zzso We found that the extreme zzso and conserved region 1 are required for zzso In zzso the motif in conserved region 2 zzso zzso as well as amino acids zzso at the zzso are not zzso As these two later motifs mediate zzso binding to the zzso protein or to the transcriptional zzso zzso zzso and are important for transformation by zzso in cooperation with other zzso the results suggest that the zzso zzso can still efficiently zzso the zzso zzso The zzso binding zzso promoter had lower zzso but was also repressed by the same zzso mutants in human melanoma zzso The zzso protein is known to also exert an antitumour zzso which is associated with its transcription repression function and the ability to induce zzso and is a potential zzso zzso Since recent data suggest that zzso may be a survival factor for melanoma zzso the zzso mutants described here might constitute a good targeting agent for zzso zzso
