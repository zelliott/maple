The gene zzso coding for a zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso A zzso zzso against the protein was used to identify zzso clones from a zzso zzso expression library of zzso strain zzso zzso The initial positive clone zzso zzso contained a zzso zzso zzso fragment, which was used to detect a larger zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contained an zzso portion of the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame of zzso zzso 450 zzso acids which give rise to a protein of zzso zzso The zzso plot indicates that the protein may have a zzso signal sequence which is zzso to yield a mature protein of zzso zzso The protein has been localized in the zzso membrane by zzso procedures as well as by electron microscopic zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso of zzso is tightly regulated by DNA zzso light intensity, and iron zzso zzso is greatly induced by growth under high light zzso and zzso during growth under zzso zzso The DNA zzso inhibitor zzso specifically inhibited the zzso zzso In Northern zzso the zzso probe zzso to two size classes of zzso with lengths of zzso and zzso zzso Since zzso appears to be a component of the zzso transcript, it is likely part of a larger zzso
