The zzso complex of zzso zzso and the protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso light chain zzso from zzso smooth muscle and zzso zzso zzso is one of the most extensively characterized zzso zzso complexes and it has an established in zzso role in the zzso of calcium signals into biological zzso We have used a combination of approaches to the study of zzso and zzso in order to derive initial insight into the key features of each protein and of the zzso zzso complex that are involved in zzso and zzso recognition and regulation of zzso zzso zzso studies are described here that include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analog zzso These and previous results indicate that: zzso both zzso and zzso features are important in the functionally correct interactions between zzso and zzso zzso even the interactions between zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso binding site of zzso are zzso and zzso in nature; zzso zzso zzso that have been zzso in zzso across millions of years of evolution and that are zzso in zzso with quantitative zzso zzso activity can be zzso without any zzso effect on activity and zzso structures different from the zzso zzso domain of zzso can have similar zzso activity in the presence of a zzso binding zzso
