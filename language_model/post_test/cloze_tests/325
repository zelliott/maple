The heterodimer complex of zzso zzso and the protein kinase catalytic subunit of myosin light chain kinase from vertebrate smooth muscle and zzso tissues zzso is one of the most extensively characterized zzso enzyme complexes and it has an established in vivo role in the transduction of calcium signals into biological zzso We have used a combination of approaches to the study of zzso and zzso in order to derive initial insight into the key features of each protein and of the zzso zzso complex that are involved in zzso and zzso recognition and regulation of enzyme zzso zzso studies are described here that include zzso zzso fluorescence zzso zzso and peptide analog zzso These and previous results indicate zzso zzso both electrostatic and hydrophobic features are important in the functionally correct interactions between zzso and zzso zzso even the interactions between zzso and peptide analogs of the zzso binding site of MLCK are heterogeneous and zzso in zzso zzso zzso residues that have been conserved in zzso across millions of years of evolution and that are conserved in zzso with quantitative MLCK activator activity can be mutated without any detectable effect on activity and zzso structures different from the prototypical zzso domain of zzso can have similar zzso activity in the presence of a zzso binding zzso
