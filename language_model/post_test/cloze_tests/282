To understand mechanisms of DNA zzso in zzso zzso a human pathogen associated with zzso zzso disease and gastric zzso we cloned a putative DNA zzso zzso zzso This gene contains a zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was closely related to zzso zzso DNA zzso including zzso in zzso zzso zzso was present in all zzso zzso strains zzso DNA from zzso zzso zzso strains was resistant to zzso by zzso and zzso which recognize DNA at sites containing zzso whereas their zzso zzso zzso were zzso indicating lack of zzso zzso of zzso in zzso coli rendered DNA from these cells resistant to zzso zzso confirming the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso encodes a DNA zzso zzso that is well zzso among diverse zzso zzso strains and that zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso
