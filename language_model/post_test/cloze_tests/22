A number of algorithms have been developed to correct for migration time drift in capillary zzso Those algorithms require identification of common components in each zzso zzso not all components may be present or resolved in separations of complex zzso which can confound attempts for zzso This paper reports the use of fluorescein zzso derivatives of amino acids as internal standards for alignment of zzso zzso proteins in capillary sieving zzso The fluorescein zzso derivative of aspartic acid zzso before zzso proteins and the fluorescein zzso derivative of arginine zzso after the zzso zzso These compounds were used as internal standards to correct for variations in migration time over a zzso period in the separation of a cellular zzso The experimental conditions were deliberately manipulated by varying electric field and sample preparation zzso Three components of the zzso were used to evaluate the alignment zzso Before zzso the average relative standard deviation in migration time for these components was zzso After zzso the average relative standard deviation in migration time for these components was reduced to zzso
