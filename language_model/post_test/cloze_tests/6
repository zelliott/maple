To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of zzso enzyme immunoassay zzso and heteroduplex mobility assay zzso for the determination of zzso subtypes B and zzso to determine the proportions of infections due to subtypes B and E over zzso and to generate data on DNA sequences of the zzso region of the env zzso 

zzso subtyping was conducted by PEIA and HMA on blood specimens obtained from 97 injecting drug users zzso infected with HIV between 1988 and zzso Genetic sequencing was performed on 84 zzso 

Both laboratory methods were highly sensitive and specific for the determination of zzso subtypes B and zzso The two tests were zzso samples which could not be typed by HMA were correctly typed by PEIA and vice zzso While subtype B accounted for zzso zzso out of zzso of infections zzso the proportion of new infections due to subtype E increased from zzso zzso out of zzso in zzso to zzso zzso out of zzso in zzso and to zzso zzso out of zzso in zzso zzso 2 for linear zzso P zzso zzso 

HMA and PEIA are zzso sensitive and specific laboratory methods for the determination of zzso subtypes in zzso and may be useful in other geographic areas to define the molecular epidemiology of the global zzso zzso Data suggest that the proportion subtype E infections have increased among Bangkok zzso from 1988 through zzso
