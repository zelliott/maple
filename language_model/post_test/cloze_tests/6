To evaluate the sensitivity and specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mobility zzso zzso for the determination of zzso zzso B and zzso to determine the proportions of infections due to zzso B and E over time; and to generate data on DNA sequences of the zzso region of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso was conducted by zzso and zzso on blood specimens obtained from 97 injecting drug users zzso infected with zzso between 1988 and zzso zzso sequencing was performed on 84 zzso 

Both laboratory methods were highly sensitive and specific for the determination of zzso zzso B and zzso The two tests were zzso samples which could not be typed by zzso were correctly typed by zzso and vice zzso While zzso B accounted for zzso (78 out of zzso of infections overall, the proportion of new infections due to zzso E increased from zzso (one out of zzso in zzso to zzso (11 out of zzso in zzso and to zzso zzso out of zzso in zzso zzso 2 for linear trend, P zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso are practical, sensitive and specific laboratory methods for the determination of zzso zzso in zzso and may be useful in other geographic areas to define the molecular epidemiology of the global zzso zzso Data suggest that the proportion zzso E infections have increased among Bangkok zzso from 1988 through zzso
