To assess zzso tolerance and efficacy of zzso zzso B zzso in a large unselected series of paediatric zzso stem cell transplantation zzso patients requiring zzso zzso 

The study included 84 children and adolescents zzso zzso 11 zzso who received 141 consecutive courses of zzso for prophylaxis zzso empirical therapy zzso possible zzso or zzso zzso invasive zzso zzso was administered until intolerance or maximum efficacy at dosages individually determined by the responsible zzso 

zzso courses were zzso zzso 49 zzso and 92 courses were started during zzso zzso The median duration of zzso therapy was 13 days zzso zzso and the median maximum dosage was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adverse events were noted during 109 courses zzso zzso zzso electrolyte zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso adverse events necessitating discontinuation of zzso occurred in 6 courses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso While median hepatic zzso alkaline phosphatase and blood urea nitrogen values were slightly zzso zzso zzso higher at end of treatment zzso bilirubin and creatinine values were not different from zzso Complete or partial responses were observed in zzso and zzso courses for possible and zzso invasive zzso zzso of 33 courses of prophylaxis and 74 of 83 courses of empirical therapy were completed with zzso Overall survival was zzso at 3 months zzso 

zzso had acceptable safety and tolerance and was useful in prevention and treatment in zzso mostly zzso paediatric patients undergoing treatment for cancer or zzso
