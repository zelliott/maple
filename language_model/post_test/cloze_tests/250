To evaluate different zzso temperature levels for a zzso prediction of the coagulation zone in magnetic resonance zzso radiofrequency zzso ablation of liver zzso 

zzso measurements were acquired during RF ablation of 24 patients with primary zzso and secondary liver lesions zzso using a zzso zzso T MR zzso and compared with the zzso coagulation zzso Temperature measurements using the proton resonance frequency shift method were performed directly subsequent to energy zzso The temperature maps were registered on the zzso zzso MR images acquired 4 weeks after zzso Areas with temperatures above zzso zzso and 60°C were segmented and compared with the coagulation zzso Sensitivity and positive predictive value were zzso 

No major complications occurred and all tumours were completely zzso No tumour recurrence was observed at the zzso examination after 4 zzso Two patients with secondary liver lesions showed local tumour recurrence after 4 and 7 zzso The 60°C threshold level achieved the highest positive predictive value zzso and the best prediction of the coagulation zzso 

For a zzso prediction of the coagulation zzso the 60°C zzso level achieved the best prediction of the coagulation zone among the tested zzso 

• Temperature monitoring can be used to survey zzso radiofrequency ablation • The developing ablation zone can be estimated based on zzso temperature measurements • A 60°C threshold level can be used to predict the ablation zone • The zzso and zzso temperature zones tend to overestimate the ablation zzso
