The gene zzso coding for a zzso protein of the cyanobacterium zzso zzso strain PCC zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso A polyclonal antibody against the protein was used to identify immunoreactive clones from a lambda zzso expression library of zzso strain PCC zzso The initial positive clone zzso zzso contained a zzso zzso chromosomal zzso which was used to detect a larger chromosomal fragment from a lambda zzso zzso The lambda zzso zzso lambda zzso contained an zzso portion of the zzso strain PCC zzso zzso The open reading frame of zzso encoded 450 amino acids which give rise to a protein of zzso zzso The hydrophobicity plot indicates that the protein may have a zzso signal sequence which is cleaved to yield a mature protein of zzso zzso The protein has been localized in the cytoplasmic membrane by biochemical procedures as well as by electron microscopic zzso Northern zzso blot analysis indicates that transcription of zzso is tightly regulated by DNA zzso light zzso and iron zzso Transcription is greatly induced by growth under high light intensities and repressed during growth under zzso zzso The DNA gyrase inhibitor zzso specifically inhibited the zzso zzso In Northern zzso the zzso probe hybridized to two size classes of zzso with lengths of zzso and zzso zzso Since zzso appears to be a component of the zzso zzso it is likely part of a larger zzso
