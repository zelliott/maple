Many kinds of natural zzso and their analogs stimulate or inhibit a wide assortment of biochemical phenomena and zzso The puzzle considered here zzso how can these lipids control so many different kinds of zzso In almost every study in which a structural comparison was zzso an zzso alcohol moiety zzso was found to be an essential feature of the zzso Many of those zzso lead to cell zzso emphasizing the importance of zzso zzso structure in the design of chemotherapeutic zzso The proposal offered here is that these lipids function as zzso in which the zzso moiety acts as an anion transferring zzso forming transient phosphate or acyl or zzso esters for the synthesis or hydrolysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso that inhibit these reactions may simply displace the active zzso from their sites in the zzso active zzso or bind to the zzso allosteric zzso This kind of competition could act as a major homeostatic control zzso Some of the zzso zzso also generate reactive zzso possibly by oxidation of the zzso alcohol zzso This explains the need to control zzso metabolites in zzso processes zzso zzso Many anticancer drugs that produce apoptosis in tumors possess an zzso alcohol zzso affect protein zzso and produce reactive oxygen zzso They may be therapeutically useful because they control the action of zzso as anion transfer agonists or zzso
