Candida zzso has been previously shown to produce a zzso zzso zzso that preferentially zzso transfer reactions such as zzso over hydrolysis in the presence of suitable zzso other than zzso even in aqueous media zzso zzso zzso zzso This enzyme has been shown to belong to a new family of zzso The present work describes the cloning of the gene coding for this zzso in the yeast Pichia pastoris and the heterologous zzso expression of the recombinant zzso The zzso zzso in which the sequence encoding the signal peptide was replaced by that of the zzso of Saccharomyces zzso was placed under the control of the methanol inducible promoter of the alcohol oxidase 1 gene zzso A transformed zzso pastoris zzso containing five copies of the zzso zzso was selected for the production of recombinant zzso The zzso culture zzso contained zzso zzso zzso of almost pure recombinant zzso displaying the same catalytic behavior as the original zzso
