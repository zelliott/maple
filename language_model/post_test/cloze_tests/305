Results from ion mobility studies of tryptic peptides suggest zzso in some zzso the zzso structures can be related to the zzso structure of the parent zzso The interpretation of ion mobility measurements is supported by results from molecular modeling and zzso exchange experiments on the same zzso This study clearly illustrates the utility of zzso for screening complex mixtures for peptides having intrinsically stable zzso zzso zzso posttranslational zzso
