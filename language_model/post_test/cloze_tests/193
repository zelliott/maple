Factor analysis is a powerful tool used for the analysis of dynamic zzso One of the major drawbacks of factor analysis of dynamic structures zzso is that the solution is not mathematically unique when only nonnegativity constraints are used to determine factors and factor zzso In this zzso a method to correct for ambiguous FADS solutions has been zzso A nonambiguous solution zzso within certain scaling zzso is obtained by constructing and minimizing a new objective zzso The most common objective function consists of a least squares term that when minimized with nonnegativity zzso forces agreement between the applied factor model and the measured zzso In our zzso this objective function is modified by adding a term that penalizes multiple components in the images of the factor zzso Due to nonuniqueness zzso these factor coefficients consist of more than one physiological zzso The technique was tested on computer zzso an experimental canine cardiac study using zzso and a patient planar zzso renal zzso The results show that the technique works well in comparison to the truth in computer simulations and to region of interest zzso measurements in the experimental zzso
