One of the key problems in accelerometry based gait analyses is that it may not be possible to zzso an accelerometer to the lower trunk so that its axes are perfectly aligned to the axes of the zzso In this paper we will present an algorithm that was designed to virtually align the axes of the accelerometer to the axes of the subject during walking zzso This algorithm is based on a physically reasonable approach and built for measurements in unsupervised zzso where the test persons are applying the sensors by zzso For evaluation purposes we conducted a study with 6 healthy subjects and measured their gait with a manually aligned and a skewed accelerometer attached to the zzso lower zzso After applying the algorithm the zzso correlation of both sensors was on average zzso with a mean absolute error of zzso We concluded that the algorithm was able to adjust the skewed sensor node virtually to the coordinate system of the zzso
