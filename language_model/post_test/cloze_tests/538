One of the key problems in zzso based gait analyses is that it may not be possible to attach an zzso to the lower trunk so that its axes are perfectly aligned to the axes of the zzso In this paper we will present an zzso that was designed to virtually align the axes of the zzso to the axes of the subject during walking zzso This zzso is based on a physically reasonable approach and built for zzso in zzso settings, where the test persons are applying the sensors by zzso For evaluation purposes we conducted a study with 6 healthy subjects and measured their gait with a manually aligned and a skewed zzso attached to the zzso lower zzso After applying the zzso the zzso correlation of both sensors was on average zzso with a mean absolute error of zzso We concluded that the zzso was able to adjust the skewed sensor zzso virtually to the coordinate system of the zzso
