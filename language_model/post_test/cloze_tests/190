The biological molecule NO and its cyclic nucleotide effector molecule zzso are involved in a variety of biological zzso This article reviews evidence supporting a role for these molecules in signal zzso Over the last 10 zzso it has become evident that these molecules are important in zzso zzso particularly in excitable zzso In these zzso zzso mechanisms appear to both directly and indirectly regulate zzso zzso Until zzso reports of the actions of zzso in zzso cells have been zzso presenting a confusing zzso of zzso In these zzso the zzso regulation pathway appears to be zzso possibly representing a negative feedback zzso zzso entry appears to be activated when low concentrations of zzso are zzso and inhibited at higher zzso The role of zzso in zzso regulation in zzso cells has been largely overlooked and further investigation of this issue may provide clues as to the nature of various unknown components that induce zzso entry into these zzso
