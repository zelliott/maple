Botulinum neurotoxin zzso serotype E is synthesized by Clostridium botulinum as an approximately zzso zzso polypeptide of zzso amino acid residues of which 8 are Cys residues zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The posttranslational processing of the gene product removes only the initiating zzso A very narrow segment of this zzso mature zzso zzso the distance from the zzso zzso residues Lys 418 and zzso zzso highly sensitive to zzso such as zzso The zzso NT easily undergoes an exogenous posttranslational modification by zzso residues zzso zzso are zzso The zzso processed NT is a zzso protein in which zzso zzso 418 constitute the approximately zzso light zzso Lys zzso zzso constitute the approximately zzso heavy zzso Cys zzso 425 and Cys zzso zzso form the interchain and intrachain disulfide zzso zzso the other four Cys residues at positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso remain as free sulfhydryl zzso The approximately zzso zzso zzso and separated light and heavy zzso were fragmented with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso some of these fragments were zzso with zzso zzso or without zzso zzso before and after zzso The fragments were separated and analyzed for amino acid compositions and sequences by zzso degradation to determine the complete covalent structure of the zzso type E zzso A total of 208 amino acid zzso zzso zzso of the entire zzso sequence deduced from nucleotide zzso was zzso Direct chemical identification of these amino acids was in complete agreement with that deduced from nucleotide zzso
