Muscle magnetic resonance imaging zzso is an innovative tool for exploring focal zzso zzso its usefulness in zzso zzso or chronic zzso when electromyography zzso the current zzso zzso sensitivity is zzso has yet to be zzso 

zzso zzso and EMG examinations were performed in 113 muscles of 17 consecutive patients with clinically diagnosed lower limb focal zzso The sensitivity and specificity of MRI and EMG were evaluated in relation to disease zzso zzso and anatomical zzso 

Muscle MRI was highly sensitive for the detection of zzso zzso zzso unlike zzso its sensitivity did not decrease regardless of the anatomical zzso zzso or severity of the zzso Five MRI false positives were zzso including three in the thigh zzso 

Muscle MRI is an alternative tool to EMG in zzso zzso or chronic clinical diagnoses of lower limb focal zzso zzso it also seems prone to zzso zzso particularly in proximal zzso
