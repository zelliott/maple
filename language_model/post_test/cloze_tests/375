Fusion of zzso cells to form stable, zzso zzso results in nuclear zzso without the exchange of genetic zzso In this report, we show that zzso in zzso cell zzso involves zzso of the zzso skeletal muscle zzso factors as well as zzso zzso Thus, the effect of zzso formation on gene expression is to induce a zzso of zzso zzso formed with a relatively zzso cell type, the zzso cell line zzso revealed the importance of both zzso expression and other unidentified zzso zzso neither of which are sufficient for efficient muscle gene zzso but are zzso We provide evidence that zzso by transient zzso zzso zzso can induce zzso expression and increase the extent and efficiency of muscle gene zzso Taken together, the results suggest that understanding the zzso basis, using a combination of approaches, and taking into account cell history, will facilitate an increase in the efficiency and zzso of conversion from one differentiated zzso to another desired cell zzso Inherent advantages of the zzso system merit further investigation in the pursuit of directed zzso
