Diabetes is a zzso disease and diabetic cardiomyopathy can result in heart zzso which is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in diabetic zzso In the zzso insulin resistance contributes to hyperglycaemia and zzso which further worsens the metabolic zzso zzso in mTOR signalling are believed to contribute to metabolic dysfunctions in diabetic liver and zzso but evidence is missing that mTOR activation is causal to the development of diabetic zzso This study shows that specific zzso inhibition by zzso prevents the development of diabetic zzso This phenotype was associated with improved metabolic zzso zzso hypertrophic growth and preserved cardiac zzso In addition zzso treatment improves hepatic insulin sensitivity and reduces systemic hyperglycaemia in obese zzso zzso unlike zzso zzso inhibition with zzso improves metabolic profile in diabetic zzso These findings may open novel avenues for therapeutic strategies using zzso directed against zzso zzso
