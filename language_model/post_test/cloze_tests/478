Because of zzso sensitivity and tolerance to protein zzso mass spectrometry zzso has become a popular method for measuring the solution hydrogen zzso exchange zzso of biologically relevant protein zzso While incorporated deuterium can be localized to different regions by pepsin zzso of the labeled zzso the assignment of zzso to individual residues is typically not zzso thereby limiting a detailed understanding of zzso and the dynamics of protein zzso Here we use zzso fragmentation of peptic peptides by electron transfer dissociation zzso to measure the zzso of individual amide linkages in the amyloidogenic protein zzso A comparison of the deuterium levels of 60 individual backbone zzso of zzso measured by zzso analysis to the corresponding values measured by NMR spectroscopy shows an excellent zzso The deuterium labeling pattern of zzso is retained in the gaseous fragment ions by employing mild declustering conditions for electrospray zzso A recently developed model peptide is used to arrive at such ion source declustering conditions that prevent the occurrence of intramolecular zzso hydrogen zzso migration zzso hydrogen zzso This article demonstrates that zzso can be implemented in a mass spectrometric method to monitor the conformational dynamics of proteins in solution at zzso zzso
