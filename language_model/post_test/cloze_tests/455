Tumour cell lines derived from breast cancer patients constitute one of the cornerstones of breast cancer zzso To characterise breast cancer cell lines at the genetic zzso we have developed a full tiling path bacterial artificial chromosome zzso array collection for comparative genomic hybridisation zzso This aCGH BAC collection covers zzso of the entire human genome at a resolution of zzso zzso We have used this platform alongside an zzso produced 17 K cDNA microarray set to characterise the genetic and transcriptomic profiles of 24 breast cancer cell zzso as well as cell types derived from zzso zzso We demonstrate that breast cancer cell lines have genomic and transcriptomic features that recapitulate those of primary breast cancers and can be reliably zzso into zzso and luminal zzso By overlaying aCGH and transcriptomic zzso we have identified 753 genes whose expression correlate with copy zzso this list comprised numerous zzso zzso amplified and overexpressed in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we demonstrate that although breast cancer cell lines have genomic features usually found in grade III breast cancers zzso gains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and luminal cell lines are characterised by distinct genomic zzso
