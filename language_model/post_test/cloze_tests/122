Studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated significant blood pressure reduction in eligible patients with resistant zzso These trials have used stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria in patient enrollment, potentially selecting for a small subset of patients with resistant zzso In this study, we examined the changes in estimated prevalence of resistant hypertension when using increasingly stringent definitions of resistant hypertension in a fixed population and assessed the zzso of zzso when applying study criteria to a community-based zzso zzso 

A retrospective chart review was done of zzso zzso Four increasingly stringent interpretations of the American Heart Association definition of resistant hypertension were used to calculate prevalence zzso Patients eligible for zzso were identified using criteria from zzso zzso zzso and clinical characteristics were zzso 

We identified zzso zzso zzso zzso were male, zzso were white, and subjects had a mean age of zzso zzso zzso years and a body mass index zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Only 14 zzso were eligible for zzso Among these patients, 10 zzso were female and all were black, with a mean age of zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso heart failure was more common in patients eligible for zzso 

Patients eligible for zzso based on published studies represent an zzso small proportion of the total zzso zzso Further studies are necessary to determine if the benefits of zzso can be generalized to a broader range of zzso patients than those included in previous zzso
