Studies of endovascular renal zzso zzso have demonstrated significant blood pressure reduction in eligible patients with resistant zzso These trials have used stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria in patient zzso potentially selecting for a small subset of patients with resistant zzso In this zzso we examined the changes in estimated prevalence of resistant hypertension when using increasingly stringent definitions of resistant hypertension in a fixed population and assessed the generalizability of zzso when applying study criteria to a zzso hypertensive zzso 

A retrospective chart review was done of hypertensive zzso Four increasingly stringent interpretations of the American Heart Association definition of resistant hypertension were used to calculate prevalence zzso Patients eligible for zzso were identified using criteria from zzso zzso Demographic and clinical characteristics were zzso 

We identified zzso hypertensive zzso zzso were zzso zzso were zzso and subjects had a mean age of zzso ± zzso years and a body mass index zzso of zzso ± zzso zzso Only 14 zzso were eligible for zzso Among these zzso 10 zzso were female and all were zzso with a mean age of zzso ± zzso and BMI of zzso ± zzso zzso heart failure was more common in patients eligible for zzso 

Patients eligible for zzso based on published studies represent an exceedingly small proportion of the total hypertensive zzso Further studies are necessary to determine if the benefits of zzso can be generalized to a broader range of hypertensive patients than those included in previous zzso
