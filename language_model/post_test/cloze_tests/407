Although regulation of zzso and cartilage development by zzso signaling is well zzso the function of zzso in the maintenance and destruction of cartilage remains largely zzso Here we investigated the involvement and regulatory mechanisms of zzso signaling in cartilage zzso We found that zzso the primary zzso cytokine involved in cartilage zzso induces expression of zzso and zzso in primary culture articular zzso The level of zzso was also increased in chondrocytes of zzso zzso suggesting the association of zzso signaling with zzso cartilage zzso In zzso our results show that zzso induces dedifferentiation and inhibits zzso apoptosis of primary culture articular zzso zzso induces dedifferentiation of articular chondrocytes by stimulating transcriptional activity of zzso whereas zzso apoptosis is inhibited via the activation of cell survival zzso such as phosphatidylinositol zzso and zzso which block apoptotic signaling zzso Our results collectively suggest that zzso is associated with cartilage destruction by regulating the maintenance of differentiation status and the apoptosis of articular chondrocytes via different zzso
