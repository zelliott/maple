The effect of echoplanar imaging zzso acoustic background noise on blood oxygenation level dependent zzso activations was zzso Two EPI pulse sequences were zzso zzso conventional EPI with a pulsating sound component of typically zzso zzso which is a potent physiological zzso and zzso the more recently developed zzso zzso which is perceived as less zzso despite equivalent peak sound pressure zzso Sixteen healthy subjects performed an established demanding visual zzso working memory zzso Using an exploratory data analysis technique zzso probabilistic independent component zzso zzso we studied the zzso response variability introduced by zzso versus conventional EPI acoustic background noise in addition to temporal and spatial signal zzso The analysis revealed a zzso component associated with the established zzso working memory and motor feedback response zzso which exhibited a significant zzso increase in its average effect size for the zzso as opposed to conventional zzso zzso zzso zzso such as primary visual zzso were not zzso EPI acoustic background noise influences much more than the auditory system per zzso This analysis provides additional evidence for an enhancement of zzso zzso BOLD activations by zzso EPI due to less zzso acoustic background gradient zzso
