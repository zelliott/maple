zzso positioning of water channel zzso zzso strictly regulates body water zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso membrane is critical to the zzso of water in zzso collecting zzso Controlled zzso positioning of zzso suggests the existence of proteins that interact with zzso A zzso search for zzso proteins led to the identification of zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso protein zzso for zzso The distribution of zzso coincided with that of zzso in zzso collecting zzso The site of zzso was zzso relocated by zzso zzso zzso trafficking to the zzso membrane was inhibited by the zzso zzso lacking zzso activity and by the zzso active zzso of zzso zzso trafficking was impaired in zzso zzso Our results show that zzso directly binds to zzso and regulates at least in part zzso zzso
