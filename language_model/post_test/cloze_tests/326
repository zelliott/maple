Targeted positioning of water channel zzso zzso strictly regulates body water zzso zzso of zzso to the apical membrane is critical to the zzso of water in renal collecting zzso Controlled apical positioning of zzso suggests the existence of proteins that interact with zzso A biochemical search for zzso proteins led to the identification of zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a zzso protein zzso for zzso The distribution of zzso coincided with that of zzso in renal collecting zzso The site of zzso was concomitantly zzso by hydration zzso zzso trafficking to the apical membrane was inhibited by the zzso mutant lacking zzso activity and by the constitutively active mutant of zzso zzso trafficking was impaired in zzso zzso Our results show that zzso directly binds to zzso and regulates at least in part zzso zzso
