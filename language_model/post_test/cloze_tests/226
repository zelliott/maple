An evaluation index that can zzso assess the severity of chest wall zzso is essential to prepare and assess corrective surgical operations for patients with these zzso including funnel chest zzso In previous studies, our group proposed several automatically calculated zzso that represent the severity of depression and asymmetry in the chest zzso These zzso showed sufficient performance in most cases of zzso including those involving zzso and zzso zzso however, their zzso declined when assessing complex zzso The purpose of this study is to propose two automated zzso that provide linear evaluation output for all types of chest wall zzso including complex zzso and to evaluate their performance and clinical zzso Six reference chest wall boundary zzso were obtained from 60 zzso zzso zzso images of a normal zzso Next, an active zzso zzso image processing technique was used to extract boundary zzso from images of patients with real chest wall zzso Third, the required parameters were extracted from the boundary zzso and the targeted zzso were zzso Finally, the performance of the proposed zzso was evaluated using 33 synthetic images and 60 real chest CT images of patients with chest wall zzso The newly proposed zzso can be automatically calculated from the original CT images and showed sufficient performance for all types of chest wall zzso We believe that the newly proposed zzso can facilitate zzso and zzso evaluation of chest wall zzso in clinical zzso
