An evaluation index that can quantitatively assess the severity of chest wall deformities is essential to prepare and assess corrective surgical operations for patients with these zzso including funnel chest zzso In previous zzso our group proposed several automatically calculated indices that represent the severity of depression and asymmetry in the chest zzso These indices showed sufficient performance in most cases of zzso including those involving asymmetric and symmetric zzso zzso their linearity declined when assessing complex zzso The purpose of this study is to propose two automated indices that provide linear evaluation output for all types of chest wall zzso including complex zzso and to evaluate their performance and clinical zzso Six reference chest wall boundary curves were obtained from 60 computed tomography zzso images of a normal zzso zzso an active contour zzso image processing technique was used to extract boundary curves from images of patients with real chest wall zzso zzso the required parameters were extracted from the boundary curves and the targeted indices were zzso zzso the performance of the proposed indices was evaluated using 33 synthetic images and 60 real chest CT images of patients with chest wall zzso The newly proposed indices can be automatically calculated from the original CT images and showed sufficient performance for all types of chest wall zzso We believe that the newly proposed indices can facilitate zzso and postoperative evaluation of chest wall deformities in clinical zzso
