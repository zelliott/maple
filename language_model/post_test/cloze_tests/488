The zzso of the UK Atomic Energy zzso has been the subject of several previous epidemiological zzso 

To detect and investigate associations between mortality rates and employment in a substantially increased cohort size and follow up extended to zzso 

The new cohort included 51 zzso zzso of whom 10 249 were zzso Mortality rates for all workers were low compared to national zzso as were rates in radiation workers and for workers monitored for internal zzso For radiation workers all cause mortality and all cancer mortality were significantly lower than for zzso zzso There was no overall trend of increasing mortality with radiation zzso There was little evidence of raised mortality from zzso The association of prostatic cancer with radiation dose was much less significant than in previous zzso zzso the relatively high mortality from uterine cancers among radiation workers zzso though the numbers were very zzso The association was with endometrial rather than cervical zzso Mortality from cancer of the zzso was high among radiation zzso but was not correlated with zzso 

zzso radiation workers at zzso showed no excess zzso The previously detected association of prostate cancer with high radiation dose may have been a statistical artefact or a risk associated with discontinued zzso zzso cancer occurred at higher rates in female radiation zzso zzso because there was no correlation with zzso may well be due to something other than their radiation zzso Cancer of the zzso in radiation workers was almost certainly related to past zzso zzso
