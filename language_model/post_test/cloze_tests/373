We describe eight members from two large zzso zzso who share a phenotype characterized by zzso zzso retinopathy and zzso global developmental delay and mental zzso zzso short zzso zzso joint zzso small hands and zzso common facial zzso and friendly zzso Several of the children had intermittent zzso The phenotypic occurrence in three siblings coupled with the increased coefficient of inbreeding in the zzso suggested that this disorder is autosomal recessive and due to a single founder zzso Despite similarity to the clinical features of Cohen zzso experienced zzso attending the zzso David zzso Smith zzso suggested the facial zzso of the zzso children was inconsistent with this zzso We mapped the locus responsible for these zzso phenotype to chromosome zzso which contains the recently discovered Cohen syndrome zzso zzso Complete sequencing of the zzso gene identified a likely zzso frameshift mutation and a missense mutation in the zzso zzso A comparison of features among different Cohen syndrome populations with shared linkage to the zzso locus or known zzso gene mutations may allow for the determination of improved clinical criteria on which to suspect the diagnosis of Cohen zzso We conclude that facial zzso seems to be an unreliable indicator of Cohen syndrome between ethnic zzso although it is quite consistent among affected individuals within a particular ethnic zzso Other features common to almost all individuals with proven zzso zzso such as retinal zzso zzso zzso mental zzso global developmental zzso zzso and joint zzso appear to be better clinical indicators of this zzso
