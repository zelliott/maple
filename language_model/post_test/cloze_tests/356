zzso behave as complex, zzso opportunistic dynamic zzso In an attempt to better understand and describe the highly complicated zzso zzso a novel zzso simulation model of in zzso zzso growth and response to zzso has been zzso This paper presents the latest improvements to the model as well as a zzso validation of zzso zzso include an advanced zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso a quantitative consideration of the influence of zzso on zzso and a more zzso imaging based description of the zzso zzso The zzso selected for the validation of the model are a wild type and a zzso zzso gene zzso zzso According to the model predictions, a whole zzso with larger cell cycle duration tends to repopulate more zzso A lower oxygen enhancement ratio value leads to a more zzso whole zzso Higher zzso cell density zzso produces a higher number of zzso zzso cells and, therefore, a more difficult zzso to zzso zzso predictions agree at least zzso with clinical experience, and particularly with the outcome of the zzso zzso Oncology Group zzso Study zzso It is stressed that the model allows a quantitative study of the zzso between the competing influences in a complex, dynamic zzso zzso zzso the model can already be useful as an educational tool with which to study, understand and demonstrate the role of various parameters in zzso growth and response to zzso A long term quantitative clinical adaptation and validation of the model aiming at its integration into the treatment planning procedure is in zzso
