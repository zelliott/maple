Tumours behave as zzso zzso opportunistic dynamic zzso In an attempt to better understand and describe the highly complicated tumour zzso a novel zzso simulation model of in vivo tumour growth and response to radiotherapy has been zzso This paper presents the latest improvements to the model as well as a parametric validation of zzso Improvements include an advanced algorithm leading to conformal tumour zzso a quantitative consideration of the influence of oxygenation on radiosensitivity and a more zzso imaging based description of the neovasculature zzso The tumours selected for the validation of the model are a wild type and a mutated p53 gene glioblastomas zzso According to the model zzso a whole tumour with larger cell cycle duration tends to repopulate more zzso A lower oxygen enhancement ratio value leads to a more radiosensitive whole zzso Higher clonogenic cell density zzso produces a higher number of proliferating tumour cells zzso zzso a more difficult tumour to zzso Simulation predictions agree at least zzso with clinical zzso and particularly with the outcome of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group zzso Study zzso It is stressed that the model allows a quantitative study of the interrelationship between the competing influences in a zzso dynamic tumour zzso zzso the model can already be useful as an educational tool with which to zzso understand and demonstrate the role of various parameters in tumour growth and response to zzso A long term quantitative clinical adaptation and validation of the model aiming at its integration into the treatment planning procedure is in zzso
