Introduction of the yellow obese gene zzso into mice zzso results in obesity and diabetes by 5 weeks of zzso 

Using this model of type 2 zzso we evaluated male and female zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice subjected to myocardial infarction zzso and sacrificed at day zzso zzso 

Despite similar infarct sizes zzso ± zzso for WT and zzso ± zzso for zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso survival was zzso zzso in WT mice and zzso zzso in zzso mice zzso Plasma glucose levels were zzso increased in zzso mice at baseline compared to WT zzso Glucose levels did not change in WT mice but decreased zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso dimensions zzso were smaller and fractional shortening improved in the zzso zzso ± zzso in WT and zzso ± zzso in zzso zzso for zzso The improved cardiac function in zzso was accompanied by reduced macrophage numbers and collagen I and III levels zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso staining for vessel density demonstrated fewer vessels in zzso infarcts zzso ± zzso compared to WT infarcts zzso ± zzso zzso 

In zzso our study in zzso mice revealed a paradoxical reduced zzso survival but improved cardiac function through reduced zzso extracellular matrix zzso and zzso in the infarct zzso These results indicate a zzso effect of obesity in the zzso zzso
