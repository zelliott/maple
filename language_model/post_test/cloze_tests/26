To our zzso no published functional map of the human lower brainstem zzso Our purpose was to use zzso functional MR imaging zzso to visualize the location of cranial nerve zzso nuclei and other zzso zzso and cervical spinal cord nuclei by using specific sensory stimulation or motor zzso 

We localized nuclei by using zzso analysis of regional blood oxygen zzso zzso signal intensity during specific motor and sensory procedures based on known functions of specific zzso Statistical parametric mapping zzso analysis was used for zzso zzso zzso and respiratory motion artifact correction was zzso Histologic atlases aided zzso 

We obtained evidence of localization of the following nuclei by using zzso as zzso main zzso sensory zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso eye zzso facial zzso zzso zzso and lip zzso hypoglossal zzso zzso zzso the tongue against the hard zzso nucleus zzso zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso nucleus zzso finger zzso and cervical spinal cord levels zzso tongue movement to activate the zzso zzso Activation of cortical motor and sensory areas and somatosensory thalamus corresponded with the tasks and sites of brainstem zzso Head movement was zzso typically less than 1 mm in all three zzso 

With zzso zzso the CN nuclei of the pons and zzso and other nuclei of the lower brainstem and cervical spinal zzso can be localized in awake humans with specific sensory stimulation or motor zzso
