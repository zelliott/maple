Studies in B cells from zzso mice have identified zzso as both a kinetic accelerator and negative regulator of signaling through the zzso The signaling properties of bone zzso zzso cells from zzso mice zzso zzso have also been zzso but their signaling phenotype remains zzso We confirm that zzso zzso release more zzso than zzso zzso following zzso zzso and show that multiple zzso cell responses to zzso zzso zzso phosphorylation of receptor subunits and other zzso the activation of zzso zzso zzso the mobilization of zzso the synthesis of phosphatidylinositol zzso the activation of the zzso zzso zzso are slow to initiate in zzso zzso but persist far longer than in zzso zzso zzso studies revealed increased basal as well as stimulated phosphorylation of the Src zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso there was very little basal or stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation or activity of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We speculate that zzso may substitute zzso for zzso in signal initiation in zzso zzso The loss of zzso phosphorylation and activity very likely contributes to the increased levels of phosphatidylinositol zzso and the excess zzso signaling in zzso zzso The unexpected absence of the transient receptor potential zzso zzso from zzso zzso may additionally contribute to their altered signaling zzso
