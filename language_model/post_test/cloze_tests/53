This study examined the effect of leptin on renal zzso zzso which drives the zzso of about zzso of sodium transported in the proximal zzso Chronic leptin administration zzso zzso zzso twice daily for seven zzso increased zzso activity by zzso This effect was prevented by the coadministration of superoxide dismutase zzso zzso or the NADPH oxidase zzso zzso zzso mM in the drinking zzso zzso administered NO donors decreased zzso zzso This effect was abolished by soluble zzso cyclase zzso zzso but not by protein kinase G zzso Exogenous zzso reduced zzso zzso but its synthetic zzso zzso and zzso were zzso The inhibitory effect of NO donors and zzso was abolished by zzso an inhibitor of zzso phosphodiesterase zzso Exogenous cAMP analogue and zzso increased zzso activity and abolished the inhibitory effect of zzso zzso the administration of zzso mixture zzso zzso increased zzso zzso The results suggest that nitric oxide decreases renal zzso activity by stimulating zzso which in turn activates zzso and decreases cAMP zzso Increased production of reactive oxygen species may lead to the elevation of zzso activity by zzso NO and limiting its inhibitory zzso Chronic zzso is associated with increased zzso activity due to excessive oxidative zzso
