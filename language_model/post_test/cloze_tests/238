zzso zzso have attracted considerable interest in the field of zzso due to their ability to transform electrical energy directly into mechanical work through zzso bending, and other zzso In particular, zzso zzso hold great promise for biomedical zzso applications such as zzso drug delivery zzso In such applications, energy consumption rate and durability are key zzso Here, we developed a zzso zzso system that zzso a zzso as the main zzso and tested its performance over 6 months of continuous zzso The proposed zzso system, powered by a single zzso V commercial battery, zzso very little energy (less than 750 zzso per zzso while pumping zzso zzso saline solution under a low zzso (less than 1 zzso and remained fully functional after 6 zzso zzso simulations were conducted to improve the zzso geometry so as to minimize the zzso caused by the zzso mechanism of the zzso Based on the simulation results, an zzso geometry and a stop post were introduced to enhance the pumping zzso To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system as a drug delivery zzso an zzso drug zzso was zzso to human breast cancer cells zzso using the zzso The present study showed that the proposed system can operate continuously for long periods with low energy consumption, powered by a single zzso V battery, making it a promising candidate for an zzso drug delivery zzso
