zzso zzso have attracted considerable interest in the field of microfluidics due to their ability to transform electrical energy directly into mechanical work through zzso zzso and other zzso In zzso zzso zzso hold great promise for biomedical zzso applications such as implantable drug delivery zzso In such zzso energy consumption rate and durability are key zzso zzso we developed a zzso zzso system that utilizes a hydrogel as the main zzso and tested its performance over 6 months of continuous zzso The proposed zzso zzso powered by a single zzso V commercial zzso zzso very little energy zzso than 750 zzso per zzso while pumping zzso zzso saline solution under a low voltage zzso than 1 zzso and remained fully functional after 6 zzso CFD simulations were conducted to improve the microchannel geometry so as to minimize the backflow caused by the zzso mechanism of the zzso Based on the simulation zzso an asymmetric geometry and a stop post were introduced to enhance the pumping zzso To demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed system as a drug delivery zzso an zzso drug zzso was perfused to human breast cancer cells zzso using the zzso The present study showed that the proposed system can operate continuously for long periods with low energy zzso powered by a single zzso V zzso making it a promising candidate for an implantable drug delivery zzso
