zzso zzso zzso zzso a new species of the zzso zzso genus zzso designated as zzso was isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of a patient with zzso sore zzso and zzso typical symptoms of primary zzso zzso zzso caused by zzso zzso The isolate grew at 33 degrees zzso 37 degrees zzso 40 degrees zzso and 42 degrees C and destroyed mammalian cell zzso zzso it did not kill young mice upon zzso zzso zzso zzso does not produce zzso and does not grow on agar plates coated with zzso bacteria such as Escherichia zzso the usual food source of zzso zzso the type species of the zzso The zzso at light microscopy exhibited zzso locomotion and possessed a single vesicular zzso zzso the zzso had numerous mitochondria with zzso zzso but did not have a Golgi zzso The zzso differentiated into cysts after consuming most of the zzso The cyst had an inner zzso zzso and an outer zzso zzso and zzso zzso with no zzso During zzso zzso ruptured the cyst wall and emerged from the zzso A unique feature seen in the cysts was the presence of bacterial zzso both in the zzso and within the cyst zzso zzso sequencing analysis of the 18S and zzso RNA genes of zzso zzso showed that they were distinct from those of other zzso zzso The patient recovered within a few days indicating that some of the previously reported cases of PAM that survived may have been due to zzso zzso
