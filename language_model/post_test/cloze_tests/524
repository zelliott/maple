Autoimmune disease is a disorder of immune system due to the zzso of lymphocytes against zzso own body zzso zzso Antibody zzso is an zzso produced by the immune system directed against the self body tissues or zzso which plays an important role in the diagnosis of autoimmune zzso Indirect zzso zzso method with zzso cells provides the major screening method to detect ANA for the diagnosis of autoimmune zzso Fluorescence patterns at present are usually examined zzso by experienced physicians through manually inspecting the slides with the help of a zzso which usually suffers from zzso variability that limits its zzso Previous researches only provided simple segmentation methods and zzso for cell segmentation and zzso but a fully automatic framework for the segmentation and recognition of zzso cells had never been reported zzso This study proposes a method based on the watershed algorithm to automatically detect the zzso cells with different zzso The experimental results show that the segmentation performance of the proposed method is satisfactory when evaluated with percent volume overlap zzso zzso The classification performance using a SVM classifier designed based on the features calculated from the segmented cells achieves an average accuracy of zzso which outperforms other methods presented in previous zzso The proposed method can be used to develop a zzso system to assist the physicians in the diagnosis of zzso zzso
