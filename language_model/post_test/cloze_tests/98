zzso is known to exert growth inhibition and cell death together with cell cycle arrest and apoptosis in human prostate cancer zzso Whether zzso could inhibit the zzso motility and migration of prostate cancer cells remains largely zzso This study was designed to evaluate this efficacy and possible mechanisms using a novel highly bone metastatic zzso cell zzso 

Four prostate cancer cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used in this zzso These cells were treated with increasing concentrations of zzso zzso zzso and 200 zzso for different periods of zzso After zzso cell zzso of four prostate cancer cells were compared by MTT zzso zzso of zzso cell zzso motility and migration were assessed by cell zzso motility and wound healing zzso The changes of zzso expression were observed by Western zzso and immunofluorescence zzso and the expression of zzso zzso and uPA was analyzed by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso cells showed less sensitivity to the growth inhibition of pharmacological doses of zzso than zzso zzso and DU145 zzso zzso zzso exerted significant zzso and zzso inhibitory effects on the zzso motility and migration of zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso was zzso in a zzso and zzso manner after treatment of zzso 

This study shows that zzso could inhibit the zzso motility and migration of zzso cells via zzso of zzso and zzso and therefore may be a promising agent against prostate cancer bone zzso
