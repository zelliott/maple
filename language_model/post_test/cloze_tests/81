This study specifies a strategy to improve radiotherapy by partial synchronization of zzso cancer cells zzso and zzso in mitosis using zzso with protecting p53 zzso cells zzso by the prior administration of cytostatic zzso zzso and cytostatic effects of ionizing zzso zzso zzso and zzso administrated alone or in combination were investigated in vitro by flow zzso 

A protective effect of zzso but not cisplatin was found after administration of triple sequence with ionizing radiation and zzso It was found that preliminary administration of zzso induced growth arrest and protected A549 cells from the zzso zzso while simultaneously killing zzso and zzso zzso 

The proposed therapeutic strategy allows protection of p53 zzso cells and selectively increases radiosensitivity of zzso cancer zzso
