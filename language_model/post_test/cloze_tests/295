zzso of rates is a basic tool for zzso The methodologies can be classified into direct and indirect zzso The direct methods facilitate a valid comparison between populations or across calendar zzso zzso they suffer from the problem of zzso By zzso the indirect methods achieve maximal precision but may sacrifice a valid zzso comparison zzso the zzso zzso In this zzso we propose a new weighting system to summarize the zzso The weighting system is optimal in the sense that it produces zzso rates which are most stable and ensure a valid comparison between zzso The new weighting system calls for an iterative zzso zzso the procedure simplifies considerably under some zzso We use real and simulated data to demonstrate the new zzso
