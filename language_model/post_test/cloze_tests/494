A technique is developed to minimize magnetic resonance pulse sequence zzso with first and higher moment zzso while imaging in oblique zzso zzso requirements of starting zzso ending zzso zzso and other moment requirements are transformed from the image coordinate system to the physical gradient coordinate zzso where the waveforms are then zzso With this zzso the full capabilities of the gradient hardware are zzso An online algorithm is presented to perform zzso minimization and gradient waveform design when the first moment and area of the zzso are zzso The algorithm is then used to implement zzso zzso in a fast spoiled zzso zzso This results in a minimal increase in TE and TR over an equivalent zzso zzso and little variation in the minimum TR over the entire range of oblique slice zzso Applications of this algorithm extend to the optimization of any pulse sequence in which the first moment is important and oblique imaging is zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
