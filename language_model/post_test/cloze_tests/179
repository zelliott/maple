zzso may play a significant role in the etiology of neuropsychiatric zzso zzso in plasma cortisol zzso glucocorticoid zzso and zzso function often accompany clinical symptoms of zzso illnesses such as zzso and zzso Of particular interest are genetic association studies that link single nucleotide polymorphisms of zzso genes with illnesses only in the context of an zzso trauma exposure such as child zzso These studies suggest that dysregulation of zzso function can have lasting zzso in shaping mood and zzso long after termination of the traumatic zzso As persistent zzso loss of DNA methylation in zzso binding protein 5 zzso was previously observed in the hippocampus and blood and in the neuronal cell line zzso we asked whether these epigenetic alterations occur in zzso zzso relevant zzso We used the pituitary adenoma cell line zzso to demonstrate that the zzso enhancer region of zzso undergoes loss of DNA methylation in response to dexamethasone treatment in a zzso zzso We also focused on the mouse hippocampal dentate gyrus to test whether these changes would be enriched in a region implicated in the zzso stress zzso zzso and synaptic zzso We observed an increase in enrichment of DNA methylation loss in the dentate zzso as compared to whole hippocampal tissues that were similarly treated with zzso We then asked whether DNA methyltransferase 1 zzso a methyltransferase enzyme involved in maintaining DNA methylation following cell zzso is involved in the observed epigenetic zzso We found a zzso decrease of zzso expression in the zzso cells following dexamethasone zzso and a similar decrease in zzso mouse zzso Taken zzso we provide evidence that these zzso epigenetic alterations have a broader validity in zzso cells and that they may involve the DNA methylation zzso
