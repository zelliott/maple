zzso A2B adenosine receptors zzso zzso which are expressed in zzso are mainly activated during brain hypoxia and zzso when large amounts of adenosine are zzso zzso which are also produced at high levels under these zzso may regulate receptor zzso In the present zzso we detected A2B AR in human astrocytoma cells zzso by both zzso and zzso zzso Functional studies showed that the receptor stimulated zzso cyclase through zzso zzso zzso A2B zzso were phosphorylated and zzso following stimulation of the receptors with high agonist zzso Tumour necrosis factor alpha zzso treatment zzso zzso increased A2B AR functional response and receptor G protein zzso without any changes in receptor protein and mRNA zzso zzso markedly reduced zzso receptor phosphorylation on threonine residues and attenuated zzso A2B zzso zzso In the presence of zzso A2B AR stimulation in vitro induced the elongation of astrocytic zzso a typical morphological hallmark of in vivo reactive zzso This event was completely prevented by the selective A2B AR antagonist MRS 1706 and required the presence of zzso These results suggest zzso in zzso zzso zzso selectively modulates A2B AR coupling to G proteins and receptor functional zzso providing new insights to clarify the pathophysiological role of A2B AR in response to brain zzso
