zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso zzso which are expressed in zzso are mainly activated during brain zzso and zzso when large amounts of zzso are zzso zzso which are also produced at high levels under these conditions, may regulate zzso zzso In the present study, we detected zzso zzso in human zzso cells zzso by both zzso and real-time zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso were zzso and zzso following stimulation of the receptors with high zzso zzso zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso treatment zzso zzso increased zzso zzso functional response and zzso G protein zzso without any changes in zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso markedly reduced zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso and attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso stimulation in zzso induced the zzso of zzso zzso a typical zzso hallmark of in zzso zzso zzso This event was completely prevented by the selective zzso zzso zzso MRS zzso and required the presence of zzso These results suggest that, in zzso cells, zzso selectively zzso zzso zzso zzso to G proteins and zzso functional response, providing new insights to clarify the zzso role of zzso zzso in response to brain zzso
