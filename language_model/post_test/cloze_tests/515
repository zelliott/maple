Locus control regions zzso are powerful assemblies of cis elements that organize the actions of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso in the human adenosine zzso zzso gene first zzso which controls expression in zzso is composed of a zzso enhancer domain and extended flanking sequences that facilitate activation from within zzso Prior analyses have demonstrated that the enhancer contains a zzso core region and local adjacent zzso cis zzso We now show that the core contains a single critical zzso binding zzso In both transiently zzso human cells and stable zzso yeast zzso zzso strongly zzso reporter constructs that contained zzso core zzso zzso protein was strongly evident in T lymphoblasts in which the enhancer was active and was localized within discrete nuclear zzso Fetal murine thymus exhibited a striking concordance of endogenous zzso expression with that of mouse ADA and human ADA zzso transgene zzso Point mutation of the zzso site within the intact zzso zzso severely attenuated enhancer activity in zzso and zzso activity in transgenic zzso Within the context of a complex enhancer and zzso zzso can act as an zzso of zzso gene expression via a single binding zzso
