The zzso zzso zzso zzso also called human zzso zzso has been linked to zzso and primary effusion lymphoma zzso in immunocompromised zzso We report that zzso cell lines have constitutive active alternative zzso B pathway and demonstrate zzso expression of zzso zzso precursor and its processed subunit zzso To elucidate the mechanism of activation of the alternative zzso B pathway in zzso zzso we have investigated the role of zzso viral zzso death zzso zzso beta zzso enzyme inhibitory protein zzso zzso We demonstrate that stable expression of zzso but not other zzso in a variety of cell lines constitutively zzso zzso B2 expression and leads to its processing into the zzso zzso zzso zzso and processing of zzso critically depends on the I kappa B kinase zzso subunit of the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso kinase are zzso for this zzso zzso of endogenous zzso expression by siRNA inhibits zzso processing and cellular zzso Our results demonstrate for the first zzso to our zzso that KSHV zzso zzso is required for the growth and proliferation of zzso cells and alternative zzso B pathway plays a key role in this zzso Therapeutic agents targeting the alternative zzso B pathway may have a role in the treatment of zzso zzso
