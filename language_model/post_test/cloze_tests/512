It is unclear whether the increased risk of colon cancer associated with obesity differs for men and women, by distribution of body fat, or by location of the zzso The primary goal of this study was to address these zzso 

zzso subjects from the zzso Study cohort were classified according to body mass index zzso and waist size during two age zzso zzso y zzso and zzso y zzso All eligible men and women were zzso at baseline and had complete information on the following potential zzso age, sex, education, zzso activity, smoking, and zzso There were 157 incident lifetime cases of colon cancer among those followed beginning at zzso y of age and 149 lifetime cases among those whose follow up began at zzso zzso zzso were zzso further by zzso activity, and tumor zzso The Cox zzso zzso Models were used to adjust for possible zzso by the zzso zzso 

A zzso led to a 50% increased risk zzso zzso zzso of colon cancer among middle-aged zzso zzso and a zzso increased risk zzso zzso zzso among older zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect was stronger for men than for women and for cases occurring in the zzso zzso These adverse effects generally diminished when waist was added to the multivariable zzso A larger waist size zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (40 zzso for women and men, zzso was associated with a zzso increased risk of colon zzso this risk increased zzso with increasing waist size and was evident for both zzso and zzso colon zzso There was no zzso of these effects when zzso was added to the multivariable zzso A larger waist had a particularly adverse effect among sedentary subjects zzso risk zzso for middle-aged adults; zzso for older zzso 

These findings suggest that waist circumference is a stronger predictor of colon cancer risk than is zzso and that central obesity is responsible for an increased risk of cancer of both the zzso and zzso zzso
