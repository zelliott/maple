Obesity and stress inhibit insulin action by activating protein kinases that enhance serine phosphorylation of zzso and have been thus associated to insulin resistance and the development of type II zzso The protein kinase C zzso is activated by zzso zzso and its activity is higher in muscle from obese diabetic zzso zzso a molecular link between PKC and insulin resistance has not been defined zzso Here we show that PKC zzso zzso at serine 1101 blocking zzso tyrosine phosphorylation and downstream activation of the Akt zzso zzso of zzso to alanine makes zzso insensitive to the effect of PKC and restores insulin signaling in culture zzso These results provide a novel mechanism linking the activation of PKC to the inhibition of insulin zzso
