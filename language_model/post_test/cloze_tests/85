zzso hybrid nanoparticles with calcium phosphate zzso core and zzso shell were developed to incorporate magnetic resonance imaging zzso contrast agent zzso acid gadolinium zzso zzso for noninvasive diagnosis of solid zzso A zzso preparation method was applied to elaborate hybrid nanoparticles with a zzso hydrodynamic diameter about zzso neutral surface zzso and high colloidal stability in physiological environments by zzso of zzso zzso zzso block zzso zzso and CaP in aqueous zzso followed with zzso zzso Incorporation into the hybrid nanoparticles allowed zzso to show significant enhanced retention ratio in blood zzso leading to high accumulation in tumor positions due to enhanced permeability and retention zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed above 6 times increase of relaxivity in the nanoparticle system compared to free zzso and zzso selective and elevated contrast enhancements in the tumor positions were zzso These results indicate the high potential of zzso zzso CaP nanoparticles as a novel contrast agent for noninvasive cancer zzso
