zzso plasma protein zzso may affect the protein binding and zzso of drugs in the zzso zzso This study examined the effect of zzso increases (in response to zzso in plasma zzso zzso zzso on the plasma zzso of the zzso of zzso during continuous zzso infusion of zzso zzso for zzso pain zzso 

Six patients scheduled for total hip surgery with combined zzso and general zzso received a zzso dose of zzso (65 zzso followed by zzso (8 zzso zzso infusion of zzso zzso zzso for 48 zzso Total and zzso plasma zzso of the zzso of zzso and plasma zzso zzso during the zzso zzso infusion were zzso 

Total plasma zzso of the zzso of zzso increased steadily during the infusion zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso did not change after 12 h zzso zzso zzso Total plasma zzso of zzso were higher than those of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso of zzso were lower than those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso initially zzso but thereafter increased steadily zzso zzso zzso zzso free zzso of the zzso initially increased and then decreased with time zzso zzso zzso Free zzso of zzso were smaller than those of zzso zzso zzso zzso 

The study confirmed that the zzso of zzso are zzso During zzso zzso infusion, changing plasma zzso zzso affect the protein binding of both zzso of zzso zzso total plasma zzso of the zzso increase with time, whereas zzso zzso reach a zzso
