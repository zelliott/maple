zzso syndrome is characterized by episodic zzso and zzso developmental zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and vermian zzso We studied 15 patients with the diagnosis of zzso syndrome to zzso more fully define the zzso clinical zzso and zzso correlate the clinical features with magnetic resonance imaging zzso zzso Eight of 15 patients had a history of episodic zzso and zzso All patients had developmental delay and zzso Of the 13 patients receiving detailed zzso zzso three had optic nerve zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All 13 patients had a normal zzso reflex based on head zzso but had absent to poor ability to cancel the zzso reflex horizontally and zzso Twelve of 13 patients had impaired smooth zzso Twelve of 13 patients had defects in initiation of saccades and quick zzso Two of the most consistent radiologic features were absent or hypoplastic posterior cerebellar zzso and deformed midbrain and zzso zzso which based on ocular motor physiology correlate with the zzso reflex zzso pursuit defect and saccade initiation zzso zzso As a result of zzso zzso and superior cerebellar zzso zzso axial neuroimaging showed a unique zzso zzso appearance of these zzso These results indicate that zzso syndrome results from zzso of the midbrain and cerebellar zzso producing a pathognomonic sign on zzso
