zzso cell lines derived from breast cancer patients constitute one of the zzso of breast cancer zzso To zzso breast cancer cell lines at the genetic level, we have developed a full zzso path bacterial artificial zzso zzso array collection for comparative zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso collection covers zzso of the entire human zzso at a resolution of zzso zzso We have used this platform alongside an in-house produced 17 K zzso zzso set to zzso the genetic and zzso profiles of 24 breast cancer cell lines, as well as cell types derived from zzso zzso We demonstrate that breast cancer cell lines have zzso and zzso features that zzso those of primary breast zzso and can be reliably zzso into zzso and zzso zzso By zzso zzso and zzso data, we have identified zzso genes whose expression correlate with copy number; this list comprised numerous zzso zzso amplified and zzso in breast cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Finally, we demonstrate that although breast cancer cell lines have zzso features usually found in grade III breast zzso zzso gains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso cell lines are zzso by distinct zzso zzso
