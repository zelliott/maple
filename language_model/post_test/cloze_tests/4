Several zzso zzso peptides zzso have recently been shown to display zzso activity via a mechanism that usually zzso the disruption of cancer cell zzso In this work, we designed an zzso zzso zzso zzso whose mechanism of action is designed to take advantage of the zzso zzso composition presented on the outer leaflet of cancer cell zzso which makes the surface of these cells zzso relative to the surface of zzso zzso zzso is designed to remain unfolded and inactive in zzso solution but to zzso fold at the surface of cancer cells, adopting an zzso zzso structure capable of membrane zzso zzso folding is driven by zzso interaction between the zzso and the zzso charged membrane surface of cancer zzso zzso is active against a variety of cancer cell lines such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso toward zzso cells having typical membrane compositions, such as zzso and zzso is zzso CD zzso appropriately designed zzso controls, zzso studies, zzso leakage zzso and electron zzso support the intended mechanism of action, which leads to preferential killing of zzso zzso
