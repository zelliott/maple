Several cationic antimicrobial peptides zzso have recently been shown to display anticancer activity via a mechanism that usually entails the disruption of cancer cell zzso In this zzso we designed an zzso anticancer zzso zzso whose mechanism of action is designed to take advantage of the aberrant lipid composition presented on the outer leaflet of cancer cell zzso which makes the surface of these cells zzso relative to the surface of noncancerous zzso zzso is designed to remain unfolded and inactive in aqueous solution but to preferentially fold at the surface of cancer zzso adopting an zzso zzso structure capable of membrane zzso zzso folding is driven by electrostatic interaction between the peptide and the negatively charged membrane surface of cancer zzso zzso is active against a variety of cancer cell lines such as A549 zzso zzso KB zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the cytotoxicity toward noncancerous cells having typical membrane zzso such as zzso and zzso is zzso CD zzso appropriately designed peptide zzso zzso zzso zzso leakage zzso and electron microscopy support the intended mechanism of zzso which leads to preferential killing of cancerous zzso
