zzso growth zzso zzso is a potent stimulus of connective tissue zzso and is implicated in the pathogenesis of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso functions as a key intracellular signal transducer for zzso zzso responses in normal skin zzso The potential role of zzso in the pathogenesis of zzso was investigated in zzso zzso mice using a model of skin fibrosis induced by subcutaneous injections of zzso At early time zzso zzso macrophage infiltration in the dermis and local zzso production were similar in zzso and zzso zzso In zzso at day zzso lesional skin from zzso mice showed attenuated zzso lower synthesis and accumulation of zzso and reduced collagen gene transcription in zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso tissue growth factor and zzso muscle actin expression in lesional skin were also significantly zzso Electron microscopy revealed an absence of small diameter collagen fibrils in the dermis from zzso zzso zzso Compared to fibroblasts derived from zzso zzso zzso fibroblasts showed reduced in vitro proliferative and zzso responses elicited by zzso zzso these results indicate that ablation of zzso is associated with markedly altered fibroblast regulation in vivo and in zzso and confers partial protection from zzso zzso in zzso Reduced fibrosis is due to deregulated fibroblast zzso as the inflammatory response induced by bleomycin was similar in zzso and zzso zzso
