zzso growth zzso zzso is a potent stimulus of zzso tissue zzso and is implicated in the zzso of zzso and other zzso zzso zzso functions as a key zzso signal zzso for zzso zzso responses in normal skin zzso The potential role of zzso in the zzso of zzso was investigated in zzso zzso mice using a model of skin zzso induced by subcutaneous injections of zzso At early time points, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and local zzso production were similar in zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, at day 28, zzso skin from zzso mice showed attenuated fibrosis, lower synthesis and zzso of zzso and reduced collagen gene zzso in zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso tissue growth factor and zzso muscle zzso expression in zzso skin were also significantly zzso zzso zzso revealed an absence of small diameter collagen zzso in the zzso from zzso zzso zzso Compared to zzso derived from zzso mice, zzso zzso showed reduced in zzso zzso and zzso responses zzso by zzso Together, these results indicate that zzso of zzso is associated with markedly altered zzso regulation in zzso and in zzso and zzso partial protection from zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is due to zzso zzso function, as the inflammatory response induced by zzso was similar in zzso and zzso zzso
