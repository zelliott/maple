zzso node metastasis zzso is recognized as an important factor involved in the tumor malignancy zzso Our previous study has indicated that the zzso cell line with zzso of zzso zzso neoplasia and the zzso cell line with zzso of zzso neoplasia are accompanied with high zzso and low zzso incidences of zzso In the current zzso 62 and 54 protein spots were observed zzso and zzso in zzso cell relative to the zzso cell line with zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso 113 unique proteins were identified by zzso zzso zzso The expression levels of zzso zzso zzso and ER protein 29 were validated by Western zzso zzso The abnormally regulated proteins were categorized and annotated by protein analysis through evolutionary relationships analysis with the aid of the database for zzso visualization and integrated discovery zzso Seventeen gene candidates zzso expressed both at mRNA and protein zzso By making a zzso we detected expression levels of zzso zzso in primary gastric cancer zzso and primary GC cancer tissues with zzso by zzso Higher ratio of positive and strong expressions zzso zzso in GC might correlate with the tumor zzso The repression of zzso zzso inhibits the mobility and invasion abilities of zzso zzso increases the apoptosis rate of zzso zzso Current study narrows and provides certain specific protein candidates potentially playing important roles in zzso zzso
