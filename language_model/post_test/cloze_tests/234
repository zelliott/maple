The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of automated zzso zzso in a zzso zzso of a phantom with 17 synthetic zzso zzso of different sizes zzso zzso zzso was performed at varying tube zzso reconstruction kernels and slice zzso zzso diameter and volume were measured using an automated software zzso zzso were compared with the reference diameter and volume by calculating the absolute percentage error zzso Degree of agreement between software and reference zzso was evaluated by computing corresponding zzso correlation zzso zzso Under varying tube currents the mean zzso zzso varied between zzso and zzso zzso for zzso diameter and between zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso At different reconstruction kernels the mean zzso values ranged between zzso and zzso zzso zzso and between zzso and zzso zzso zzso With different slice thicknesses the mean zzso values differed from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and from zzso to zzso zzso zzso Regarding zzso criteria and volume, automated evaluation of zzso zzso in a phantom demonstrated a high accuracy under varying zzso zzso
