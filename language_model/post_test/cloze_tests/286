zzso epidemiological and clinical evidence have clearly demonstrated the importance of the human apolipoprotein zzso zzso gene cluster in lipid metabolism and heart zzso The transcriptional regulation of these genes determines the level of the encoded proteins and therefore influences the concentration of triglycerides and zzso zzso we analyze the existence of transcription control elements in the zzso kb zzso intergenic region and their influence on the expression of both zzso Two main positive common control elements were found to modulate zzso and zzso expression in HepG2 and in zzso zzso the previously described zzso zzso located zzso kb upstream from the cap site of the zzso and a newly detected activating region located in the center of the intergenic zzso The activity of both elements is highly increased by the hepatic and intestinal transcription factor zzso Analysis of a 641 bp fragment containing the central element showed that it has the properties of a zzso zzso Liver nuclear proteins interact with seven DNA binding sites present in this enhancer and zzso specifically interacts with one of these zzso A third positive zzso situated immediately upstream from the zzso minimal zzso is also activated by zzso zzso this element is not involved in zzso zzso In zzso two negative regions were zzso one located near the zzso gene and the other one between the zzso enhancer and the newly identified central zzso In zzso negative and positive control elements are located in the zzso intergenic zzso including two enhancers important for the expression of the two zzso These results add new evidence that common regulatory elements for the expression of the zzso zzso and zzso genes are interspersed throughout the zzso
