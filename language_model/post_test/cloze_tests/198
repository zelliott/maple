zzso zzso neutralizing antibodies zzso are a major barrier in clinical gene therapy using zzso zzso zzso the transduction profile of zzso vectors in the presence of zzso following intratumoral injection has not been fully zzso although such vectors are often zzso injected in clinical zzso In this zzso we evaluated the correlation between the titer of zzso in the serum and the transduction profiles in the tumor and the liver following intratumoral administration into mice possessing various titers of zzso zzso zzso transduction in the tumor was inhibited by zzso zzso when the titer of zzso was less than zzso the levels of inhibition in the transduction efficiencies within the tumor ranged from approximately zzso to zzso A more than zzso reduction of zzso zzso transduction was found in most of the mice when the titers of zzso were zzso On the other zzso the transduction efficiencies in the liver were largely reduced almost to the levels of the zzso mice even at the low titers of zzso These results provide crucial information for the clinical use of zzso zzso
