Insight into the molecular basis of zzso zzso binding to its receptor has come from receptor mutagenesis and photoaffinity labeling zzso with both contributing to the current hypothesis that the acidic zzso residue within the peptide is situated adjacent to basic zzso in the second loop of the zzso zzso we refine our understanding of this region of interaction by examining a zzso series of these positions within both ligand and receptor and by performing zzso molecular modeling of key pairs of modified ligand and receptor zzso The important roles of zzso and zzso were supported by the marked negative impact on binding and biological response with their natural partner molecule when the receptor residue was replaced by acidic Asp or Glu and when the peptide residue was replaced by basic zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Complementary zzso zzso experiments were unable to regain the lost zzso This was supported by the molecular zzso which demonstrated that the zzso double mutants could not form a good interaction without extensive rearrangement of receptor zzso The models further predicted that zzso and zzso mutations would lead to conformational changes in the extracellular zzso and this was experimentally supported by data showing that these mutations decreased peptide agonist and antagonist binding and increased zzso antagonist zzso These receptor constructs also had increased susceptibility to trypsin degradation relative to the zzso zzso In zzso the relatively conservative zzso mutation had modest negative impact on peptide agonist zzso again consistent with the modeling demonstration of loss of a series of stabilizing zzso and intramolecular zzso The strong correlation between predicted and experimental results support the reported refinement in the zzso structure of the zzso zzso
