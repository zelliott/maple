zzso from the plant zzso zzso induce a variety of zzso and pharmacological responses in living systems, including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The discovery of the zzso receptors zzso and zzso led to the development of zzso and zzso of these receptors for the treatment of a variety of zzso zzso a synthetic zzso of zzso zzso which is the main natural zzso constituent of C zzso was approved by the US zzso for the treatment of zzso and as an zzso for patients undergoing zzso zzso and related cannabinoids are involved in a variety of signal zzso zzso thus, reducing or removing the zzso effects of these compounds would enhance their therapeutic zzso zzso synthesis and qualitative zzso studies are time-consuming activities; however, microbes are effectively the most inventive synthetic chemists because of their zzso zzso This review discusses the potential of C zzso zzso which is zzso as well as zzso to remove the zzso effects of zzso and related zzso and describes the development of a model system for the rapid and cost-effective commercial production of cannabinoids through zzso zzso
