Crosslinking zzso molecules by monoclonal antibodies zzso induces protein tyrosine phosphorylation and results in a secondary elevation of free cytoplasmic calcium concentrations in activated human T zzso Binding of bacterial zzso or zzso to DR molecules on activated T cells was recently reported to induce homotypic aggregation through activation of protein kinase C zzso and mediated by zzso zzso adhesion zzso zzso we report that zzso directed against framework zzso but neither zzso zzso and zzso nor zzso and zzso zzso induced homotypic aggregation of zzso and zzso T zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso cells zzso Protein tyrosine kinase zzso inhibitor zzso A partly blocked zzso aggregation zzso In zzso zzso ester zzso aggregation was essentially zzso A potent inhibitor of zzso zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso aggregation zzso The aggregation responses were completely inhibited by low zzso zzso B and zzso and partly inhibited by EDTA and zzso zzso but unaffected by zzso zzso zzso an zzso cyclase inhibitor zzso and zzso against other adhesion molecules zzso zzso zzso ligand zzso zzso and zzso In zzso HLA zzso aggregation responses in activated T cells appear to involve zzso and PKC activation and to be mediated through zzso and independent adhesion zzso
