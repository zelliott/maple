We have analyzed the molecular mechanism of regulation of the ferric zzso transport system in Escherichia coli zzso by studying the transcription of the regulatory and structural genes under various environmental zzso and by determining the location of their transcriptional start points and promoter zzso We report here that the main species observed in Northern hybridization analyses were a zzso zzso encoded by the outer membrane protein receptor gene zzso and a zzso mRNA encoded by a region including the zzso zzso The synthesis of the zzso zzso mRNA is regulated by both citrate and zzso zzso transcription of zzso is dependent on the presence of zzso The promoter region for the zzso zzso a likely site of action for zzso is not related to the consensus promoter region for sigma 70 RNA polymerase in zzso zzso zzso it shows greatest similarity with promoters of genes regulated by a new zzso of sigma zzso zzso the zzso function zzso sigma zzso which are associated with the expression of genes involved in zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may act as a specialized sigma zzso We also show that the zzso transport genes are linked in operon fashion to zzso Since the levels of the zzso RNAs are extremely zzso as compared to the level of zzso zzso it is likely that processing from the zzso end must occur and stop near the end of zzso where a hairpin structure is zzso
