zzso is known to exert growth zzso and cell death together with cell cycle arrest and zzso in human prostate cancer zzso Whether zzso could inhibit the invasion, zzso and migration of prostate cancer cells remains largely zzso This study was designed to evaluate this efficacy and possible mechanisms using a novel highly bone zzso zzso cell zzso 

Four prostate cancer cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used in this zzso These cells were treated with increasing zzso of zzso zzso 100, and 200 zzso for different periods of zzso After treatment, cell zzso of four prostate cancer cells were compared by zzso zzso zzso of zzso cell invasion, zzso and migration were assessed by cell invasion, zzso and wound healing zzso The changes of zzso expression were observed by Western zzso and zzso zzso and the expression of zzso zzso and zzso was analyzed by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso 

zzso cells showed less sensitivity to the growth zzso of pharmacological doses of zzso than zzso zzso and zzso zzso However, zzso exerted significant zzso and zzso zzso effects on the invasion, zzso and migration of zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso was zzso in a zzso and zzso manner after treatment of zzso 

This study shows that zzso could inhibit the invasion, zzso and migration of zzso cells via zzso of zzso and zzso and therefore may be a promising agent against prostate cancer bone zzso
