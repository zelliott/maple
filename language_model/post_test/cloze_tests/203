Serum leptin concentrations in obese patients are influenced at zzso by a reduction of food zzso The objective of this investigation was to evaluate the relationship between serum leptin level and zzso zzso The zzso behavior and the food and shape attitudes of a group of obese women were assessed by the zzso Disorder Examination zzso and the subscale scores were correlated with serum leptin zzso No difference in serum leptin level was found between obese patients with zzso zzso disorder zzso and their zzso zzso Considering all zzso the serum leptin levels positively correlated with the body mass index values zzso and the zzso subscales scores were positively zzso After controlling for zzso serum leptin level was negatively correlated with the zzso zzso score and positively correlated with the zzso Shape zzso zzso The findings of this investigation indicate that in obese women serum leptin level and the occurrence of zzso zzso are zzso zzso this study also found that the relationship between serum leptin level and zzso over food intake observed in zzso disordered patients and in overweight zzso girls is shared by obese adult zzso In zzso the positive relationship between zzso Shape zzso and serum leptin concentration suggests that the restrained zzso might be the cause rather the consequence of the low leptin zzso
