To compare the effects of insulin zzso zzso and human regular insulin zzso when given twice daily with NPH insulin on glycemic control zzso daily blood glucose profiles and rates of hypoglycemia in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus after failure to respond to sulfonylurea zzso 

A zzso zzso zzso parallel study of 148 patients receiving either LP zzso zzso zzso or HR zzso zzso zzso zzso blood glucose profiles and HbA1c measurements were collected at zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso and zzso zzso blood glucose levels zzso zzso standard zzso were significantly lower for LP than for HR at the end point zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso in both zzso HbA1c improved from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso Hypoglycemia rates were similar during the zzso zzso there was an overnight trend to reduced rates with LP zzso zzso zzso d zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso life assessment showed significant improvement zzso zzso zzso in the zzso worry scale for LP subjects whereas HR subjects slightly zzso 

With traditional zzso insulin administration zzso LP improves zzso postprandial glucose zzso quality of life and overnight hypoglycemia rates while delivering an equivalent level of glycemic control zzso compared with HR to zzso patients with type 2 diabetes who require zzso
