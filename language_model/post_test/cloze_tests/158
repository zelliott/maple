zzso is phosphorylated in zzso T zzso and translocated from the membrane to the cytosol after activation of protein kinase zzso Sequence analysis of zzso revealed that it is identical with zzso a putative zzso and zzso zzso lymphocyte form of zzso exhibits heterogeneity in the apparent molecular mass on zzso 50 and 52 kDa zzso and zzso and each isoform exhibits heterogeneity in the isoelectric zzso when examined by zzso zzso When the two molecular mass variants of zzso were dephosphorylated with alkaline zzso both isoforms showed the same apparent molecular mass of 50 kDa on zzso but could be distinguished by their distinct isoelectric zzso zzso zzso zzso has an acidic pI compared with dephosphorylated zzso zzso Comparison of the peptide maps of purified zzso and zzso on HPLC revealed that the difference was limited to one peptide zzso zzso sequence and mass spectrometric analyses of these peptides showed that the peptides derived from zzso and zzso had the same zzso amino acid sequence up to eight zzso but had distinct molecular zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data suggested that zzso zzso is the product of the previously cloned cDNA and the reduction in the molecular mass of the zzso peptide could be explained by deletion of six amino acid zzso zzso or zzso TRUNCATED AT 250 zzso
