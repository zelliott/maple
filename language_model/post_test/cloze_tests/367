Proper blood vessel formation is essential in health and is often dysregulated in ischaemic zzso zzso regulatory mechanisms that control angiogenesis and zzso are required to improve treatment of ischaemic zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the role of zzso transcription factor zzso overexpression during revascularization in ischaemic zzso 

To assess the effect of zzso overexpression on blood vessel formation in zzso we subjected zzso mice to femoral artery ligation with local intramuscular injection of zzso or green fluorescent protein control zzso zzso Laser Doppler perfusion imaging revealed that zzso enhanced perfusion restoration in mice and immunohistochemistry analysis revealed increased capillary zzso To identify a potential mechanism of zzso in blood vessel zzso a zzso array was zzso zzso overexpression in endothelial cells increased the expression of zzso molecules such as monocyte chemotactic zzso zzso and zzso zzso in vitro and in zzso zzso zzso enhanced monocyte as well as endothelial cell migration in vitro and increased zzso infiltration into ischaemic zzso zzso migration of zzso was antagonized by the presence of an zzso blocking zzso 

Our data suggest that overexpression of zzso enhances blood vessel perfusion in vivo by zzso of zzso and zzso as well as in enhanced zzso infiltration and blood vessel zzso
