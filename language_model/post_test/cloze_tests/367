Proper blood vessel formation is essential in health and is often zzso in zzso zzso zzso regulatory mechanisms that control zzso and zzso are required to improve treatment of zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the role of zzso zzso factor zzso zzso during zzso in zzso zzso 

To assess the effect of zzso zzso on blood vessel formation in zzso we subjected zzso mice to zzso artery zzso with local intramuscular injection of zzso or green fluorescent protein control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso imaging revealed that zzso enhanced zzso restoration in mice and zzso analysis revealed increased zzso zzso To identify a potential mechanism of zzso in blood vessel formation, a zzso array was zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells increased the expression of zzso molecules such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso as well as zzso cell migration in zzso and increased zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso migration of zzso was antagonized by the presence of an zzso blocking zzso 

Our data suggest that zzso of zzso enhances blood vessel zzso in zzso by zzso of zzso and zzso as well as in enhanced zzso zzso and blood vessel zzso
