The capability to zzso zzso evaluations zzso of zzso and others represents a major component of conscious zzso Separate emerging lines of brain activation research examining ME have converged on the medial prefrontal cortex as a common zzso The current functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso study utilized a task that directly compared ME associated with two zzso discrete zzso zzso and a significant other zzso close zzso or zzso Nineteen healthy young adult participants zzso age zzso 9 zzso 10 zzso were required to make zzso decisions based on individually presented trait adjectives across two separate zzso conditions and a zzso control zzso zzso zzso significant zzso zzso and semantic zzso zzso zzso Results of zzso group analyses indicated a common area of medial prefrontal activation during the ME conditions of zzso and zzso versus the baseline semantic zzso zzso A direct comparison of brain activation between the self and other evaluative conditions revealed a right dorsolateral prefrontal response that was significantly more active when making evaluations about the zzso The present study extends upon the prior findings of separate research domains by directly comparing the cerebral response to ME about the self and zzso and finding right PFC activation increases as a function of zzso
