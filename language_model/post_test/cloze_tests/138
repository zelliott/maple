The leaves of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been popularly used in the treatment of diabetes in countries in Latin America and zzso 

To investigate the zzso properties and to determine the molecular mechanism by which the zzso extract of the leaves of zzso zzso reduce blood glucose levels in zzso zzso diabetes in rats via the enzymatic pathway of protein kinase B zzso 

The zzso extract of the leaves of zzso zzso zzso and zzso vehicle and metformin zzso were administered orally to zzso rats zzso for 4 zzso Changes in body zzso food and water zzso fasting glucose levels and oral glucose tolerance were zzso zzso and the expression of zzso in the liver and soleus muscle were determined by Western zzso 

The zzso extract of the leaves of zzso zzso reduced blood glucose levels and improved the metabolic state of the zzso zzso zzso activation was observed in the liver and skeletal muscle of treated rats when compared with untreated zzso 

The results indicate that the zzso extract of the leaves of zzso zzso has zzso properties and possibly acts to regulate glucose uptake in liver and muscles by way of zzso zzso restoring the intracellular energy zzso
