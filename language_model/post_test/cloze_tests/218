Chemotherapy is the preferred therapeutic approach for advanced ovarian zzso but a successful zzso treatment is prevented by the development of drug zzso Recent works have zzso the involvement of zzso zzso microRNAs zzso in cancer zzso with several conjectures regarding their possible involvement in the evolution of drug zzso This study is to investigate the promoting effects and mechanism of zzso involved in the development of zzso in ovarian zzso The different expression of zzso in zzso ovarian cancer cell line zzso and its resistant variant zzso was identified by zzso zzso An in vitro cytotoxicity assay and apoptosis assay using zzso assay and flow zzso were carried out to detect the effect of zzso and zzso on cisplatin resistance of zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and luciferase reporter assay were used to detect whether zzso is a target of zzso As compared with zzso zzso the expression levels of zzso in zzso cells were zzso It was found that the zzso of zzso caused a marked inhibition of zzso cytotoxicity and apoptosis and a subsequent increase in the resistance to cisplatin in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was a direct target of zzso and zzso of zzso suppressed zzso apoptosis and led to an increased resistance to zzso Our study indicates that zzso has a significantly promoting effect on zzso of zzso cells and zzso of zzso expression contributes to cisplatin resistance through suppression of zzso zzso This finding has important implications in the development of targeted therapeutics for overcoming cisplatin resistance in ovarian zzso
