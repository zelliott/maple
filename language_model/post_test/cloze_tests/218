zzso is the preferred therapeutic approach for advanced zzso cancer, but a successful long-term treatment is prevented by the development of drug zzso Recent works have zzso the involvement of zzso zzso zzso zzso in cancer development, with several conjectures regarding their possible involvement in the evolution of drug zzso This study is to investigate the promoting effects and mechanism of zzso involved in the development of zzso in zzso zzso The different expression of zzso in zzso zzso cancer cell line zzso and its resistant zzso zzso was identified by real-time zzso An in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso zzso and flow zzso were carried out to detect the effect of zzso and zzso on zzso resistance of zzso zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso reporter zzso were used to detect whether zzso is a target of zzso As compared with zzso cells, the expression levels of zzso in zzso cells were zzso It was found that the zzso of zzso caused a marked zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and a subsequent increase in the resistance to zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso was a direct target of zzso and zzso of zzso suppressed zzso zzso and led to an increased resistance to zzso Our study indicates that zzso has a significantly promoting effect on zzso of zzso cells and zzso of zzso expression contributes to zzso resistance through suppression of zzso zzso This finding has important implications in the development of targeted zzso for overcoming zzso resistance in zzso zzso
