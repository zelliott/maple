Cardiac differentiation involves a cascade of coordinated gene expression that regulates cell proliferation and matrix protein formation in a defined zzso zzso The zzso transcription factor has been implicated as a critical regulator of multiple zzso genes as well as a regulator of inducible gene expression in response to hypertrophic zzso zzso protein kinase zzso signal transduction pathways are among the most widespread mechanisms of eukaryotic cell zzso The zzso function inside the nucleus and target transcription factors that are zzso to zzso Many transcription factors are probably important zzso zzso zzso we have cloned a new zzso gene named zzso using degenerate primers from an early embryo heart cDNA zzso which mapped to zzso The zzso gene consists of zzso nucleotides and encodes a protein of 499 amino acids with an zzso zzso domain and eleven zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern blot analysis indicates that a zzso kb transcript specific for zzso is expressed in zzso skeletal zzso and zzso at adult stage and is expressed in most of the examined embryonic zzso especially at a higher level in skeletal zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein distributes evenly in nuclei when overexpressed in the zzso zzso gene assays show that zzso is a transcriptional repressor and overexpression of zzso in the zzso cells inhibits the transcriptional activities of zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso is a member of the zzso transcription factor family and may be involved in the heart zzso and it probably works as a negative regulator in zzso signaling zzso
