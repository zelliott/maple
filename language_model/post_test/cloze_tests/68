zzso differentiation involves a cascade of coordinated gene expression that regulates cell proliferation and zzso protein formation in a defined zzso zzso The zzso zzso factor has been implicated as a critical regulator of multiple zzso genes as well as a regulator of zzso gene expression in response to zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso signal zzso pathways are among the most widespread mechanisms of zzso cell zzso The zzso function inside the nucleus and target zzso factors that are zzso to zzso Many zzso factors are probably important zzso zzso Here, we have cloned a new zzso gene named zzso using zzso zzso from an early zzso heart zzso library, which mapped to zzso The zzso gene consists of zzso zzso and encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with an zzso zzso domain and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicates that a zzso zzso transcript specific for zzso is expressed in heart, skeletal muscle, and zzso at adult stage and is expressed in most of the examined embryonic zzso especially at a higher level in skeletal muscle, heart, and zzso zzso protein distributes evenly in zzso when zzso in the zzso zzso gene zzso show that zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in the zzso cells zzso the zzso activities of zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso is a member of the zzso zzso factor family and may be involved in the heart development, and it probably works as a negative regulator in zzso signaling zzso
