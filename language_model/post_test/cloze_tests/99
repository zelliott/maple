In Compton cameras, the measured scattering angle is associated with an uncertainty which becomes larger as the incident zzso energy zzso Since this uncertainty degrades the spatial resolution of reconstructed images, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 48 zzso previously revised their zzso reconstruction zzso to compensate for zzso As the new zzso improved the spatial resolution in effect, they expected an enhancement of the statistical zzso In this paper, the effect of this compensation has been zzso in view of spatial resolution (the zzso of the zzso reconstructed image for a point source zzso statistical noise (the relative standard zzso of reconstructed images for an zzso source zzso and image quality (the zzso of reconstructed images for a zzso The results describe not only the effect of the compensation, but also the relation between the statistical noise and three zzso zzso the incident zzso energy, the spatial resolution and the measured total event numbers, in reconstruction with zzso This relation should be taken into account for the design of Compton cameras with good quality images, zzso useful image, zzso
