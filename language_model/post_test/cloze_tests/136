After an early report that patients treated with zzso enzyme zzso inhibitors had a lower than expected incidence of zzso there was a large number of publications investigating the possible pathophysiological mechanism mediating this zzso as well as population studies comparing the incidence of cancers in patients treated with agents inhibiting the zzso system with their incidence in the general zzso Several mechanisms are proposed to explain a potential zzso activity of such agents in vitro in experimental animal zzso zzso the population studies are mostly zzso although they do suggest a possible interaction between ACE genotypes and susceptibility to altered behaviour of certain zzso
