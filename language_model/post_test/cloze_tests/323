zzso is one of the most potent chemotherapeutic agents for the treatment of many types of solid zzso zzso it is not the zzso drug for prostate cancer zzso because prostate tumour cells exhibit intrinsic and acquired resistance to zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso a novel zzso zzso with low zzso inhibits lung and ovarian carcinoma cell growth in zzso In the present zzso we explored the therapeutically zzso effect of zzso on cisplatin zzso efficacy in zzso prostate cancer cells as well as the underlying zzso zzso significantly increased cisplatin cytotoxicity in the zzso prostate carcinoma cell lines DU145 and zzso In zzso zzso markedly promoted zzso apoptotic cell death in both cell zzso as determined by three different apoptosis zzso zzso augmented the zzso activation of zzso and zzso cleavage of zzso and zzso suppression of zzso and zzso zzso and release of cytochrome c from mitochondria in these zzso zzso zzso enhancement of zzso apoptosis via mitochondrial activation of the zzso apoptotic pathway may account for the augmented zzso potency of cisplatin in prostate zzso zzso combined with zzso as a zzso or adjuvant warrants further study and may be potentially useful as a zzso treatment of zzso prostate zzso
