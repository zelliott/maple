zzso kinase zzso zzso is essential in the maintenance of cellular energetic economy in cells of fully differentiated tissues with highly variable energy zzso such as muscle and zzso To investigate if AK zzso have a comparable function in the zzso management of proliferating zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in mouse neuroblastoma zzso cells and in human colon carcinoma zzso zzso Glucose zzso zzso zzso and metabolic inhibitor tests revealed a differential energy dependency for these two cell zzso zzso cells showed a faster proliferation rate and strongest coupling to mitochondrial zzso zzso proliferation was more dependent on zzso Despite these zzso ectopic expression of zzso or zzso did not affect their growth characteristics under normal zzso zzso no differential effects were seen under metabolic stress upon treatment with mitochondrial and glycolytic inhibitors in in vitro culture or in solid tumors grown in zzso Although many intimate connections have been revealed between cell death and zzso our results suggest that zzso or zzso zzso zzso transfer is not a modulating factor in the survival of tumor cells during episodes of metabolic zzso
