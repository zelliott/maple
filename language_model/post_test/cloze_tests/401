Obstructive sleep apnea zzso is associated with cognitive impairments in working memory zzso zzso activation during WM tasks can be indirectly assessed by blood oxygen zzso functional magnetic resonance imaging zzso The purpose of this study was to describe zzso responses during 2 separate working memory tasks and a finger tapping task in men with zzso A secondary aim was to explore the possible relation between OSA severity zzso zzso and zzso signal zzso 

Nine zzso men zzso age zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with OSA underwent BOLD fMRI testing on a zzso zzso MRI zzso During zzso subjects performed a Paced Auditory Serial Addition task zzso an auditory zzso task zzso zzso and an alternating finger zzso 

zzso and zzso tasks produced similar patterns of increased bilateral activation in posterior zzso prefrontal and cerebellar zzso BOLD signal zzso were observed within posterior zzso zzso and inferior frontal regions during zzso and zzso but not during zzso With increased disease zzso BOLD activation patterns were increased in the right parietal zzso but decreased in the cerebellar zzso 

These preliminary findings suggest that the severity of OSA may correlate with neural activation during tasks of working zzso potentially reflecting compensatory neural responses in severe zzso
