Reliable screening of mechanical prosthetic mitral valve zzso dysfunction by transthoracic echocardiography zzso is mandatory because transesophageal echocardiography zzso zzso be routinely zzso zzso acoustic shadowing seriously hampers detection of zzso dysfunction with zzso particularly zzso To identify zzso indexes that can detect zzso dysfunction zzso or zzso 134 patients zzso 60 zzso 12 zzso 64 zzso with zzso who underwent zzso and TEE within 3 zzso 5 days were zzso There were 73 normal and 61 zzso valves zzso zzso 21 zzso By multivariate zzso peak E velocity was the best predictor of a zzso zzso Both peak E velocity zzso zzso or zzso zzso sensitivity zzso specificity zzso and the ratio of zzso integrals of flow through the prosthesis to that of the left ventricular outflow zzso zzso or zzso sensitivity zzso specificity zzso were successful in detecting zzso zzso Although pressure zzso zzso readily identified zzso zzso it did not detect zzso Logistic models including peak E velocity and zzso or zzso were equally successful in detecting zzso zzso zzso all 3 variables were needed to best distinguish among zzso zzso and regurgitant zzso A peak E velocity zzso or zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso or zzso predicted valve regurgitation in zzso of valves when zzso was zzso 130 zzso and valve stenosis in zzso when zzso was zzso zzso zzso a peak E velocity zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso and a zzso zzso 130 ms had a predictive accuracy for a normal valve of zzso zzso zzso Doppler indexes can be used as screening parameters of zzso dysfunction and help select patients for further diagnostic evaluation with zzso
