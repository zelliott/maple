Reliable screening of mechanical prosthetic zzso valve zzso dysfunction by zzso zzso zzso is mandatory because zzso zzso zzso cannot be routinely zzso However, acoustic zzso seriously zzso detection of zzso dysfunction with zzso particularly zzso To identify zzso indexes that can detect zzso dysfunction zzso or zzso zzso patients (age 60 zzso 12 years, 64 zzso with zzso who underwent zzso and zzso within 3 zzso 5 days were zzso There were 73 normal and 61 dysfunctional valves (40 zzso 21 zzso By zzso analysis, peak E zzso was the best predictor of a dysfunctional zzso Both peak E zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso sensitivity zzso specificity zzso and the ratio of zzso zzso of flow through the zzso to that of the left zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso sensitivity zzso specificity zzso were successful in detecting zzso zzso Although pressure zzso zzso readily identified zzso zzso it did not detect zzso zzso models including peak E zzso and zzso or zzso were equally successful in detecting zzso zzso However, all 3 variables were needed to best distinguish among normal, zzso and zzso zzso A peak E zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso ratio zzso or zzso predicted valve zzso in zzso of valves when zzso was zzso 130 zzso and valve zzso in zzso when zzso was zzso zzso zzso a peak E zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso and a zzso zzso 130 zzso had a zzso accuracy for a normal valve of zzso Thus, zzso zzso indexes can be used as screening parameters of zzso dysfunction and help select patients for further diagnostic evaluation with zzso
