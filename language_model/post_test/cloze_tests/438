Pancreatic cancer zzso is one of the most zzso zzso and currently incurable cancers with a poor survival zzso Eukaryotic elongation zzso kinase zzso is an atypical zzso whose role in PaCa survival is not yet zzso zzso we show that zzso is overexpressed in PaCa cells and its zzso induces apoptotic cell zzso zzso zzso a zzso compound initially identified as a zzso zzso induces apoptosis and zzso in a variety of cancer cells including PaCa zzso We demonstrated that zzso induces intrinsic zzso with dissipation of mitochondrial membrane potential zzso and stimulates extrinsic apoptosis with concomitant induction of zzso apoptosis inducing ligand zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso while none of these effects were dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at mRNA zzso and induce zzso protein degradation through zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso the events observed after zzso zzso while its zzso suppressed the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulates the expression of tissue zzso zzso an enzyme previously implicated in zzso drug resistance and survival of cancer zzso Inhibition of zzso axis leads to zzso apoptosis which is associated with induction of zzso factor zzso zzso these results zzso for the first zzso that the zzso of zzso leads to induction of zzso extrinsic as well as zzso apoptosis in PaCa zzso suggesting that zzso may represent an attractive therapeutic target for the future anticancer agents in zzso
