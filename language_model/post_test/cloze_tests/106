zzso stress has been implicated in the cell death that occurs after zzso of the brain, which causes the production of zzso oxygen species and a decrease in zzso leading to zzso zzso However, the invasive methods used to collect much of this evidence are themselves stress zzso which could skew the zzso In this study, we aimed at demonstrating brain zzso zzso after zzso zzso using zzso magnetic resonance zzso The reduction rate of zzso zzso a zzso contrast agent, was used as an index of the zzso status in zzso No changes were observed in the zzso zzso the zzso complex activity, or in the zzso status image intensity after 3 h of zzso following transient middle cerebral artery zzso however, after 24 h of zzso the zzso reduction rate, calculated from continuous images, had decreased zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the concentration of zzso acid in the zzso zzso and the activity of zzso complex II had also zzso Thus, the zzso imaging of the brain zzso zzso faithfully reflected changes in zzso levels and in zzso complex II activity after zzso
