zzso stress has been implicated in the cell death that occurs after zzso of the zzso which causes the production of reactive oxygen species and a decrease in zzso leading to mitochondrial zzso zzso the invasive methods used to collect much of this evidence are themselves stress zzso which could skew the zzso In this zzso we aimed at demonstrating brain redox alterations after zzso zzso using zzso magnetic resonance zzso The reduction rate of zzso zzso a zzso contrast zzso was used as an index of the redox status in zzso No changes were observed in the antioxidant zzso the mitochondrial complex zzso or in the redox status image intensity after 3 h of zzso following transient middle cerebral artery zzso zzso after 24 h of zzso the zzso reduction zzso calculated from continuous zzso had decreased zzso zzso biochemical assays showed that the concentration of ascorbic acid in the ischemic hemisphere and the activity of mitochondrial complex II had also zzso zzso the noninvasive imaging of the brain redox alterations faithfully reflected changes in antioxidant levels and in mitochondrial complex II activity after zzso
