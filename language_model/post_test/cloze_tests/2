The cultured cell lines zzso ascites zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso cell line derived from human lung cancer of the zzso cell zzso and zzso cell line derived from zzso lymphoma have been used for the zzso kinetics study of anticancer agents and evaluation of the sensitivity of cells using the soft agar cloning assay zzso It has been found that there are 2 types of zzso zzso Type I zzso and zzso zzso The dose survival curves of Type I agents fit the equation log zzso zzso zzso surviving zzso zzso concentration of zzso n and k are zzso The sensitivity of cells can be expressed by mean lethal dose zzso zzso Four cell lines were compared on this zzso and some problems concerning the chemotherapy of human cancer are zzso zzso agents and anticancer antibiotics belonged to this zzso Type II zzso and zzso zzso The dose survival curves fit the Gompertz equation zzso zzso zzso population reduction zzso zzso zzso The exposure survival curve is negative zzso indicating that exposure time rather than concentration is the key zzso effective cell killing of Type II zzso Difficulties in expression of sensitivity to Type II agents are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso belonged to this zzso The zzso kinetics of anticancer agents and comparison of the sensitivity of cells may provide some indications not only of optimal dosage schedules but also of a new approach in screening systems for truly effective agents for human zzso
