The cultured cell lines zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso cell line derived from human lung cancer of the zzso cell type, and zzso cell line derived from zzso zzso have been used for the zzso zzso study of zzso agents and evaluation of the sensitivity of cells using the soft zzso cloning zzso zzso It has been found that there are 2 types of zzso 1) Type I zzso and zzso zzso The dose survival zzso of Type I agents fit the equation log zzso zzso zzso surviving zzso D, concentration of zzso zzso and k are zzso The sensitivity of cells can be expressed by mean lethal dose zzso zzso Four cell lines were compared on this basis, and some problems concerning the chemotherapy of human cancer are zzso zzso agents and zzso antibiotics belonged to this zzso Type II zzso and zzso zzso The dose survival zzso fit the zzso equation zzso zzso zzso population reduction zzso zzso zzso The exposure survival curve is negative zzso indicating that exposure time rather than concentration is the key zzso effective cell killing of Type II zzso zzso in expression of sensitivity to Type II agents are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso belonged to this zzso The zzso zzso of zzso agents and comparison of the sensitivity of cells may provide some indications not only of optimal dosage schedules but also of a new approach in screening systems for truly effective agents for human zzso
