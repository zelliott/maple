zzso swelling is an integral component of zzso brain zzso in zzso zzso While mechanisms underlying zzso swelling are likely zzso zzso stress and zzso dysfunction are hypothesized to contribute to such zzso We investigated the protective effects of cinnamon zzso extract zzso that has zzso and zzso effects on cell swelling and zzso of the inner zzso membrane potential zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were subjected to zzso deprivation zzso and cell volume determined using the zzso method at 90 zzso after the end of zzso When compared with controls, zzso increased cell volume by zzso This increase was blocked by zzso or insulin but not by zzso of zzso stress including vitamin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso dysfunction, a key component of zzso injury, contributes to cell zzso Changes in zzso were assessed at the end of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso induced a zzso decline in zzso and this decline was blocked by zzso as well as zzso To test the involvement of the zzso zzso transition zzso we used zzso A zzso an zzso and a blocker of the zzso zzso zzso blocked cell swelling and the decline in zzso but zzso an zzso that does not block the zzso did zzso Our results show that zzso reduces zzso cell swelling as well as the decline in zzso in cultures and some of its protective effects may be through zzso the zzso
