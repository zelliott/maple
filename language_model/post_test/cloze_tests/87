zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso agents used for the treatment of zzso zzso zzso However, zzso has precluded the use of zzso alone in clinical zzso Combination therapies with zzso and other zzso agents are considered to be a therapeutic option for patients with zzso We previously reported that the expression of zzso growth factor zzso zzso III zzso can decrease the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso To overcome this problem, in this study, we zzso the mechanism underlying zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso expression can induce zzso zzso and the ensuing zzso of the zzso factor zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso which may lead to drug zzso zzso we found that zzso a zzso zzso directed against zzso and zzso together had an additive zzso effect on zzso zzso zzso and significantly improved survival in all mice with established tumors when compared with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso alone, the combination more noticeably zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the expression of the zzso protector zzso and the cell cycle regulator zzso zzso Additionally, the combination zzso the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor zzso in in zzso zzso More interestingly, zzso treatment zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso at the zzso and protein zzso zzso these observations suggest that the combination of zzso with zzso zzso is a potential means of zzso zzso zzso resistance in zzso
