zzso zzso is one of the most common chemotherapeutic agents used for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma zzso zzso zzso has precluded the use of zzso alone in clinical zzso Combination therapies with zzso and other anticancer agents are considered to be a therapeutic option for patients with zzso We previously reported that the expression of epidermal growth factor receptor variant III zzso can decrease the sensitivity of HCC cells to zzso To overcome this zzso in this zzso we elucidated the mechanism underlying zzso zzso zzso We observed that zzso expression can induce zzso downregulation and the ensuing upregulation of the transcription factor zzso and the enzyme zzso synthase zzso which may lead to drug zzso zzso we found that zzso a monoclonal antibody directed against zzso and zzso together had an additive antitumor effect on zzso HCC xenografts and significantly improved survival in all mice with established tumors when compared with either zzso or zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso the combination more noticeably downregulated EGFR phosphorylation and Akt phosphorylation as well as the expression of the apoptotic zzso zzso and the cell cycle regulator cyclin zzso zzso the combination upregulated the expression of the cell cycle inhibitor zzso in in vivo zzso More zzso zzso treatment upregulated zzso and downregulated zzso and TS at the mRNA and protein zzso zzso these observations suggest that the combination of zzso with mAb zzso is a potential means of zzso zzso zzso resistance in zzso
