A method for the simultaneous determination of zzso in water and urine samples by zzso in a zzso syringe zzso with LC is zzso zzso is a new miniaturized SPE technique that can be used with chromatographic instruments without any zzso In zzso approximately 1 mg of the solid packing material is inserted into a syringe zzso zzso as a zzso Sample preparation takes place on the packed zzso The new method is zzso easy to zzso zzso and zzso The determination of zzso in groundwater and urine was performed using zzso as a sample preparation method with zzso zzso Four quinolone zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso groundwater and urine samples were used as zzso The extraction recovery was found to be between zzso and zzso The results showed high correlation coefficients zzso zzso zzso for all of the analytes within the calibration zzso The LOQ was between zzso and zzso zzso
