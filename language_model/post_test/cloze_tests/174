Lack of receptor tyrosine kinase zzso a zzso nerve growth factor zzso zzso is closely associated with the malignant progression of neuroblastoma zzso and its zzso zzso zzso zzso analogs inhibit the activity of protein tyrosine phosphatases zzso which causes hydrolysis of the phosphate groups bound to the tyrosine residues on tyrosine zzso resulting in sustained tyrosine zzso 

In order to reverse this abnormal zzso signal transduction in NB zzso we synthesized new zzso analogs and examined their activity against NB zzso 

zzso analogs increased or maintained the expression level of zzso mRNA in the NB zzso which express the downstream genes of zzso signal zzso zzso the expression level of zzso zzso which is a marker of neurite zzso and neuronal zzso was increased and morphological differentiation was also zzso zzso analogs zzso zzso zzso continued to express zzso and zzso mRNAs and induced differentiation of NB cells after stimulation of zzso by strong inhibition of zzso without affecting zzso zzso 

zzso zzso analogs may have potential as clinical therapeutic agents for zzso
