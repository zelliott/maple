The human nucleus zzso zzso plays an important role in motivation and emotional processes and is involved in some of the most disabling zzso disorders such as Parkinson's disease zzso The purpose of our study was to check out the potential existence of a statistically significant difference in zzso size between zzso and zzso individuals, through studying brain magnetic resonance images zzso 

For our study we used 52 zzso from 26 cerebral zzso from zzso zzso Of these zzso 15 were zzso from patients with advanced zzso who underwent bilateral deep brain stimulation of the zzso zzso The group of zzso zzso came from the rest 11 zzso We measured the absolute and relative zzso maximum zzso diameter zzso zzso and absolute and relative zzso zzso at a specific zzso zzso 

We found a statistically significant difference of the mean value of the D zzso zzso and zzso between the two zzso The mean percentage reduction of the zzso size was zzso represented by the relative D zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the first report of zzso shrinkage of the human zzso Further research is needed to identify whether a respective shrinkage is also observed in patients with early zzso and whether this zzso is correlated with zzso zzso symptoms (perhaps zzso by a malfunctioning zzso that occur in zzso
