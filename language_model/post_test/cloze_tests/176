The human nucleus zzso zzso plays an important role in motivation and emotional processes and is involved in some of the most disabling neuropsychiatric disorders such as zzso disease zzso The purpose of our study was to check out the potential existence of a statistically significant difference in NA size between parkinsonian and zzso zzso through studying brain magnetic resonance images zzso 

For our study we used 52 zzso from 26 cerebral MRIs from neurosurgical zzso Of these zzso 15 were preoperative from patients with advanced PD who underwent bilateral deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic zzso The group of zzso MRIs came from the rest 11 zzso We measured the absolute and relative NA maximum transverse diameter zzso zzso and absolute and relative NA width at a specific transverse zzso 

We found a statistically significant difference of the mean value of the D zzso zzso and zzso between the two zzso The mean percentage reduction of the NA size was zzso represented by the relative D zzso 

To our zzso this is the first report of zzso shrinkage of the human zzso Further research is needed to identify whether a respective shrinkage is also observed in patients with early PD and whether this atrophy is correlated with dopaminergic neuropsychiatric symptoms zzso mediated by a malfunctioning zzso that occur in zzso
