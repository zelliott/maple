To demonstrate the feasibility of dynamic magnetic resonance imaging zzso with zzso temporal resolution zzso zzso for analyzing the zzso closure in comparison with multiview zzso 

Seven patients zzso females and four zzso zzso years zzso mean zzso zzso with suspected zzso zzso and one healthy volunteer were examined with zzso and zzso MRI using a zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso slice zzso zzso six images per zzso Imaging was done during phonation in all three image zzso The results were analyzed by two radiologists in comparison with zzso as the standard of reference for overall image quality and the pattern of zzso zzso 

zzso MRI correctly depicted the pattern of zzso closure in correspondence to zzso in all zzso Concerning the movement of the pharyngeal zzso zzso MRI falsely depicted a general movement of the dorsal pharyngeal wall in one zzso whereas zzso showed no zzso In one zzso zzso MRI provided additional information by showing an asymmetric movement of the lateral pharyngeal walls that could not be depicted by zzso due to technical zzso Concerning image zzso the coronal plane was more difficult to evaluate with zzso MRI compared to zzso The axial plane was easier to analyze in zzso MRI compared to zzso 

zzso MRI has the potential to depict the pattern of zzso closure in close correlation with zzso and may deliver additional information in selected zzso
