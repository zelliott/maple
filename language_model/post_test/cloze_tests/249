zzso zzso was prepared via zzso reaction and central composite design zzso technique was applied to study the effects of reaction time, temperature, the pH value of the buffer solution on the degree of graft zzso content of the zzso zzso and zzso stability zzso of the zzso zzso Fluorescence zzso as well as several other techniques including sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso infrared spectrum zzso and differential scanning zzso zzso were employed to study the possible differences between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso possessed distinct properties from zzso and had the great potential to be used as the drug carrier for zzso
