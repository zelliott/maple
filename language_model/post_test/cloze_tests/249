zzso BSA was prepared via zzso reaction and central composite design zzso technique was applied to study the effects of reaction zzso zzso the pH value of the buffer solution on the degree of graft zzso content of the zzso zzso and zzso stability zzso of the resultant zzso Fluorescence spectra as well as several other techniques including sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis zzso infrared spectrum zzso and differential scanning calorimetry zzso were employed to study the possible differences between the glycosylated BSA and zzso zzso albumin possessed distinct properties from BSA and had the great potential to be used as the drug carrier for zzso
