In Compton zzso the measured scattering angle is associated with an uncertainty which becomes larger as the incident zzso energy zzso Since this uncertainty degrades the spatial resolution of reconstructed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 48 zzso previously revised their analytical reconstruction algorithm to compensate for zzso As the new algorithm improved the spatial resolution in zzso they expected an enhancement of the statistical zzso In this zzso the effect of this compensation has been analysed in view of spatial resolution zzso FWHM of the zzso reconstructed image for a point source zzso statistical noise zzso relative standard deviation of reconstructed images for an isotropic source zzso and image quality zzso roughness of reconstructed images for a zzso The results describe not only the effect of the zzso but also the relation between the statistical noise and three zzso zzso the incident zzso zzso the spatial resolution and the measured total event zzso in reconstruction with zzso This relation should be taken into account for the design of Compton cameras with good quality zzso zzso useful zzso zzso
