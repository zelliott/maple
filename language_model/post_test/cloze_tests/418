zzso endocrine zzso zzso cells zzso and zzso in their zzso migration from neural crest to zzso may become zzso in the zzso or in other ectopic zzso They may become zzso adenomatous or zzso Eight illustrative patients are zzso One patient had zzso zzso with zzso zzso pancreatic zzso normal zzso biologically active zzso but inert zzso to the usual parathyroid zzso Two had zzso malignancies in the zzso zzso after zzso but eventual recurrence of the syndrome due to zzso cell hyperplasia required total zzso One patient had a gastric corpus zzso found prospectively with zzso which required excision of the zzso One patient had zzso with zzso and antral zzso treated by pituitary zzso One patient had the antral or intermediary type of the zzso syndrome with moderate zzso duodenal ulcer and antral zzso treated by vagotomy and zzso One patient had hyperparathyroidism with antral zzso treated by zzso One patient had malignant zzso syndrome and developed associated thyroid zzso cell hyperplasia and parathyroid chief cell zzso treated by total gastrectomy and multiple endocrine zzso These investigative observations demonstrate ectopic loci and associated hyperplasias which support the concept of migration and zzso potentiality of zzso cells of the zzso
