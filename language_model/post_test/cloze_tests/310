zzso of the p53 tumor suppressor gene has been reported to be a prognostic factor in several human cancer zzso Normal function of the gene is affected by deletion in one zzso dysfunction of the other allele is often caused by a zzso In tumors of heterozygous zzso deletion of one allele can be detected as loss of heterozygosity zzso A recently found variable number of tandem repeats zzso segment in intron 1 of the p53 gene seems to be highly polymorphic zzso zzso a very useful marker in detecting LOH in various types of tumor zzso We in vitro amplified the VNTR segment from genomic DNA samples of 101 lung cancer patients and run conventional agarose gel electrophoreses in order to detect the alleles of various zzso differing by the number of zzso The usefulness of the method was studied using DNA from white blood cell samples and from fresh and zzso zzso tumor zzso Of the zzso zzso were found to have two different zzso zzso were informative in this zzso In zzso of the lung tumors from the informative zzso LOH in the p53 suppressor gene was zzso
