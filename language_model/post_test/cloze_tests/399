Depression has been associated with increased risk of cardiovascular zzso The inflammatory marker zzso protein zzso has also been identified as an independent predictor of zzso and zzso cardiovascular disease zzso Inflammation may influence the relationship between depression and cardiovascular zzso 

The objective of this study was to investigate the association between symptoms of depression and zzso CRP zzso in an obese clinical zzso We also sought to determine whether this relationship was different in men and zzso given prior reports of a gender zzso 

Symptoms of depression and zzso were measured in 390 participants enrolled in a weight loss intervention trial that was delivered in a primary care zzso Symptoms of depression were evaluated with the Patient Health zzso zzso in which a score ≥ 10 is consistent with major zzso 

A total of 58 zzso participants reported a zzso score ≥ zzso The median zzso zzso zzso concentration was significantly higher in participants with symptoms consistent with major depression zzso zzso mg zzso compared with those without depression zzso zzso mg zzso zzso Symptoms consistent with major depression were significantly associated with zzso zzso concentrations in an analysis adjusted for zzso zzso obesity class and other metabolic variables zzso When interaction by gender was zzso this relationship remained significant in men zzso but not in women zzso 

Symptoms consistent with major depression were significantly associated with zzso in men zzso even after adjusting for zzso obesity zzso metabolic variables and medications known to affect zzso This finding suggests that there are biologic differences between men and women that may modify the relationship between zzso and zzso Further studies are needed to elucidate the biologic basis for these zzso
