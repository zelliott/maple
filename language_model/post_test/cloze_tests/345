zzso of the mammalian CNS lose the ability to zzso soon after development due to both an inhibitory CNS environment and the loss of zzso factors necessary for zzso The complex molecular events required for robust regeneration of mature neurons are not fully zzso particularly in zzso To identify genes affecting axon regeneration in Caenorhabditis zzso we performed both an zzso screen for defective motor axon regeneration in zzso mutants and a candidate gene zzso From these zzso we identified at least 50 conserved genes with zzso or zzso zzso Through our analysis of zzso we shed new light on certain aspects of zzso including the role of zzso and membrane zzso the antagonistic activity of MAP kinase signaling zzso and the role of stress in promoting axon zzso Many gene candidates had not previously been associated with axon regeneration and implicate new pathways of interest for therapeutic zzso
