It is now widely accepted that the zzso nutritional environment is important in determining susceptibility to metabolic zzso In zzso zzso growth restriction followed by accelerated postnatal growth is associated with an increased risk of zzso zzso diabetes and other features of the metabolic zzso The mechanisms underlying these observations are not fully zzso 

Using a zzso maternal zzso rodent zzso our aim was to determine if exposure to mismatched nutrition in zzso programmes adipose tissue structure and zzso and expression of key components of the zzso zzso 

zzso of dams fed a zzso zzso diet during pregnancy were zzso by control zzso dams to drive zzso zzso This zzso group was compared with offspring of dams fed a zzso protein diet during pregnancy and lactation zzso zzso zzso adipose tissue from zzso and zzso control and zzso male rats was studied using histological zzso Expression and phosphorylation of zzso proteins and gene expression were assessed by western zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso offspring at both ages had larger adipocytes zzso zzso serum zzso insulin and leptin levels were comparable between groups but increased with zzso zzso offspring had reduced expression of zzso zzso and PI3K zzso zzso in adipose zzso In adult zzso zzso Akt phosphorylation zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso were also zzso Messenger RNA expression levels of these proteins were not zzso indicating a zzso zzso 

zzso nutrition programmes alterations in adipocyte cell size and impairs the protein expression of several zzso proteins through zzso zzso These indices may represent early markers of insulin resistance and metabolic disease zzso
