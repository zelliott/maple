It is now widely accepted that the zzso nutritional environment is important in determining zzso to zzso zzso In particular, zzso growth restriction followed by accelerated zzso growth is associated with an increased risk of zzso zzso diabetes and other features of the zzso zzso The mechanisms underlying these observations are not fully zzso 

Using a well-established maternal zzso zzso model, our aim was to determine if exposure to mismatched nutrition in zzso zzso zzso tissue structure and function, and expression of key components of the zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso fed a zzso zzso diet during pregnancy were zzso by control zzso zzso to drive catch-up zzso This zzso group was compared with offspring of zzso fed a zzso protein diet during pregnancy and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue from zzso and zzso control and zzso male rats was studied using zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso proteins and gene expression were assessed by western zzso and zzso zzso zzso 

zzso offspring at both ages had larger zzso zzso zzso serum zzso insulin and zzso levels were comparable between groups but increased with zzso zzso offspring had reduced expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso In adult zzso rats, zzso zzso zzso and protein levels of zzso zzso were also zzso zzso zzso expression levels of these proteins were not different, indicating a zzso zzso 

zzso nutrition zzso zzso in zzso cell size and zzso the protein expression of several zzso proteins through zzso zzso These zzso may represent early markers of insulin resistance and zzso disease zzso
