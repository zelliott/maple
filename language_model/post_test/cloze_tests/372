Diffuse optical tomography allows quantification of zzso oxygen zzso and water in zzso and the fidelity in this quantification is dependent on the accuracy of optical properties determined during image zzso In this zzso a zzso algorithm is proposed and validated that uses the standard Newton minimization with zzso regularization as the first zzso The second step is a modification to the existing algorithm using a zzso regularization to allow lower damping in a region of interest as compared to zzso This second stage allows the recovery of the actual size of an zzso A zzso reconstruction is the final third zzso which uses the estimated size and position information from step 2 to yield quantitatively accurate average values for the optical zzso The algorithm is tested on simulated and experimental data and is found to be insensitive to object contrast and zzso The percentage error between the true and the average recovered value for the absorption coefficient in test images is reduced from 47 to zzso for a zzso zzso from 38 to zzso for a zzso zzso and from 28 to zzso for a zzso zzso Simulated data with absorbing and scattering heterogeneities of 15 mm zzso located in different positions show recovery with less than zzso error in absorption and zzso error in reduced scattering zzso The algorithm is successfully applied to clinical data from a subject with a breast abnormality to yield quantitatively increased absorption zzso which enhances the contrast to zzso compared to zzso zzso
