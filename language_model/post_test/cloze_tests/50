Bone zzso cells zzso localize in zzso niche through chemokines and zzso signals and establish clusters that precede the arrival of even single metastatic tumor cell at distant zzso zzso demonstrate an increased metastatic propensity and would seem likely candidates for the acquisition of migratory capabilities and propagation of heterogeneous tumor cell populations to different target zzso Sonic Hedgehog zzso zzso and zzso pathways and signaling molecules such as zzso and zzso could dictate their zzso 

In this zzso the molecular mechanisms of zzso niche onset are zzso 

zzso niche is defined as a fertile microenvironment that forms in metastatic target organ and facilitates the zzso survival zzso proliferation of metastatic tumor zzso providing a novel mechanism for the promotion of zzso Drugs targeting zzso niche could represent a new promising therapeutic approach in the treatment of bone zzso
