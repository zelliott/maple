The unique energy demands of neurons require zzso distribution and maintenance of zzso zzso dynamic properties of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are critical to all zzso but may be particularly important in zzso zzso in mitochondrial dynamics has been linked to neuropathies and is increasingly being linked to several neurodegenerative zzso but the evidence is particularly zzso and continuously zzso in zzso disease zzso The unique characteristics of neurons that degenerate in PD may predispose those neuronal populations to susceptibility to alterations in mitochondrial zzso In zzso evidence from zzso toxins supports that mitochondrial zzso zzso and transport may be involved in zzso zzso rapidly increasing evidence suggests that two proteins linked to familial forms of the zzso zzso and zzso interact in a common pathway to regulate mitochondrial zzso zzso may also play a role in maintaining mitochondrial homeostasis through targeting damaged mitochondria for zzso Taken zzso the current data suggests that mitochondrial dynamics may play a role in PD zzso and a better understanding of mitochondrial dynamics within the neuron may lead to future therapeutic treatments for zzso potentially aimed at some of the earliest pathogenic zzso
