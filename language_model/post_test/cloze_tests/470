Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a snake zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso sequence of zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso zzso encodes zzso class zzso with an open reading frame of 411 zzso acid zzso that includes signal zzso zzso and zzso zzso The full-length zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and encodes zzso class zzso The open reading frame of zzso with a zzso zzso acid zzso is composed of signal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso acid identical to zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso class zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When expressed in zzso coli, most of zzso proteins of zzso and zzso were in zzso inclusion bodies, with soluble yields of zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacterial culture, zzso Both affinity zzso zzso proteins show zzso activity on zzso although having an activity lower than that of crude zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities of zzso and zzso were completely abolished after incubation with a final concentration of 100 zzso of zzso or zzso Both zzso and zzso were active in a zzso plate but devoid of zzso activity when injected (up to 50 zzso zzso into mice, and had no capacity to inhibit zzso zzso
