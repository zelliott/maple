Two cDNA zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from a snake zzso zzso zzso venom gland cDNA zzso The zzso cDNA sequence of zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso kDa is zzso bp in zzso zzso encodes PI class metalloproteinase with an open reading frame of 411 amino acid residues that includes signal zzso zzso and metalloproteinase zzso The zzso cDNA of the zzso zzso zzso has a calculated molecular mass of zzso kDa and encodes PII class zzso The open reading frame of zzso with a zzso amino acid residues is composed of signal zzso zzso metalloproteinase and zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso and zzso amino acid identical to PI class enzyme zzso zzso zzso zzso and PII class enzyme zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When expressed in Escherichia zzso most of recombinant proteins of zzso and zzso were in insoluble inclusion zzso with soluble yields of zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacterial zzso zzso Both affinity purified recombinant proteins show proteolytic activity on zzso although having an activity lower than that of crude zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities of zzso and zzso were completely abolished after incubation with a final concentration of 100 microM of EDTA or zzso Both zzso and zzso were active in a zzso plate but devoid of hemorrhagic activity when injected zzso to 50 zzso subcutaneously into zzso and had no capacity to inhibit platelet zzso
