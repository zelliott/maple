Experimental approaches for identifying new zzso include zzso and zzso screening zzso The former involves basic research into zzso and validating new zzso mostly zzso followed by identification of inhibitors or agonists through the use of zzso screening assays zzso in silico drug zzso The latter experimental approach uses zzso assays to identify zzso agents with unknown modes of zzso or where the primary interest lies in whether analogues are able to kill zzso zzso zzso rather than in measuring their direct impact on their likely zzso This paper focuses initially on the intestine and external layers of nematodes as potential drug zzso Specific zzso agents targeting either tissue are discussed to illustrate the impact of disruption to these zzso In both zzso the activity of these agents against insects was zzso and activity against nematodes was identified using whole worm screening zzso Recent literature identifying zzso signalling pathway receptors in nematodes is then used to provide an example of basic research into a specific target that may lead to the development of zzso zzso drug screening zzso zzso the role of zzso screening approaches versus zzso screening is discussed zzso
