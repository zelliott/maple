Experimental approaches for identifying new zzso include zzso and zzso screening zzso The former involves basic research into zzso and zzso new targets, mostly zzso followed by identification of zzso or zzso through the use of zzso screening zzso and/or in zzso drug zzso The latter experimental approach uses zzso zzso to identify zzso agents with unknown modes of action, or where the primary interest lies in whether zzso are able to kill (or zzso worms rather than in measuring their direct impact on their likely zzso This paper focuses initially on the zzso and external layers of zzso as potential drug zzso zzso zzso agents targeting either tissue are discussed to illustrate the impact of disruption to these zzso In both cases, the activity of these agents against insects was known, and activity against zzso was identified using whole zzso screening zzso Recent literature identifying zzso zzso zzso receptors in zzso is then used to provide an example of basic research into a specific target that may lead to the development of zzso zzso drug screening zzso Finally, the role of zzso screening approaches versus zzso screening is discussed zzso
