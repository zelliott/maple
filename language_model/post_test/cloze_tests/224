The structure of the 30 zzso subunit a of the membrane component zzso of zzso coli ATP synthase is investigated in a mixture of zzso methanol and zzso a solvent previously used for solving the structure of another integral membrane zzso subunit zzso Near complete backbone chemical shift assignments were made from a set of TROSY experiments including zzso zzso zzso zzso and 4D zzso and zzso Secondary structure of subunit a was predicted from the backbone chemical shifts using zzso zzso The protein was found to consist of multiple elongated zzso zzso This finding is generally consistent with previous predictions of multiple transmembrane zzso in this polytopic zzso
