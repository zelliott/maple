The structure of the 30 zzso zzso a of the membrane component zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso is investigated in a mixture of zzso methanol and water, a zzso previously used for solving the structure of another integral membrane zzso zzso zzso Near complete backbone chemical shift assignments were made from a set of zzso experiments including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso Secondary structure of zzso a was predicted from the backbone chemical shifts using zzso zzso The protein was found to consist of multiple zzso zzso zzso This finding is generally consistent with previous predictions of multiple zzso zzso in this zzso zzso
