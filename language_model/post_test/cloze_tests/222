While characterizing various splice forms of zzso zzso we observed what appeared to be a novel posttranslational modification of zzso resulting in a higher molecular weight form that was dependent on the splicing zzso Further investigation revealed the higher molecular weight form to be a fusion protein between sequences encoded by the retroviral vector and zzso We found that the publicly available sequence of the vector we used does not agree with the experimental zzso We caution other investigators to be aware of this potential zzso
