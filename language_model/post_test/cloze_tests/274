The proteins kinases zzso are a subfamily of zzso kinases that act as metabolite sensors to constantly adapt metabolism to the supply zzso and demand zzso zzso In the yeast Saccharomyces zzso the zzso complex is a central component of the regulatory response to glucose zzso zzso activated protein kinase zzso the mammalian homologue of zzso plays a central role in the regulation of energy homeostasis at the cellular as well as the zzso zzso In Arabidopsis zzso zzso and zzso have recently been described as central integrators of a transcription network for stress and energy zzso In this zzso biochemical analysis established zzso as the major zzso isoform both in isolated cells and zzso In order to elucidate the function of zzso in Arabidopsis zzso transgenic plants zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso physiological and molecular analyses of these plants revealed that zzso is implicated in sugar and zzso signalling zzso Modifications of the starch and soluble sugar content were observed in the zzso transgenic zzso Our studies also revealed modifications of the activity of essential enzymes such as nitrate reductase or zzso zzso and of the expression of several zzso zzso confirming the central role of the protein kinase zzso in the regulation of zzso
