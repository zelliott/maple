zzso zzso are found in a variety of signal zzso zzso they bind zzso zzso allowing them to both recognize target molecules and regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso that are involved in signal zzso by association with a number of membrane zzso The zzso activity of these zzso proteins is modulated by switching the binding mode of their zzso and zzso zzso from zzso to zzso The molecular basis of the zzso roles observed for different zzso family members is still not well understood; although structures have been determined for the zzso zzso of other zzso family zzso this is the first structure of the zzso zzso zzso 

The structure of the zzso zzso domain in complex with a zzso zzso zzso was determined by high resolution zzso zzso The overall structure of the complex is analogous to that of other zzso zzso zzso aspects of the structure are: the zzso loop, which contacts the bound zzso contains a zzso zzso a zzso interaction is present at the zzso end of zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso of the Val beta zzso beta zzso zzso bond causes zzso zzso of zzso near the N and C zzso of the zzso 

zzso of the zzso zzso domain structure with other structures of zzso zzso highlights several interesting zzso Conservation of zzso capping interactions among various zzso zzso is suggestive of a role in protein zzso The presence of a zzso turn in the zzso loop, which is dependent on the presence of a zzso zzso at position zzso is indicative of a binding pocket, characteristic of the zzso family, zzso and zzso rather than a binding groove found in zzso zzso zzso alpha N and zzso for zzso
