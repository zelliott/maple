SH2 domains are found in a variety of signal transduction zzso they bind zzso zzso allowing them to both recognize target molecules and regulate intramolecular kinase zzso zzso is a member of the Src family of tyrosine kinases that are involved in signal transduction by association with a number of membrane zzso The kinase activity of these signalling proteins is modulated by switching the binding mode of their SH2 and SH3 domains from intramolecular to zzso The molecular basis of the signalling roles observed for different Src family members is still not well zzso although structures have been determined for the SH2 domains of other Src family zzso this is the first structure of the zzso SH2 zzso 

The structure of the zzso SH2 domain in complex with a zzso peptide zzso was determined by high resolution NMR zzso The overall structure of the complex is analogous to that of other zzso zzso Noteworthy aspects of the structure zzso the BG zzso which contacts the bound zzso contains a zzso zzso a zzso interaction is present at the zzso end of helix alpha zzso zzso zzso of the Val beta zzso beta G2 peptide bond causes conformational heterogeneity of residues near the N and C termini of the zzso 

Comparison of the zzso SH2 domain structure with other structures of SH2 domains highlights several interesting zzso Conservation of helix capping interactions among various SH2 domains is suggestive of a role in protein zzso The presence of a zzso turn in the BG zzso which is dependent on the presence of a glycine residue at position zzso is indicative of a binding zzso characteristic of the Src zzso zzso and zzso rather than a binding groove found in zzso zzso zzso alpha N and zzso for zzso
