To investigate the sustained release rule of zzso zzso copolymer zzso nanoparticles and the effect thereof in killing zzso zzso 

zzso nanoparticles were prepared by method of emulsification zzso evaporation of organic zzso Its morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy and the zzso efficiency of zzso was determined by ultraviolet zzso zzso was put in a dialysis bag to observe the releasing characteristics of zzso from zzso nanoparticles in zzso Human liver carcinoma cells of the line HepG2 were cultured with zzso of different concentrations or the original drug of zzso as control group for zzso zzso or 48 zzso MTT method was used to observe the cancer inhibition zzso zzso nude mice underwent subcutaneous injection of HepG2 cells at the right scapula and then randomly divided into 4 groups to undergo intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso original drug of zzso zzso drug zzso zzso zzso zzso or normal saline zzso control zzso once every 5 days for 3 zzso zzso days later the mice were killed with the tumors taken out to measure the weight to analyze the inhibitory effect against zzso zzso 

The zzso nanoparticles were of round or elliptical shape with the diameter of about 83 zzso and the zzso entrapment efficiency was about zzso The releasing test in vitro manifested a sustained release of over zzso of zzso encapsulated in zzso nanoparticles for about 7 zzso Both the zzso nanoparticles and naked drug zzso inhibited the growth of HepG2 cells with a similar inhibitory rate zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso meanwhile the zzso zzso failed to inhibit the HepG2 zzso zzso experiment showed an inhibitory rate of zzso nanoparticles on hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts of zzso significantly higher than that of the naked drug zzso zzso 

zzso nanoparticles can effectively inhibit the growth of zzso zzso
