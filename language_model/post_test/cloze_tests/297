In zzso emission computed tomography zzso of the dopaminergic zzso measurements of striatal uptake are useful for diagnosis and patient zzso but are strongly biased by the partial volume effect zzso We studied whether PVE correction might improve patient classification based on binding potential zzso zzso 

Patients with a probable diagnosis of dementia with zzso bodies zzso 10 zzso or zzso disease zzso 13 zzso were studied zzso zzso zzso SPECT images were reconstructed with and without PVE zzso Each patient SPECT scan was also simulated to obtain SPECT data whose characteristics were fully zzso In zzso 17 SPECT scans were simulated with striatal uptake values mimicking zzso cases of zzso 

Without PVE zzso mean putamen BP values were zzso and zzso for AD and zzso patients zzso while with PVE zzso they were zzso and zzso zzso All patients were properly identified as having AD or zzso when considering mean putamen BP measured on their real or simulated SPECT zzso with and without PVE zzso All 30 simulations mimicking zzso zzso and AD patients were accurately classified with PVE zzso but without PVE correction 15 mean putamen BP values were in a range where AD and zzso could not be zzso 

We conclude that putamen BP values measured without PVE correction can be used to differentiate probable zzso and AD due to the already severe reduction in dopamine transporter zzso PVE correction appeared useful for accurate differential diagnosis between AD and zzso zzso
