zzso and chronic toxicity of zzso were examined by inhalation exposure of 50 male zzso rats to zzso vapor at 0 zzso zzso 50, zzso or zzso zzso zzso for 6 zzso 5 zzso and 104 zzso Survival rates of 250 and zzso zzso groups were decreased near the end of the zzso exposure period, due probably to the occurrence of zzso zzso A statistically significant but marginal zzso of terminal body weight zzso was found in the zzso zzso group, suggesting slight systemic zzso zzso changes in plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and relative weight of the liver occurred in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and statistically significant increases in zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found primarily in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso cell zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso were also increased zzso zzso zzso occurred in the zzso cavity and liver of the zzso zzso As zzso zzso the significantly increased zzso of nuclear enlargement, zzso and respiratory zzso in the zzso cavity were noted at 50 zzso and zzso A zzso zzso observed adverse effect zzso was determined at 50 zzso for the zzso zzso of general chronic zzso This study provides clear evidence of zzso for zzso in male zzso A zzso and in zzso zzso mode of action is suggested to operate in zzso zzso
