zzso and chronic toxicity of zzso were examined by inhalation exposure of 50 male zzso rats to zzso vapor at 0 zzso zzso zzso zzso or 1250 ppm zzso for 6 zzso 5 zzso and 104 zzso Survival rates of 250 and 1250 zzso groups were decreased near the end of the zzso exposure zzso due probably to the occurrence of malignant zzso A statistically significant but marginal decrement of terminal body weight zzso was found in the 1250 zzso zzso suggesting slight systemic zzso Significant changes in plasma levels of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and relative weight of the liver occurred in the 1250 zzso zzso zzso and statistically significant increases in incidences of nasal squamous cell zzso hepatocellular zzso and peritoneal zzso were found primarily in the 1250 zzso zzso The incidences of renal cell zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and adenomas in the zzso gland were also increased zzso zzso lesions occurred in the nasal cavity and liver of the zzso zzso As nonneoplastic zzso the significantly increased incidences of nuclear zzso zzso and respiratory zzso in the nasal cavity were noted at 50 ppm and zzso A zzso zzso observed adverse effect zzso was determined at 50 ppm for the nasal endpoint of general chronic zzso This study provides clear evidence of carcinogenicity for zzso in male zzso A zzso and in vivo zzso mode of action is suggested to operate in zzso zzso
