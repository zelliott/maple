We have previously shown that calcium zzso apoptosis of zzso human B cells is preceded by the induced expression of early response zzso implying a requirement for new gene expression in this mode of programmed cell zzso We have found in the present studies that inhibitors of macromolecular zzso zzso and zzso zzso are also potent inducers of apoptosis in the same zzso cell zzso These drugs trigger apoptosis through apparently early gene zzso zzso Although different mechanisms for induction of apoptosis exist in zzso zzso enforced zzso of zzso protects cells from apoptosis induced in response to different zzso demonstrating that zzso blocks a final common pathway for programmed cell death in the zzso cell zzso
