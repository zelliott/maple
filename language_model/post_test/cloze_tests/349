A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso Cells were zzso produced terminal zzso and grew at pH zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso degrees C zzso at zzso degrees zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso Comparative 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis showed that strain zzso zzso belongs to the genus zzso exhibiting the highest sequence similarity with respect to the type strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso the next most similar 16S rRNA gene sequences were those of the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso hybridization with zzso zzso AS zzso showed a relatedness of 55 zzso The major fatty acids of strain zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso type was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The genomic DNA zzso content was zzso zzso and the predominant respiratory zzso was zzso The major polar lipids were zzso zzso and zzso On the basis of the evidence from this zzso zzso strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the genus zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso AA zzso as the type zzso
