zzso a naturally occurring zzso is known to be an Akt inhibitor and to have an zzso effect on several zzso 

This study was performed to elucidate the effect of zzso on apoptotic pathways related to zzso signaling in colon cancer cells and on the zzso effect in colon cancer xenograft zzso 

We studied zzso 205 and zzso cells in the presence or absence of zzso zzso signaling was examined by zzso zzso for interleukin zzso by Western zzso for zzso zzso and by the electrophoretic mobility shift zzso Cell death was determined by the MTT zzso and apoptosis by zzso zzso staining and zzso zzso We also assessed the expression of zzso and proapoptotic factors by use of zzso In colon cancer xenograft zzso we evaluated the effect of zzso on inoculated tumor zzso and apoptotic index was measured by the in vivo zzso zzso 

zzso significantly inhibited zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and DNA binding activity of zzso in colon cancer zzso zzso induced cell death and apoptosis in colon cancer cells in a dose and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso factors such as zzso zzso and zzso In the colon cancer xenograft zzso the volume of the tumor treated with zzso was significantly lower than that of the zzso and the apoptotic index for zzso mice was much zzso 

zzso might be a potential therapeutic agent for treatment of colorectal zzso
