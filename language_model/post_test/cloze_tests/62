One of the most important issues in zzso zzso brain functional magnetic resonance imaging is the understanding of the vascular structures that are responsible for the signal changes zzso The zzso signal changes observed during variations in zzso magnetic field gradients are a function both of zzso zzso such as zzso and of zzso effects such as field zzso zzso zzso signal changes are only a function of zzso zzso It has been suggested that zzso images could be less sensitive to blood susceptibility changes in a zzso environment than zzso images and could thus be more accurate in identifying the zzso of the parenchyma rather than zzso zzso zzso In this study we use hypoxia and hypercapnia challenges in cats to provide a change in blood deoxyhemoglobin concentration zzso a model for classic BOLD changes and not as a model for neuronal zzso A combined gradient echo and spin echo zzso zzso pulse sequence was used to map zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso changes during the zzso Our experiments demonstrate zzso zzso the acquisition of zzso EPI data does not in itself differentiate signal changes in the parenchyma from those occurring in regions around larger zzso but that zzso the simultaneous acquisition of zzso and zzso images could be useful in identifying microvascular regions in gray matter by analyzing the ratio zzso This value seems independent of the degree of deoxyhemoglobin concentration zzso but is related to properties of the vascular zzso We suggest a possible application of the results to the study of brain function in zzso
