Epilepsy is a common neurological zzso for which a great deal of research has been devoted to analyze and characterize brain activity during zzso While this can be done by a human zzso automatic methods still lag zzso This paper analyzes neural activity captured with zzso zzso recorded through intracranial implants from zzso model test zzso The goal is to automatically identify the main seizure zzso zzso zzso and zzso While visually differentiating each stage can be done by an expert if the complete zzso is zzso the goal here is to automatically identify the corresponding stage of short signal zzso 

The proposal is to pose the above task as a supervised classification problem and derive a mapping function that classifies each signal zzso Given the complexity of the signal zzso it is difficult to a priori choose any particular zzso zzso Genetic Programming zzso a population based zzso for automatic program zzso is used to automatically search for the mapping zzso Two zzso classifiers are used and extensively zzso The signals from epileptic seizures are obtained using the zzso model of elicited epilepsy in rodent test zzso for which a seizure was elicited and recorded on four separate zzso 

Results show that signal segments from a single seizure can be used to derive accurate classifiers that generalize when tested on different signals from the same zzso zzso GP can automatically produce accurate mapping functions for zzso zzso A large number of experiments are performed with the GP classifiers achieving good performance based on standard performance zzso zzso a zzso zzso prototype is zzso where a GP classifier is transferred and zzso on an embedded system using a zzso converter and a field programmable gate zzso achieving a low average classification error of zzso sensitivity values between zzso and zzso and specificity values between zzso and zzso 

The proposed approach achieves good results for stage zzso particularly when compared with previous works that focus on this zzso The results show that the problem of zzso classification can be solved with a low zzso and high sensitivity and zzso zzso the limitations of the approach are identified and good operating configurations can be proposed based on the zzso
