zzso is the first zzso zzso zzso HSP90 inhibitor that showed activity in preclinical models at low zzso zzso We performed a phase 1 trial of zzso administered to subjects with advanced solid zzso 

Sixty patients received zzso capsules orally on days zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 18 of each course in schedule zzso and on days zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 25 of each course in schedule zzso The treatment schedules were repeated every 28 zzso In addition to determining the zzso we evaluated pharmacokinetics of zzso and pharmacodynamic effects of zzso zzso HER2 extracellular domain zzso 

The MTD was 700 mg twice weekly when zzso was dosed for 3 weeks out of each zzso zzso The MTD for continuous dosing regimen was established at 600 mg twice zzso Gastrointestinal zzso zzso hot zzso and neurologic zzso events characterize the safety profile of zzso dosed twice zzso with events mostly mild or zzso Plasma exposure to zzso was zzso Cmax occurred at approximately 90 minutes and zzso was approximately 1 hour across dosing cohorts of 25 to 800 mg zzso twice zzso The biologic activity of zzso was demonstrated in zzso zzso and tumor zzso zzso levels were increased zzso from zzso and serum zzso was significantly decreased zzso inhibition from zzso 

zzso twice zzso given with or without the 1 of zzso rest period was tolerated in subjects with advanced solid tumors at doses that are zzso zzso
