Recent progress in zzso zzso and bioinformatics enables unprecedented opportunities to examine the evolutionary history of zzso zzso and developmental pathways through zzso zzso we have developed a motif analysis tool for zzso zzso zzso that scans predicted proteome sets for proteins containing highly conserved amino acid motifs or domains for in silico analysis of the evolutionary history of these zzso zzso enables the user to download results as full protein or extracted zzso sequences from each zzso Tables containing the percent distribution of a zzso in organisms normalized to proteome size are zzso zzso can also align the set of full protein or extracted zzso sequences and predict a zzso tree from relative sequence zzso zzso zzso serves as a zzso zzso tool for the phylogenomic analysis of conserved sequence zzso in annotated proteomes from the three domains of zzso
