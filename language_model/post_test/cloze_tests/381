zzso of leukocytes using labelled zzso zzso zzso colloidal radiopharmaceuticals has been reported as a method for imaging zzso This in vivo study compares the use of leukocytes labelled using 99mTc zzso fluoride colloid with leukocytes labelled using zzso zzso zzso A total of 26 patients zzso zzso 16 zzso mean age 52 zzso range zzso zzso referred for the investigation of possible infection were studied using both leukocyte labelling methods zzso Images were acquired 4h and 24h after zzso of the labelled zzso The images were evaluated qualitatively by two nuclear medicine zzso The results show a high degree of concordance between the zzso 11 of the 28 images showed a focus of leukocyte accumulation with both techniques at zzso and 13 out of 28 showed a normal appearance at 24h with both zzso In four cases the results were zzso the 99mTc zzso fluoride colloid labelled leukocytes gave a false positive appearance at 24h in three patients and a false negative in zzso In zzso colloid labelling of leukocytes offers a sensitive method for the detection of infective foci coupled with the high resolution imaging offered by zzso It has the advantage over other in vitro labelling methods of being a zzso zzso procedure employing whole zzso and its use should be considered by departments that have limited facilities for in vitro leukocyte zzso
