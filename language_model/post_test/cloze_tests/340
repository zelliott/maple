zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are members of three distinct phage groups with characteristic host zzso Their zzso zzso genes were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli as demonstrated by the zzso zzso phenotype when colonies of recombinant cells were overlaid with a zzso of zzso zzso The nucleotide sequences of the cloned DNA fragments were determined and the individual enzymes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to have varying degrees of homology within their zzso or zzso zzso Transcriptional analysis revealed them to be zzso genes with transcription beginning zzso min zzso The enzymes were overexpressed and partially purified and their individual specificities zzso When applied zzso the zzso induced rapid zzso of zzso strains from all species but generally did not affect other zzso Using hydrolysis of purified zzso cell zzso zzso was characterized as an zzso amidase zzso zzso and shows homology in its zzso domain to other enzymes of this zzso In zzso zzso and zzso were shown to represent a new class of cell wall zzso enzymes which cleave between the zzso and zzso residues of zzso zzso these were designated as zzso zzso These two enzymes share homology in the zzso domain which we propose determines zzso zzso Highly conserved zzso zzso gene sequences are present upstream of zzso and zzso They encode proteins of structural similarity to the product of phage lambda gene zzso and are predicted to be membrane proteins which form pores to allow access of the zzso to their zzso zzso This arrangement of conserved zzso genes with downstream zzso genes among the zzso zzso cassettes explains why the cytoplasmic zzso alone are not zzso since they require a specific transport function across the cell zzso
