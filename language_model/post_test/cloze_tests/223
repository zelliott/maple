zzso laser therapy has become popular in clinical applications including promoting wound healing and pain zzso zzso effects of this zzso on human zzso cells are rarely zzso zzso we found 808 nm gallium aluminum zzso zzso continuous wave laser had an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of human zzso cell lines HepG2 and zzso at the energy density of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible mechanism of action of this zzso on HepG2 and zzso zzso HepG2 and zzso cells were cultured in zzso plates for 24 zzso After zzso by 130 mW 808 nm zzso continuous wave laser for different time intervals zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 180 zzso Western blot and zzso staining were used to examine the expression and distribution of histone and zzso zzso The cell counts as well as histone and zzso expression of HepG2 and zzso cells were reduced by zzso at the energy density of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the architecture of zzso and the distribution of intermediate zzso proteins zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso zzso by 808 nm zzso continuous wave laser at the energy density of zzso and zzso zzso inhibited the survival of human zzso cell zzso The mechanism might reduce synthesis of histone and zzso Reduced histone synthesis might further reduce the proliferation rate of these zzso Reduced zzso synthesis might result in the destruction of the zzso zzso the net effects by this zzso were reduced cell zzso
