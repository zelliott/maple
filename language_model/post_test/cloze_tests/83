zzso and MRS techniques are being applied to the zzso of various aspects of the zzso zzso and to the assessment of zzso response to zzso For example, kinetic parameters describing zzso blood vessel flow and zzso can be derived from dynamic zzso zzso data and have been correlated with a positive zzso response to zzso zzso The ongoing development and validation of zzso high-resolution zzso MR techniques will zzso us with the means to detect specific zzso zzso early on, and then to monitor the efficacy of cancer treatments efficiently and zzso all within a clinically relevant time zzso Reliable zzso zzso imaging zzso will provide obvious advantages by enabling zzso treatment tailoring and potentially improving patient zzso However, for routine clinical application across many disease types, such imaging zzso must be zzso zzso zzso sufficiently sensitive and zzso These characteristics are all difficult to achieve in practice, but image zzso development and validation have been greatly facilitated by an increasing number of pertinent zzso in zzso cancer zzso zzso must now be placed on discovering whether the zzso results translate into an improvement in patient care and, therefore, overall zzso
