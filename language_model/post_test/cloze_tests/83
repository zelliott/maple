MRI and MRS techniques are being applied to the characterisation of various aspects of the tumour microenvironment and to the assessment of tumour response to zzso For zzso kinetic parameters describing tumour blood vessel flow and permeability can be derived from dynamic zzso MRI data and have been correlated with a positive tumour response to zzso zzso The ongoing development and validation of zzso zzso zzso MR techniques will zzso us with the means to detect specific tumour biomarkers early zzso and then to monitor the efficacy of cancer treatments efficiently and zzso all within a clinically relevant time zzso Reliable tumour microenvironment imaging biomarkers will provide obvious advantages by enabling zzso treatment tailoring and potentially improving patient zzso zzso for routine clinical application across many disease zzso such imaging biomarkers must be zzso zzso zzso sufficiently sensitive and zzso These characteristics are all difficult to achieve in zzso but image biomarker development and validation have been greatly facilitated by an increasing number of pertinent preclinical in vivo cancer zzso Emphasis must now be placed on discovering whether the preclinical results translate into an improvement in patient care zzso zzso overall zzso
