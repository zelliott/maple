In the past two decades a trickle of manuscripts examining the zzso central nervous system immune consequences of the drugs of abuse has now swollen to a significant body of zzso Initially, these studies reported zzso evidence of central nervous system zzso resulting from exposure to the drugs of abuse demonstrating key implications for zzso and disease progression associated with, for example, zzso zzso However, more recently this drug-induced zzso of central immune signaling is now understood to contribute substantially to the zzso actions of the drugs of abuse, by enhancing the engagement of classical zzso zzso reward pathways and withdrawal zzso This review will highlight the key in zzso animal, human, biological and molecular evidence of these central immune signaling actions of zzso alcohol, cocaine, methamphetamine, and zzso zzso zzso this new appreciation of central immune signaling activity of drugs of abuse provides novel therapeutic interventions and opportunities to identify zzso zzso individuals through the use of zzso zzso will also cover the evidence of zzso of this signaling by existing clinical and zzso drug candidates, and novel pharmacological zzso Finally, following examination of the breadth of central immune signaling actions of the drugs of abuse highlighted here, the current known common immune signaling components will be outlined and their impact on established addiction zzso discussed, thereby zzso a common zzso hypothesis of zzso
