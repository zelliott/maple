One hundred and nine patients suffering from various zzso underwent 285 zzso procedures for zzso zzso A median of two zzso zzso zzso resulted in median numbers of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso cells correlated significantly with collected zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso A value zzso 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly zzso for a collection yield zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso harvested by a single zzso Sixty patients were evaluated for zzso zzso and zzso in a median time of 10 days for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10 days for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 11 days for zzso zzso 20 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated significantly with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso A zzso cell dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso led to a significantly faster recovery for zzso zzso and zzso when compared with patients receiving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that rapid zzso zzso after high-dose therapy and zzso zzso zzso well with a zzso cell dose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and that above a zzso threshold of 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be collected by a single zzso We suggest that patients recovering from zzso should be monitored for zzso cells in serial blood samples to determine the course of circulating zzso zzso zzso This issue will help to define the optimal time point to start zzso and to predict a zzso zzso harvested by a single zzso which will lead to rapid and stable zzso zzso following zzso
