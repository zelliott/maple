zzso zzso is a major zzso bone zzso protein and an zzso marker whose expression is limited to mature zzso during the late differentiation zzso In previous studies we have shown zzso to lose zzso function with a corresponding loss of zzso gene zzso Introduction of wild type zzso resulted in zzso expression of the zzso zzso Using gel shift and zzso zzso zzso we have identified a putative zzso binding site within the rat OC promoter region and observed an increase in OC promoter activity when zzso accumulates using a zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso is a well-known downstream regulator of zzso zzso Our results showed a synergistic increase in the OC promoter activity when both zzso and zzso were zzso zzso We further demonstrate that zzso is not zzso during zzso of zzso zzso Increased OC expression was observed with zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso levels in zzso cells during treatment with differentiation promoting zzso media, but was significantly decreased when zzso with zzso media and the small zzso inhibitor of zzso interaction, zzso We have also observed a dramatic increase of the OC promoter activity in the presence of zzso and zzso with inclusion of zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that under some zzso conditions the zzso zzso may cooperate with zzso to regulate the zzso gene during zzso zzso
