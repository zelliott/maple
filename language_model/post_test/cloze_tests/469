zzso zzso is a major zzso bone matrix protein and an zzso marker whose expression is limited to mature osteoblasts during the late differentiation zzso In previous studies we have shown zzso to lose p53 function with a corresponding loss of zzso gene zzso Introduction of wild type p53 resulted in zzso expression of the zzso zzso Using gel shift and chromatin immunoprecipitation zzso we have identified a putative p53 binding site within the rat OC promoter region and observed an increase in OC promoter activity when p53 zzso using a CAT zzso The p53 inducible gene zzso is a zzso downstream regulator of p53 zzso Our results showed a synergistic increase in the OC promoter activity when both p53 and zzso were transiently zzso We further demonstrate that p53 is not degraded during overexpression of zzso zzso Increased OC expression was observed with concomitantly increased zzso zzso and zzso levels in zzso cells during treatment with differentiation promoting zzso zzso but was significantly decreased when zzso with DP media and the small molecule inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso We have also observed a dramatic increase of the OC promoter activity in the presence of p53 and zzso with inclusion of zzso and zzso zzso Our results suggest that under some physiological conditions the zzso zzso may cooperate with p53 to regulate the zzso gene during osteoblastic zzso
