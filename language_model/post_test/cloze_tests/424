A rapid zzso zzso assay has been investigated in which percent inhibition of incorporation of the DNA precursor zzso is measured following exposure of tumor cells to the test zzso To evaluate the usefulness of the zzso assay in providing a rapid reliable assessment of chemotherapeutic zzso the zzso assay was compared with the soft agar clonogenic zzso Sensitivity to five anticancer drugs was compared using three human tumor cell lines zzso carcinoma of the oral zzso pancreatic zzso and bladder zzso The zzso assay produced results that were similar to results of the clonogenic assay in two of the three tumors zzso for three drugs zzso zzso and zzso but did not detect responses to two zzso zzso and zzso in any zzso Further studies of this zzso assay should focus on alkylating agents and other zzso
