The reliability of zzso aspiration cytology zzso for distinguishing between zzso zzso and sarcoma was established in a previous study zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate which criteria were useful for a probabilistic zzso A total of 78 randomly chosen FNA smears zzso zzso 24 zzso and 23 zzso was sent around and read zzso by six zzso Each pathologist completed a list of 16 criteria for every zzso Histology was used as a reference zzso A statistical analysis led to the selection of three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Given the scores on these zzso the probabilities to be assigned to the three diagnostic categories can be read from a zzso It turns zzso as one might zzso that the classification of the most probable disease is pretty reliable if one cytologic criterion scores much higher than the other two zzso On other zzso fuzziness appears and misclassifications are far from zzso This study offers a general cytologic zzso The cytologic criteria zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be used both in daily practice and in education to assign posterior probabilities to zzso zzso and zzso zzso
