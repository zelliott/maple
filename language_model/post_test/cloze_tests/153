The zzso zzso subunit of zzso acid zzso glutamate receptors greatly determines calcium permeability and kinetic properties of zzso AMPA subunit zzso zzso editing of this subunit at the zzso site controls calcium permeability whereas editing at the zzso site is involved in the regulation of biophysical zzso We used zzso techniques with ultrafast solution exchange to examine the kinetics of recombinant human homomeric zzso zzso channels transiently expressed in HEK293 cells zzso at the zzso site and zzso site zzso and zzso zzso and edited zzso at the zzso site both with zzso zzso at the zzso zzso The time constant of desensitization after application of 10 mm glutamate was zzso zzso zzso ms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ms zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso ms zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso RN and GN zzso zzso The time constant of zzso was 75 ms for the zzso zzso RN and 30 ms for the GN zzso The zzso of the peak current zzso kinetics of activation and zzso and peak open probability did not differ between RN and GN zzso The study shows that desensitization and zzso kinetics of homomeric zzso zzso channels are controlled by a single amino acid exchange zzso by zzso at the zzso zzso Quantitative analysis by computer simulation using a circular kinetic scheme allows the prediction of the main experimental zzso
