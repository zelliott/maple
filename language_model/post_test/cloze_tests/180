zzso zzso zzso zzso named for their sequence similarity to the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso coli, comprise a zzso of zzso that zzso and/or zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso response and regulator of cellular zzso The classical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and ACT domain architecture have been found across diverse bacteria and plant zzso while dedicated single domain zzso and zzso zzso have also been discovered in disparate bacteria and animals zzso However, there is considerable confusion in terms of nomenclature and no comprehensive zzso and sequence analyses have previously been carried out to zzso zzso on a zzso zzso We have performed zzso sensitive sequence searching of over 1000 zzso from across the tree of life, in combination with zzso analyses to consolidate previous ad hoc identification of diverse zzso in different organisms and provide a much-needed unifying zzso for the zzso We zzso zzso into 30 zzso zzso three groups: long zzso small zzso zzso zzso and small zzso zzso zzso Members of zzso previously unidentified zzso zzso can now be studied zzso including previously unknown zzso in zzso expanding the zzso zzso to this domain of zzso We have analyzed possible combinations of zzso proteins and their zzso in bacterial zzso and compared zzso content with available zzso zzso data for various organisms to determine the rules of combining zzso Through comparative sequence analysis of long and small zzso we find exposed sites limited in conservation to the long zzso that we propose are involved in zzso regulatory zzso Such signals may be transmitted via zzso to zzso zzso zzso or zzso interactions either among individual zzso molecules or among long zzso and other binding partners such as the zzso
