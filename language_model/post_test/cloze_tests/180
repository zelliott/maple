zzso zzso zzso zzso named for their sequence similarity to the zzso and zzso enzymes of Escherichia zzso comprise a superfamily of enzymes that synthesize zzso zzso the zzso zzso activator of the zzso response and regulator of cellular zzso The classical zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain architecture have been found across diverse bacteria and plant zzso while dedicated single domain zzso and zzso zzso have also been discovered in disparate bacteria and animals zzso zzso there is considerable confusion in terms of nomenclature and no comprehensive phylogenetic and sequence analyses have previously been carried out to classify zzso on a genomic zzso We have performed zzso sensitive sequence searching of over 1000 genomes from across the tree of zzso in combination with phylogenetic analyses to consolidate previous ad hoc identification of diverse zzso in different organisms and provide a zzso unifying terminology for the zzso We classify zzso into 30 subgroups comprising three zzso long zzso small zzso zzso zzso and small zzso zzso zzso zzso of nineteen previously unidentified zzso subgroups can now be studied zzso including previously unknown zzso in zzso expanding the zzso zzso to this domain of zzso We have analyzed possible combinations of zzso proteins and their domains in bacterial genomes and compared zzso content with available zzso zzso data for various organisms to determine the rules of combining zzso Through comparative sequence analysis of long and small zzso we find exposed sites limited in conservation to the long zzso that we propose are involved in transmitting regulatory zzso Such signals may be transmitted via zzso to zzso zzso zzso or zzso interactions either among individual zzso molecules or among long zzso and other binding partners such as the zzso
