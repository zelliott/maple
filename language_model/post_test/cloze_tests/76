The proteolytic processing of the two TNF receptors zzso and zzso into soluble forms was investigated in the myeloid cell lines zzso and zzso Phorbol zzso acetate zzso rapidly stimulated release of soluble forms of both zzso zzso were made with PMA and protease inhibitors directed against different target protease zzso The zzso inhibitors zzso and zzso and the zzso inhibitor zzso reduced zzso release of both soluble receptor forms with about zzso zzso zzso also reduced zzso zzso of zzso in both cell lines as judged by zzso to zzso Reduced zzso and zzso shedding by zzso was reversed by zzso indicating involvement of a zzso zzso zzso both serine proteases and zzso are involved in the processing of zzso
