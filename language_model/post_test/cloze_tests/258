This work introduces a novel zzso for a zzso zzso which, contrary to common methods, can be trained entirely zzso using an zzso zzso approach, eliminating the need for costly zzso collection or tedious zzso zzso We use publicly available zzso for validation of our method and show that our zzso zzso performs competitively with supervised state-of-the-art zzso Finally, we demonstrate the added value of our method in different experimental settings which reflect realistic usage situations of increasing difficulty and which would be difficult or impossible to tackle with existing supervised or zzso zzso
