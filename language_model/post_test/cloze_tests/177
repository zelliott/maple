To evaluate the hospital zzso rate to determine if it has the attributes necessary for a performance indicator that can be applied to administrative zzso 

The fiscal year 1994 Veterans Affairs Patient Treatment File zzso which contains discharge data on all VA zzso 

Using a retrospective study design, we assessed zzso variation in zzso the zzso rate and zzso the standardized zzso zzso A hospital's zzso rate is the observed average number of zzso for patients with one or more hospital zzso A hospital's standardized zzso ratio is the ratio of the geometric mean of the observed number of zzso per patient to the geometric mean of the expected number of zzso per patient, conditional on the types of patients admitted to that zzso 

Discharge data were extracted for the zzso VA patients who had one or more admissions in one of seven disease zzso 

We found that zzso percent zzso of the admissions in the seven disease categories were zzso The average number of stays per person zzso zzso for an average of seven months of follow-up ranged from zzso to zzso across the disease zzso The maximum standardized zzso ratio ranged from zzso to zzso 

This study has shown that the hospital zzso rate offers sufficient ease of zzso frequency, and variation to potentially serve as a performance zzso
