Five strains of infectious bronchitis virus zzso were isolated from five layer flocks that had zzso infection in four provinces in zzso Among zzso three of the five flocks had been vaccinated against infectious zzso zzso studies indicated that the five Chinese zzso isolates caused 10 to zzso mortality in zzso specific pathogen free chickens and gross lesions were mainly confined to the kidneys in all of the dead zzso Two oligonucleotide zzso zzso and zzso or zzso and zzso were used after propagation of the isolates in zzso eggs to amplify the S1 protein genes of the spike zzso The cDNA derived by reverse zzso chain reaction was cloned and zzso The nucleotide and amino acid sequence of S1 protein gene had a similar degree of identity zzso or zzso among the five Chinese zzso zzso The nucleotide and amino acid identity of the S1 protein gene between the five Chinese zzso isolates and 16 strains of other zzso varied from 60 to zzso This clearly showed that the five Chinese zzso isolates comprised a separate zzso These results zzso for the first zzso that there is a new genotype of zzso zzso circulating in vaccinated and zzso flocks in zzso
