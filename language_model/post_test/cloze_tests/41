Signals sent through zzso play crucial roles in B cell zzso including blocking apoptosis of germinal center B zzso In this zzso using a murine B cell zzso line that undergoes apoptosis by the zzso of surface Ag receptors zzso we have demonstrated that zzso zzso are linked to induction of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins whose expression was significantly suppressed by the apoptotic signal through zzso zzso analyses of zzso revealed that the domain of human zzso required for blocking apoptosis of zzso cells coincides with that required for zzso zzso Signals through zzso arrest cells in the G1 phase of the cell zzso which is followed by zzso zzso while constitutive expression of zzso leads to the inhibition of zzso zzso zzso fails to induce S phase zzso By zzso zzso both zzso and zzso resume their normal expression zzso which are sufficient for passing the restriction point in G1 even in the presence of the apoptotic signals mediated by zzso These results suggest that cooperation of zzso zzso and zzso induced by zzso signaling plays a key role in zzso selective growth of B zzso
