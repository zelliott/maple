zzso sent through zzso play crucial roles in B cell zzso including blocking zzso of zzso center B zzso In this study, using a zzso B cell zzso line that zzso zzso by the zzso of surface zzso receptors zzso we have demonstrated that zzso zzso are linked to induction of the zzso zzso and zzso proteins whose expression was significantly suppressed by the zzso signal through zzso zzso analyses of zzso revealed that the domain of human zzso required for blocking zzso of zzso cells zzso with that required for zzso zzso zzso through zzso arrest cells in the zzso phase of the cell cycle, which is followed by zzso However, while zzso expression of zzso leads to the zzso of zzso Nevertheless, zzso fails to induce S phase zzso By zzso zzso both zzso and zzso resume their normal expression levels, which are sufficient for passing the restriction point in zzso even in the presence of the zzso signals zzso by zzso These results suggest that cooperation of zzso zzso and zzso induced by zzso signaling plays a key role in zzso selective growth of B zzso
