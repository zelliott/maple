Of the thirteen active carbonic anhydrase zzso zzso the transmembrane isoform CA IX has been shown to be linked with zzso CA IX presents an ectopic expression in a multitude of carcinomas derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contrasting with its restricted expression in normal zzso namely in the epithelia of the gastrointestinal zzso It has been demonstrated that this zzso CA is strongly overexpressed in hypoxic zzso participating in tumor cell environment acidosis and contributing to malignant progression and poor treatment zzso zzso CA IX could thus be an important means of controlling cancer zzso Modulation of extracellular tumor pH via inhibition of CA IX activity represents a promising approach to novel anticancer zzso Much attention has recently been paid to the CA IX inhibitors drug zzso and efforts have been made to obtain zzso IX zzso with putative applications as antitumor zzso zzso This review will focus on the different CA IX inhibitors described in the literature which could represent excellent potential as candidate therapeutic agents in cancer zzso
