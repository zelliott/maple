MicroRNA zzso is known to be downregulated and to act as an zzso in melanoma zzso At zzso we found that exogenous zzso increased pigmentation and protein expression levels of the melanoma antigen recognized by T cells zzso zzso zzso zzso in the human melanoma cells zzso zzso treatment with an inhibitor of zzso downregulated the expression level of zzso The target gene of zzso involved in the mechanism was zzso superfamily protein 5b zzso which was revealed by gene silencing using short interfering RNA and luciferase activity zzso zzso immunocytochemistry showed obvious accumulation of zzso around nuclei of human melanoma zzso cells transfected with zzso or zzso zzso treatment with the zzso zzso but not zzso exhibited effects on human epidermal zzso isolated from zzso pigmented adult skin similar to those on melanoma zzso In zzso the data indicated that exogenous zzso also negatively regulated the cAMP response zzso protein 1 zzso transcription factor zzso zzso which is one of the main pathways active in melanoma zzso In zzso our data indicated that zzso zzso had a pivotal role in melanoma through reducing zzso transport and promoting zzso by targeting zzso and through negative regulation of the zzso zzso
