A comparative analysis was performed of the properties of cloned zzso and zzso receptors and their ability to induce ion currents and zzso zzso 

zzso oocytes were injected with zzso that codes for rat zzso and zzso and bovine zzso receptors and membrane currents were recorded by using the zzso zzso zzso zzso maturation was scored by observation of the germinal vesicle breakdown zzso 

Xenopus oocytes expressing zzso or zzso generated oscillatory chloride currents by coupling to the zzso zzso zzso zzso II activation of zzso oocytes expressing rat zzso yielded larger chloride currents zzso zzso than those generated by oocytes expressing bovine zzso zzso zzso Oocytes expressing rat zzso were recovered from desensitization after zzso h and completely after zzso zzso whereas oocytes expressing bovine zzso receptors were unable to do zzso Expression of rat zzso generated smaller chloride currents zzso zzso Expression of zzso receptors triggered zzso whereas zzso did zzso The proportion of oocytes developing zzso was greater for zzso oocytes than for oocytes that were zzso zzso oocytes injected with zzso secreted into the zzso a zzso zzso that stimulated zzso of zzso This media elicited inward and outward membrane currents when applied to zzso zzso 

Activation of zzso and zzso receptors couple to similar metabolic cascades in Xenopus laevis zzso zzso the pathway activated by zzso zzso to induce zzso zzso
