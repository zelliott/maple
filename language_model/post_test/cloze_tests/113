A method is described for the rapid comparison of protein binding sites using geometric matching to detect similar zzso zzso The geometric matching detects common atomic features through identification of the maximum common zzso or zzso These features are not necessarily evident from sequence or from global structural similarity giving additional insight into molecular recognition not evident from current sequence or structural classification zzso Here we use the method to produce an zzso comparison of phosphate binding sites in a number of different nucleotide zzso zzso The similarity search is combined with clustering of similar sites to allow a preliminary structural zzso Clustering by site similarity produces a classification of binding sites for the 476 representative local environments producing ten main clusters representing half of the representative zzso The similarities make sense in terms of both structural and functional classification zzso The ten main clusters represent a very limited number of unique structural binding motifs for zzso These are the structural zzso zzso binding motif zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similar classification schemes for nucleotide binding proteins have also been arrived at independently by others using different zzso
