zzso evidence points to a role for circulating zzso zzso cells, including populations of zzso and zzso cells present in peripheral blood, in maintenance of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso including zzso cells, have been shown to contribute to vascular zzso not only as a pool of zzso zzso cells but also as a source of zzso factors at zzso zzso We hypothesized that diminished numbers of circulating immature cells might impair such zzso and zzso zzso potentially contributing to cerebrovascular zzso 

The level of circulating immature cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells, in patients with a history of zzso cerebral zzso events was analyzed to assess possible correlations with the degree of carotid zzso and number of cerebral zzso There was a strong inverse correlation between numbers of circulating zzso and zzso cells and cerebral zzso In contrast, there was no correlation between the degree of zzso and populations of circulating immature zzso Analysis of patients with cerebral artery zzso revealed a significant positive correlation between circulating zzso and zzso cells and regional blood flow in areas of chronic zzso 

These results suggest a possible contribution of circulating zzso and zzso cells in maintenance of the cerebral circulation in settings of zzso zzso Our data demonstrate the utility of a simple and precise method to zzso circulating zzso cells, the latter providing a marker of cerebrovascular zzso
