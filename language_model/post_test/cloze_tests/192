Increasing evidence points to a role for circulating endothelial progenitor zzso including populations of zzso and zzso cells present in peripheral zzso in maintenance of the vasculature and zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso have been shown to contribute to vascular zzso not only as a pool of endothelial progenitor cells but also as a source of zzso factors at ischemic zzso We hypothesized that diminished numbers of circulating immature cells might impair such physiological and zzso zzso potentially contributing to cerebrovascular zzso 

The level of circulating immature zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in patients with a history of zzso cerebral ischemic events was analyzed to assess possible correlations with the degree of carotid atherosclerosis and number of cerebral zzso There was a strong inverse correlation between numbers of circulating zzso and zzso cells and cerebral zzso In zzso there was no correlation between the degree of atherosclerosis and populations of circulating immature zzso Analysis of patients with cerebral artery occlusion revealed a significant positive correlation between circulating zzso and zzso cells and regional blood flow in areas of chronic zzso 

These results suggest a possible contribution of circulating zzso and zzso cells in maintenance of the cerebral circulation in settings of ischemic zzso Our data demonstrate the utility of a simple and precise method to quantify circulating zzso zzso the latter providing a marker of cerebrovascular zzso
