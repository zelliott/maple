Cell invasion through a dense zzso zzso matrix is believed to depend on the ability of cells to generate traction zzso To quantify the role of cell zzso during invasion in zzso we present a technique to measure the elastic strain energy stored in the matrix due to zzso zzso The matrix deformations around a cell were measured by tracking the 3D positions of fluorescent beads tightly embedded in the zzso The bead positions served as nodes for a finite element zzso From the strain in each element and the known matrix zzso we computed the local strain energy in the matrix surrounding the zzso We applied the technique to measure the strain energy of highly invasive zzso breast carcinoma and zzso lung carcinoma cells in collagen zzso The results were compared to the strain energy generated by zzso zzso breast and zzso lung carcinoma zzso In all zzso cells locally zzso the zzso Invasive breast and lung carcinoma cells showed a significantly higher contractility compared to zzso zzso Higher zzso zzso was not universally associated with higher zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso carcinoma cells were the most contractile cells among all cell lines zzso As a universal zzso zzso we found that invasive cells assumed an elongated zzso morphology as opposed to a more spherical shape of zzso zzso zzso the distribution of strain energy density around invasive cells followed patterns of increased complexity and zzso These results suggest that not so much the magnitude of traction generation but their directionality is important for cancer cell zzso
