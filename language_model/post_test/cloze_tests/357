Cell invasion through a dense three-dimensional zzso zzso is believed to depend on the ability of cells to generate traction zzso To zzso the role of cell zzso during invasion in zzso we present a technique to measure the elastic strain energy stored in the zzso due to zzso zzso The zzso zzso around a cell were measured by tracking the zzso positions of fluorescent beads tightly embedded in the zzso The zzso positions served as zzso for a finite element zzso From the strain in each element and the known zzso zzso we zzso the local strain energy in the zzso surrounding the zzso We applied the technique to measure the strain energy of highly invasive zzso breast zzso and zzso lung zzso cells in collagen zzso The results were compared to the strain energy generated by zzso zzso breast and zzso lung zzso zzso In all cases, cells locally contracted the zzso zzso breast and lung zzso cells showed a significantly higher zzso compared to zzso zzso Higher zzso however, was not universally associated with higher zzso For instance, zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were the most zzso cells among all cell lines zzso As a universal feature, however, we found that invasive cells assumed an zzso zzso zzso as opposed to a more zzso shape of zzso zzso zzso the distribution of strain energy density around invasive cells followed patterns of increased complexity and zzso These results suggest that not so much the magnitude of traction generation but their zzso is important for cancer cell zzso
