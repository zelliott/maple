In this zzso we applied zzso fluorescent quantum dots zzso for zzso in vivo and in situ imaging of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma zzso The zzso squamous cancer cell line with high expression of epidermal growth factor receptor zzso was implanted subcutaneously into the head and neck regions of nude mice to establish zzso zzso zzso with an emission wavelength of 800 nm zzso were conjugated with EGFR monoclonal antibodies to develop the zzso Ab zzso In vivo and in vitro studies demonstrated that the zzso Ab probe can specifically bind EGFR expressed on zzso zzso zzso squamous cell carcinoma in the head and neck can be clearly visualized by in vivo imaging after intravenous injection of zzso Ab zzso The results suggested that in situ imaging using zzso Ab probes has unique advantages and prospects for the investigation of tumor zzso early diagnosis and personalized therapy of zzso
