In this study, we applied zzso fluorescent quantum dots zzso for zzso in zzso and in zzso imaging of head and neck zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso zzso cancer cell line with high expression of zzso growth factor zzso zzso was implanted zzso into the head and neck regions of nude mice to establish zzso zzso zzso with an zzso wavelength of 800 zzso zzso were zzso with zzso zzso zzso to develop the zzso zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso probe can specifically bind zzso expressed on zzso zzso zzso zzso cell zzso in the head and neck can be clearly zzso by in zzso imaging after intravenous injection of zzso zzso zzso The results suggested that in zzso imaging using zzso zzso zzso has unique advantages and prospects for the investigation of tumor development, early diagnosis and personalized therapy of zzso
