zzso drugs are effective against tumors that depend on the molecular target of the zzso zzso targets of cytotoxic anticancer drugs are involved in cell zzso drugs acting on such targets are ineffective against zzso tumor zzso survival of which leads to eventual therapy zzso zzso genomic screening identified the zzso protein complex zzso zzso gene as essential for different tumor cell types but not for normal zzso zzso encodes a subunit of zzso protein complex 1 zzso involved in intracellular traffic and zzso The knockdown of zzso but not of zzso encoding isoform zzso protein complex zzso caused Golgi apparatus zzso blocked zzso and induced apoptosis in both proliferating and zzso tumor zzso In zzso inhibition of normal cell growth required simultaneous knockdown of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso not zzso was zzso in the majority of tumor cell lines and in clinical samples of different cancer zzso zzso of zzso protected tumor cells from killing by zzso zzso indicating that tumor cell dependence on zzso is the result of zzso zzso zzso displays no zzso zzso but it zzso microRNA zzso which is zzso in tumor cells concurrently with zzso and acts as a tumor suppressor in vitro and in zzso zzso of microRNA 152 in different cancers and the ensuing zzso of its host gene zzso offer a therapeutic opportunity for zzso selective killing of tumor cells by zzso zzso
