We report here the isolation of three members of a new family of antimicrobial peptides from the zzso of shrimps Penaeus zzso in which immune response has not been experimentally zzso The three molecules display antimicrobial activity against fungi and bacteria with a predominant activity against zzso zzso The complete sequences of these peptides were determined by a combination of enzymatic zzso zzso zzso mass zzso and cDNA cloning using a zzso cDNA zzso The mature molecules zzso and 62 zzso are characterized by an zzso domain rich in proline residues and a zzso domain containing three intramolecular disulfide zzso One of these molecules is zzso modified by a zzso acid at the first zzso Comparison of the data obtained from the cDNA clones and mass spectrometry showed that two of these peptides are probably zzso zzso by elimination of a glycine zzso These molecules with no evident homology to other hitherto described antimicrobial peptides were named zzso
