The neonatal intestinal immune system is still undergoing development at zzso leading to a higher susceptibility to mucosal zzso In this zzso we investigated the effect of zzso on controlling enteric infection by the protozoan zzso zzso in neonatal zzso After zzso zzso a rapid reduction in parasite burden was observed and proved to be dependent on zzso cells and zzso zzso Protection against zzso zzso required additional signals provided by the gut flora through zzso and zzso zzso This cooperation gave rise to higher levels of expression of critical mutually dependent cytokines such as interleukin zzso and type 1 and type 2 zzso the last 2 being known to play a key role in the elimination of infected zzso Our findings demonstrate in neonatal mice how gut flora zzso with zzso to elicit protective intestinal immunity against an intracellular zzso
