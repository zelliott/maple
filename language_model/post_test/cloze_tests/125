We investigated the difference between brain activities in speeded and precisely timed responses to identical visual stimulus using zzso Stimulus used was a row of seven zzso zzso zzso zzso up one after another with constant speed within a trial but with various speeds between zzso Subjects were asked to execute zzso tapping with the right hand in response to the onset of the first LED light in the reaction time zzso task and in anticipation of the onset of the last zzso zzso LED light in the timing zzso In control zzso they were asked to passively view the stimulus without motor zzso Results showed that various zzso areas including contralateral cingulate motor cortex were commonly activated for both tasks relative to the control zzso suggesting these structures are involved in general perception and response execution rather than specific function for speeded or precisely timed zzso In the RT zzso the zzso motor area extending to the cingulate sulcus was activated more strongly than in the timing task probably to focus attention to the onset of the first LED light zzso presented after random zzso The lateral occipital area extending to the zzso junction was activated more strongly in the timing task than in the RT zzso the same area was deactivated in the RT task relative to the control zzso zzso areas were also deactivated in the both zzso This zzso and zzso zzso modification including deactivation underscores significance of the context for perception and action and can have an important role in dexterous or skilled zzso
