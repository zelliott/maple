The persistent circulation of hepatitis A virus zzso in the Mediterranean area suggests the need for monitoring its presence in the zzso A reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was used to detect the presence of zzso in several consecutive raw sewage and final effluent zzso collected over an zzso period from an activated sludge treatment plant in southern zzso 

Two distinct purification zzso either based on zzso with monoclonal antibody zzso or RNA zzso were zzso The possible influence of the antibody used in the AC phase was evaluated in preliminary experiments on zzso zzso using two different monoclonal zzso Hepatitis A virus RNA was detected in all but one sewage environmental sample zzso The contemporary presence of zzso zzso and phages was zzso while zzso growth in cell culture was zzso 

The zzso technique was confirmed to be a valuable tool for the rapid monitoring of zzso in sewage zzso In zzso this study demonstrated that application of different sample purification methods can result in different levels of sensitivity of the assay and zzso in the zzso zzso the choice of antibody can have a crucial zzso 

This work underlines the need for technical uniformity in environmental studies from different laboratories for a correct and useful comparison of the zzso
