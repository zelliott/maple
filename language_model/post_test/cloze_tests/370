The persistent circulation of zzso A virus zzso in the Mediterranean area suggests the need for monitoring its presence in the zzso A reverse zzso chain reaction zzso was used to detect the presence of zzso in several consecutive raw sewage and final zzso samples, collected over an zzso period from an activated sludge treatment plant in southern zzso 

Two distinct zzso zzso either based on zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso The possible influence of the zzso used in the zzso phase was evaluated in preliminary experiments on zzso samples, using two different zzso zzso zzso A virus zzso was detected in all but one sewage environmental sample zzso The contemporary presence of zzso zzso and zzso was observed, while zzso growth in cell culture was zzso 

The zzso technique was confirmed to be a valuable tool for the rapid monitoring of zzso in sewage zzso In addition, this study demonstrated that application of different sample zzso methods can result in different levels of sensitivity of the zzso and that, in the zzso method, the choice of zzso can have a crucial zzso 

This work zzso the need for technical uniformity in environmental studies from different laboratories for a correct and useful comparison of the zzso
