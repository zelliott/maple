Pretreatment with octreotide zzso in zzso has been reported to improve surgical zzso The objective of this study was to analyze retrospectively the effects of a zzso to zzso presurgical treatment with OCT in zzso focusing on electrocardiographic zzso zzso blood pressure zzso glucose and lipid zzso tumor size and zzso easy tumor removal at zzso and morphological findings at zzso zzso patients with zzso who were undergoing surgical treatment were studied randomly before zzso 37 patients were zzso and 22 were treated with OCT at doses ranging zzso zzso for zzso zzso At study zzso untreated and zzso patients had similar circulating GH and zzso growth factor I zzso zzso and cholesterol levels as well as prevalence of overt diabetes zzso zzso and ECG zzso In untreated and zzso zzso zzso radiological imaging documented zzso in 0 and zzso zzso zzso in 10 and zzso zzso and suprasellar zzso in 18 and zzso invasive zzso in 9 and 4 zzso Before zzso serum GH and zzso levels significantly decreased in the 22 zzso zzso and in 5 of zzso a significant shrinkage was zzso ECG abnormalities disappeared in 7 of 11 zzso zzso zzso In 3 of the 7 patients with diabetes zzso treatment with OCT together with low carbohydrate intake normalized blood glucose zzso whereas in 2 zzso insulin could be replaced by oral zzso and in 2 zzso the insulin dose was zzso zzso blood zzso total cholesterol and triglyceride zzso as well as systolic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mm zzso P zzso zzso and diastolic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mm zzso P zzso zzso blood pressure levels were significantly higher in untreated than in zzso zzso Two weeks after zzso circulating GH and zzso levels were normalized in 11 untreated zzso and 12 zzso zzso patients zzso zzso zzso by chi 2 zzso zzso no difference was found between untreated and zzso zzso whereas at zzso a significant increases in cellular atypia zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso One patients in the untreated group died from cardiorespiratory arrest during the early postoperative zzso zzso the average duration of hospitalization after operation was longer in untreated than in zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We conclude that a zzso to zzso treatment with OCT before surgery for zzso adenoma improved clinical conditions and surgical outcome and reduced the duration of hospitalization after zzso
