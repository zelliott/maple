Tumor cells can evade the immune system through several zzso one of which is to block DC zzso It has been suggested that signaling via zzso receptors zzso may be involved in the induction of prophylactic zzso immunity and in the treatment of established zzso In the present study we found that high numbers of tumor cells interfere with zzso activation induced by the zzso ligands LPS and poly zzso Tumor cells blocked zzso and zzso induction of zzso and the zzso molecules zzso and zzso as well as the cytokines zzso zzso and zzso zzso tumor cells induced inhibitory molecules zzso zzso and zzso on spleen DC in vivo and on zzso even in the presence of zzso zzso zzso after a long exposure with tumor zzso purified zzso were unable to respond to a second challenge with zzso zzso The failure of tumor zzso to express zzso molecules and cytokines in the presence of zzso ligands has implications for the future development of zzso cancer immune therapies using zzso ligands as zzso for the activation of zzso
