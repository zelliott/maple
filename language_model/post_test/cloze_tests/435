The pharmacokinetics of alkylating activity were studied in 17 children treated zzso with zzso zzso at 3 zzso as a zzso infusion for 2 consecutive days every 3 zzso with zzso as a zzso Two patients were treated for a newly diagnosed zzso according to the current zzso zzso Society of Pediatric zzso zzso The other 15 patients were treated in a phase II study and presented with one of the following malignancies in zzso neuroblastoma zzso osteosarcoma zzso soft tissue sarcoma zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso lymphoma zzso and acute lymphoblastic leukemia zzso Plasma alkylating activity levels determined by using zzso showed considerable zzso and zzso variations and decreased zzso with mean alpha and beta zzso of 60 min and zzso zzso zzso Probably as a result of liver zzso oxidase zzso on the 2nd day of treatment the terminal zzso were zzso the plasma exposures were zzso and the mean plasma clearances were zzso Renal excretion was almost complete after 24 zzso accounting for a mean of zzso of the injected zzso The CSF alkylating activity zzso obtained in four zzso were always lower than the plasma levels and ranged from 8 to 51 zzso with a mean zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso during the first 12 zzso We conclude that IF alkylating activity was zzso cleared from the zzso with significant interindividual and zzso zzso that the renal contribution to the clearance was zzso and that high levels of CSF alkylating activity could possibly contribute to the CNS toxic side effects observed in pediatric patients treated with zzso zzso
