The Escherichia coli open reading frame zzso encodes a member of a large bacterial protein family of unknown biological zzso The sequences within this family are remotely related to the sequence of zzso ligase zzso an enzyme in the zzso biosynthetic zzso A gene encoding zzso in zzso coli is already zzso The zzso A resolution crystal structure of zzso reveals an overall fold similar to that of zzso synthetase zzso a nitrogen metabolism enzyme that zzso glutamate and ammonia to yield zzso GS and zzso perform related chemical reactions and require ATP and zzso for their zzso The zzso binding of ATP to zzso was confirmed by fluorescence spectroscopy employing zzso zzso zzso and yielding a dissociation constant of 3 zzso zzso zzso The structure of zzso contains a crevice that corresponds to the binding sites of zzso zzso and glutamate in zzso Many of the GS residues that coordinate the metal ions and interact with glutamic acid and the zzso and zzso groups of ATP are also present in zzso GS amino acids that have been associated with ammonia binding have no obvious counterparts in zzso consistent with a substrate specificity that is different from that of zzso zzso activity between glutamic acid and each of the twenty amino acid residues was tested on high performance liquid chromatography zzso by following the hydrolysis of ATP to zzso zzso was observed only with zzso A pyruvate zzso acid dehydrogenase coupled assay was used to rule out GS activity and to determine that zzso exhibits zzso zzso The catalytic rate was found to be approximately zzso slower than that reported for authentic zzso
