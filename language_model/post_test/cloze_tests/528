External loop 5 zzso of serotonin transporter was analyzed by mutating each of the residues from zzso to zzso one at a zzso with zzso zzso was zzso at most zzso although zzso zzso and zzso had low transport zzso Replacement with cysteine rendered mutants zzso sensitive to partial or complete inactivation by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Within this sensitive zzso the rates of reaction varied by over 2 orders of zzso Rates of inactivation were not significantly affected by removal of zzso or by addition of cocaine or zzso These results suggest that modification of zzso interferes with the transport process but is not sensitive to substrate and ion zzso
