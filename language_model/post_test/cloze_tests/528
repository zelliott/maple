External loop 5 zzso of zzso zzso was analyzed by mutating each of the zzso from zzso to zzso one at a time, with zzso zzso was zzso at most positions, although zzso zzso and zzso had low transport zzso Replacement with zzso rendered zzso zzso sensitive to partial or complete zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Within this sensitive region, the rates of reaction varied by over 2 orders of zzso Rates of zzso were not significantly affected by removal of zzso or by addition of cocaine or zzso These results suggest that modification of zzso interferes with the transport process but is not sensitive to zzso and zzso zzso
