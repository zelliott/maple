To test whether a feeding algorithm could improve the nutritional support of intensive care zzso 

Numerous factors may impede delivery of both enteral and parenteral nutrition to patients in the intensive care zzso Often there is a discrepancy between what is prescribed and actual delivery of zzso The purpose of this study was to test the effect of a nutritional support algorithm in an intensive care unit mainly by using the enteral route and if necessary by combining enteral and parenteral zzso 

In this prospective zzso nutritional data were collected from routinely fed critically ill patients zzso zzso during the first three days following admission to the intensive care zzso A nutritional support algorithm was then implemented and nutritional data were collected from critically ill patients who participated in this intervention zzso zzso zzso Data collected included the total amount of zzso prescribed zzso zzso onset of delivery of enteral zzso enteral zzso parenteral zzso and the use and size of enteral feeding zzso 

Patients in the intervention group were both prescribed and actually received significantly larger amounts of nutrients than patients in the control zzso They also received a larger proportion of their nutrients in the form of enteral zzso In zzso the nutritional support algorithm led to greater consistency in nursing practices with respect to aspiration of gastric content and rate of increment in enteral zzso 

The study confirms that a nutritional support algorithm improved the delivery of nutrients to critically ill zzso The algorithm was most effective with respect to the delivery of enteral zzso The effect was primarily because of early and more rapid increment in the delivery of enteral nutrition administered by nurses based on improved physician zzso The combination of enteral and parenteral nutrition may contribute to meeting adequate nutritional zzso 

By using a nutritional algorithm focused on enteral zzso but including parenteral nutrition as a zzso it is possible to improve the delivery of clinical nutrition in the intensive care unit zzso
