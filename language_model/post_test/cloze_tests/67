Prenatal ethanol exposure zzso induces dyslipidemia and hyperglycemia in fetus and adult zzso zzso whether zzso increases the susceptibility to zzso fatty liver disease zzso in offspring and its underlying mechanism remain zzso This study aimed to demonstrate an increased susceptibility to zzso diet zzso zzso and its intrauterine programming mechanisms in female rat offspring with zzso zzso model of intrauterine growth retardation zzso was established by zzso the female fetus and adult offspring that fed normal diet zzso or zzso were zzso The results showed zzso in zzso zzso serum zzso zzso slightly decreased and zzso growth zzso zzso and glucose increased with partial zzso zzso In zzso zzso serum zzso zzso while serum zzso glucose and triglyceride zzso zzso with notable zzso zzso higher metabolic status and zzso zzso Enhanced liver expression of the zzso zzso zzso and lipid synthesis as well as reduced expression of lipid output were accompanied in zzso zzso In zzso zzso serum zzso increased while zzso zzso with low body zzso zzso and zzso ultrastructural zzso Hepatic zzso expression as well as lipid output was zzso while lipid synthesis significantly zzso Based on these zzso we propose a zzso hypothesis for an increased susceptibility to zzso zzso in female offspring of zzso That zzso the intrauterine programming of liver glucose and lipid metabolic function is zzso first zzso and postnatal adaptive zzso growth triggered by intrauterine programming of zzso axis acts as zzso second zzso
