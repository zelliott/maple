zzso ethanol exposure zzso zzso zzso and zzso in fetus and adult zzso However, whether zzso increases the zzso to zzso fatty liver disease zzso in offspring and its underlying mechanism remain zzso This study aimed to demonstrate an increased zzso to high-fat diet zzso zzso and its zzso programming mechanisms in female rat offspring with zzso zzso model of zzso growth zzso zzso was established by zzso the female fetus and adult offspring that fed normal diet zzso or zzso were zzso The results showed that, in zzso group, serum zzso zzso slightly decreased and zzso growth zzso zzso and zzso increased with partial catch-up zzso In zzso group, serum zzso zzso while serum IGF-1, zzso and zzso zzso increased, with notable catch-up growth, higher zzso status and zzso zzso zzso liver expression of the IGF-1 pathway, zzso and zzso synthesis as well as reduced expression of zzso output were accompanied in zzso zzso In zzso zzso serum zzso increased while IGF-1 zzso with low body weight, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso IGF-1 expression as well as zzso output was zzso while zzso synthesis significantly zzso Based on these findings, we propose a zzso hypothesis for an increased zzso to zzso zzso in female offspring of zzso That is, the zzso programming of liver zzso and zzso zzso function is zzso first zzso and zzso zzso catch-up growth triggered by zzso programming of zzso axis acts as zzso second zzso
