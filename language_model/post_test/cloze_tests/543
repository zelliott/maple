zzso adenocarcinoma zzso is the zzso most common cancer type worldwide with a dismal zzso zzso zzso zzso the replacement of the normal squamous epithelia with glandular zzso is the first step in the pathway towards zzso Although most patients with zzso present de zzso the presence of the easily detectable zzso precursor zzso zzso zzso enables the possibility of early detection of zzso patients who are more likely to zzso zzso identification of zzso patients depends on histopathological assessment of dysplasia with no regards to molecular zzso In the zzso screening and risk stratification initiatives for zzso oesophagus that incorporate molecular profiles might permit improved early diagnosis and intervention strategies with the possibility of preventing zzso For the majority of patients presenting de novo at an advanced zzso combining zzso zzso datasets with current clinical staging algorithms might enable zzso to be better classified according to distinct molecular zzso thereby leading to better targeted treatment strategies as well as cancer monitoring zzso This Review discusses how the latest advances in zzso technologies have improved our understanding of the development and biology of zzso and how this development might alter patient management in the zzso
