zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso is a key regulator in the signals zzso by zzso zzso and zzso receptors zzso The regulatory mechanism of zzso in response to various tissue types and stimuli remains incompletely zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso regulates zzso signals by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes a marked reduction in zzso and zzso activity induced by stimulation of zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso zzso cells display enhanced production of inflammatory zzso Moreover, zzso mice exhibit decreased survival in response to challenge with zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso activity by interfering with the interaction between zzso and zzso which is a key regulator protein for zzso zzso zzso Upon stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso causes a marked increase in zzso zzso activity that in turn zzso a substantial enhancement of zzso gene zzso indicating that zzso is zzso involved in the zzso signaling zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso Our findings contribute to understanding the molecular zzso of the impaired immune responses seen in type 2 diabetes, where zzso plays a key role both in driving insulin resistance and modulating zzso zzso
