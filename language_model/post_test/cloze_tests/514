To investigate the sustained release rule of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the effect zzso in killing zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were prepared by method of zzso & evaporation of organic zzso Its zzso was observed by transmission electron zzso and the zzso efficiency of zzso was determined by ultraviolet zzso zzso was put in a dialysis bag to observe the releasing characteristics of zzso from zzso zzso in zzso Human liver zzso cells of the line zzso were cultured with zzso of different zzso or the original drug of zzso as control group for 24, 36, or 48 zzso zzso method was used to observe the cancer zzso zzso zzso nude mice underwent subcutaneous injection of zzso cells at the right zzso and then randomly divided into 4 groups to undergo intravenous injection of zzso zzso group), original drug of zzso zzso drug group), zzso zzso group), or normal saline zzso control zzso once every 5 days for 3 zzso zzso days later the mice were killed with the tumors taken out to measure the weight to analyze the zzso effect against zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso were of round or elliptical shape with the diameter of about 83 zzso and the zzso zzso efficiency was about zzso The releasing test in zzso zzso a sustained release of over 50% of zzso zzso in zzso zzso for about 7 zzso Both the zzso zzso and naked drug zzso inhibited the growth of zzso cells with a similar zzso rate zzso vs zzso P zzso zzso meanwhile the zzso zzso failed to inhibit the zzso zzso zzso experiment showed an zzso rate of zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso of zzso significantly higher than that of the naked drug zzso zzso 

zzso zzso can effectively inhibit the growth of zzso zzso
