More than a quarter of the zzso population is infected with nematode zzso and more than a hundred species of nematodes are parasites of humans zzso Despite extensive morbidity and mortality caused by nematode zzso the biological mechanisms of zzso interactions are poorly zzso largely because of the lack of genetically tractable model zzso We have demonstrated that the insect parasitic nematode zzso zzso its bacterial zzso zzso zzso and the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster constitute a zzso model for nematode zzso and parasitic zzso We find that infective zzso zzso of zzso which contain zzso in their zzso can zzso and kill Drosophila zzso We show that infection activates an immune response in Drosophila that results in the temporally dynamic expression of a subset of antimicrobial peptide zzso zzso and that this immune response is induced specifically by zzso We also investigated the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso the developmental process that occurs in parasitic nematodes upon host invasion and that is necessary for successful zzso We find that the zzso neurons and signaling pathways that control zzso recovery in Caenorhabditis elegans also control zzso recovery in zzso suggesting conservation of these developmental processes across zzso and parasitic zzso
