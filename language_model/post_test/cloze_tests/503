Apple zzso zzso x zzso zzso sequences sharing homology with known resistance genes were cloned using a zzso approach with degenerate oligonucleotide primers designed on conserved regions of the zzso site zzso Sequence analysis of the amplified fragments indicated the presence of at least 27 families of zzso genes in zzso each composed of several very similar or nearly identical zzso The zzso repeat homologues appeared to include members of the two major groups that have been described in dicot zzso one possessing a zzso receptor element and one lacking such a zzso Genetic mapping of the cloned sequences was achieved through the development of zzso and SSCP markers using a segregating population of a cross between the two apple cultivars zzso and zzso Several of the apple resistance gene homologues mapped in the zzso or at least on the same linkage zzso of known loci controlling resistance to various zzso The utility of resistance zzso sequences as molecular markers for breeding purposes and for gene cloning is zzso
