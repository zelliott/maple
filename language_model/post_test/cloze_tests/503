Apple ( zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences sharing zzso with known resistance genes were cloned using a zzso approach with zzso zzso zzso designed on zzso regions of the zzso site zzso zzso analysis of the amplified fragments indicated the presence of at least 27 families of zzso genes in apple, each composed of several very similar or nearly identical zzso The zzso repeat zzso appeared to include members of the two major groups that have been described in zzso zzso one possessing a zzso zzso element and one lacking such a zzso zzso mapping of the cloned sequences was achieved through the development of zzso and zzso markers using a segregating population of a cross between the two apple zzso Fiesta and zzso Several of the apple resistance gene zzso mapped in the vicinity, or at least on the same linkage group, of known zzso controlling resistance to various zzso The utility of resistance zzso sequences as molecular markers for breeding purposes and for gene cloning is zzso
