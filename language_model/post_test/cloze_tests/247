zzso cancers are extremely difficult to treat and rarely result in a zzso The application of zzso viruses is a potential strategy for controlling zzso cancer because intratumoral zzso injection of an zzso zzso such as zzso zzso results in tumor cell zzso and subsequent release of tumor antigens into the zzso zzso the viruses can serve as a vehicle for delivering genes of interest to cancer zzso 

In the current zzso we hypothesize that in zzso mice zzso with DNA encoding an immunogenic foreign zzso zzso zzso followed by a boost with zzso administration of zzso virus encoding the same foreign zzso zzso can generate enhanced antitumor effects through the combination of viral zzso and zzso zzso 

We observed that zzso mice zzso with zzso DNA and boosted with zzso encoding zzso zzso generated significant therapeutic antitumor effects as well as induced significant levels of zzso zzso T cells in two different tumor zzso zzso treatment with zzso not only zzso the tumor and stromal cells directly but also renders the tumor cells and surrounding stromal cells susceptible to zzso zzso zzso zzso resulting in enhanced antitumor therapeutic zzso 

zzso the current study may provide a novel therapeutic strategy for the control of zzso zzso
