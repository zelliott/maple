Video capsule enteroscopy zzso has revolutionized small bowel zzso enabling visual examination of the mucosa of the entire small zzso while MR zzso zzso and CT zzso zzso have largely replaced conventional zzso zzso A new indication for MRE and zzso is the clinical suspicion of small bowel zzso as indicated by delayed or zzso of a test capsule given before a zzso zzso to exclude zzso The aim of this study was to determine the clinical value of subsequent MRE and zzso in patients in whom a test capsule did not present itself in due zzso 

zzso consecutive patients were identified with a delayed or unnoticed delivery of the test zzso Seventy patients consented to participate and underwent MRE zzso or zzso zzso The medical records and imaging studies were retrospectively reviewed and zzso laboratory results and imaging findings zzso 

Lesions compatible with Crohns disease were shown by MRE in 5 zzso by zzso in one and by zzso in zzso one of whom had lesions on zzso In patients without alarm symptoms and findings zzso zzso zzso zzso nocturnal zzso zzso zzso abscess and abnormal blood zzso imaging studies did not unveil any such zzso zzso were performed in only 20 zzso mainly younger than 50 years of zzso although no stenotic lesion was shown by MRE and zzso In the remaining 50 patients no zzso or other endoscopic intervention was performed indicating that the referring physician was content with the diagnostic information from MRE or zzso 

The diagnostic value of MRE and zzso is sufficient for clinical management of most patients with suspected small bowel zzso and thus zzso may be omitted or at least zzso for later zzso
