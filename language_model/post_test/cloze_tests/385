In late infantile and juvenile forms of neuronal zzso zzso commonly known as Batten disease zzso ATP synthase subunit c zzso in the zzso of neural zzso By using polyclonal zzso raised against bovine liver subunit c and an image analysis system for the quantification of zzso alkaline phosphatase zzso we have demonstrated that zzso zzso from a late infantile and a juvenile BD patient stored zzso more subunit c as compared to normal zzso
