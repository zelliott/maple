zzso zzso is an important cause of zzso media, zzso and lower respiratory tract infections in patients with chronic zzso pulmonary zzso The zzso outer membrane of zzso zzso contains a 29 zzso band, previously named outer membrane protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso band was used to screen a zzso zzso zzso library and the gene for zzso zzso was cloned and zzso Analysis of outer membrane by zzso focusing and zzso protein sequence of the 29 zzso band revealed that the band is actually two individual proteins designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso with an zzso point of zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso and has an zzso point of zzso Analysis of the sequence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from 25 clinical zzso revealed a high degree of conservation among zzso The sequence conservation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso among zzso combined with previous observations that zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain zzso on the bacterial surface, indicate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are potential vaccine zzso for zzso zzso
