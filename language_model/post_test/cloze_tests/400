zzso zzso is an important cause of otitis zzso zzso and lower respiratory tract infections in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary zzso The purified outer membrane of zzso zzso contains a 29 kDa zzso previously named outer membrane protein G1 zzso zzso zzso antiserum to the zzso G1 band was used to screen a genomic lambda phage library and the gene for zzso zzso was cloned and zzso Analysis of outer membrane by isoelectric focusing and zzso protein sequence of the 29 kDa band revealed that the band is actually two individual proteins designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is a lipoprotein with an isoelectric point of zzso zzso zzso contains an unblocked zzso and has an isoelectric point of zzso Analysis of the sequence of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from 25 clinical isolates revealed a high degree of conservation among zzso The sequence conservation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso among zzso combined with previous observations that zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain epitopes on the bacterial zzso indicate that zzso zzso and zzso zzso are potential vaccine antigens for zzso zzso
