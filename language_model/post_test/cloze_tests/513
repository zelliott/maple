For many zzso bacterial cells were considered primarily as zzso zzso zzso in recent zzso it has become evident zzso far from operating in zzso they coordinate collective behaviour in response to environmental challenges using sophisticated intercellular communication zzso zzso communication between bacteria is mediated by small zzso signal molecules that trigger changes in gene expression in response to fluctuations in population zzso This zzso generally referred to as quorum sensing zzso controls diverse phenotypes in numerous zzso and zzso zzso Recent advances have revealed that bacteria are not limited to communication within their own species but are capable of zzso zzso and zzso zzso unrelated species to intercept messages and zzso zzso into behavioural zzso either for the good of the population or for the benefit of one species over zzso It is also evident that QS is not limited to the bacterial zzso The study of zzso intercellular signalling networks between bacteria and both zzso and multicellular eukaryotes as well as between eukaryotes is just beginning to unveil a rich diversity of communication zzso
