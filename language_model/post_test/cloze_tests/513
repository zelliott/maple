For many years, bacterial cells were considered primarily as selfish individuals, but, in recent years, it has become evident that, far from operating in isolation, they coordinate collective zzso in response to environmental challenges using sophisticated zzso communication zzso zzso communication between bacteria is zzso by small zzso signal molecules that trigger changes in gene expression in response to fluctuations in population zzso This process, generally referred to as zzso sensing zzso controls diverse zzso in numerous zzso and zzso zzso Recent advances have revealed that bacteria are not limited to communication within their own species but are capable of zzso zzso and zzso zzso unrelated species to intercept messages and coerce zzso into zzso zzso either for the good of the population or for the benefit of one species over zzso It is also evident that zzso is not limited to the bacterial zzso The study of zzso zzso zzso networks between bacteria and both zzso and zzso zzso as well as between zzso is just beginning to unveil a rich diversity of communication zzso
