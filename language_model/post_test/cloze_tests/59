Tissue fibrosis is a leading cause of death in patients with systemic sclerosis zzso Effective zzso treatments are not zzso zzso the authors investigated inhibition of hedgehog signalling by targeting zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso 

The activation status of the hedgehog pathway was assessed by immunohistochemistry for zzso transcription factors and by quantification of hedgehog target zzso Hedgehog signalling was inhibited by the selective inhibitor zzso and by small interfering RNA against zzso in the models of zzso dermal fibrosis and in zzso zzso 

Hedgehog signalling is activated in zzso and in murine models of zzso Inhibition of zzso either by zzso or by small interfering RNA prevented dermal zzso zzso differentiation and accumulation of collagen upon challenge with zzso zzso zzso also exerted potent zzso effects in zzso mice and did prevent progression of fibrosis and induced regression of zzso zzso 

Inhibition of hedgehog signalling exerted potent zzso effects in preclinical models of zzso in both preventive and therapeutic zzso These findings might have direct translational implications because inhibitors of zzso are already available and yielded promising results in initial clinical zzso
