zzso zzso is a leading cause of death in patients with systemic sclerosis zzso zzso zzso treatments are not zzso Here, the authors investigated zzso of zzso zzso by targeting zzso zzso as a novel zzso zzso 

The zzso status of the zzso zzso was assessed by zzso for zzso zzso factors and by zzso of zzso target zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by the selective inhibitor zzso and by small interfering zzso against zzso in the models of zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso 

zzso zzso is activated in zzso and in zzso models of zzso zzso of zzso either by zzso or by small interfering zzso prevented zzso zzso zzso differentiation and zzso of collagen upon challenge with zzso zzso zzso also exerted potent zzso effects in zzso mice and did prevent progression of zzso and induced zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso of zzso zzso exerted potent zzso effects in zzso models of zzso in both preventive and therapeutic zzso These findings might have direct zzso implications because zzso of zzso are already available and yielded promising results in initial clinical zzso
