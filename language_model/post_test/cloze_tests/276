In zzso cells interact with zzso zzso or neighboring cells by a zzso intervention pattern of specific cell surface receptors and zzso zzso Resident cells of the injured tissue communicate with circulating zzso cells by zzso and direct zzso zzso These zzso stimulate expression of the zzso molecules zzso zzso and zzso and zzso on zzso cell surfaces and zzso beta zzso and zzso on zzso zzso White blood cells then adhere to the activated zzso cells, migrate through the vessel wall, and penetrate areas of infection or tissue zzso The basis for a cellular immune response is formed by the interaction between T zzso and zzso cells amplified by zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso
