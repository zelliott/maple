In the past two decades a trickle of manuscripts examining the zzso central nervous system immune consequences of the drugs of abuse has now zzso to a significant body of zzso zzso these studies reported associative evidence of central nervous system zzso resulting from exposure to the drugs of abuse demonstrating key implications for neurotoxicity and disease progression associated zzso for zzso HIV zzso zzso more recently this zzso activation of central immune signaling is now understood to contribute substantially to the pharmacodynamic actions of the drugs of zzso by enhancing the engagement of classical mesolimbic dopamine reward pathways and withdrawal zzso This review will highlight the key in vivo zzso zzso biological and molecular evidence of these central immune signaling actions of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso this new appreciation of central immune signaling activity of drugs of abuse provides novel therapeutic interventions and opportunities to identify zzso zzso individuals through the use of zzso Discussion will also cover the evidence of modulation of this signaling by existing clinical and zzso drug zzso and novel pharmacological zzso zzso following examination of the breadth of central immune signaling actions of the drugs of abuse highlighted zzso the current known common immune signaling components will be outlined and their impact on established addiction zzso zzso thereby synthesizing a common zzso hypothesis of zzso
