The effect of zzso zzso a natural polymer used as a dietary zzso on human zzso cells was zzso zzso morphological change was demonstrated by nuclear zzso zzso cells showed elevation of zzso zzso but no significant elevation of zzso zzso which suggest that proapoptotic effect of chitosan is attributable to death receptor activation and not to activation of the zzso c zzso zzso increased expression of zzso but decreased zzso zzso Use of monoclonal antibodies to inhibit zzso signal transduction did not attenuate the proapoptotic activity of zzso Examination of zzso revealed that TNFalpha mRNA expression was markedly increased by chitosan treatment while zzso mRNA was not zzso Although the direct interaction of chitosan with death receptors remains zzso the results suggest that its proapoptotic effect might be related to interaction with TNFalpha or zzso
