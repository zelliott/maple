Synovial tissue is rarely available from patients with early zzso with the exception of synovial zzso zzso T cell populations early in the development of synovitis may be enriched in zzso cells and critical to disease zzso To investigate the T cell repertoire in early zzso we utilized a PCR protocol for detection of T cell receptor zzso transcripts present in small amounts of synovial zzso To expand the substrate for zzso zzso of cDNA was performed with a zzso constant region primer plus either a mixture of variable region primers or random zzso Utilizing this method improved the sensitivity of zzso This technique is applied here to the analysis of TCR transcripts in synovial biopsies from individuals with early rheumatoid arthritis zzso and zzso zzso TCR zzso transcripts were detectable in zzso RA and zzso zzso specimens zzso with zzso transcripts detected in zzso early RA and zzso zzso specimens zzso zzso of transcripts by sequencing of cloned PCR products verified the specificity of zzso The most frequently expressed TCR V region families in early RA synovitis were V alpha zzso V alpha zzso V alpha zzso V beta zzso V beta 9 and V beta zzso Several of these V regions have previously been implicated in studies of chronic RA zzso J alpha and J beta region usage was similar to that seen in chronic zzso and conserved N region motifs were zzso We conclude that it is possible to detect TCR transcripts in small synovial biopsies from individuals with early zzso TRUNCATED AT 250 zzso
