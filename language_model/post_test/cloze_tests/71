To determine whether early zzso limb posturing is reliable in zzso or zzso of the seizure generator in 14 patients with zzso supplementary zzso area zzso zzso 

All patients underwent high-quality zzso scans and zzso zzso 

The zzso seizure zzso predicted focal or regional zzso onset in the zzso in six zzso zzso Three had a focal zzso seizure zzso and three had a regional seizure onset with involvement of one zzso plus adjacent zzso The eight remaining patients had diffuse zzso or bilateral seizure zzso Eight of 14 patients underwent a frontal or central cortical zzso but a good outcome was seen in only zzso 2 with no zzso zzso and 1 with an extensive central zzso 

zzso zzso is suggestive of early involvement of this region but is by no means a reliable indicator that the primary zzso contains the seizure zzso
