To determine whether early tonic limb zzso is reliable in zzso or localizing of the seizure generator in 14 patients with zzso supplementary sensorimotor area zzso zzso 

All patients underwent zzso MRI scans and zzso zzso 

The zzso seizure zzso predicted focal or regional ictal onset in the zzso in six zzso zzso Three had a focal zzso seizure zzso and three had a regional seizure onset with involvement of one zzso plus adjacent zzso The eight remaining patients had diffuse zzso or bilateral seizure zzso Eight of 14 patients underwent a frontal or central cortical zzso but a good outcome was seen in only zzso 2 with no zzso resection and 1 with an extensive central zzso 

zzso zzso is suggestive of early involvement of this region but is by no means a reliable indicator that the primary zzso contains the seizure zzso
