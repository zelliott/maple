Our purpose was, through the comparison of the characteristics of zzso curve on zzso dynamic zzso zzso among groups of giant cell tumor of bone zzso zzso benign giant cell tumor of bone zzso and secondary zzso giant cell tumor of bone zzso to find clues to predict the zzso transformation of zzso 

21 patients diagnosed as zzso were included in this zzso All cases took recurrence after zzso zzso 9 cases were confirmed as zzso and 12 cases were confirmed as zzso Cases were divided into four groups: group A, zzso zzso group B, zzso zzso group C, zzso zzso group D, zzso zzso Enhancement zzso of zzso on zzso was calculated using formula: zzso where zzso was signal intensity of zzso on zzso zzso images and zzso was signal intensity of zzso on zzso zzso 60, zzso Enhancement index of each group in each phase was compared using zzso zzso zzso Slope values of zzso curve were compared by the same zzso 

zzso curve of zzso was characterized by a steep upward slope followed by an early and rapid zzso zzso zzso curve of zzso and zzso was characterized by a steep slope followed by a relatively slow zzso zzso No significant difference in enhancement index was found in the first phase zzso There was significant difference in the second and the third phase zzso Enhancement index of group B zzso was zzso There was no difference in rising slope value zzso 

Dynamic zzso zzso appears a helpful method to find new clues to predict zzso transformation of zzso
