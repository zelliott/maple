Our purpose zzso through the comparison of the characteristics of zzso curve on zzso dynamic zzso MRI among groups of giant cell tumor of bone zzso recurrent benign giant cell tumor of bone zzso and secondary malignant giant cell tumor of bone zzso to find clues to predict the malignant transformation of zzso 

21 patients diagnosed as zzso were included in this zzso All cases took recurrence after intralesional zzso 9 cases were confirmed as zzso and 12 cases were confirmed as zzso Cases were divided into four zzso group zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso Enhancement zzso of lesions on DCEMRI was calculated using zzso zzso where zzso was signal intensity of lesion on zzso zzso images and zzso was signal intensity of lesion on DCEMRI zzso zzso zzso Enhancement index of each group in each phase was compared using zzso ANOVA zzso Slope values of zzso curve were compared by the same zzso 

zzso curve of zzso was characterized by a steep upward slope followed by an early and rapid washout zzso zzso curve of zzso and zzso was characterized by a steep slope followed by a relatively slow washout zzso No significant difference in enhancement index was found in the first phase zzso There was significant difference in the second and the third phase zzso Enhancement index of group B zzso was zzso There was no difference in rising slope value zzso 

Dynamic zzso MRI appears a helpful method to find new clues to predict malignant transformation of zzso
