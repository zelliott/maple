zzso D3 zzso has potent antiproliferative actions but zzso effects obstruct its application in the treatment of zzso zzso zzso analogs of zzso are designed with a clear dissociation between both zzso Here the biological activity of the zzso zzso analog zzso is zzso 

zzso assays as well as mouse models were used to determine the activity of zzso in vitro and in zzso 

zzso has zzso higher antiproliferative actions than zzso but is also twice as zzso To determine the role of the zzso D Receptor zzso in mediating the zzso actions of zzso the analog was daily administered to zzso and zzso zzso This treatment caused drastic weight loss and death in zzso mice but not in zzso zzso 

Analog zzso has greater antiproliferative action but also zzso higher zzso effects which depended entirely on zzso signalling zzso
