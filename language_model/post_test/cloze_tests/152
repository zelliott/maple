To find an accurate algorithm for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction in zzso chest pain patients on presentation to the emergency zzso 

In a prospective clinical zzso we compared the diagnostic performances of clinical zzso presenting zzso creatinine zzso creatine kinase MB activity and mass zzso zzso and cardiac troponin T test results of hospital admission blood zzso By classification and regression zzso a decision tree for the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction was zzso 

Emergency room of a Department of Internal Medicine zzso zzso 

One hundred fourteen zzso chest pain patients zzso delay from onset of chest pain to hospital zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso to zzso 26 zzso and 19 zzso myocardial zzso 49 patients with unstable angina zzso and 20 patients with chest pain caused by other zzso 

Of each parameter taken by zzso the ECG was zzso most informative zzso under receiver operating characteristic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso kinase MB zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso kinase zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso kinase MB zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In patients presenting 3 h or less after the onset of chest zzso ECG signs of acute transmural myocardial ischemia were the best discriminator between patients with and without myocardial zzso In patients presenting more than 3 zzso zzso creatine kinase MB mass concentrations zzso zzso zzso zzso were superior to the zzso clinical zzso and all other biochemical markers zzso This algorithm for diagnosing acute myocardial infarction was superior to each parameter by itself and was characterized by zzso zzso a zzso zzso a zzso positive and negative predictive zzso and a zzso zzso 

We found an algorithm that could accurately separate the myocardial infarction patients from the others on admission to the emergency zzso zzso this classifier could be a valuable diagnostic aid for rapid confirmation of a suspected myocardial zzso
