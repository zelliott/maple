The use of Bayesian algorithm on theophylline pharmacokinetics was studied in asthmatic zzso Each patient received multiple oral doses of the zzso theophylline zzso zzso zzso in an amount of zzso mg as maintenance zzso Plasma theophylline concentration was measured by a commercially available zzso fluorescent zzso The data were analyzed by applying a zzso model with both zzso and zzso zzso based on a nonlinear least squares zzso Bayesian zzso The present study indicated that the zzso absorption model provided better estimated pharmacokinetic parameters than the zzso absorption zzso It was also found that prediction by the Bayesian method is dependent on number of sampling zzso but the best sampling time is still zzso This may be due to the small zzso plasma concentration zzso From these zzso we suggest that parameters with larger variances should be chosen by considering the interindividual and intraindividual variabilities in order to improve the accuracy of population zzso
