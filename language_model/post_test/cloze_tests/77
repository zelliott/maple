The use of zzso zzso on zzso zzso was studied in zzso zzso Each patient received multiple oral doses of the zzso zzso tablet zzso zzso in an amount of zzso zzso as maintenance zzso Plasma zzso concentration was measured by a commercially available zzso fluorescent zzso The data were analyzed by applying a zzso model with both zzso and zzso zzso based on a zzso least squares method, zzso zzso The present study indicated that the zzso zzso model provided better estimated zzso parameters than the zzso zzso zzso It was also found that prediction by the zzso method is dependent on number of sampling trials, but the best sampling time is still zzso This may be due to the small zzso plasma concentration zzso From these findings, we suggest that parameters with larger zzso should be chosen by considering the zzso and zzso zzso in order to improve the accuracy of population zzso
