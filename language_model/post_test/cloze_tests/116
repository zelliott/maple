zzso metastases are found in about zzso of all pituitary zzso They often derive from zzso zzso and zzso tract zzso very rarely from thyroid zzso zzso symptoms of thyroid carcinoma metastatic to the pituitary gland are usually zzso with central neurological impairment due to zzso expansion in the zzso zzso zzso is more often associated with papillary and medullary rather than follicular thyroid carcinoma zzso Here we describe a patient with pituitary metastasis from zzso who had zzso with thyrotropin zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso who presented with visual deficits and pain to the right zzso was found on magnetic resonance imaging to have a large mass involving the pituitary zzso zzso was found to have pituitary insufficiency based on zzso hormone and zzso hormone zzso zzso biopsy of the mass revealed metastases from zzso After total zzso which confirmed widely invasive zzso the patient underwent external beam radiation therapy of the metastases for progressive neurological symptoms and an increase in orbit zzso Since endogenous TSH production was zzso we used recombinant human TSH zzso as preparation for a series of radioiodine zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso of zzso was repeated seven times over a zzso zzso This was associated with a marked decrease in serum thyroglobulin levels accompanied by substantial clinical zzso but after 7 years disease progression zzso 

Seven patients with pituitary metastases from zzso have been zzso In all zzso some neurological signs and symptoms related to mass effect were zzso but no pituitary insufficiency was zzso This may be the first case of zzso with metastases to the pituitary causing zzso It seems likely that management of such cases could be limited to biopsy to confirm thyroid zzso rather than more extensive zzso and that this could be followed by multiple treatments with zzso followed by zzso
