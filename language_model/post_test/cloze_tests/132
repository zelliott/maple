It is generally accepted that, during evolution, replicating zzso molecules emerged from pools of random zzso This zzso zzso world was followed by an era of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso would thus have provided the machinery responsible for the assembly of peptides and the beginning of the protein world of zzso zzso occurring zzso which catalyze the zzso or zzso of zzso zzso bonds, support the idea that zzso could zzso But was zzso constrained to this path and were zzso carriers required before zzso could catalyze the formation of zzso zzso 

We have isolated zzso zzso that are capable of zzso zzso synthesis without the need for specifically designed templates to align the zzso and we have zzso characterized these zzso The rate enhancement observed for these zzso zzso zzso exceeds the zzso zzso rate by a factor of approximately zzso In addition, zzso zzso caused a change in the affinity of zzso for the zzso rather than being directly involved in zzso zzso 

The discovery of these new zzso zzso shows how functionally modified zzso acids can facilitate zzso formation without zzso Previously unforeseen zzso pathways can, therefore, be zzso for example, to guide zzso formation, en route to the protein world, it appears that zzso pockets were formed that are analogous to those of protein zzso
