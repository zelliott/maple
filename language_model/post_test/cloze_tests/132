It is generally accepted zzso during zzso replicating RNA molecules emerged from pools of random zzso This zzso RNA world was followed by an era of zzso catalysis of zzso zzso RNA would thus have provided the machinery responsible for the assembly of peptides and the beginning of the protein world of zzso zzso occurring zzso which catalyze the cleavage or ligation of oligonucleotide zzso zzso support the idea that RNA could zzso But was RNA constrained to this path and were zzso carriers required before RNA could catalyze the formation of amide zzso 

We have isolated RNA catalysts that are capable of mediating zzso synthesis without the need for specifically designed templates to align the zzso and we have kinetically characterized these zzso The rate enhancement observed for these RNA amide synthases exceeds the zzso zzso rate by a factor of approximately zzso In zzso zzso ions caused a change in the affinity of RNA for the substrate rather than being directly involved in zzso zzso 

The discovery of these new amide synthases shows how functionally modified nucleic acids can facilitate zzso formation without zzso Previously unforeseen zzso pathways zzso zzso be zzso for zzso to guide zzso zzso en route to the protein zzso it appears that zzso pockets were formed that are analogous to those of protein zzso
