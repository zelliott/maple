Diastolic heart failure is defined clinically when signs and symptoms of heart failure are present in the presence of preserved left ventricular systolic function zzso zzso The incidence and prevalence of primary diastolic heart failure increases with age and it may be as high as zzso in the zzso zzso female zzso zzso coronary artery zzso zzso and increased body mass index are risk factors for diastolic heart zzso Hemodynamic consequences such as increased pulmonary venous zzso zzso pulmonary zzso and secondary right heart failure as well as decreased cardiac output are similar to those of systolic left ventricular zzso although the nature of primary left ventricular dysfunction is zzso Diagnosis of primary diastolic heart failure depends on the presence of preserved left ventricular ejection zzso Assessment of diastolic dysfunction is preferable but not zzso It is to be noted that increased levels of zzso zzso peptide does not distinguish between diastolic and systolic heart zzso zzso studies are recommended to exclude hypertrophic zzso zzso heart zzso primary valvular heart zzso and constrictive zzso Myocardial stress imaging is frequently required to exclude ischemic heart zzso The prognosis of diastolic heart failure is zzso it is related to zzso severity of heart zzso and associated comorbid diseases such as coronary artery zzso The prognosis of severe diastolic heart failure is similar to that of systolic heart zzso zzso cautious use of diuretics zzso nitrates may cause hypotension and low output zzso Heart rate control is essential to improving ventricular zzso Pharmacologic agents such as angiotensin receptor zzso zzso enzyme zzso and calcium channel blockers are used in selected patients to decrease left ventricular zzso To decrease myocardial zzso aldosterone antagonists have a potential therapeutic zzso zzso prospective controlled studies will be required to establish their efficacy in primary diastolic heart zzso
