The androgen receptor zzso plays a central role in the development and progression of prostate zzso AR expression is maintained throughout the progression of prostate cancer and is also associated with an zzso zzso zzso zzso Despite the critical roles of AR expression in prostate cancer zzso the exact signaling mechanism regulating AR expression remains zzso In this zzso we demonstrated that AR expression was increased by a zzso leukotriene zzso receptor zzso zzso We found that zzso was overexpressed in zzso prostate cancer zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso using an inhibitor or siRNA zzso clearly attenuated AR expression and triggered apoptosis in these zzso These results suggest a role for zzso in AR expression and the survival of zzso prostate cancer zzso zzso we found that the NADPH oxidase family zzso zzso lay downstream of zzso and mediated the production of reactive oxygen species zzso and subsequent zzso zzso thereby inducing AR zzso Taken zzso our results demonstrate that zzso plays a critical role in AR expression via a zzso zzso thereby mediating the survival of zzso prostate cancer zzso Our findings point to zzso as a key regulator of AR expression and will contribute to the development of novel therapies for zzso prostate zzso including zzso and CR prostate zzso
