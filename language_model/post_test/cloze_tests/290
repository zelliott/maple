In order to zzso zzso and evaluate studies of medical language processing on clinical zzso i2b2 zzso for Integrating Biology to the zzso organized its second challenge and zzso This challenge focused on automatically extracting information on obesity and fifteen of its most common comorbidities from patient discharge zzso For each zzso obesity and any of the comorbidities could be zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso in the zzso or zzso in the discharge summary of the zzso i2b2 provided data zzso and invited the development zzso automated systems that can classify obesity and its comorbidities into these four classes based on individual discharge zzso This article refers to obesity and comorbidities as zzso It refers to the categories zzso zzso zzso and zzso as zzso The task of classifying obesity and its comorbidities is called the Obesity zzso The data released by i2b2 was annotated for textual judgments reflecting the explicitly reported information on zzso and intuitive judgments reflecting medical zzso reading of the information presented in discharge zzso There were very few examples of some disease classes in the zzso The Obesity Challenge paid particular attention to the performance of systems on these less zzso zzso A total of 30 teams participated in the Obesity zzso Each team was allowed to submit two sets of up to three system runs for zzso resulting in a total of 136 zzso The zzso represented a combination of zzso and machine learning zzso Evaluation of system runs shows that the best predictions of textual judgments come from systems that filter the potentially noisy portions of the zzso project dictionaries of disease names onto the remaining zzso apply negation zzso and process the text through zzso Information on zzso zzso such as symptoms and zzso and general medical knowledge help systems infer intuitive judgments on the zzso
