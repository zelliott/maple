We have cloned and sequenced the zzso nuclear gene zzso encoding the complete zzso acid cytosolic zzso dehydrogenase zzso from the red alga zzso zzso The proline residue which contributes to the specificity of zzso binding in other zzso proteins is zzso Putative regulatory zzso including zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso but excluding zzso and zzso were identified zzso Two types of zzso zzso differing in zzso site were zzso An zzso zzso spliceosomal intron was identified in a novel position interrupting the highly conserved zzso region zzso The zzso zzso zzso was easily aligned with other known zzso zzso zzso phylogenetic trees place red algae among the eukaryote crown zzso although with modest bootstrap support and without stable resolution among related zzso zzso
