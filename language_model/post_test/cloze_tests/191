Complete envelope genes were amplified from autopsy brain tissue of five individuals who had died of AIDS and had neurological zzso zzso node samples were included for two of the zzso Nineteen different envelope clones from the five patients had distinct zzso zzso Thirteen of the envelopes were functional and zzso zzso and infectivity for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso fusion assays showed that most envelopes used both zzso and zzso One zzso envelope used a broad range of zzso while three other brain envelopes from one individual were restricted to zzso zzso there was no correlation between tissue of origin and coreceptor zzso zzso showed two very distinct phenotypes depending on their capacity to zzso macrophages and to exploit low levels of CD4 zzso zzso for zzso zzso that were highly zzso and zzso for macrophages were identified in brain tissue from four of the five zzso The enhanced macrophage zzso correlated with reduced sensitivity to inhibition by zzso a zzso zzso but not with sensitivity to the zzso zzso zzso The highly zzso envelopes were able to zzso cells expressing low levels of CD4 zzso zzso Comparison with several zzso zzso envelopes showed that the four identified patient envelopes were at the top limit of macrophage zzso In zzso all four lymph zzso envelopes exhibited a zzso phenotype and required high levels of CD4 for zzso Our data support the presence of envelopes that are highly zzso and zzso for macrophages in the brains of patients with neurological zzso These envelopes are able to zzso cells that express low levels of CD4 zzso zzso and may have adapted for replication in brain macrophages and zzso which are known to express limited amounts of zzso
