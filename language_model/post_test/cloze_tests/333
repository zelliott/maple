The aim of the work was the synthesis of gold nanoparticles zzso of different sizes and the estimation of their biological activity in vitro and in zzso 

Water dispersions of gold nanoparticles of different sizes have been synthesized by Davis method and characterized by zzso spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy zzso The GNP interaction with tumor cells has been visualized by confocal microscopy zzso The enzyme activity was determined by standard biochemical zzso GNP distribution and content in organs and tissues have been determined via zzso spectrometry zzso zzso influence has been estimated by zzso zzso 

The GNP zzso accumulation in cultured zzso tumor cells and their ability to modulate zzso cell membrane zzso activity value has been revealed in zzso Using in vivo model of zzso carcinoma it has been shown that GNP possess high affinity to tumor zzso 

Our results indicate the perspectives of use of the synthesized GNP water dispersions for cancer diagnostics and zzso zzso necessary to take into account a zzso biosafety level of zzso
