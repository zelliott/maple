zzso zzso evaluation of pulse wave velocity is widely accepted as the zzso zzso method for noninvasively assessing arterial zzso Newer noninvasive tools such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance can also evaluate arterial zzso but have not been zzso The aim of this study was to validate cardiovascular magnetic zzso aortic zzso with pulse wave velocity and to investigate zzso changes in regional aortic zzso 

Ten young zzso zzso and ten old zzso zzso patients underwent applanation zzso assessment of pulse wave zzso Cardiovascular magnetic resonance measurements of arterial stiffness were evaluated by aortic zzso zzso zzso at three separate zzso the ascending zzso proximal descending aorta and distal descending zzso 

Pulse wave velocity correlated strongly with aortic zzso measurements at each zzso ascending aorta R2 zzso zzso proximal descending aorta R2 zzso zzso and distal descending aorta R2 zzso zzso As zzso the old cohort had significantly increased aortic stiffness compared with the young cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison showed an increase in proximal stiffness in the old cohort compared with the young cohort zzso zzso zzso 

Cardiovascular magnetic zzso aortic zzso is an accurate measure of arterial stiffness and can evaluate regional stiffness through the zzso zzso our results suggest that aortic stiffening may preferentially occur in the proximal aortic segments in the zzso
