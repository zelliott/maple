zzso zzso evaluation of pulse wave zzso is widely accepted as the zzso zzso method for zzso assessing zzso zzso Newer zzso tools such as cardiovascular magnetic resonance can also evaluate zzso zzso but have not been zzso The aim of this study was to validate cardiovascular magnetic zzso zzso zzso with pulse wave zzso and to investigate age-related changes in regional zzso zzso 

Ten young zzso zzso and ten old zzso zzso patients underwent zzso zzso assessment of pulse wave zzso zzso magnetic resonance zzso of zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso zzso at three separate locations, the ascending zzso zzso descending zzso and zzso descending zzso 

Pulse wave zzso correlated strongly with zzso zzso zzso at each zzso ascending zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso descending zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso descending zzso zzso zzso zzso As expected, the old cohort had significantly increased zzso zzso compared with the young cohort zzso zzso zzso zzso comparison showed an increase in zzso zzso in the old cohort compared with the young cohort zzso zzso zzso 

zzso magnetic zzso zzso zzso is an accurate measure of zzso zzso and can evaluate regional zzso through the zzso Furthermore, our results suggest that zzso stiffening may zzso occur in the zzso zzso segments in the zzso
