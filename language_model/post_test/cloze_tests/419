zzso zzso and clinical evidence have clearly demonstrated the importance of the human zzso zzso zzso gene cluster in zzso metabolism and heart zzso The zzso regulation of these genes determines the level of the zzso proteins and therefore influences the concentration of zzso and zzso Here, we analyze the existence of zzso control elements in the zzso zzso zzso zzso region and their influence on the expression of both zzso Two main positive common control elements were found to zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso and in zzso zzso the previously described zzso zzso located zzso zzso upstream from the cap site of the zzso and a newly detected zzso region located in the center of the zzso zzso The activity of both elements is highly increased by the zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso Analysis of a zzso zzso zzso containing the central element showed that it has the properties of a zzso zzso Liver nuclear proteins interact with seven DNA binding sites present in this zzso and zzso specifically interacts with one of these zzso A third positive element, situated immediately upstream from the zzso minimal promoter, is also activated by zzso however, this element is not involved in zzso zzso In addition, two negative regions were identified, one located near the zzso gene and the other one between the zzso zzso and the newly identified central zzso In conclusion, negative and positive control elements are located in the zzso zzso region, including two enhancers important for the expression of the two zzso These results add new evidence that common regulatory elements for the expression of the zzso zzso and zzso genes are zzso throughout the zzso
