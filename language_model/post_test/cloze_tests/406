The high potential of zzso as modeling elements for image segmentation tasks has been pointed out since years in the computer vision zzso In this work we employ zzso as modeling elements for multiple object segmentation in range zzso Segmentation is executed in two zzso zzso a hypothesis about the values of the segmentation parameters is zzso zzso the hypothesis is refined zzso In both zzso object boundary and region information are zzso Boundary information is derived via zzso edge detection in the input range zzso Hypothesis generation uses boundary information to isolate image regions which can be accurately described by zzso Within hypothesis zzso a zzso framework is used to fuse the two information sources by zzso an objective function to each information zzso Iterative optimization of the two objective functions in zzso outputs a precise description of all image zzso We demonstrate experimentally that this approach substantially improves the most established method in zzso zzso in terms of accuracy and computational zzso We demonstrate the applicability of our segmentation framework in real world applications by constructing a novel robotic system for automatic unloading of zzso zzso objects from zzso
