Adult neural stem cells zzso are known to exist in a few regions of the zzso zzso the entity and zzso relevance of adult zzso zzso zzso remain zzso This work shows that adult zzso are zzso and predominantly present in the zzso hypothalamus of adult zzso Chronic zzso feeding led to not only depletion but also neurogenic impairment of zzso associated with zzso zzso In vitro zzso models demonstrated that their survival and zzso markedly decreased on zzso activation but increased on zzso zzso mechanistically mediated by zzso apoptosis and zzso zzso Mouse studies revealed that zzso zzso activation led to depletion and impaired neuronal differentiation of zzso and ultimately the development of obesity and zzso In zzso adult zzso are important for the central regulation of metabolic zzso and zzso impairment of adult zzso is a critical neurodegenerative mechanism for obesity and related zzso
