NO is a pleiotropic signaling molecule and has an important role in cognition and zzso In the zzso NO is produced by neuronal nitric oxide synthase zzso encoded by zzso coupled to the NMDA receptor via PDZ zzso this zzso interaction is disrupted upon binding of zzso zzso protein zzso by zzso to zzso As both zzso and zzso were associated with zzso we here investigated these genes in greater detail by genotyping new samples and conducting a zzso of our own and published zzso In doing zzso we confirmed association of both genes with schizophrenia and found evidence for their interaction in increasing risk towards zzso Our strongest finding was the zzso promoter SNP zzso yielding an odds ratio of zzso in the zzso As findings from heterologous cell systems have suggested that the risk allele decreases gene zzso we studied the effect of the variant on zzso expression in human zzso brain samples and found that the risk allele significantly decreases expression of zzso in the prefrontal zzso Bioinformatic analyses suggest that this might be due the replacement of six transcription factor binding sites by two new binding sites as a consequence of proxy zzso Taken zzso our data argue that genetic variance in zzso resulting in lower prefrontal brain expression of this gene contributes to schizophrenia zzso and that zzso interacts with zzso in doing zzso The zzso PDZ interface may thus well constitute a novel target for small molecules in at least some forms of zzso
