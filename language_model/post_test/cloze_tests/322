Three highly zzso wheat germ zzso zzso are distinct gene products in zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences of two of these zzso germ zzso 1 zzso and 2 zzso are compared with sequence data derived from a complementary DNA zzso clone for the third zzso zzso This comparison includes three corrections to earlier zzso acid sequence data of both zzso and zzso at positions 109 (from zzso to zzso zzso (from zzso to zzso and 150 (from zzso to zzso These zzso are based on new results from crystal structure refinement and zzso acid sequence data of zzso as well as the recently determined zzso sequence of zzso In addition, the zzso zzso of zzso has been revised to zzso and now differs from zzso zzso Four other positions, zzso zzso zzso and zzso at which zzso and zzso are identical but differ from the DNA sequence of zzso were also zzso by zzso acid sequencing techniques and zzso zzso among the three zzso is observed at a total of 10 sequence zzso 9, 53, 56, 59, 66, 93, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso comparisons indicate that zzso deviates to a much larger extent from zzso (at eight zzso and from zzso (at seven zzso than the latter from one another (at five zzso Eight of the 10 zzso are equally distributed between zzso B and C, the two interior and more highly zzso of the four zzso zzso zzso B, C, zzso zzso of the variable zzso with the three-dimensional structure indicates that all except the two previously described zzso zzso 56 and 59 zzso and zzso zzso are easily zzso at the zzso zzso zzso displays a higher degree of zzso similarity than found in zzso and zzso Of the seven variable positions that are located in the domain core zzso zzso five are in perfect agreement with our earlier predicted domain zzso zzso This suggests that of the three zzso zzso is most closely related to the common ancestral zzso
