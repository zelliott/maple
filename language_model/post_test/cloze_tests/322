Three highly homologous wheat germ zzso zzso are distinct gene products in zzso zzso The amino acid sequences of two of these zzso germ zzso 1 zzso and 2 zzso are compared with sequence data derived from a complementary DNA zzso clone for the third zzso zzso This comparison includes three corrections to earlier amino acid sequence data of both zzso and zzso at positions 109 zzso zzso to zzso 134 zzso Gly to zzso and 150 zzso Gly to zzso These reassignments are based on new results from crystal structure refinement and amino acid sequence data of zzso as well as the recently determined nucleotide sequence of zzso In zzso the zzso residue of zzso has been revised to zzso and now differs from zzso zzso Four other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at which zzso and zzso are identical but differ from the DNA sequence of zzso were also zzso by amino acid sequencing techniques and zzso Variability among the three zzso is observed at a total of 10 sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Pairwise comparisons indicate that zzso deviates to a much larger extent from zzso zzso eight zzso and from zzso zzso seven zzso than the latter from one another zzso five zzso Eight of the 10 mutations are equally distributed between domains B and zzso the two interior and more highly conserved of the four zzso domains zzso zzso zzso zzso Correlation of the variable residues with the zzso structure indicates that all except the two previously described zzso zzso 56 and 59 zzso and zzso zzso are easily accommodated at the dimer zzso zzso displays a higher degree of zzso similarity than found in zzso and zzso Of the seven variable positions that are located in the domain core zzso zzso five are in perfect agreement with our earlier predicted domain ancestor zzso This suggests that of the three zzso zzso is most closely related to the common ancestral zzso
