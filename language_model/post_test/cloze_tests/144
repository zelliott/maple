The proteolytic activity of zzso responsible for processing full length zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso The amplitude and duration of zzso activity can be regulated at various points in the zzso but there has been no report regarding regulation of the zzso zzso despite its zzso In the present zzso we found that the zzso interaction is regulated by the zzso tyrosine zzso zzso zzso and zzso are physically zzso and this association is responsible for zzso processing and zzso We also found that growth factor zzso an EGFR zzso and zzso a zzso zzso induce the zzso interaction mediated by zzso Our results support three new and zzso zzso zzso The association between zzso and zzso is a zzso zzso zzso Extracellular growth factor signals regulate this zzso which is mediated by zzso zzso There is zzso between the plasma growth factor zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso was confirmed in xenograft tumor tissues and in the tissues of pancreatic cancer zzso Our findings have implications for the mechanism by which the zzso and growth factor zzso signaling pathways regulate carcinogenesis and cancer cell zzso
