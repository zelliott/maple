For years an assumption was made that zzso a byproduct of insulin zzso possessed no appreciable physiologic zzso As other contributions in this volume zzso zzso the time has come to zzso that zzso zzso either directly through interaction with its specific zzso receptor or indirectly through an interaction with a related membrane zzso exerts a unique effect on several intracellular zzso We review here results of studies attempting to elucidate such molecular effects of zzso in different cell systems and zzso zzso a purified zzso zzso we also demonstrate zzso effects on distinct elements of the insulin signal transduction zzso
