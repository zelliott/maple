This study aims to evaluate the incidence of Obstructive Sleep zzso zzso in severely obese Asians and to study the impact of weight loss on zzso 

We report the results of routine preoperative zzso in 350 Asian patients undergoing bariatric surgery in our zzso zzso were repeated in 75 randomly selected patients with moderate to severe OSA after target weight loss with the laparoscopically placed adjustable gastric band zzso 

The prevalence of OSA in obese Asians is zzso Moderate OSA was found in zzso of patients and severe OSA was found in zzso Severe OSA was significantly more in the Chinese zzso compared to the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We identified other risk factors for severe OSA zzso zzso higher body mass index and the presence of zzso but were unable to select identifying parameters for very low zzso likelihood of severe OSA such that routine sleep studies prior to bariatric surgery could be zzso zzso zzso Index zzso showed improvement of zzso at 20 kg excess weight loss with the cure of OSA in preoperatively severe cases zzso zzso Mild to moderate cases reported similar improvements although a direct correlation could not be zzso zzso zzso apnoea zzso work of breathing and subjective assessment of sleepiness scores and quality of life zzso showed improving zzso albeit not statistically zzso Similar improvements were seen in sleep architecture with increased rapid eye movement zzso and stage 3 zzso 

The incidence of OSA in Asians undergoing bariatric surgery is zzso Routine sleep studies in Asian patients are zzso Weight loss brought about a significant improvement in AHI and continuous positive airway pressure zzso LAGB placement should be considered a broadly effective therapy for sleep apnoea in the severely obese zzso
