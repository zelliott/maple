zzso zzso has been reported to have potential zzso effects in a few zzso but the antiobesity properties of CO and its related mechanisms in models of dietary obesity remain zzso We investigated the effect of CO on body weight zzso size of zzso zzso and lipid profiles in zzso zzso zzso obese mice and on the gene expression in adipose tissue using a complementary DNA microarray approach to test the hypothesis that CO supplementation would alleviate HF zzso obesity by the alteration of adipose zzso gene zzso Male zzso mice were fed a normal diet zzso HF zzso or zzso HF diet zzso or zzso for 5 zzso Compared with the HF diet zzso mice fed the zzso zzso diet gained zzso less weight but did not display any change in food and energy zzso zzso supplementation markedly improved serum and hepatic lipid zzso Histologic examination showed that zzso adipocyte size was smaller in mice fed the HF zzso zzso zzso Microarray analysis showed that dietary CO supplementation modulated zzso genes such as matrix zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase zzso and zzso k in the adipose zzso zzso percent of the zzso genes identified are involved in immune responses including the inflammatory response and cytokine zzso These results suggest that CO supplementation may help ameliorate HF zzso weight gain and improve serum and liver lipid profile zzso which are zzso at least in zzso with altered adipose tissue gene expression involved in zzso and zzso
