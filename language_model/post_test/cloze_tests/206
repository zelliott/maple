zzso of gene expression data from zzso experiments has become a central tool for identifying zzso functional gene zzso A crucial aspect of such analysis is the integration of data from different experiments and different zzso How to weigh the contribution of different experiments is an important point influencing the final zzso We have developed a novel method for this integration, and applied it to zzso data from multiple zzso zzso experiments performed under a variety of experimental zzso The goal of this study is to identify functional globally zzso gene zzso in the zzso zzso 

Following the analysis of zzso zzso genes in 43 zzso and about 2 zzso zzso gene pairs, we identified a globally zzso gene zzso We found clusters of globally zzso zzso genes that are enriched for known Gene zzso zzso Two types of zzso were identified in the regulatory network that differed in their sensitivity to the zzso zzso we further showed these two pertain to general and specialized zzso Some of these zzso were further investigated using the zzso compendium of zzso zzso zzso of smaller zzso of data lead to the identification of zzso zzso 

Our method for identification of gene clusters allows the integration of diverse zzso experiments from many zzso The analysis reveals that part of the zzso zzso is globally zzso and can be further divided into known as well as novel functional gene zzso Our methodology is general enough to apply to any set of zzso experiments, using any scoring zzso
