Analyses of gene expression data from microarray experiments has become a central tool for identifying zzso functional gene zzso A crucial aspect of such analysis is the integration of data from different experiments and different zzso How to zzso the contribution of different experiments is an important point influencing the final zzso We have developed a novel method for this zzso and applied it to zzso data from multiple Arabidopsis microarray experiments performed under a variety of experimental zzso The goal of this study is to identify functional globally zzso gene modules in the Arabidopsis zzso 

Following the analysis of zzso Arabidopsis genes in 43 datasets and about 2 x zzso gene zzso we identified a globally zzso gene zzso We found clusters of globally zzso Arabidopsis genes that are enriched for known Gene Ontology zzso Two types of modules were identified in the regulatory network that differed in their sensitivity to the zzso zzso we further showed these two zzso to general and specialized zzso Some of these modules were further investigated using the zzso compendium of microarray zzso Analyses of smaller subsets of data lead to the identification of zzso zzso 

Our method for identification of gene clusters allows the integration of diverse microarray experiments from many zzso The analysis reveals that part of the Arabidopsis transcriptome is globally zzso and can be further divided into known as well as novel functional gene zzso Our methodology is general enough to apply to any set of microarray zzso using any scoring zzso
