zzso zzso has traditionally been grown on fallen zzso It produces a wide array of enzymes to digest the zzso substrate for zzso zzso this organism represents a rich source of potentially potent zzso enzymes that can be zzso for conversion of biomass to simple zzso These sugars can then be used as feedstock for ethanol production or other chemical zzso We have cloned two zzso genes from zzso zzso grown on a wood substrate without the use of genomic or cDNA libraries by using a zzso strategy employing degenerate primers directed at the zzso zzso zzso encoded a zzso acid protein that belonged to zzso hydrolase family 7 and had sequence similarities to zzso genes from other zzso zzso encoded a zzso acid protein that belonged to zzso hydrolase family 6 and had sequence similarities to zzso genes from other zzso We demonstrated that zzso and zzso transcript levels were positively correlated to zzso zzso growth in the presence of crystalline zzso
