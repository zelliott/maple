zzso zzso has traditionally been grown on fallen zzso It produces a wide array of zzso to digest the zzso zzso for zzso Thus, this zzso represents a rich source of potentially potent zzso zzso that can be harnessed for conversion of biomass to simple zzso These zzso can then be used as zzso for ethanol production or other chemical zzso We have cloned two zzso genes from zzso zzso grown on a wood zzso without the use of zzso or zzso libraries by using a zzso strategy employing zzso zzso directed at the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid protein that belonged to zzso zzso family 7 and had sequence similarities to zzso genes from other zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid protein that belonged to zzso zzso family 6 and had sequence similarities to zzso genes from other zzso We demonstrated that zzso and zzso transcript levels were positively correlated to zzso zzso growth in the presence of zzso zzso
