This study specifies a strategy to improve zzso by partial synchronization of zzso cancer cells zzso and zzso in zzso using zzso with protecting zzso zzso cells zzso by the prior administration of zzso zzso zzso and zzso effects of zzso radiation, zzso zzso and zzso zzso alone or in combination were investigated in zzso by flow zzso 

A protective effect of zzso but not zzso was found after administration of triple sequence with zzso radiation and zzso It was found that preliminary administration of zzso induced growth arrest and protected zzso cells from the zzso treatment, while simultaneously killing zzso and zzso zzso 

The proposed therapeutic strategy allows protection of zzso zzso cells and selectively increases zzso of zzso cancer zzso
