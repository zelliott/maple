To understand mechanisms of DNA methylation in Helicobacter zzso a human pathogen associated with peptic ulcer disease and gastric zzso we cloned a putative DNA methyltransferase zzso zzso This gene contains a zzso open reading frame encoding a zzso zzso zzso Sequence analysis revealed that zzso was closely related to zzso adenine DNA zzso including zzso in zzso zzso zzso was present in all zzso pylori strains zzso DNA from zzso zzso pylori strains was resistant to digestion by zzso and zzso which recognize DNA at sites containing zzso whereas their isogenic zzso mutants were zzso indicating lack of zzso zzso of zzso in Escherichia coli rendered DNA from these cells resistant to zzso zzso confirming the role of zzso in modifying zzso zzso We conclude that zzso encodes a DNA zzso zzso that is well conserved among diverse zzso pylori strains and that modifies zzso pylori genomes at zzso zzso
