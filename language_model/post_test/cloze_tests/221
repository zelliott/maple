The present report describes the development of a technique for automatic wheezing recognition in digitally recorded lung zzso This method is based on the extraction and processing of spectral information from the respiratory cycle and the use of these data for user feedback and automatic zzso The respiratory cycle is first zzso in order to normalize its spectral zzso and its spectrogram is then zzso After this zzso the spectrogram image is processed by a zzso convolution filter and a zzso in order to increase the contrast and isolate its highest amplitude zzso zzso zzso in order to generate more compressed data to automatic zzso the spectral projection from the processed spectrogram is computed and stored as an zzso The higher magnitude values of the array and its respective spectral values are then located and used as inputs to a zzso perceptron artificial neural zzso which results an automatic indication about the presence of zzso For validation of the zzso lung sounds recorded from three different repositories were zzso The results show that the proposed technique achieves zzso accuracy in the detection of wheezing for an isolated respiratory cycle and zzso accuracy for the detection of zzso when detection is carried out using groups of respiratory cycles obtained from the same zzso zzso the system presents the original recorded sound and the zzso spectrogram image for the user to draw his own conclusions from the zzso
