We have isolated the embryonic lethal gene zzso zzso as a zzso of the zzso eye zzso Analysis of clones zzso for zzso during eye development shows that it is autonomously required for zzso zzso zzso cells are recruited into developing zzso and initiate neural zzso but they fail to properly differentiate as zzso zzso analysis reveals that the zzso locus is large and complex, giving rise to multiple different proteins with common zzso sequences but different zzso zzso zzso proteins are nuclear and share a zzso zzso motif which is also found in the zzso family of proteins and is highly zzso in zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso the observation that it also zzso suppresses the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso similarity to zzso in the zzso glass gene suggest that zzso is a general factor required for zzso zzso
