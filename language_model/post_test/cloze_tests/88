Successful trophoblast invasion and transformation of the maternal spiral arteries requires that the pregnant zzso zzso zzso act in an immunologically paradoxical zzso accepting the zzso zzso while maintaining host zzso against an array of microbial zzso In contrast to the growing evidence that the immune surveillance molecules known as zzso receptors zzso are expressed by zzso and fetal zzso to zzso no studies have been conducted on the zzso 

zzso tissues and cells were obtained from women undergoing first trimester elective zzso or repeat zzso sections and analyzed at both the protein and mRNA zzso 

We now demonstrate for the first time that human zzso differentially express zzso and their downstream signaling molecules as well as zzso stimulated induction of cytokine production in the first and third trimester of zzso 

These findings suggest that the zzso is a critical component of the zzso immune response in zzso zzso the results have implications for the success or failure of compromised pregnancies in early or late zzso
