zzso swelling is an integral component of cytotoxic brain edema in ischemic zzso While mechanisms underlying zzso swelling are likely zzso oxidative stress and mitochondrial dysfunction are hypothesized to contribute to such zzso We investigated the protective effects of zzso zzso extract zzso that has zzso and zzso effects on cell swelling and depolarization of the inner mitochondrial membrane potential zzso in ischemic zzso zzso glial cells were subjected to zzso deprivation zzso and cell volume determined using the zzso method at 90 min after the end of zzso When compared with zzso zzso increased cell volume by zzso This increase was blocked by zzso or insulin but not by blockers of zzso stress including vitamin zzso zzso zzso methyl ester zzso or uric zzso Mitochondrial zzso a key component of ischemic zzso contributes to cell zzso Changes in zzso were assessed at the end of zzso with zzso ethyl ester zzso a potentiometric zzso zzso induced a zzso decline in zzso and this decline was blocked by zzso as well as zzso To test the involvement of the mitochondrial permeability transition zzso we used Cyclosporin A zzso an immunosuppressant and a blocker of the zzso zzso zzso blocked cell swelling and the decline in zzso but zzso an immunosuppressant that does not block the zzso did zzso Our results show that zzso reduces zzso cell swelling as well as the decline in zzso in cultures and some of its protective effects may be through inhibiting the zzso
