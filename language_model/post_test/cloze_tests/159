Assessing the zzso zzso of a potential therapeutic through the use of a downstream zzso is zzso This is traditionally performed in the target tissue but limited volume and zzso of sampling pose challenges with solid zzso Currently, there are several small zzso zzso zzso zzso and large zzso therapeutic zzso in clinical trials that interfere with zzso zzso to treat various forms of zzso With the advent of these new therapies, there is a need for a surrogate tissue that is easily accessible and indicative of zzso zzso We propose the use of an ex zzso zzso stimulation of peripheral blood zzso cells zzso coupled with the measurement of zzso zzso zzso Against zzso a downstream zzso zzso using a sandwich zzso zzso is involved in many different cellular responses, such as zzso zzso migration, invasion and zzso zzso and zzso are zzso as a result of the zzso cascade through zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso associate with zzso a zzso and zzso activate zzso zzso This paper describes the novel method for measuring the downstream effects of zzso zzso zzso zzso using ex zzso stimulation of surrogate tissue to predict zzso zzso In addition, we present the zzso validation rationale and zzso This novel, validated zzso can be used to gain insight into clinical trials regarding zzso signal zzso by multiple inhibitor platforms for both large and small zzso
