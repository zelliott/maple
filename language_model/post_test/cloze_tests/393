A technique is developed to minimize magnetic resonance pulse sequence zzso with first and higher moment requirements, while imaging in zzso zzso zzso requirements of starting zzso ending zzso area, and other moment requirements are transformed from the image coordinate system to the physical zzso coordinate system, where the zzso are then zzso With this technique, the full capabilities of the zzso hardware are zzso An online zzso is presented to perform zzso zzso and zzso zzso design when the first moment and area of the zzso are zzso The zzso is then used to implement zzso zzso in a fast zzso zzso zzso This results in a minimal increase in TE and zzso over an equivalent zzso zzso and little variation in the minimum zzso over the entire range of zzso slice zzso zzso of this zzso extend to the zzso of any pulse sequence in which the first moment is important and zzso imaging is zzso zzso zzso zzso Imaging zzso
