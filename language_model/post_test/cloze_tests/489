Prediction of a zzso structure from its amino acid sequence is a key issue in molecular zzso While zzso performed in the space of zzso contact zzso eases the necessary conformational zzso it may also lead to maps that do not correspond to any real zzso zzso To remedy zzso an efficient procedure is needed to reconstruct zzso conformations from their contact zzso 

We present an efficient algorithm to recover the zzso structure of a protein from its contact map zzso We show that when a physically realizable map is used as zzso our method generates a structure whose contact map is essentially similar to the zzso zzso the reconstructed and original structures are similar up to the resolution of the contact map zzso zzso we use nonphysical target zzso obtained by corrupting a physical zzso in this zzso our method essentially recovers the underlying physical map and zzso zzso our algorithm will help to fold zzso using dynamics in the space of contact zzso zzso we investigate the manner in which the quality of the recovered structure degrades when the number of contacts is zzso 

The procedure is capable of assigning quickly and reliably a zzso structure to a given contact zzso It is well suited for use in parallel with dynamics in contact map space to project a contact map onto its closest physically allowed structural zzso
