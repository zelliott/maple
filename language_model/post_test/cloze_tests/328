We report the chemical pathological changes on magnetic resonance spectroscopic images of 4 zzso each of whom had a single large zzso zzso The patients were followed from soon after the onset of the symptoms for a minimum of 7 months to a maximum of 3 zzso zzso We observed increases in the relative resonance intensities of zzso zzso zzso and zzso inside the lesion zzso Decreases in relative resonance intensities of zzso and creatine were seen both in and around the magnetic resonance zzso zzso In all patients neurological deficits improved and zzso zzso and zzso resonance intensities normalized during the zzso zzso compounds recovered more slowly and were still abnormally high in 1 patient after 7 zzso Partial recovery of the zzso resonance was seen for all zzso Evaluation of the relationships between indices of cerebral chemical zzso brain lesion zzso and functional disability showed highly significant negative correlations between zzso resonance intensities and both brain lesion volumes zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and clinical disability zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso As zzso is localized solely in neurons in the adult central nervous zzso our results suggest that neuronal dysfunction may be a zzso mechanism of disability even in inflammatory disorders primarily affecting myelin and zzso zzso
