We report the chemical pathological changes on magnetic resonance zzso images of 4 patients, each of whom had a single large zzso zzso The patients were followed from soon after the onset of the symptoms for a minimum of 7 months to a maximum of 3 1/2 zzso We observed increases in the relative resonance zzso of zzso compounds, zzso and zzso inside the zzso zzso zzso in relative resonance zzso of zzso and zzso were seen both in and around the magnetic resonance zzso zzso In all patients neurological deficits improved and zzso zzso and zzso resonance zzso zzso during the zzso zzso compounds recovered more slowly and were still zzso high in 1 patient after 7 zzso zzso recovery of the zzso resonance was seen for all zzso zzso of the relationships between zzso of cerebral chemical pathology, brain zzso volumes, and functional disability showed highly significant negative correlations between zzso resonance zzso and both brain zzso volumes zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso and clinical disability zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso As zzso is localized solely in zzso in the adult central nervous system, our results suggest that zzso dysfunction may be a zzso mechanism of disability even in inflammatory disorders primarily affecting zzso and zzso zzso
