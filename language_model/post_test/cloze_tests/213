zzso filtration of human serum extracts on zzso zzso columns produced two peaks of material reactive with insulin zzso The earlier eluting fraction appeared at the elution position of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso while the second fraction corresponded in elution volume to zzso In assays using porcine zzso and an antiserum against porcine zzso human pancreatic zzso was less reactive than human zzso Serial dilutions of the serum zzso in the immunoassay showed immunological identity with the human zzso zzso Partial tryptic digestion of the serum zzso yielded products with increased immunological reactivity as estimated with insulin as the zzso With larger amounts of zzso all the serum zzso was converted to zzso components zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of these results we conclude that the earlier eluting fraction of human serum extracts is zzso The fasting values of zzso in normal subjects ranged between zzso and zzso zzso representing from 5 to zzso of the insulin zzso In one subject the values of zzso were higher than those of zzso After oral administration of 100 g of zzso the zzso levels tended to rise similarly to zzso Three obese patients with hyperinsulinemia had higher fasting levels of zzso and a greater increase after glucose than the normal zzso As the high levels of zzso zzso with raised insulin concentration in these obese zzso the relative proportions of the two hormones were in the same range observed in the normal zzso Thus hyperinsulinemia in these obese subjects was not accompanied by an increase in the fraction of serum zzso When the values for serum zzso were expressed as percentage of the insulin zzso there was a decrease in the per cent zzso in the first hour of the glucose tolerance zzso After the second zzso the per cent tended to rise towards the fasting zzso
