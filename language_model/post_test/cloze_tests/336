zzso comparing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for treatment of zzso anemia in Belgium concluded that costs for zzso patients were significantly lower than costs for zzso or zzso zzso The objective of the present study was to extend the Belgian analysis to Austria, France, Italy, zzso and Spain, zzso differences in costs between zzso agents zzso in each zzso 

zzso in epidemiology and treatment patterns between countries were adjusted using data from zzso national cancer zzso IMS sales data, and reimbursement and treatment zzso Belgian unit costs were replaced with zzso zzso zzso were analyzed using a zzso model zzso for propensity score zzso 

All populations were comparable to the Belgian population in terms of age, zzso zzso and blood zzso zzso After adjusting for zzso chemotherapy use and cancer zzso total management costs per patient zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso lower with zzso compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso costs with zzso were between zzso zzso zzso and 38% zzso zzso lower compared with zzso zzso all remaining zzso and between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso lower compared with zzso zzso all remaining countries except zzso zzso 

Not all differences could be accounted for by a lack of zzso zzso however, the potential zzso and zzso of costs should be similar for all three zzso 

These findings are in line with the Belgian zzso In all countries, total and zzso costs were lowest in patients receiving zzso vs zzso or zzso This study demonstrates the feasibility of adapting real-life zzso data to other settings, adjusting for differences in patients' characteristics and treatment zzso These findings should be valuable in zzso decision-making in zzso patients treated in each of the countries zzso
