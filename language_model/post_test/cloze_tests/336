zzso comparing zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for treatment of zzso anemia in zzso concluded that costs for zzso patients were significantly lower than costs for zzso or zzso zzso The objective of the present study was to extend the zzso analysis to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso estimating differences in costs between zzso agents zzso in each zzso 

Differences in epidemiology and treatment patterns between countries were adjusted using data from zzso national cancer zzso IMS sales zzso and reimbursement and treatment zzso zzso unit costs were replaced with zzso zzso Costs were analyzed using a zzso model stratifying for propensity score zzso 

All populations were comparable to the zzso population in terms of zzso zzso zzso and blood transfusions zzso After adjusting for zzso chemotherapy use and cancer zzso total management costs per patient zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso lower with zzso compared with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso costs with zzso were between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso lower compared with zzso zzso all remaining zzso and between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso lower compared with zzso zzso all remaining countries except zzso zzso 

Not all differences could be accounted for by a lack of zzso zzso zzso the potential zzso and zzso of costs should be similar for all three zzso 

These findings are in line with the zzso zzso In all zzso total and zzso costs were lowest in patients receiving zzso vs zzso or zzso This study demonstrates the feasibility of adapting zzso zzso data to other zzso adjusting for differences in zzso characteristics and treatment zzso These findings should be valuable in healthcare zzso in oncology patients treated in each of the countries zzso
