zzso a direct target of zzso has been shown to target several molecules associated with the cell cycle and cell survival zzso and its dysregulation is implicated in cancer drug resistance or sensitivity in several human zzso zzso the correlation between zzso expression and zzso has not been explored in zzso In this zzso we confirmed that zzso was significantly zzso in HCC tissues and HCC cell lines by zzso HCC tissues with lower zzso expression displayed higher expression of zzso protein than those with high expression of zzso zzso an inverse correlation is evident between the zzso level and zzso zzso zzso patients with lower zzso expression had significantly poorer overall zzso Bioinformatics and luciferase reporter assays revealed that zzso binds the zzso of the zzso mRNA and zzso its zzso Western zzso analysis and zzso confirmed that zzso is inhibited by zzso zzso Functional analyses indicated that the restoration of zzso reduced cell zzso promoted cell apoptosis and potentiated zzso apoptosis and toxicity in HCC cell lines by inhibiting zzso zzso This study is the first to demonstrate that zzso induces sensitivity to the zzso effect of sorafenib in human HCC zzso suggesting a potential role of zzso in the treatment of zzso
