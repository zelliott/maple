In the present study, we examined the mechanisms through which zzso zzso activates the zzso transient zzso potential protein channel zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso of zzso mice, and zzso stimulation resulted in a significant and zzso increase in zzso calcium concentration zzso This increase in zzso was inhibited by zzso with the zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso but not by the inactive analog zzso demonstrating the requirement for zzso activity in zzso zzso influx in primary zzso zzso To determine whether zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso by zzso cell models were used to examine this zzso Single zzso cells that expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified, and zzso was zzso zzso zzso influx through zzso was inhibited by zzso with zzso or by zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso results in the production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso has zzso zzso zzso binding zzso To determine whether zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared with partial or complete deletions of the zzso zzso binding zzso In cells expressing zzso zzso binding zzso and zzso no significant increase in zzso was observed after zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso and the association between zzso and zzso was disrupted in these zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso that interaction of zzso with zzso is zzso and that zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact to form a signaling zzso
