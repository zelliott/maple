In the present zzso we examined the mechanisms through which erythropoietin zzso activates the zzso transient receptor potential protein channel zzso zzso were isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso and Epo stimulation resulted in a significant and zzso increase in intracellular calcium concentration zzso This increase in zzso was inhibited by pretreatment with the zzso C zzso inhibitor zzso but not by the inactive analog zzso demonstrating the requirement for zzso activity in zzso zzso influx in primary zzso zzso To determine whether zzso is involved in the activation of zzso by zzso cell models were used to examine this zzso Single zzso cells that expressed transfected Epo receptor zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso influx through zzso was inhibited by pretreatment with zzso or by downregulation of zzso by RNA zzso zzso activation results in the production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso has zzso receptor zzso binding zzso To determine whether zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso mutants were prepared with partial or complete deletions of the zzso zzso binding zzso In cells expressing zzso zzso binding mutants and zzso no significant increase in zzso was observed after Epo zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso and the association between zzso and zzso was disrupted in these zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso modulates zzso activation through zzso that interaction of zzso with zzso is zzso and that zzso zzso zzso and zzso interact to form a signaling zzso
