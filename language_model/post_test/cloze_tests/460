Modulation of tumorigenicity has been considered to be a reflection of the zzso genetic and cellular aberrations present in tumor zzso Recent studies have suggested that cytoplasmic elements can also contribute to the malignant phenotype of zzso and that mitochondria may be important in this zzso zzso zzso undertook a study to evaluate the effects of depletion of functional mitochondria on the zzso zzso Brain and breast tumor cells were depleted of mitochondrial DNA zzso by treatment with zzso zzso These zzso zzso cells showed a distinct change in the zzso zzso including loss of ability to grow in an zzso fashion zzso zzso a substantial increase in sensitivity to cytotoxic drugs zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso phenotype was accomplished with transfer of normal mitochondria into the diminished zzso zzso zzso No changes in expression of the apoptosis genes zzso and zzso nor the drug resistance genes zzso zzso or zzso was found in any of the cell types zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso the type of cell death remained the zzso zzso cells with and without mitochondria underwent apoptosis in response to exposure to cytotoxic zzso Our results indicate that zzso DNA play a direct role in modulating aspects of the zzso zzso although they are not necessarily a sine zzso non for apoptotic cell zzso This is particularly interesting because most tumor tissues are more dependent upon glycolysis for energy zzso rather than zzso mediated oxidative zzso zzso of zzso cells will be useful to study the mitochondrial processes involved in zzso
