Three zzso fragments that zzso all but the extreme N zzso of the rat zzso protein were cloned by zzso screening of a rat liver zzso library with a human zzso zzso The remaining zzso of the zzso was generated by a reverse zzso chain reaction method, and a single full-length rat zzso zzso was zzso A comparison of the deduced zzso acid zzso sequences of human and rat zzso was made, and the effects of certain zzso zzso in the putative protein zzso zzso domain were zzso The rat zzso zzso was subsequently expressed in cultured zzso mouse zzso in which a high level of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The rat zzso produced in zzso zzso was responsive to the zzso zzso a known zzso for zzso Challenge of zzso zzso with zzso zzso the zzso of rat zzso on zzso zzso and promoted its association with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Together, these results indicate that a fully functional rat zzso zzso has been isolated, and that zzso cells expressing this zzso will be suitable for investigations of the signal zzso mechanism of zzso
