zzso of the late genes of zzso virus 40 zzso is zzso during the early phase of the zzso cycle of infection of binding of cellular factors, called zzso to the zzso late zzso repression is relieved after the onset of viral DNA replication by zzso of these zzso zzso data indicated that one of the major components of zzso was human zzso zzso 1 zzso We show here that several members of the zzso hormone zzso zzso including zzso zzso 2, zzso zzso alpha 1 in combination with zzso X zzso zzso chicken zzso upstream promoter zzso factors 1 and 2 zzso and zzso as well as zzso possess the properties of zzso These receptors bind specifically to hormone zzso binding sites present in the zzso major late zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso from the zzso major late promoter in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso in monkey cells results in repression of the zzso late promoter, but not the early promoter, in the absence of the zzso zzso large tumor zzso zzso of zzso leads to a delay in the zzso switch in zzso gene expression during the zzso cycle of zzso Thus, members of this zzso can play major direct roles in regulating expression of zzso zzso natural or synthetic zzso to these receptors can serve as zzso zzso Our findings also provide the basis for the development of zzso to screen for the zzso to zzso zzso 2 and zzso
