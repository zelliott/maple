A new type C zzso zzso pol sequence zzso found to be occasionally zzso in zzso particles released by the human zzso zzso cell line zzso was used to screen a human zzso library zzso W, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A, zzso zzso and zzso zzso J zzso zzso The DNA sequence of one full-length clone now reveals a human zzso zzso sequence zzso of zzso zzso in length zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and regions with 37 and zzso overall zzso acid zzso to zzso gag and pol zzso zzso About 35 related elements were found to be distributed on all human zzso except 16, 17, and zzso zzso comparisons with zzso and various type zzso zzso suggest that despite a zzso zzso site this novel zzso element, now named zzso can be assigned to one family together with known zzso zzso zzso analyses of 5 zzso and 25 solitary zzso sequences confirmed the existence of two distinct but closely related zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In contrast to most known zzso the evolutionary age of zzso elements dates back prior to the divergence of New and Old World zzso Despite their old age, members of the zzso family are still zzso active and were found to be highly expressed in specific human zzso such as liver and zzso
