Cystic zzso zzso is caused by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator gene zzso Despite the extensive and enduring efforts of many zzso researchers over the past 14 years, up to zzso of disease zzso still remain to be identified in some zzso It has long been suggested that gross zzso zzso could account for these unidentified zzso To date, however, only a few large deletions have been found in the zzso gene and only three have been fully zzso Here, we report the first systematic screening of the 27 zzso of the zzso gene for large zzso zzso by means of the quantitative multiplex zzso of short fluorescent fragments zzso A zzso cohort of 39 classical zzso patients carrying at least one unidentified zzso (after extensive and complete screening of the zzso gene by both zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso zzso liquid zzso participated in this zzso Using zzso some zzso of the previously unidentified zzso zzso zzso were identified and zzso including five novel zzso (one large deletion and four zzso The zzso of these five zzso were precisely determined, enabling us to explore the underlying mechanisms of zzso Although zzso zzso may be invoked to explain all five complex zzso each zzso appears to have arisen through a different zzso One of the zzso was highly unusual in that it involved the zzso of a short 41 zzso sequence with partial zzso to a zzso zzso zzso The zzso of this zzso zzso element zzso a zzso zzso may constitute a novel type of zzso associated with human genetic zzso
