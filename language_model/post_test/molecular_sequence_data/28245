The zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso are essential for overcoming multiple zzso zzso located within the major early zzso of these zzso zzso In order for N proteins to function, a zzso sequence specifying N zzso zzso must be located within an zzso between the promoter and the zzso zzso Two components have been identified within zzso zzso zzso zzso among different zzso and implicated in the recognition of host zzso zzso required for N function zzso zzso zzso an interrupted zzso zzso zzso in sequence among different zzso zzso and hypothesized to be the site of recognition for different N zzso also zzso in sequence zzso Here we apply a zzso for testing termination and zzso of zzso zzso to identify zzso at all positions in the zzso base loop of zzso zzso Almost every base change at any position within the zzso base zzso loop was found to zzso zzso of zzso by the N protein of zzso zzso These observations extend previous zzso knowledge of nut zzso and are zzso with the hypothesis that the zzso loop is the direct site of recognition for N zzso Variations among the effects of different base changes suggest differential contacts between N protein and bases of the zzso loop, whether in DNA or zzso
