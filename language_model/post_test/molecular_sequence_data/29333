The steroid zzso zzso plays an important zzso role in the conversion of steroid hormones such as zzso and zzso to their zzso zzso zzso type II zzso one of two zzso zzso is thought to be a key zzso in the generation of zzso steroids in the brain, particularly zzso zzso via the production of its precursor zzso from zzso In the present study, we investigated possible regulatory mechanisms of zzso gene expression by steroid hormones in the female mouse zzso We first cloned mouse zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and found that zzso induced zzso gene expression to levels zzso by in zzso zzso in female mouse zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene promoter by a transient expression zzso with human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression zzso identified a zzso and zzso regulatory element zzso zzso zzso of an zzso mobility shift zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso zzso bound directly to zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that the gene expression of zzso is zzso regulated by zzso in female zzso
