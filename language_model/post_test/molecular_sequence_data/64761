The control of zzso expression is one of the principal mechanisms by which diversity is generated among muscle zzso In an attempt to zzso the regulatory mechanisms that control fiber diversity in any given muscle, we have focused our attention on the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso functionally zzso zzso elements activate zzso T zzso independently in all major muscles of the zzso and larvae as well as in adult zzso and visceral zzso Here, we propose that the differential but concerted interaction of these two elements zzso the mechanism by which a particular zzso establish the correct levels of zzso T zzso adapting these levels to their specific zzso This mechanism is not exclusive to the zzso T zzso but is also relevant to the zzso zzso I zzso In conjunction with in zzso transgenic studies, an in zzso analysis of the zzso T zzso sequences revealed that both these elements are organized in a modular zzso zzso this analysis to the zzso I and zzso regulatory zzso the two other components of the zzso complex, we have discovered a similar modular organization of zzso zzso zzso
