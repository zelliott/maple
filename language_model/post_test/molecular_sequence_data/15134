We report the zzso of an infrared laser onto our previously reported zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso source with zzso zzso yielding multiply charged peptides and zzso zzso zzso is demonstrated for atmospheric pressure zzso and zzso of biological molecules ranging in molecular weight from zzso to 17 zzso High resolving power, high mass accuracy zzso zzso transform zzso zzso resonance zzso mass zzso were generated from zzso and solid-state zzso and protein samples by zzso with an infrared laser zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis of zzso zzso (17 zzso zzso from the solid state with zzso zzso demonstrates the sequencing capabilities using zzso coupled to zzso mass zzso zzso and lipids were detected through direct analysis of milk and egg zzso using both zzso and zzso with minimal sample zzso Three of the four classes of biological zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been zzso and detected using zzso with minimal sample zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso from zzso using reductive zzso chemistry, is also zzso
