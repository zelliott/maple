In zzso a single zzso translation termination factor zzso zzso the three stop zzso zzso zzso and zzso Some zzso like zzso have a zzso code, and here zzso exhibit zzso zzso whereas zzso is reassigned as a sense zzso Since zzso zzso zzso recognition is associated with its zzso domain, structural features should exist in the N domain of zzso zzso that restrict their zzso zzso Using an in zzso zzso zzso translation system we demonstrate here that a zzso zzso composed of the N domain of zzso zzso zzso fused to the zzso zzso of human zzso exhibits zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso constructed by swapping zzso N domain sequences with the zzso regions from human zzso as well as zzso zzso of human zzso highlighted the crucial role of the zzso zzso in position 70 of zzso zzso zzso in restricting zzso zzso Switching the zzso specificity of zzso zzso zzso to omnipotent mode is due to a single point zzso Furthermore, we examined the influence of zzso on the ability of zzso and zzso zzso to induce zzso release in response to different stop zzso
