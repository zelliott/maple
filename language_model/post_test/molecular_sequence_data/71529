A zzso zzso a novel member of the small molecular weight zzso protein zzso zzso zzso was cloned from rat spinal zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence was highly zzso with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were reported to alter many important cellular functions including formation of both zzso stress fibers and focal zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso analyses indicated that the novel small zzso is expressed specifically in zzso in the brain and spinal zzso and also in zzso zzso zzso Based on the sequence similarity and zzso expression in the brain, this protein was named zzso Unlike classical zzso zzso zzso was not susceptible to the zzso reaction by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso seemed to be specifically involved in zzso and zzso functions as a zzso zzso member of the zzso zzso Then, a mouse zzso DNA segment containing the zzso gene was zzso The locus was mapped on the mouse zzso zzso The sequence data showed that the zzso sequence for zzso is divided by 4 zzso and that the defined 5 zzso may zzso zzso zzso serving for different zzso
