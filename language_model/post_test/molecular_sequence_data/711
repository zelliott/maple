zzso is a zzso protein zzso zzso found to be a tumor zzso It zzso regulates cell growth by indirectly suppressing Ras zzso We identified and characterized the critical zzso required for zzso promoter zzso zzso indicate that the zzso zzso promoter lacks a conventional zzso zzso or zzso element zzso but contains multiple zzso start zzso zzso is initiated by a zzso element composed of an AT rich sequence at zzso (30 zzso zzso from the major zzso start site and an zzso element that zzso the multiple start zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter reveals the presence of both positive zzso to zzso and negative zzso to zzso regulatory zzso The three zzso boxes which bind zzso and zzso with high zzso an zzso site zzso zzso with an zzso zzso and a zzso site comprise the necessary zzso of the zzso promoter required for both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso results reveal that cellular stress reverses the repression of zzso and zzso its expression through increased high affinity interactions between nuclear proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso These findings provide a mechanism by which the zzso promoter can be zzso regulated during normal zzso
