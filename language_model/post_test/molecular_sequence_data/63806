Unlike other zzso malaria zzso in the zzso zzso have structurally and functionally different zzso copies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene that are expressed at different zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in asexual stage, while zzso in zzso zzso A third type zzso has been described in zzso zzso It is expressed only in zzso stage in the zzso Recently, it has been shown that the maintenance of zzso zzso zzso in zzso can be modeled as a zzso process under strong zzso selection zzso zzso zzso zzso underlying the evolution and maintenance of functionally zzso zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso zzso 21, zzso In this study, we performed detailed zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso with special emphasis on the evolution of zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso We zzso zzso copies of the zzso zzso genes from an African zzso zzso species, zzso zzso and Asian zzso zzso species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, all Asian zzso zzso species have a single zzso gene and several zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated for the first time that an approximately zzso zzso in the zzso variable region near the stem 43 is shared exclusively by the zzso sequences of the Asian zzso zzso species and the zzso and zzso sequences of zzso zzso We zzso analyzed all zzso zzso sequences of the zzso zzso currently available in the zzso zzso analyses of all publicly available zzso zzso sequences for the zzso zzso clearly demonstrated that gene zzso events giving rise to A- and zzso sequences took place independently at least three times in the zzso evolution, supporting the hypothesis that these genes evolve according to a zzso zzso
