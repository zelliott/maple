A zzso protein zzso of zzso zzso expressed as inclusion bodies in zzso coli was zzso in 10 zzso zzso zzso concentration of saturated solution of the zzso zzso in 10 zzso zzso was about 25 times higher than that in the buffer of previous method (in 50 zzso sodium zzso zzso pH zzso containing 1 zzso zzso and 10 zzso zzso The zzso zzso in the zzso solution was activated by zzso as an alternative to zzso K in the previous zzso zzso activity against zzso cells of the zzso zzso was almost identical to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso The concentration of the zzso protein was zzso zzso which was zzso higher than that of the activated zzso by the previously zzso The zzso activity of the zzso protein was stable in broad pH region zzso zzso for 3 days, and zzso zzso activity remained after incubation at 30 degrees C for 360 zzso
