The zzso is a zzso zzso from zzso zzso with the sequence zzso zzso studies indicate that the segment zzso occurs in an zzso zzso in the zzso A synthetic zzso corresponding to this segment, although zzso did not exhibit zzso zzso Since charged zzso like D and K are likely to zzso zzso activity, zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso where D was systematically replaced by zzso zzso in which the first D and both Ds were replaced by K showed potent zzso and zzso zzso The analog in which the second D was replaced by K was relatively less zzso However, all the peptides showed an zzso structure with similar zzso zzso The activities of the peptides were found to correlate directly with their ability to zzso model zzso Thus, by minimal judicious replacement of charged zzso zzso it should be possible to generate zzso peptides from short segments of zzso zzso
