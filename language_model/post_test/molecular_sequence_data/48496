zzso are a family of zzso zzso toxins produced by zzso They are responsible for the zzso and death of wild and domestic animals throughout the zzso They display extensive variation in zzso acid composition and functional group zzso zzso zzso are frequently produced by zzso and symbiotic strains of the zzso zzso Here, we show that the production of zzso zzso is zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the 57 zzso zzso zzso gene cluster of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso belongs to a family of zzso that zzso antibiotics through zzso The zzso zzso has a relaxed zzso zzso allowing the preparation of zzso zzso This study sheds light on the evolutionary origins and genetic diversity of an important class of zzso involved in zzso zzso
