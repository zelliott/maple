The zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso A defined deletion in the zzso zzso now designated zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso of gene expression levels in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso strain revealed enhanced expression of the zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Gene expression of the zzso zzso was zzso by the presence of either zzso or zzso Growth zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed that functional zzso and zzso proteins are essential for the zzso of zzso as the sole carbon zzso zzso regulation of the zzso zzso is zzso by a 29 zzso zzso sequence composed of two zzso element zzso sequences and located in between the mapped zzso promoter region and the start zzso of zzso A similar zzso sequence was detected in the upstream region of zzso zzso coding for a second zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso with a zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso including the zzso sequences of zzso and zzso demonstrated the specific binding of the zzso regulator in zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso comparing the gene expression in zzso zzso zzso with that of the zzso strain revealed that zzso is a zzso zzso of genes involved in zzso zzso in zzso zzso
