zzso zzso receptors zzso are zzso zzso channels that belong to the zzso of zzso loop zzso zzso insight into the zzso zzso binding to zzso in recent years has been obtained from the crystal structures of zzso proteins zzso that share significant sequence zzso with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which are isolated from the zzso of carnivorous marine zzso selectively inhibit the signaling of zzso zzso zzso zzso structures of zzso in complex with zzso show that the side chain of a highly zzso zzso zzso in these toxins is oriented toward the zzso binding pocket in the zzso but does not have direct interactions with this zzso In this study, we have designed and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso by introducing a range of zzso on the zzso zzso in these toxins to probe the importance of this zzso for their binding to the zzso zzso characterization of the toxin zzso at the zzso zzso shows that although polar and charged groups on zzso result in zzso with significantly reduced zzso activities, zzso with aromatic and zzso zzso in the zzso position exhibit moderate activity at the zzso Interestingly, introduction of a zzso zzso at zzso in zzso zzso gives rise to a zzso analogue with a significantly higher binding affinity and zzso activity at the zzso zzso than those exhibited by the native zzso
