zzso zzso is an important model zzso for zzso studies because of its diverse respiratory zzso However, the genetic basis and regulatory mechanisms underlying the ability of zzso zzso to survive and adapt to various environmentally relevant stresses is poorly zzso To define this zzso molecular response to elevated growth temperatures, zzso gene expression profiles were examined in cells subjected to heat stress by using zzso DNA zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the total predicted zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso represented on the zzso were significantly zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso over a zzso period after shift to the heat shock zzso As expected, the majority of the genes that showed zzso to known zzso and heat shock proteins in other organisms were highly zzso In addition, a number of predicted zzso including those zzso zzso in zzso and the zzso cycle, zzso zzso zzso regulators zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and hypothetical proteins were zzso Genes zzso membrane proteins were zzso zzso suggesting that cells possibly alter their membrane composition or structure in response to variations in growth zzso A substantial number of the genes zzso zzso proteins displayed zzso zzso patterns in response to heat stress, as did genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, a putative regulatory site with high conservation to the zzso coli zzso consensus sequence was identified upstream of a number of zzso zzso
