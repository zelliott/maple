zzso zzso is challenging and various stable isotope based approaches have been developed to meet the zzso zzso we describe a simple, efficient, reliable, and inexpensive method named reductive zzso by zzso zzso to introduce stable zzso to peptides for quantitative zzso The zzso method leads to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso groups with zzso zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso labeled zzso zzso a 6 Da mass split is introduced to each zzso modification between the light and heavy isotope labeled zzso which is zzso suited for quantitative zzso The reaction zzso zzso labeling efficiency, and linear range of the zzso method have been thoroughly evaluated in this study using standard zzso zzso digest of zzso as well as human cell zzso Reliable quantitative results have been consistently obtained in all zzso We also applied the zzso method to quantitative analysis of proteins in spinal cords of transgenic mouse models of zzso lateral zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso human zzso and zzso mouse zzso were distinguished and zzso using the method developed in this zzso In addition, the quantitative results using the zzso approach were independently validated by Western zzso
