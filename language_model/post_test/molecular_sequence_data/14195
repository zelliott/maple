A new zzso has been isolated from the cell wall of the green algae Chlorella zzso by extraction with zzso M zzso dialysis and SEC zzso zzso was about 8000 zzso Terminal, zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were detected as the main constituents beside some minor zzso components by zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso with collision induced zzso zzso up to zzso experiments of zzso obtained by partial zzso or partial acid zzso indicated the presence of zzso and zzso as well as zzso and also zzso zzso experiments gave evidence of a zzso zzso probably also including some zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso up to zzso with mainly zzso but at higher zzso also zzso were obtained by acid zzso and zzso zzso up to zzso could be detected after mild zzso In accordance with results from zzso analysis and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified from zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments in a zzso ratio of zzso A highly zzso structure is suggested with a 6- and zzso zzso main chain, zzso zzso zzso zzso side chains with an average chain length of 2 are linked to the zzso main zzso The zzso of zzso is zzso The new zzso shows structural similarities with the zzso of zzso zzso
