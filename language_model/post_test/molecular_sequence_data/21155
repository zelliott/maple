We zzso the entire coding region of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The sequence obtained comprised zzso zzso with zzso evidence indicating that the entire zzso comprised a single, circular zzso of approximately zzso zzso The zzso is the most zzso zzso zzso zzso reported to date, with T representing over half of all zzso on the coding zzso The zzso also contains the highest number of zzso tracts so far reported (to our zzso with 60 zzso tracts zzso 12 zzso All genes are transcribed from the same zzso zzso The organization of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso shows a number of similarities compared with zzso zzso but fewer similarities when compared with zzso zzso Very few gene boundaries are shared with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences were also obtained for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and these had identical organizations compared with zzso zzso We found zzso evidence of a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso but at low levels and lacking a zzso zzso Such zzso zzso fragments may be present at low levels in a range of zzso with zzso zzso zzso representing a shift to a condition in which these zzso circles zzso
