zzso salmon zzso zzso virus zzso is a pathogen of zzso Atlantic salmon zzso zzso a disease first diagnosed in Norway in zzso For over 25 years zzso has caused major disease outbreaks in the Northern hemisphere, and remains an emerging fish pathogen because of the zzso infections in marine wild fish and the potential for emergence of new epidemic zzso zzso belongs to the family zzso together with influenza viruses but is sufficiently different to be assigned to its own zzso zzso The zzso zzso consists of eight zzso zzso species, and the zzso have two surface zzso fusion zzso protein zzso on segment 5 and zzso zzso protein zzso on segment zzso However, comparison between different zzso zzso is complicated because there is presently no universally accepted nomenclature system for designation of genetic zzso between zzso zzso The first outbreak of zzso in zzso Atlantic salmon in the Southern zzso occurred in Chile starting in June zzso In order to describe the molecular characteristics of the virus so as to understand its origins, how zzso zzso are maintained and spread, and their zzso zzso we conducted a study where the viral sequences were directly zzso cloned and zzso from tissue samples collected from several zzso fish on the different fish farms with confirmed or suspected zzso outbreaks in zzso This paper describes the genetic characterization of a large number of zzso strains associated with extensive outbreaks in Chile starting in June 2007, and their zzso relationships with selected European and North American zzso that are representative of the genetic diversity of zzso 

zzso for zzso F and HE zzso genes was performed directly on tissue samples collected from zzso fish on different farms among 14 fish companies in Chile during the zzso outbreaks that started in June zzso The genes of the F and HE zzso were cloned and zzso for 51 and 78 new zzso zzso An extensive comparative analysis of zzso F and HE sequence data, including reference zzso sampled from Norway, zzso Islands, Scotland, USA, and Canada was zzso Based on zzso analysis of zzso zzso F and HE genes of 103 individual zzso the zzso from the zzso outbreaks in Chile grouped in their own cluster of 7 distinct strains within zzso I zzso zzso of zzso with the closest zzso to Norwegian zzso isolated in zzso The zzso software program, zzso estimated the Chile zzso zzso from Norway zzso about 1996 and, therefore, had been present in Chile for some time before the recent zzso Analysis of the deduced F protein sequence showed 43 of 51 Chile zzso with an zzso acid insert between zzso and zzso with zzso sequence identity with zzso I zzso zzso segment zzso Twenty four different zzso including zzso were zzso with zzso making up zzso This is considered a manifestation of zzso zzso HE protein sequence zzso 

Taken together, these findings suggest that the zzso outbreaks were caused by virus that was already present in Chile that zzso to new zzso This is the first comprehensive report tracing zzso from Europe to South zzso
