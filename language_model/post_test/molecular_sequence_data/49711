We have constructed three-dimensional models of four zzso zzso proteins from wheat zzso belonging to the zzso zzso All the models were based on the knowledge of the zzso structure of zzso a highly zzso protein from zzso zzso and zzso differ in two zzso acid zzso zzso 62 and zzso out of zzso zzso differs from zzso in one zzso at position 78, while zzso differs from zzso in one zzso at position zzso The global folding and the secondary structures were very similar through all the zzso including the regions of the zzso acid zzso The main differences were found in the traits zzso zzso and zzso zzso 15-21 was predicted as zzso in zzso and zzso in the other zzso zzso zzso was predicted as zzso in zzso and zzso in the other zzso zzso zzso was predicted as random zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso in the other two zzso zzso 15-21 and zzso were exposed, while trait zzso was quite hidden in all the zzso The zzso activities of the four proteins towards the specific zzso fungus zzso zzso were distinct and well correlated to the structural zzso These results suggest that these regions may have a role in the action zzso which is still zzso
