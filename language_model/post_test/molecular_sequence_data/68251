zzso from zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which zzso the zzso transfer of a zzso group from zzso to zzso It is composed of a central, zzso 12 S zzso 6 outer zzso 5 S zzso which are held in a complex by 12 zzso S zzso zzso The zzso reaction requires two partial zzso one of which is specific to 5 zzso The cloning and expression of each of these zzso in zzso coli have been zzso We have designed a method for the zzso of the 5 S zzso from an zzso coli expression zzso zzso zzso to zzso by this method was shown to be active in the 5 S partial reaction, but unable to catalyze the overall zzso zzso This protein was characterized as to its ability to form stable zzso associate with the zzso S zzso in stable complexes referred to as 6 zzso and assemble whole zzso The latter activity was shown to be zzso The zzso protein has a native molecular weight of 120 zzso and a zzso molecular weight of 60 zzso consistent with the 5 S zzso Plasma zzso analysis of the metal content of the zzso protein demonstrated the presence of both Co and zzso comparable to the authentic zzso Fluorescence analysis verified the ability of the zzso protein to bind zzso and zzso S zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and determination of the zzso acid composition of the zzso protein relative to that of the authentic zzso further verified the identity of the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
