zzso flow triggers signal zzso events, zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso structures in vascular zzso cells zzso However, the primary steps of zzso are still zzso We have recently reported that a zzso is rapidly zzso in bovine zzso exposed to fluid flow or zzso zzso Here were cloned a zzso zzso zzso zzso this protein and found that this was bovine zzso The zzso level of zzso zzso from mechanically zzso bovine or human zzso zzso The zzso zzso was not induced by zzso that triggered zzso zzso in zzso An zzso band zzso with zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso zzso and bound to a zzso fusion protein containing the zzso zzso zzso A spliced zzso form lacking zzso acid zzso zzso in the zzso domain was also expressed in bovine zzso zzso neither zzso nor bound to the fusion protein containing the spliced zzso zzso domain which lacked one zzso zzso of the six zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso motif containing zzso 713 is the zzso zzso zzso Our study is the first demonstration of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and suggests involvement of zzso and zzso family zzso in the zzso zzso of mechanical stimuli in zzso
