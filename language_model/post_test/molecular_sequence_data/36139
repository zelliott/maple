zzso and/or zzso zzso of the zzso tumor zzso gene are frequently found in zzso cell zzso of the skin and of the zzso zzso In order to identify the precise mechanisms of zzso of zzso in tumors of this class, we examined the status of zzso zzso protein and DNA in a panel of eight human zzso zzso cell lines zzso 3; zzso 1; zzso 1; zzso zzso 2; zzso zzso Three lines zzso zzso zzso failed to express any zzso zzso zzso cells contained a single zzso zzso without zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that the lack of zzso was the result of zzso in the regulatory region of the zzso Both zzso zzso were deleted in zzso cells, whereas the single zzso present in zzso cells was rearranged and carried two zzso zzso in zzso zzso Two cell lines zzso zzso expressed only 50% of the normal level of zzso zzso either because only one zzso was present zzso or because only one of the two zzso was transcribed zzso The two cervical zzso lines zzso zzso expressed normal levels of zzso zzso but no wild type zzso presumably as a result of accelerated degradation by the human zzso 16 or zzso E6 zzso present in these cells as previously described zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso Three of the lines expressed only zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso in zzso 248 and zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
