In the present study, investigations were conducted on natural zzso deposits to better understand the role of zzso bacteria zzso in the accelerated zzso process of carbon steel sheet piles in port zzso We describe the abundance and diversity of total and metabolically active zzso within five natural zzso deposits located within tidal or low water zone and showing either normal or accelerated zzso By using molecular techniques, such as quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction, zzso gel zzso zzso and sequence cloning based on zzso zzso zzso zzso and their zzso we demonstrated a clear distinction between zzso population structure inhabiting normal or accelerated zzso zzso zzso Although zzso were present in both normal and accelerated zzso zzso deposits, they dominated and were exclusively active in the inner and intermediate layers of accelerated zzso zzso We also highlighted that some of these zzso populations are specific to the accelerated zzso zzso deposit environment in which they probably play a dominant role in the zzso zzso product zzso
