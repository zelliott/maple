zzso proteins act as essential molecular zzso in protein zzso and protein complex stabilization under stress zzso The roles of a tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso whose expression was zzso by treatment at 4 and 42 zzso and with high light, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were investigated here using sense and zzso transgenic zzso The sense plants exhibited not only higher zzso content, fresh weight and net zzso rate, but also lower zzso of zzso oxygen species and membrane damage under chilling zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso efficiency of zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso and D1 protein content were higher in the sense plants and lower in the zzso plants, and the zzso zzso was lower in the sense plants and higher in the zzso plants, suggesting that the zzso of zzso was less severe in the sense plants and more severe in the zzso plants compared with the wild zzso Furthermore, the zzso protein complexes were also more stable in the sense zzso Interestingly, the sense plants treated with zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso translation, still showed higher F zzso zzso D1 protein content and zzso stability than the zzso zzso zzso This finding suggested that the protective effect of zzso on zzso was, at least zzso independent of D1 protein zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso protein 70 was identified as the partner of zzso These results indicate that zzso has essential functions in maintaining zzso under chilling zzso
