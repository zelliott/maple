The positively acting regulatory gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso regulates the expression of five structural genes involved in the zzso of certain zzso zzso omega zzso acids zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in the presence of omega zzso acid zzso Analysis of the zzso gene showed that it contains three small zzso zzso zzso and 3' zzso sites, and multiple zzso zzso prior to the major zzso zzso The predicted zzso protein sequence has a zzso zzso zzso zzso motif at the zzso end, four putative zzso zzso zzso motifs in the zzso half, and two sequences zzso to the zzso virus 40 large T zzso nuclear zzso zzso These nuclear zzso sequences overlap the zzso zzso zzso A series of zzso zzso and internal deletions were examined in zzso for zzso zzso function and showed that the zzso product contains at least two zzso regions in the zzso zzso Each of these zzso zzso product contains at least two zzso regions in the zzso zzso Each of these zzso regions may function zzso but both are required for zzso levels of zzso zzso A number of the zzso deletion products were found to compete with the zzso zzso product in zzso Development of a rapid method for the zzso of zzso zzso is zzso and using this technique, we localized and zzso the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso occurs in the middle of the zzso and it is suggested that it results in an altered protein which activates gene expression efficiently in the absence of an zzso
