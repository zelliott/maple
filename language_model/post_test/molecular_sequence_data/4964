Because zzso in the zzso gene have been found in retinal zzso involving the zzso we examined various types of zzso zzso from southern France to characterize sequence variations that may be associated with these zzso DNA sequence analysis of the full coding and zzso regions of the zzso gene was performed in zzso unrelated patients with different types of zzso dystrophy, including nine with zzso zzso zzso Of the 15 zzso with zzso disease, two zzso were found to carry a zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was identified in a pedigree with zzso dominant zzso A previously zzso complex zzso zzso associated with zzso + zzso that is predicted to result in the premature termination of zzso synthesis was identified in a sporadic case of zzso zzso with zzso We also report eight novel neutral sequence variations in the zzso zzso most of them found in the 3' untranslated part of the zzso
