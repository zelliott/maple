We have constructed and analyzed different zzso forms of zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli that can be divided into two zzso The first group contains four full-length zzso molecules that differ in the presence of zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso The second group contains 22 zzso zzso acid deletions in addition to the differences in the zzso zzso The different zzso zzso were extracted and their expression levels and zzso were zzso We found that the production levels of zzso can be dramatically improved by deleting the first 22 zzso zzso acids of the zzso We have also found that the production of zzso containing the four zzso zzso is lower than the production of the zzso molecules that lack one or both pairs of zzso The yield of soluble and properly zzso zzso was the highest when the zzso bond between the zzso at positions 74 and 84 was present in the zzso form, which also lacked the 22 zzso zzso zzso
