Using a differential display technique, we identified two genes that are zzso in human gastric cancer tissue as compared to normal gastric zzso The zzso expression of these genes in gastric cancer tissue was confirmed by northern zzso analysis and zzso One, zzso was a novel gene expressed predominantly in the stomach and was depleted in all of the gastric cancer cell lines zzso The other zzso zzso was zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of both zzso and zzso was suppressed or depleted in gastric cancer cell lines of differentiated and poorly differentiated zzso This is the first report of zzso the expression of which is zzso with considerable frequency in gastric zzso
