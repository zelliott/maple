The zzso heat shock proteins zzso are a highly zzso abundant, and ubiquitous family of proteins expressed by all organisms from bacteria to zzso It is well established that zzso family members function as molecular zzso and aid in the zzso folding of newly zzso or zzso zzso Current evidence suggests an emerging role for zzso family members in immune responses and in clinically important responses to stress and tissue zzso Here we report the generation and characterization of several zzso to zzso family zzso zzso responses to this highly zzso family were induced in mice by zzso with synthetic peptides that contain regions of the mouse zzso zzso coupled to a potent helper T cell zzso derived from zzso zzso The resulting zzso include ones specific for the human and mouse zzso zzso and others that show zzso among the family members and recognize the zzso zzso the zzso zzso resident zzso zzso the zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso and the zzso member, zzso zzso these zzso are effective in Western zzso in zzso and in zzso and thus should find applications in the zzso and detection of members of this important zzso
