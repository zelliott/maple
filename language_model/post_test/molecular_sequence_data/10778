Two zzso in the zzso B zzso a 3' zzso zzso and a stop zzso zzso were previously found in patients with progressive zzso zzso of zzso type zzso et zzso zzso Science zzso We present here a new zzso zzso a zzso deletion within the third zzso of the zzso B gene in an zzso zzso This zzso results in a zzso and consequently premature termination of protein zzso Complete sequencing of the coding region and zzso junctions of the zzso B gene showed that neither of the two previously known zzso was present in this zzso The level of zzso B zzso in an immortalized cell line was found to be zzso as had been reported for other zzso zzso The new zzso further supports the argument that defects in the zzso B gene cause the zzso form of progressive zzso zzso We describe a simple zzso method which can detect the zzso zzso This zzso together with previously described zzso zzso for the other two known zzso should prove useful in confirming clinically difficult diagnoses of zzso zzso
