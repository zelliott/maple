zzso structures and genetic diversity of the small zzso zzso from the coastal waters of the zzso Islands in China were zzso Two genes libraries using zzso zzso of the marine small zzso were zzso and 323 clones were identified within zzso (more than zzso zzso zzso and zzso Many novel clones were detected in the two libraries, including two groups of zzso and two zzso related to both zzso and zzso Several sequences unrelated to any other known zzso may represent early branches in the zzso zzso Our results reveal that there is a high diversity and abundance of small zzso in the marine regions of zzso
