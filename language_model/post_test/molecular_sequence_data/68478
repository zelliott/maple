zzso human breast cancer cells are from an zzso zzso breast cell line derived from a highly aggressive zzso zzso Our previous zzso growth factor binding zzso zzso binding studies zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated specific binding of zzso on the zzso cell surface and a significant zzso effect of zzso itself, on zzso zzso In this study, we have demonstrated cell surface association proteins that are specific for zzso by zzso 1) detection of zzso zzso and zzso proteins by affinity zzso with zzso coli and zzso of cell zzso and cell zzso with zzso zzso 2) zzso competition of zzso coli by zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso of zzso binding to these cell surface proteins by zzso and by zzso with native zzso growth factor II zzso but not by zzso with zzso an zzso analog with decreased affinity for zzso and 4) partial zzso of zzso and zzso species by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of these specific zzso cell surface association proteins are identical to those observed in our previous zzso binding zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso The specificity of binding and the zzso effect of zzso binding on zzso cell growth suggest that these cell surface proteins are zzso receptors or zzso zzso zzso the direct zzso effect of zzso on zzso growth of zzso zzso
