We determined the resonance assignments, secondary structure and general zzso of the zzso sweet protein zzso zzso zzso using two-dimensional zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso is a genetically engineered protein whose design is based on the crystal structure of natural, zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso shows that the secondary structure of zzso consists of a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso constraints place the zzso on the zzso side of the zzso and indicate that the sheet is partially wrapped around the zzso The general structural features determined for zzso are similar to those of native zzso zzso et zzso zzso Some differences between the zzso structure in solution and the crystal structure of zzso are zzso
