zzso DNA of zzso zzso was isolated by means of screening the zzso library and zzso zzso chain zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso consisted of 516 zzso and showed zzso and zzso identities to corresponding forms in human and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protection zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso was expressed zzso in the liver, but not in the zzso kidney and small zzso The level of zzso zzso in the liver was increased by treatment with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso activated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and also activated zzso zzso zzso but at a relatively lower rate in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also showed zzso zzso zzso Based on these results, we demonstrate that zzso zzso express zzso in the liver as in zzso
