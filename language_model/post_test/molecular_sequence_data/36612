In the zzso zzso zzso zzso the gene coding for zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is located between zzso c of the zzso open reading frame and zzso The physical proximity of these genes further supports the zzso model for assembly of the zzso zzso Some transcripts comprise the zzso open reading frame zzso with zzso zzso c and zzso while other zzso contain only zzso and zzso Both open reading frames for zzso and zzso are edited in several positions with different zzso
