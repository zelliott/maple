We have isolated six distinct dog zzso zzso zzso class I zzso An additional functional zzso class I zzso zzso was characterized zzso This brings the number of isolated canine class I sequences to zzso These seven zzso account for nearly all class I sequences detected in zzso DNA by Southern zzso With approximately seven members, the class I gene family in dog is considerably less complex than in either human or zzso Three of the six sequences described in this article contain complete class I zzso These genes have the typical arrangement of zzso and zzso and their predicted protein sequences have the features expected of expressed class I zzso Two sequences contain truncated zzso These zzso having only partial class I zzso and disruptive zzso are clearly zzso The remaining locus contains a full-length processed gene which is unique among characterized class I zzso zzso comparisons were performed to examine evolutionary relationships among the family zzso Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso appear to be zzso presumably formed by zzso zzso Using the reverse zzso chain reaction, zzso originating from each of the three complete genes was identified in canine peripheral blood zzso zzso specific transcripts were identified zzso Thus, each of the four complete canine class I genes is transcribed in zzso
