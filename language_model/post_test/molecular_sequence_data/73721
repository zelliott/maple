Genes from zzso zzso predicted to zzso a zzso transport zzso system were shown by zzso to affect zzso zzso zzso but not zzso resistance or zzso zzso zzso The zzso start of the promoter upstream of the zzso gene was defined by primer zzso The promoter contains structural features analogous to the zzso coli zzso promoter but not sequence zzso zzso from this promoter was induced zzso upon zzso zzso and regulated by the zzso zzso regulatory zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso is involved in zzso transport and is a member of the zzso zzso but is not involved in zzso zzso
