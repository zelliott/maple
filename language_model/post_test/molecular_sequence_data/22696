zzso is an essential zzso zzso acid zzso that zzso the zzso and zzso steps of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso consists of two zzso zzso zzso component and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can function in zzso zzso in zzso when expressed as separate zzso To understand the structural requirements for the zzso domain, we performed an zzso scan of 30 zzso acids that are zzso in zzso zzso from other zzso We thereby identified four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as essential for activity in zzso zzso relationships at these positions, and at four essential or zzso essential zzso defined previously zzso zzso zzso and zzso were clarified by introducing conservative zzso zzso analysis showed that lethal zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso module abolished zzso zzso activity in zzso We report that a recently cloned zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso functions in lieu of zzso zzso in zzso and identify essential side chains in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the plant zzso The plant zzso like zzso zzso but unlike T4 zzso zzso 1, requires a zzso end for zzso zzso in zzso
