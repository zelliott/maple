We have determined the zzso and zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso in the rat zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso was zzso expressed in the nuclear fiber cells of the lens between embryonic days zzso 15 and 20, with zzso zzso occurring on zzso and zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso with zzso in the embryonic nuclear fiber zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso tests showed that at least three alternatively spliced forms of zzso zzso including zzso with and without the zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso zzso with zzso in the embryonic zzso The major zzso protein in the lens was 67 zzso We conclude that zzso active zzso is zzso expressed in the lens nuclear fiber cells of the embryonic zzso The transient expression is regulated by zzso and/or zzso zzso We speculate on the basis of possible common gene regulatory elements for zzso and zzso zzso and the involvement of these zzso with zzso zzso that the transient expression of zzso may be connected to nuclear and/or DNA breakdown during lens fiber cell zzso
