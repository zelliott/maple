zzso is a zzso protein that zzso restricts zzso before reverse zzso zzso is composed of four different zzso zzso zzso 2, coiled zzso and zzso The contribution of each of these zzso to restriction has been extensively zzso with the exception of the zzso zzso The zzso domain of zzso exhibits zzso zzso activity, but the contribution of this activity to the restriction of zzso is not zzso To test the hypothesis that the zzso zzso activity of the zzso domain zzso zzso restriction of zzso we correlated the zzso zzso activity of a panel of zzso zzso domain zzso with the ability of these zzso proteins to restrict zzso For this purpose, we first solved the nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the zzso domain of zzso and defined potential functional regions of the zzso domain by zzso to other zzso zzso With this structural information, we performed a systematic zzso of the zzso domain regions and tested the zzso zzso domain zzso for the ability to undergo zzso Several zzso particularly the ones on the zzso region of the zzso domain, were defective in their zzso zzso To correlate zzso restriction to zzso we used zzso domain zzso proteins that were defective in zzso but preserve important properties required for potent restriction by zzso such as zzso binding and zzso zzso From these zzso we found a set of zzso that when zzso results in zzso molecules that lost both the ability to zzso restrict zzso and their zzso zzso zzso all of these changes were in zzso located in the zzso region of the zzso zzso Overall, these results demonstrate a role for zzso zzso in the ability of zzso to restrict zzso
