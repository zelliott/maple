The zzso zzso gene encodes a putative response regulator in the food-borne pathogen zzso zzso It has zzso zzso acid identity to the zzso response regulator of zzso zzso We have characterized the zzso gene product in zzso zzso zzso by generation of a deletion zzso The zzso zzso was found to be zzso in zzso plate zzso and no zzso was zzso The zzso was attenuated in challenge of zzso Northern zzso analysis suggested that the zzso gene product is a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso at 25 degrees zzso However, the zzso gene product had no influence on the zzso of zzso zzso the major zzso regulator, zzso The results indicate that the putative zzso response regulator is a zzso regulator involved in expression of both zzso at low temperature and in zzso zzso in zzso
