The zzso zzso region represents the most diverse part of the zzso zzso We have previously reported that of 200 zzso zzso zzso of rat zzso T cells, rarely did two share sequence zzso over the entire zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that sequences of the zzso zzso region are excellent zzso markers for rat zzso T cell clones and zzso zzso complementary to the zzso region of three T cell clones specifically recognized the zzso from which they were zzso but failed to recognize zzso T cells that express a similar zzso zzso or T cells that share both V beta and J beta zzso To explore this zzso we determined the ability of zzso T cell clones to enter the zzso We were able to show that some zzso T cell clones have an zzso ability to enter the zzso and that zzso T cells have a higher penetrating activity than their zzso T cell zzso
