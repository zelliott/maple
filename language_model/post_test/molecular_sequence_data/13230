The zzso zzso protein zzso is a member of the basic zzso zzso zzso family of zzso zzso Like several other members of the zzso family, zzso activity of zzso is modulated by zzso acid receptors zzso We present evidence that the zzso alpha and zzso can zzso repress each other's zzso zzso by a newly discovered zzso Analysis of zzso alpha zzso in zzso studies reveals that the DNA binding domain is sufficient for zzso of zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso indicates that both the zzso zzso domain and a region containing the zzso zzso domain of zzso are required for zzso zzso experiments demonstrate physical interactions between zzso alpha and zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso reveal that these zzso interactions are zzso by the zzso zzso domain of zzso and the DNA binding domain of zzso zzso While zzso alpha is unable to recognize zzso binding sites, the zzso alpha can be zzso to the DNA by forming a zzso complex with zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso via zzso interactions onto promoter DNA suggest a mechanism through which zzso might gain additional levels of zzso zzso
