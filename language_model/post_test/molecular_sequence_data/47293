A series of zzso zzso zzso containing base and sugar modifications were tested for the ability to detect zzso repeat sequences in FISH zzso These modified zzso all 18 zzso in zzso were complementary to either the zzso zzso zzso zzso target zzso zzso were modified to either increase target affinity by enhancing duplex stability zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or inhibit the formation of zzso or zzso structures zzso and zzso zzso which might interfere with binding to the zzso Several zzso zzso zzso were found that could effectively stain the zzso repeat sequences of either zzso or zzso strands in a specific zzso Such zzso could be used as an alternative to zzso zzso acids for investigating the dynamics of zzso length and zzso In principle, these relatively inexpensive and readily zzso modified zzso could be used for other zzso zzso
