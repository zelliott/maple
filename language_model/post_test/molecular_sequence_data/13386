To determine the sister zzso to zzso the relationships among the zzso zzso were investigated using sequence data from the zzso gene of zzso zzso Both sequence data and translated zzso acids were zzso We examined how different models of zzso acid evolution zzso affected the zzso of tree zzso We then added previously published sequence data from the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso In most zzso regardless of data type and treatment, the zzso is either the sister zzso to butterflies or derived within the butterfly zzso These molecular results are compared to a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso agrees with zzso 1991 hypothesis of zzso zzso Analysis of combined molecular and zzso data supports the hypothesis that zzso are the sister group to zzso Scott's hypothesis that hawk zzso zzso are the sister zzso to butterflies is zzso
