The zzso gene is implicated in the development of zzso leukemia through its fusion with the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The normal 160 zzso zzso protein has several functional zzso and recently one specific role for zzso was established in the regulation of respiratory burst activity in white blood zzso zzso expression levels are relatively constant throughout mouse development until adulthood in brain and in zzso zzso a pattern that is distinctly different from that of the functionally related zzso zzso In the present study, zzso in zzso zzso was used to explore the normal cellular function of zzso in zzso brain and zzso zzso The data pinpoint the high zzso expression in the brain to the zzso zzso cell layer and the zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso reflecting a potentially interesting function for zzso in these highly specialized brain zzso
