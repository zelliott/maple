The 14 zzso of the zzso gene have been zzso zzso using zzso in 6 zzso zzso In each family band shifts were observed on the zzso gels for only one zzso and direct zzso revealed zzso in each zzso Two zzso involved zzso transitions in zzso zzso in zzso 9 and zzso Another zzso transition converted a zzso to a zzso in zzso zzso Small insertions created zzso which produced downstream stop zzso in another two patients and an zzso zzso disrupted the zzso donor site of zzso 5 in the remaining zzso Thus, complete zzso of the zzso gene is predicted in all zzso Analysis of other affected members of the families showed that, in each case, all affected individuals carried the same zzso zzso One zzso was found in zzso zzso This data strongly supports the zzso of zzso as the gene responsible for zzso zzso
