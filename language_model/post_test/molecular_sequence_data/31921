In cells, zzso are zzso as precursor molecules bearing extra sequences at their zzso and 3' zzso Some zzso also contain zzso which, in zzso and zzso are zzso by an zzso zzso zzso complex that generates fully functional mature zzso In addition, zzso undergo numerous zzso zzso chemical zzso In zzso zzso the single zzso zzso zzso is responsible for decoding all zzso zzso therefore, zzso removal is essential for zzso Using molecular and zzso approaches, we show the presence of several zzso editing events, within the zzso of zzso involving zzso transitions zzso to zzso and an zzso zzso (A to zzso The zzso editing described here is required for proper processing of the zzso establishing the functional significance of zzso editing with implications for zzso processing in the deeply divergent zzso lineage and zzso in zzso
