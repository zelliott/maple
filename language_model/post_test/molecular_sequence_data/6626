zzso zzso zzso contain zzso elements that have been divided into two groups, exemplified by zzso zzso 1) and zzso zzso zzso These elements are functionally related and have an intriguing level of structural and sequence zzso Some zzso zzso sequences and/or structures may zzso to zzso elements involved in zzso function, so that there may also be similarities in the mechanism by which the two types or zzso promote zzso The function of both types of zzso element appears to depend on a cellular 57 zzso zzso which has been identified as the predominantly nuclear zzso protein zzso However, a specific function for zzso in translation has not yet been zzso These two groups can be differentiated on the basis of their requirements for zzso zzso The zzso zzso functions efficiently in a broader range of zzso cell types than type 1 zzso zzso probably because the latter require additional zzso A second distinction between these zzso element is that initiation occurs directly at the 3' border of type 2 zzso zzso whereas a zzso zzso of between 30 zzso and 154 zzso separates type 1 zzso elements from the downstream initiation zzso
