The appropriate regulation of the zzso zzso is essential for cell movement, changes in cell shape, and formation of membrane zzso like zzso and zzso Moreover, several regulatory proteins affecting zzso dynamics have been identified in the zzso regions of zzso Here, we provide evidence for the involvement of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso and zzso comet tail zzso zzso was distributed throughout the zzso in zzso cells, but exposing the cells to zzso growth factor zzso caused a zzso of zzso to the cell zzso and the formation of zzso (or membrane zzso both of which were dramatically inhibited in zzso zzso In addition, the binding of the C zzso of zzso with both the zzso complex zzso proteins zzso 2 and zzso 3) and zzso activates the former, leading to zzso zzso in zzso And when zzso with zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso was observed within zzso comet zzso Taken these findings suggest that zzso zzso in reorganization of the zzso zzso and in zzso cell zzso
