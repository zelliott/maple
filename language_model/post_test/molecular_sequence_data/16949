The basic zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso controls the expression of zzso and other zzso genes and is a key zzso of zzso zzso To delineate the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso initiation of zzso zzso we characterized different regions of the zzso protein using zzso zzso zzso We identified 35 zzso acid zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso region (called minimal zzso domain, zzso which, when combined with zzso or zzso DNA binding zzso exhibited zzso of target zzso Because this domain is zzso in all proteins of the large zzso family, we hypothesized that zzso played an important role in assembling the zzso initiation zzso Our studies showed that the zzso zzso including the zzso zzso with full-length or the zzso domain of zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso and zzso could be zzso from bovine retinal nuclear zzso zzso was also part of zzso and zzso zzso other large zzso zzso zzso in zzso Our data suggest that the function of zzso is to activate zzso by recruiting or stabilizing zzso (and consequently other components of the general zzso zzso at the promoter of target zzso and a similar function may be attributed to other zzso proteins of the large zzso zzso
