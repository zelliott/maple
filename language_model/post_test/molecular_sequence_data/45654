The zzso zzso zzso senses temperature primarily via the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso The response to temperature can be observed as a behavior called zzso on zzso zzso It has been shown that a zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso in zzso To further identify the zzso mechanisms in zzso we attempted to identify components that function upstream of the zzso channel by a reverse genetic zzso zzso and behavioral analyses showed that three members of a zzso of zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were essential for zzso in zzso zzso zzso of each gene drove reporter gene expression exclusively in the zzso zzso and, moreover, zzso proteins were localized to the sensory endings of zzso Single zzso of each zzso gene showed almost normal zzso However, animals carrying double and triple zzso in these genes showed defective zzso zzso The abnormal zzso of the zzso triple zzso was rescued by expression of any one of the three zzso proteins in the zzso zzso These results suggest that three zzso zzso function zzso in the zzso zzso to mediate zzso by zzso zzso
