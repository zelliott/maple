We have recently reported that a zzso factor recognizes a DNA element, designated as region A, upstream of a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 176 (1999) zzso In this study, we isolated and characterized the zzso gene of this zzso zzso The zzso gene was found to zzso a putative protein consisting of zzso zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso was evident comparing the zzso sequence of zzso zzso with that of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain at the zzso of zzso is well zzso in the case of the zzso zzso zzso gene product and the zzso motif and the zzso box are also zzso In addition, the zzso zzso domain is present at the zzso zzso in zzso zzso was expressed at a relatively constant level under various growth conditions as determined by both primer extension and Western zzso zzso By means of a zzso zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso from strain zzso was zzso in zzso coli and zzso to near zzso An zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso protein specifically recognizes region A in the zzso zzso zzso
