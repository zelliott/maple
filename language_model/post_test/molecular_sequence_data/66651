The zzso zzso zzso consist of zzso negative feedback zzso In zzso it was proposed that the zzso zzso protein promotes the zzso of the WHITE zzso zzso complex, thus zzso its zzso The zzso involved in this process is not zzso In this study, we show that the disruption of the interaction between zzso and zzso (a zzso zzso I zzso results in the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso In the zzso strain, a zzso zzso that carries a zzso equivalent to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso The zzso also exhibits zzso h zzso rhythms due to the increase of zzso stability and the significant delay of zzso progressive zzso In addition, the levels of zzso and zzso are low in the zzso strain, indicating that zzso is also important for the zzso positive feedback zzso In spite of its low zzso in the zzso strain, the zzso zzso efficiently binds to the zzso within the zzso promoter, presumably because it cannot be zzso through zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso are also zzso in the zzso strain, which carries the disruption of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso In the zzso strain, zzso binding to the zzso is constantly high and cannot be inhibited by zzso despite high zzso levels, resulting in high levels of zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso and zzso in addition to being the zzso zzso mediate the zzso zzso of zzso which inhibit their activity and close the zzso negative feedback zzso
