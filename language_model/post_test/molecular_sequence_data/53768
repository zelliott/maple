zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are arrested at the zzso phase of zzso I and possess a prominent zzso zzso in which maternal stores of nuclear proteins which are destined for use primarily by the early zzso are zzso zzso zzso breakdown and subsequent zzso maturation is triggered by zzso of the zzso B complex, which is present as the zzso in the zzso The aim of the present study was to identify and zzso characterize in zzso zzso of the zzso Two zzso acid binding nuclear proteins designated zzso and zzso were found, both of which contain 345 zzso acid zzso with zzso zzso 6 and which serve as zzso The only difference between the two proteins was in the primary zzso acid sequence at position 51, which is zzso in zzso but zzso in zzso zzso are zzso in zzso during zzso maturation but not at the zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso in zzso by the zzso zzso on the same site as in zzso Although there are other zzso zzso consensus sequences for zzso by zzso active zzso zzso in zzso and zzso fragments containing the sequences were efficiently zzso in zzso these sites in the intact zzso were not zzso either in zzso or in zzso These results suggest that the zzso structure of zzso affects the target specificity of the zzso zzso
