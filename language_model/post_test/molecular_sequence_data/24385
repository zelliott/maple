Recently, eight zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso have been characterized in zzso zzso strains isolated in Europe and the United zzso It has been suggested that the divergence of the zzso types of clinical zzso from those of the zzso zzso vaccine strains is a result of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso which is relatively zzso has so far been the only method for the differentiation of zzso zzso We have developed a rapid real-time zzso chain reaction zzso suitable for large-scale screening of the zzso type of the circulating zzso This method correctly identified the zzso type of all tested 41 clinical zzso and two Finnish vaccine zzso The method is simple and reliable and provides an alternative for sequencing in zzso zzso
