Two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were obtained by zzso zzso synthesis using the zzso zzso The synthetic and natural zzso isolated from the snake zzso or zzso zzso display identical zzso properties and pharmacological zzso High protein recovery allowed us to specify the selectivity of these toxins for various zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso has a selectivity for the zzso zzso that is at least 20,000 times that for the other zzso The stability of the zzso complexes indicates that zzso interacts zzso with the zzso zzso unlike zzso which binds it zzso The effect of the synthetic toxins on the zzso zzso zzso zzso confirms that zzso targets the zzso site on the zzso zzso whereas zzso seems interact on the zzso zzso The great decreases in the binding zzso observed after the zzso modification in zzso and zzso toxins highlight the functional role of this zzso zzso in their interactions with the zzso zzso Interestingly, after the zzso zzso the zzso toxin binds zzso on the zzso zzso Furthermore, the potency of zzso for the zzso zzso is lower compared with unmodified zzso supporting the role of this zzso in the zzso interaction of zzso All these results and the different charge zzso observed at the two toxin surfaces of their structure models support the hypothesis that the two toxins recognize the zzso zzso zzso
