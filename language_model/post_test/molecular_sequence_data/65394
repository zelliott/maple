zzso zzso factor zzso 5 is a zzso factor belonging to the zzso zzso protein gene zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso expression increased in response to zzso acid zzso The zzso gene allows zzso of zzso with at least two alternative zzso regions zzso zzso and zzso derived from zzso and zzso zzso contains highly zzso zzso in which the upstream open reading frames zzso zzso and zzso are found in many zzso This study was designed to investigate the potential role of zzso in zzso zzso These zzso zzso determined translation efficiency from zzso The presence of zzso or zzso zzso translation from the downstream zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso repression is released by zzso acid limitation or zzso zzso This release was not seen for zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso of zzso restored the zzso expression and abolished the positive regulation by zzso acid limitation or zzso zzso We demonstrated that zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso was required for zzso acid zzso zzso regulation of zzso Furthermore, zzso exposure activated the zzso expressed zzso inhibitor zzso and induced the zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso in zzso zzso These results suggest that translation of zzso is regulated by the alternative zzso region of its zzso and zzso may play a role in protecting cells from zzso acid limitation or zzso zzso zzso
