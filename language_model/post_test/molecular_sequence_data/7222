zzso zzso observations of the oral zzso zzso zzso show the presence of zzso zzso bound to the bacterial surface or free in the surrounding zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso 50 to 100 zzso in diameter, were isolated and further zzso zzso and zzso patterns of the zzso were found to be very similar to those of isolated zzso zzso outer zzso They were enriched with the major outer sheath zzso zzso sizes, 113 to 234 zzso and with outer sheath zzso of 91, zzso zzso and zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso outer sheath zzso contain the necessary zzso and zzso arsenal for adherence to and damage of zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso The major outer zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso The zzso zzso had a molecular size of 91 zzso and it zzso into three zzso of 72, 38, and 35 zzso upon heating in the presence of sodium zzso zzso with or without a reducing zzso The activity of the zzso could be inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The value of the zzso rate constant of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by zzso acid was rapid zzso 1 zzso and pH zzso These data strongly suggest that this major surface zzso activity belongs to a family of zzso zzso
