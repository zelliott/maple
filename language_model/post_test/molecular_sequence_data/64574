zzso zzso zzso zzso channels are zzso of four zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions between the zzso domain of zzso and zzso were investigated by zzso of rat zzso zzso fragments with full-length zzso and by analysis of cloned zzso channel function and distribution in zzso cells zzso embryonic kidney zzso zzso in the presence of competing zzso zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso with full-length zzso using a zzso zzso zzso A fourth zzso domain fragment, zzso zzso zzso did not zzso with zzso under the same conditions, indicating a direct interaction between zzso and a zzso section of the zzso zzso region of zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso currents were decreased in zzso cells expressing full-length zzso and zzso zzso that were zzso zzso with fragments zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso or zzso cells, suggesting either channel zzso or a reduction in the number of functional zzso channels at the cell zzso zzso channel zzso zzso in the cell membrane was substantially lower and zzso zzso increased in zzso expressing zzso thus, zzso fragments containing zzso zzso reduce current by decreasing the number of channel zzso in the cell zzso These results identify a site in the zzso domain of zzso between zzso zzso and zzso whose direct interaction with full-length zzso is crucial for the assembly of functional zzso zzso
