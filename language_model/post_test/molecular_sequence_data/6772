The zzso of zzso zzso via the zzso pathway, requires zzso as a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso which are the first two zzso in this three step zzso These two zzso form a zzso complex with the zzso in zzso zzso suggesting that the recognition elements on the zzso zzso are different for each zzso Chemical modification and comparative studies with zzso from a number of species were used to determine the zzso involved in the recognition of the barley zzso zzso by the barley zzso The barley zzso zzso is chemically modified both before and after zzso to zzso with zzso or zzso The chemically modified zzso is a poor zzso for the zzso zzso and the chemically modified zzso is used as a zzso for zzso zzso The zzso from the zzso if zzso zzso zzso zzso cucumber, wheat and spinach and zzso from zzso zzso zzso coli, barley germ and zzso zzso and the barley zzso zzso are all effective zzso for the barley zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the sequences of these zzso shows 19 zzso bases and five of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are suggested as recognition elements of barley zzso zzso zzso by assuming a similar binding orientation as in the crystal structure of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The zzso from zzso coli, zzso zzso and barley germ and the barley zzso zzso are not effective zzso for the barley zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the sequences of these four zzso species with the sequences of the zzso species that can be used as zzso by the zzso zzso yields seven common differences in the primary zzso These 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expected to be required for recognition by the barley zzso zzso zzso
