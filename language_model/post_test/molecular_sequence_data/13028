To study the molecular basis of zzso and zzso regulated expression of the fatty acid zzso zzso gene in zzso we generated lines of transgenic mice carrying zzso zzso of the zzso region zzso to zzso of the rat zzso gene fused to a zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso This reporter gene construct was strongly expressed in zzso that normally express high levels of zzso zzso which include liver and white zzso zzso In contrast, zzso reporter activity was not detected in appreciable levels in zzso heart, zzso and muscle zzso which do not normally show significant levels of zzso zzso The relative levels of the zzso zzso driven by the rat zzso promoter in various zzso of the transgenic animals zzso those of the zzso mouse zzso zzso We also examined the hormonal and nutritional regulation of the zzso reporter gene in transgenic zzso zzso activity was increased in both liver and white zzso tissue when zzso animals were zzso a high zzso zzso zzso These changes in zzso activity and zzso zzso levels occurred in parallel to the changes in zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso did not change zzso activity appreciably in other zzso such as muscle and brown zzso zzso Administration of zzso zzso at the start of zzso prevented an increase in zzso activity in zzso However, the zzso effect was zzso as zzso treatment did not bring about change in zzso activity in zzso zzso Next, to examine the effect of insulin, we made the transgenic mice zzso by zzso zzso zzso treatment of the zzso mice increased both the zzso activity and zzso zzso levels driven by the rat zzso promoter in liver and white zzso zzso These changes in zzso expression by insulin paralleled those in zzso zzso zzso zzso Administration of zzso increased zzso activity in all zzso zzso liver, white and brown zzso zzso zzso heart, and zzso Overall, the first zzso zzso of the zzso region of the rat zzso gene appear to contain sequence elements necessary to zzso zzso and zzso regulated expression characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso
