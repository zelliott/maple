zzso zzso with in zzso expanded zzso T zzso specific for zzso virus zzso can successfully treat zzso zzso disease zzso However, extension of a similar strategy to Hodgkin's disease zzso and zzso zzso zzso is limited by the poor zzso of the limited set of zzso zzso zzso expressed in these zzso making zzso expansion zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso receptors zzso into activated T zzso may provide a universal, zzso means to generate zzso cells without the need for tissue culture based methods of zzso zzso We report the transfer of two zzso zzso from human zzso clones zzso and zzso zzso that zzso the ability to lyse zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso are the best model for native expression of zzso We also demonstrate the rapid transfer of the zzso by zzso of primary T cells using a simple zzso zzso The ability to detect zzso zzso chain by zzso fully assembled zzso by zzso and zzso zzso activity indicates that zzso can serve as a tool for rapid screening of zzso zzso
