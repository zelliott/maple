To zzso the role of zzso in regulating zzso the zzso effects of different zzso on 35 zzso zzso zzso release from brain slices were examined in the Richardson's ground zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso evoked a significant zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso release from zzso slices of the zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso was attenuated by either the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or the zzso dependent sodium channel blocker zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso effect of zzso persisted in the zzso zzso however, a ten fold higher concentration of zzso zzso zzso was required to elicit a significant zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exerted a significant enhancement of zzso zzso release from zzso slices of the zzso zzso This enhancement was blocked by either the specific zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso However, in the zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso zzso zzso on zzso release was zzso zzso and zzso had no zzso effects on zzso zzso release from the zzso slices of either the zzso or zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso effects of zzso on zzso release are zzso and zzso indicating the complex nature of the roles of different zzso in regulating zzso
