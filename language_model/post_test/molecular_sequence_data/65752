zzso zzso zzso a model system for zzso has contributed enormously to the study of insect zzso especially in zzso zzso But little is known about the molecular mechanism of immune response in the zzso Toll receptors are a group of zzso ancient zzso which play a crucial role in the innate immunity of both insects and zzso In human, zzso receptors zzso are the typical pattern recognition receptors for different kinds of pathogen zzso zzso receptors in zzso however, were thought to function as zzso receptors in immune response and zzso We have identified 11 putative zzso receptors and two Toll zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of insect Toll family and human zzso showed that zzso is grouped with zzso zzso and zzso zzso These putative proteins are typical zzso receptors flanked by the zzso zzso repeat zzso domain and the zzso zzso zzso zzso prediction of the zzso domain alignment found five stranded sheets and five zzso which are zzso zzso zzso data indicated that zzso and zzso were expressed with remarkable enrichment in the zzso suggesting that they might play a role in the zzso However, the enriched expression of zzso and zzso in the zzso suggested that the proteins they zzso may be involved in immune zzso zzso expression of zzso and zzso and zzso implies that these may be involved in zzso biological zzso The zzso results indicated that 10 genes were induced or suppressed with different degrees after their immune system was challenged by different zzso zzso profiles of zzso and zzso reported here provide insight into their role in innate immunity and zzso
