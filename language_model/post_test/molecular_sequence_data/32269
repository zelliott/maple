The zzso system in bacteria promotes recycling of stalled zzso and targets incomplete peptides for zzso In zzso coli, loss of zzso function has little effect on growth under normal laboratory zzso Among the subtle zzso of zzso zzso is the inability to plate certain zzso zzso zzso This zzso is dependent on the zzso recycling functions of the zzso system but is independent of its zzso zzso The experiments described here show that translation of the first zzso zzso of the zzso open reading frame by a zzso is both necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso While a variety of sense zzso can replace the zzso zzso zzso zzso as the resume zzso both AAA and zzso zzso zzso are zzso resume zzso These results suggest that the main function of zzso in releasing stalled zzso is to supply a stop zzso and so facilitate termination and subsequent zzso zzso
