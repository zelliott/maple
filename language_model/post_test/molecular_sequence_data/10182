zzso zzso fragments can be produced in large quantities using bacterial expression systems and could potentially be useful for the generation of zzso for the selective removal of viral particles from zzso A human single zzso zzso library, derived from synthetic zzso of germ line zzso segments rearranged in zzso and paired to a single light chain zzso et zzso 1994, zzso zzso 13, zzso has recently been used to isolate hundreds of different binding zzso by panning with zzso zzso from this library typically have affinities in the zzso zzso zzso Occasionally, better zzso are isolated but at other times the affinities recovered are zzso In the latter situation binding cannot be detected with soluble zzso but only by zzso display of multiple copies of zzso on zzso By panning with human zzso zzso zzso we have isolated a number of zzso clones from this library that bound to the zzso only if displayed on the zzso zzso but not in soluble zzso One of these clones was selected for an affinity maturation zzso achieved by zzso zzso of the zzso determining region 3 zzso of the zzso light chain, followed by selection of the resulting library for zzso zzso By this means, we were able to isolate a number of zzso some of which exhibited specific zzso binding in soluble zzso The clone that gave the strongest zzso signal was expressed in bacteria, zzso in solution, zzso using a novel capture methodology with surface zzso resonance detection on a zzso instrument and used for the production of an zzso for the removal of zzso form human zzso The filter removed more than zzso of applied zzso in 10 zzso circulation time, while the amount of zzso retained zzso in a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso was less than zzso under similar zzso
