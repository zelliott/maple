zzso 11 zzso zzso (11 beta zzso an zzso zzso zzso disease, accounts for zzso of cases of zzso adrenal zzso In this study, we carried out a molecular genetic analysis of zzso zzso steroid 11 zzso zzso from a Japanese patient affected with this zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso chain zzso products of the patient's zzso revealed the occurrence of a stop zzso in zzso 2 due to a point zzso zzso zzso To further analyze the role of zzso zzso steroid zzso zzso in the 11 beta zzso patient, zzso of the patient was also amplified and zzso In contrast to zzso there was no zzso in zzso zzso zzso length zzso analysis indicated that the 11 beta zzso patient is zzso and his unaffected parents are zzso for the zzso When a zzso corresponding to zzso of the 11 beta zzso patient was zzso into zzso cells, steroid 11 zzso activity was not zzso in zzso of the zzso These results demonstrate that intact zzso was not produced at all due to the nonsense zzso in zzso of the patient without any zzso in zzso
