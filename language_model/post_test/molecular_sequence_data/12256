zzso zzso cell cycle zzso mouse cell, zzso is deficient in DNA zzso alpha activity to initiate DNA replication at zzso zzso Here, we analyzed zzso concerning growth control genes in the arrested zzso zzso Analysis of zzso showed that expression levels of zzso zzso which is essential for zzso transition, remarkably decreased in the zzso cells after temperature zzso Further we examined zzso states of zzso protein zzso in the zzso Though the zzso cells arrested in zzso phase at zzso temperature zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 265 zzso a large proportion of zzso was found as an zzso zzso form in the arrested zzso In zzso cell lines of zzso zzso was not zzso even at zzso zzso The zzso zzso occurred later than the decrease of zzso levels of zzso zzso thus the zzso may be caused by the decrease in amount of zzso D1 zzso These results indicated that the zzso zzso of DNA zzso alpha evokes zzso in which the zzso machinery of zzso transition has been turned zzso
