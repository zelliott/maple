zzso mouse zzso zzso were modified for the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The cell construct was tested for its zzso properties in zzso mice zzso with zzso zzso The results indicated that the survival of mice injected with a mixture of zzso cells and the zzso double zzso zzso was significantly longer than that of mice injected with zzso cells and zzso cells modified for the expression of zzso and the zzso of zzso or zzso alone zzso or zzso zzso Both natural zzso killer zzso cells and zzso + zzso with zzso zzso activities were zzso in mice zzso with the double zzso zzso zzso melanoma cells persisted in mice treated with zzso cells zzso The zzso cells were resistant to zzso zzso cells from mice zzso with zzso zzso The zzso melanoma cells were deficient in the expression of zzso class I zzso Class I expression by zzso cells was increased if they were incubated in medium zzso by the growth of zzso zzso or zzso zzso After zzso the sensitivity of zzso melanoma cells to zzso cells from mice zzso with zzso cells was zzso The survival of mice bearing low zzso class zzso zzso cells, treated zzso cells, was zzso The treated animals survived significantly longer than mice with zzso melanoma treated with zzso zzso Similar results were obtained for mice with zzso melanoma treated with zzso zzso We zzso that zzso of mice with zzso double zzso cells zzso multiple zzso zzso zzso zzso to the enhanced therapeutic zzso effects of combination chemotherapy, it was likely that treatment with a cellular zzso engineered to stimulate more than one zzso mechanism resulted in the elimination of larger numbers of zzso cells than treatment with an zzso that zzso a single zzso mechanism zzso
