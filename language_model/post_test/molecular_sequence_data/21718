We investigated the zzso activity of zzso zzso in terms of growth, zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso to zzso III cells with zzso value of zzso while other zzso did not show any zzso activity except for zzso which is a well-known inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso To investigate whether low molecular weight zzso zzso zzso can inhibit zzso zzso zzso we performed chemical zzso of AS by radical reactions to obtain zzso Its zzso properties were characterized by zzso size exclusion zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso compositional analysis after zzso with zzso II, and zzso zzso The most potent molecular size of zzso was zzso with zzso value of zzso which is zzso more potent than intact zzso These results suggest that AS as well as other zzso can be chemically zzso by free zzso and zzso compared to intact AS can be applied as a pharmaceutical candidate in order to inhibit zzso zzso zzso to zzso III zzso
