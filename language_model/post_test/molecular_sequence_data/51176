The complete zzso sequence of zzso zzso type D strain zzso zzso was determined and the deduced zzso acid sequence is reported here for the first zzso The structure and function of zzso type D zzso is discussed from a molecular biological zzso DNA was extracted from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso type D strain zzso and a zzso (about 10 zzso coding for the zzso was cloned into zzso coli using zzso zzso A zzso zzso which zzso to zzso to zzso of the partial zzso acid sequence near the zzso of the type D zzso was zzso and used as a probe to identify the gene zzso type D zzso The zzso sequence contained a single open reading frame coding for zzso zzso acids zzso weight of zzso and the deduced zzso acid sequence corresponded exactly to the partial zzso acid sequences determined by direct zzso of the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso formed the zzso of the light chain zzso zzso and heavy chain zzso zzso respectively, and these two chains were linked with a zzso bond between zzso on the light chain and zzso on the heavy zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso differed from that previously reported for type D zzso by three zzso
