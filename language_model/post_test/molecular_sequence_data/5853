gamma zzso from shark eye lenses, formerly termed beta s zzso in zzso lenses, is structurally characterized in this study by zzso cloning and zzso To facilitate sequence characterization of gamma zzso possessing intermediate structural properties between zzso and zzso zzso mixture was constructed from the zzso zzso isolated from shark eye lenses, and amplification by zzso chain reaction zzso was carried out to obtain zzso segments zzso multiple shark gamma zzso zzso several positive clones revealed that a zzso of zzso exists in the gamma zzso class of this zzso fish, similar to authentic zzso family characterized from the same shark zzso zzso of protein sequences zzso by two representative shark gamma zzso and gamma zzso zzso with those published sequences of zzso zzso and gamma S zzso from zzso human, zzso and carp zzso indicated that there is about zzso sequence zzso between shark gamma S zzso and structurally related zzso from different evolutionary classes, with a higher sequence similarity between shark gamma S and zzso zzso than that of shark gamma S and carp gamma S or bovine gamma S zzso A zzso tree constructed on the basis of the sequence divergence among various zzso zzso and gamma S zzso corroborates the closer zzso of shark gamma S to authentic zzso than to zzso and zzso gamma S zzso It further strengthens the supposition that ancestral precursors of gamma zzso were present in the shark lens long before the appearance of zzso zzso and zzso gamma zzso
