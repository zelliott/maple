Transfer zzso possess highly zzso secondary structures, and zzso studies suggest a common, L-shaped zzso zzso in which the zzso and zzso stems are disposed at approximately right angles to one zzso However, many animal zzso zzso possess unusual secondary structures, and little is known regarding their zzso zzso in particular, the relative zzso of their zzso and zzso zzso To address this issue, we have constructed zzso zzso molecules corresponding to human zzso and zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso and zzso stems of each zzso have been extended by approximately 70 base zzso The zzso zzso times of the two zzso zzso species were compared to the zzso times of a linear zzso control and to an extended zzso zzso zzso species whose zzso angle had been reported zzso Whereas the apparent zzso angle of the human zzso zzso species is essentially identical to that of the zzso zzso zzso with both zzso to the zzso zzso the angle for the zzso zzso construct is much larger zzso 140 zzso Thus, the universal zzso may not be zzso to zzso zzso zzso a finding of significance for both zzso evolution and zzso zzso
