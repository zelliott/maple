zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been associated with the presence of a zzso approximately zzso zzso in size which carries a zzso M zzso resistance zzso Two different zzso types, American and Dutch, have previously been zzso based on the restriction zzso zzso zzso In this study, the zzso genes from the two zzso types have been amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso and then zzso The gene sequences from the two plasmids shared zzso identity, and showed similarities with different segments of the zzso gene sequences from zzso zzso and zzso zzso The data suggest that it is highly likely that the zzso M zzso found in the American type zzso has a different origin from that present in the Dutch zzso
