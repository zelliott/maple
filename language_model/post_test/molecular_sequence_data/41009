To establish the clinical zzso and genetic background in a family with diabetes zzso 

The subjects were a sister and brother, aged 34 and 27 years, respectively, with a history of zzso since zzso Clinical testing confirmed a diagnosis of zzso zzso diabetes zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso DNA were zzso 

The sequence of the entire coding region of the zzso gene as well as the zzso gene was zzso zzso analysis revealed no variations in the zzso zzso A zzso variation in zzso 2 of the zzso gene zzso predicting a zzso zzso was identified in the zzso of the affected male and one zzso in the sister and the zzso zzso The zzso variation in zzso is known to cause zzso and has previously been described as inducing a partial zzso zzso with zzso However, in this family zzso had no influence on urine zzso whereas combination therapy with zzso and zzso increased urine zzso to 299 zzso in the zzso A skewed zzso pattern zzso occurring in the normal X zzso was recognized in the zzso 

This study demonstrates the effect of skewed zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso in early childhood could be due to zzso zzso despite affecting both zzso The significant zzso in the clinical zzso in zzso carries a risk of diagnostic zzso and emphasizes the need for genetic zzso Treatment combining zzso and zzso results in a marked response on both urine output and urine zzso
