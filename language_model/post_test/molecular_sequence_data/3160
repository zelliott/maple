zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso to zzso zzso The HAS from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains six zzso zzso whereas the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains four zzso zzso These zzso zzso of zzso are highly zzso in all Class I HAS family zzso Here we investigated the structural and functional roles of these zzso zzso in zzso by using zzso zzso and sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were inhibited by zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso These zzso zzso were zzso indicating the presence of sensitive and insensitive zzso After treatment of zzso with zzso the zzso value was decreased approximately zzso and the zzso values changed only zzso All the zzso zzso of zzso were partially zzso The least active single zzso double zzso or triple zzso zzso zzso retained 24, zzso and zzso activity, respectively, compared with zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso value of the zzso zzso was approximately zzso of zzso although the zzso values for both zzso were increased zzso zzso zzso therefore, are not involved in a critical interaction necessary for either zzso binding or zzso However, the distribution of zzso products was shifted to a smaller size in approximately zzso of the zzso zzso zzso particularly the triple zzso Mass zzso analysis of zzso and zzso zzso as well as the labeling of all double zzso zzso with zzso demonstrated that zzso contains no zzso zzso We conclude that the four zzso zzso in zzso are not directly involved in zzso but that one or more of these zzso zzso are located in or near zzso binding or zzso active sites, so that their modification zzso the functions of zzso
