zzso is a zzso zzso protein which plays important roles in the alternative zzso of zzso It has been shown to be involved in regulatory pathways for maintaining zzso stability and play important roles in regulating key receptors in the zzso We report here the solution structure of the zzso recognition motifs zzso domain of free human zzso zzso zzso Compared with other members of the zzso protein family, zzso structure has a longer zzso loop zzso The zzso aromatic zzso in the zzso motif is absent in zzso zzso zzso shows that the zzso sequence zzso binds zzso with a zzso of 61 zzso 1 zzso and a zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments reveal that for zzso the zzso zzso and zzso interactions are themselves not sufficient for effective zzso zzso the additional loop zzso is crucial for zzso complex zzso A comparison is made between the structures of zzso complex with other known zzso complexes of zzso zzso We conclude that interactions involving the zzso loop, zzso and zzso of the zzso domain are collectively important for determining selectivity between the protein and zzso
