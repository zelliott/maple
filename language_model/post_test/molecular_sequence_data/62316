zzso defects in DNA repair have been shown to be associated with zzso instability followed by zzso Recently, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso small zzso 2 zzso was identified as a novel zzso gene which is directly regulated by zzso protein in the zzso and zzso zzso of the cell cycle zzso zzso to repair damaged zzso 

We performed genetic analyses of zzso to determine whether zzso zzso play significant roles in zzso zzso zzso DNA from 108 primary transitional cell zzso zzso 81 of the urinary zzso and 27 of the zzso pelvis or zzso was analyzed for zzso in the zzso gene by direct zzso We focused on three zzso of the zzso zzso one zzso small zzso signature involving zzso zzso zzso 1) and two putative nuclear zzso signal zzso involving zzso zzso zzso 2) and zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, a zzso site of 20 zzso in zzso 1 of zzso was also zzso 

One zzso pelvic zzso zzso zzso had a zzso substitution in zzso with a G to T zzso resulting in the zzso acid substitution zzso zzso zzso This base substitution was localized within the domain of zzso 4 zzso the zzso small zzso signature, and causes an zzso acid substitution in one of the most highly zzso regions of zzso in which human zzso and zzso zzso and zzso proteins are highly zzso 

This finding provides the in zzso evidence for the zzso involvement of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso
