zzso zzso R zzso is a key component of the zzso zzso defense zzso Upon binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reactions that activate the zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso zzso binding domain, which consists of two tandem zzso zzso binding zzso and a zzso zzso zzso We have used zzso X-ray scattering and zzso zzso scattering to define the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis indicates a radius of zzso of about 35 zzso The zzso distance distribution function exhibits a peak near 30 A, with a broad shoulder extending to longer zzso Good fits to the scattering data require models that incorporate multiple compact and extended zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso belongs to the growing family of proteins that contain zzso zzso zzso We propose that the flexible zzso may allow zzso to zzso zzso upon interaction with zzso zzso that have diverse zzso
