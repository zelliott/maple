A zzso zzso study was performed to compare 26 novel bacterial zzso obtained from zzso zzso zzso and a zzso soil in the Netherlands with 16 strains that had previously been assigned to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso of intact cells and zzso characterization zzso of the zzso confirmed the existence of different strain clusters zzso within the zzso zzso Until now, only cluster C strains have been formally zzso as zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso were performed with a selection of strains representing the four zzso The results showed that cluster B strains also belong to zzso zzso and that strains of clusters A and D represent two novel species within the zzso zzso The latter novel species could be differentiated by means of zzso and zzso characteristics and are classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
