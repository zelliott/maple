zzso exchange is an important process in zzso zzso Here, we examine the role of zzso zzso in the divergence of closely related zzso zzso from natural marine zzso Four zzso genes zzso T4 zzso zzso zzso zzso and a putative tail zzso zzso and four zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso for 60 zzso zzso belonging to five Rhode Island zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the 60 zzso sequences revealed zzso sequence clusters corresponding to the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso within a strain shared an average zzso identity of zzso Nevertheless, extensive zzso was observed within each zzso zzso only three of the 60 zzso shared the same zzso zzso zzso was generated by point zzso zzso zzso within a strain, and zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso zzso events between distinct zzso strains were detected most often in zzso zzso II zzso and zzso zzso but were also identified in some major zzso protein zzso zzso Within a strain, more zzso was observed at the zzso locus than at any of the other seven zzso Although most of the zzso within a strain was neutral, some zzso acid zzso were identified, and thus zzso within strains has the potential to influence the population dynamics of zzso zzso
