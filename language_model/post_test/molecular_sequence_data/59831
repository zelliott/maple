We identified some gene linkage groups in zzso zzso using a zzso zzso improved zzso alternating field zzso zzso zzso Complex zzso DNA molecules were found trapped along the gel lanes, explaining the fuzziness of the zzso Using several zzso zzso including 16 zzso zzso zzso and 25 S zzso zzso zzso an autonomous replication sequence zzso and zzso we identified a complete zzso zzso linkage group zzso at the zzso zzso Three other incomplete groups were zzso zzso formed by zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso and 25 S zzso zzso formed by zzso 16 S and 25 zzso and zzso formed only by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes migrated at the zzso position, forming the zzso linkage group, zzso while the zzso gene migrated at zzso zzso forming the zzso zzso zzso was located at zzso zzso and zzso zzso in three different groups: zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were also identified using an zzso zzso zzso By in zzso zzso experiments, the zzso and zzso genes were located in both nucleus and zzso while the zzso and zzso genes were found mainly in the zzso We propose a model zzso that the 16 S and 25 S genes are in a linear zzso duplicated in two zzso repeats, which may be zzso out of the linear DNA to form an zzso probably lacking or not the zzso S zzso which could be added later by zzso
