zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that mediates the action of zzso In order to examine the role of zzso dynamics of DNA in zzso regulation of gene zzso we studied the binding of zzso to zzso which zzso transition to a left-handed zzso zzso This type of zzso repeats are widely distributed in zzso zzso and are present in zzso response zzso zzso affinity of zzso for the zzso was assessed by its ability to release zzso bound to zzso zzso binding by zzso was enhanced in the presence of an zzso zzso zzso zzso The concentration of zzso required for zzso 50% zzso of zzso zzso was 75 zzso This zzso increased to 500 zzso for a zzso zzso zzso demonstrating zzso structural zzso zzso zzso showed that the presence of zzso zzso zzso initiated changes in the zzso of the zzso indicative of zzso form, but a major zzso to zzso spectrum occurred only at 300 zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso favors DNA sequences poised for zzso zzso The efficacy of zzso zzso in zzso zzso interaction may be important in predicting their efficiency to replace cellular functions of zzso
