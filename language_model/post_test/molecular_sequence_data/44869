In recent years, significant progress has been made toward understanding smooth muscle zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso cloning analysis has identified four different zzso zzso They are products of a single gene and result from alternative zzso zzso In addition, two zzso zzso zzso are also expressed in smooth muscle zzso Studies show that zzso expression is highly tissue specific and does not appear in cardiac or skeletal muscle zzso Each smooth muscle tissue is characterized by a specific pattern of zzso zzso expression that changes during development and zzso This review essentially focuses on zzso zzso and their expression in zzso
