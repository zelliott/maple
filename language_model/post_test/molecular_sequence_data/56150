zzso zzso produces thin, zzso zzso designated zzso A zzso region of a zzso zzso zzso genes responsible for zzso zzso was zzso and found to contain three zzso zzso zzso zzso a novel zzso the structural zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins zzso to zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins and zzso outer membrane zzso respectively, and are the first such genes to be characterized from zzso zzso in zzso expression directed by the zzso DNA zzso identified zzso zzso and zzso as approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which correlated with their predicted zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso were not expressed in the absence of zzso zzso extension analysis of zzso revealed two major zzso start sites located upstream of zzso zzso of zzso also initiated from the zzso promoter zzso zzso analysis of the zzso transcript for zzso predicted the formation of two stable zzso structures in the zzso region between zzso and zzso indicative of differential regulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso coli cells carrying the zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso DNA were unable to assemble distinguishable zzso zzso however, zzso zzso zzso were displayed on zzso coli clones containing a zzso DNA zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso genes make up part of a complex zzso zzso responsible for the expression and assembly of zzso zzso
