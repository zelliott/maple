The zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This putative zzso zzso was zzso expressed and structurally zzso The zzso A resolution X-ray crystal structure reported here revealed a zzso assembly with zzso zzso Each zzso contains a large zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso domain reminiscent of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which also exhibit a zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso exhibits numerous structural and sequence differences in the zzso domain that render it inactive with respect to zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso domain does indeed display zzso zzso activity, indicating that this gene product is a true zzso zzso zzso these results provide the first structural insights into a unique zzso zzso zzso that contains a zzso zzso zzso domain of unknown zzso
