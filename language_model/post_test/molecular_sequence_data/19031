Plants host at the contact zone with soil a distinctive zzso bacterial zzso believed to function in plant nutrition and zzso We investigated the diversity of the root zzso within a zzso framework of zzso three zzso zzso zzso along with its sister species zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso which zzso from the former zzso 35 zzso We surveyed their zzso under controlled environmental conditions and of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in two natural zzso Deep zzso zzso gene profiling of root and corresponding soil samples identified a total of 237 quantifiable bacterial zzso of which an average of 73 community members were enriched in zzso The composition of this root zzso depends more on interactions with the environment than with host zzso zzso species zzso diversity is largely quantitative and is greater between the three zzso species than the three zzso zzso zzso Host zzso zzso were identified at the levels of individual community members, zzso groups, and whole root zzso Most of these signatures were observed in the zzso distant zzso zzso However, the branching order of host zzso is zzso with zzso root zzso diversity, indicating that host zzso distance alone cannot explain root zzso zzso Our work reveals within 35 My of host divergence a largely zzso and zzso narrow root zzso which comprises stable community members belonging to the zzso zzso and zzso
