The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso locus was shown to zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and point zzso of zzso that affect the zzso nature of mature zzso engendered an zzso series of lines with zzso reductions in gene zzso zzso zzso abundance in zzso leaves was reduced zzso without significant effects on total zzso zzso This zzso in polar zzso composition disrupted the organization of zzso zzso into zzso zzso Total zzso abundance in zzso was strongly reduced in zzso zzso causing zzso defects and changes in starch production such that the normal simple zzso were replaced with compound zzso separated by zzso zzso Complete loss of zzso function in a zzso zzso caused kernel zzso zzso to failure in both zzso and zzso zzso The data demonstrate that zzso zzso with five double bonds serve functions in zzso zzso that are not replaced by the zzso species with six double zzso Furthermore, the data identify a function of zzso zzso in the development of starch zzso Finally, the specific changes in zzso composition suggest that zzso can distinguish the constituency of zzso groups on its zzso zzso based upon the degree of zzso
