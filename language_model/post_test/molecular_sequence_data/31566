With the advantage of replacing zzso and their zzso zzso have been applied to zzso the most common of which were zzso from random zzso displayed zzso zzso However, these zzso were limited by the zzso of the zzso zzso The aim of this study was to demonstrate that a variety of zzso can be obtained by constructing a second-generation zzso zzso Using zzso zzso A as a model system, a zzso zzso was isolated after panning the second-generation zzso zzso The half zzso concentration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso setup with this zzso was zzso zzso and the linear range was zzso zzso The zzso was also used to develop a qualitative zzso zzso with a zzso level of 1 zzso The method not only presents a high sensitivity but also contributes to the development of zzso zzso for zzso avoiding the need of zzso toxic zzso zzso
