zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso To test the zzso function of the two zzso hands, point zzso were introduced into either one or both zzso zzso After zzso the two zzso hands were distinguishable with respect to their regulatory zzso zzso of zzso hand I abolished completely the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso but zzso binding by zzso hand II was still observed in a zzso overlay zzso In contrast, after zzso of zzso hand II the zzso was still active and inhibited by zzso however, approximately zzso more zzso was necessary for zzso and zzso binding could not be detected in the overlay zzso These data indicate that zzso hand I has a low affinity for zzso and zzso hand II a high zzso zzso a regulatory function of zzso hand I in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso data is presented which allows us to distinguish two functions of the zzso hand zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso at the level of the zzso the zzso affinity of zzso hand I was increased by zzso hand II in a cooperative manner, and zzso at the level of the two zzso the zzso hands acted as an zzso switch for zzso in the neighboring zzso To corroborate in zzso observations in an in zzso system we tried to rescue the abnormal zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by introducing the zzso zzso zzso In agreement with the zzso data, only the zzso modified in zzso hand II could rescue the abnormal zzso Considering the fact that the active construct is zzso zzso because it requires zzso high zzso zzso for zzso it is interesting to note that an zzso zzso was able to rescue the zzso zzso
