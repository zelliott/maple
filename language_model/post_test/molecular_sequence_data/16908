The brain of all higher organisms has a modular zzso zzso of various tasks, such as learning, zzso or motor control is performed in specialized brain areas, characterized by zzso and molecular zzso To identify those genes that are transcribed in only one region of the insect brain, we chose two different approaches, differential display zzso and DNA array zzso with two different insect species, the desert locust zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of visual information zzso the zzso (the region of the brain where almost all zzso centers are zzso and the zzso zzso zzso required to control various peripheral zzso were compared in both types of zzso Both, the differential display zzso screen of the different parts of the locust brain as well as the DNA array screen of the zzso brain revealed almost identical numbers of transcripts exclusively present in either of the three zzso brain zzso Interestingly, the brain areas with the largest number of differential transcripts are the zzso zzso and not the zzso
