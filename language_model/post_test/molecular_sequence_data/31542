The human zzso family of DNA zzso zzso serves as a front-line intrinsic immune response to inhibit the replication of diverse zzso zzso and zzso are the most potent factors against zzso As a zzso zzso viral zzso factor zzso targets zzso for zzso zzso Here we report the crystal structure of the zzso domain in zzso and a novel zzso to assess zzso zzso Our results point to an zzso surface that is zzso in zzso as critical for zzso zzso in zzso zzso interactions likely mediate zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso reveals a straight zzso groove distinct from the zzso site, and an zzso zzso is proposed to explain DNA zzso zzso across the zzso zzso This study opens new lines of inquiry that will further our understanding of zzso zzso restriction and provides an accurate template for zzso development of zzso targeting the zzso zzso
