The plasma zzso inhibitor corresponding to zzso inhibitor zzso zzso in humans was isolated from sheep zzso zzso alpha zzso is of higher molecular weight zzso zzso than is human alpha zzso is resistant to chemical zzso by zzso and has poor zzso power compared with the corresponding inhibitor in zzso However, zzso alpha zzso is a potent zzso zzso Despite the differences indicated above, a partial zzso zzso to zzso exists between human and sheep alpha zzso at least as analyzed through the first 20 zzso of the sheep zzso The weak zzso capacity of sheep alpha zzso is paralleled by the low content of zzso in the sheep zzso zzso These important differences between sheep and human zzso and plasma zzso zzso should be borne in mind in designing experiments related to zzso zzso lung injury in the former zzso
