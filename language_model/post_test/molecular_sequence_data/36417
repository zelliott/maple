In isolated rat zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso in the zzso at a concentration zzso zzso which had little effect on muscle resting zzso In the absence of external zzso zzso still zzso increased zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso did not change the effects of zzso In zzso zzso with 100 zzso zzso 100 zzso zzso relaxed the muscle with an increase in zzso zzso An inhibitor of zzso oxide zzso 100 zzso zzso inhibited the zzso effect of zzso but not the increase in zzso zzso In the absence of the zzso or in the presence of an zzso of zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso the zzso increase in zzso zzso and relaxation of zzso contraction were zzso Under these conditions, zzso increased smooth muscle zzso and induced contraction, both of which were inhibited by an inhibitor of ETA zzso 3 zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso acts on zzso receptors in the vascular zzso to increase zzso by releasing zzso from storage sites and by opening zzso type zzso channels, activates zzso oxide zzso releases zzso oxide and zzso vascular smooth zzso Although zzso also activates ETA receptors in smooth muscle to induce contraction, this effect is overcome by the zzso effect zzso by zzso zzso
