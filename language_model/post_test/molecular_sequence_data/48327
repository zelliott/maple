The reduction potential of an electron transfer protein is one of its most important functional zzso Although the type of zzso site and the protein fold are the major zzso of the reduction potential of a zzso zzso its zzso acid sequence may tune the reduction potential as zzso Thus, zzso proteins can often be divided into different classes, with each class characterized by a biological function and a reduction zzso zzso zzso of the sequence zzso of the differences in the reduction potential between classes should change the reduction potential of a protein in one class to that of the other zzso Here, a procedure is presented that combines energetic and zzso analysis of zzso proteins to identify sequence zzso that are also good candidates for zzso zzso using the zzso and the zzso zzso proteins as zzso This procedure is designed to guide zzso zzso or more zzso expensive studies, such as molecular dynamics zzso To make the procedure more accessible to the general scientific community, it is being implemented into zzso a Web-based portal, with a library of density functional theory results for the zzso site that are used in the setting up of zzso zzso zzso calculations for the protein zzso
