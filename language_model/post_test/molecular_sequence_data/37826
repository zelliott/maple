The zzso zzso is a small zzso DNA zzso of potential therapeutic zzso Here, the zzso rates of 16 zzso of the zzso zzso were measured in the presence of different zzso metal zzso Despite the fact that zzso was originally selected in zzso for activity in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and Joyce, zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 94, zzso nearly all the zzso zzso exhibited substantially higher (up to zzso reaction rates in zzso as compared with zzso This preference for calcium zzso critically depended on the zzso zzso at two specific positions of the zzso zzso The zzso specificity of zzso is strongly reminiscent of the properties of zzso an zzso zzso zzso previously isolated by zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 35, zzso Indeed, analysis of the zzso sequence revealed the presence of a complete zzso zzso zzso with the zzso region of zzso An zzso zzso modeled after the zzso zzso region displayed zzso features comparable with those reported for the full-length zzso zzso
