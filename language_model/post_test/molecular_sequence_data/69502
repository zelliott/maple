This study compares the processing of zzso zzso at two zzso zzso sites, located in the zzso domain of the zzso one site marking the zzso zzso of zzso hormone zzso and the other in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso These comparisons were carried out by zzso monkey zzso zzso into two zzso cell zzso zzso which zzso expresses mouse zzso and zzso zzso which has been previously used as a host for zzso zzso These cells lines are known to process zzso differently at zzso zzso though less is known about their zzso zzso Our results have demonstrated both zzso and zzso factors controlling zzso zzso The zzso line appears not to perform either zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, on the other hand, fail to process the site at the zzso zzso of beta E zzso zzso but do process, to a significant extent, the zzso site to zzso That this differential processing is unlikely to be due to a zzso zzso which would make the beta E site zzso was demonstrated by mutating the sites from zzso to zzso With such zzso zzso zzso cells fully processed at both zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso sites were not fully processed by zzso zzso These results are discussed in terms of the complement of processing zzso expressed in each of the cell lines, as well as the role of zzso surrounding the zzso zzso sites in determining the likelihood of zzso
