zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that maintains zzso during cellular zzso Given previous findings that shorter length zzso of a zzso promoter region zzso zzso zzso are associated with increased zzso expression in cell lines, we hypothesized that shorter zzso would also be associated with increased levels of zzso zzso less inflammation and lower levels of zzso viral replication in human zzso virus zzso zzso Healthy donors zzso zzso zzso with shorter zzso repeats had higher zzso zzso transcript in peripheral blood zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The presence of fewer zzso repeats in subjects with zzso zzso disease was associated with higher zzso zzso levels in peripheral blood zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso similar observations were made in zzso zzso from zzso subjects zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso In African-Americans, but not zzso greater zzso repeats were correlated with higher soluble zzso levels during highly active zzso therapy zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso as well as higher mean viral load zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is associated with higher levels of zzso expression and that this zzso may have important effects on the association between inflammation and zzso zzso
