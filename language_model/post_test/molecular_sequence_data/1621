The envelope zzso zzso 120 and zzso of zzso play a crucial role in zzso zzso zzso binding and membrane zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is zzso in all strains of zzso and, as a part of the full zzso zzso behaves as zzso but as an individual zzso it is zzso When this zzso binds to its zzso it activates the fusion domain of zzso allowing viral entry into the host zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso domain and zzso zzso of the zzso domain was studied by zzso and MD zzso The studies were carried out in three varied zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso nature of the zzso domain zzso was investigated by zzso zzso experiments with model zzso prepared from zzso zzso The zzso was seen to exert a major effect on the structure of the two zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso had a type I zzso around the zzso zzso while in zzso a zzso structure spanning the region zzso to zzso was seen with the remaining part of the zzso in a random zzso zzso It is possible that the zzso may constitute an initiation site for the formation of the zzso In water at pH zzso the zzso adopted a zzso The zzso results for zzso zzso of zzso are conclusive of a zzso structure in zzso a zzso which may help in zzso into the zzso a notion also put forward by zzso The zzso zzso studies of zzso zzso with this zzso show its zzso nature, promoting fusion of zzso zzso to larger zzso like zzso zzso
