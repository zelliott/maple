We report the identification of a novel zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso which is zzso to the recently identified zzso core component of zzso zzso in zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso in live zzso zzso or zzso zzso cells and is functionally zzso since the zzso zzso gene can complement a deletion of the zzso gene in budding zzso Analysis of zzso during the zzso cell cycles of living zzso and budding zzso cells shows that this zzso and by implication zzso zzso remains localized with zzso material during zzso although the gross organization of zzso of zzso during zzso is different in a comparison of the two zzso During zzso in zzso zzso zzso trails segregating zzso while in zzso zzso the protein zzso alongside bulk zzso The pattern of segregation comparing zzso and zzso zzso zzso cells suggests that zzso is closely associated with the zzso during nuclear zzso
