zzso zzso zzso generate zzso and other zzso zzso to zzso and kill invading pathogens and zzso Due to the presumed zzso of these compounds, PO activity and its zzso zzso have to be regulated as a local, transient reaction against zzso in order to minimize damage to the host zzso and zzso We identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso sequence with its zzso 33 zzso similar to the housefly zzso inhibitor zzso The zzso zzso zzso into the zzso coli zzso space along with its fusion partner zzso was released by zzso shock and isolated by zzso affinity zzso Following zzso zzso and protein zzso the zzso was zzso to near zzso in a soluble form which inhibited zzso zzso PO at a high zzso We then produced the inhibitor using a modified zzso cell system and isolated the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso coupled with zzso zzso revealed that zzso only moderately increased its zzso zzso While this led us to speculate the role of zzso zzso we were unable to modify the zzso protein with zzso zzso or purify zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Instead, we isolated a zzso zzso compound which strongly inhibited zzso The wavelength of maximum zzso is zzso zzso for the zzso These data suggest that the zzso of PO activity in zzso zzso is achieved by two mechanisms at zzso
