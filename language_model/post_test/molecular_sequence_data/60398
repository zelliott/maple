It has recently been demonstrated that some members of the zzso protein family play an important role in signal zzso leading to cellular zzso We have previously shown that expression of zzso is induced by growth factors in human vascular smooth muscle cells zzso In this study, we cloned the human zzso of zzso and observed many potential zzso sites, suggesting the potential for zzso zzso In zzso treated with zzso growth factor zzso zzso protein was expressed and zzso in an zzso zzso zzso growth zzso zzso could be inhibited by zzso C zzso zzso compounds, and zzso could be zzso in the absence of zzso by compounds that activate zzso We also demonstrated interaction between zzso and several zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso implicating these zzso family zzso as the zzso responsible for zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso with the signal zzso protein zzso suggesting that zzso provides a link between this protein and zzso Thus, zzso may represent a signal zzso protein that is regulated zzso and zzso by growth zzso
