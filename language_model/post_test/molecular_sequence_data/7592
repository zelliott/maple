The zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso gene product, zzso host zzso zzso has zzso among five zzso zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso virus, and zzso zzso 1), suggesting a role for this protein in zzso A zzso virus, termed zzso which carries a nonsense zzso in the zzso open reading frame at zzso acid position zzso was zzso zzso and a zzso virus, zzso were characterized in zzso and tested for their ability to replicate in zzso and in zzso and to establish and reactivate from zzso in a mouse eye zzso As demonstrated by Western zzso zzso and Northern zzso zzso procedures, zzso encodes an appropriately truncated zzso protein and, as expected for a zzso zzso zzso fails to induce the degradation of cellular zzso zzso zzso The growth of zzso was not significantly altered in zzso growth zzso in zzso or mouse zzso cells but was impaired in zzso in zzso zzso and in brains of mice compared with the growth of zzso and zzso As a measure of establishment of zzso quantitative DNA zzso showed that the amount of viral DNA within zzso zzso zzso infected with zzso was reduced by approximately zzso compared with that in zzso zzso and by zzso compared with that in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies revealed a low zzso frequency for zzso (1 of 28 zzso or zzso compared with that for zzso zzso of 76, or zzso or zzso (13 of 20 or zzso Taken together, these results demonstrate that zzso represents a zzso of viral zzso
