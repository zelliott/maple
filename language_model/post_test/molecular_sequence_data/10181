For structural studies, high-level production of properly zzso zzso zzso protein in zzso coli is an attractive alternative to production in zzso zzso We describe here the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli as a zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso Two zzso one zzso zzso the zzso variable and constant zzso zzso alpha and C zzso of zzso zzso fused to an zzso zzso zzso sequence and the other zzso zzso the zzso variable and constant zzso zzso beta and C zzso fused to an zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso from a zzso zzso promoter as a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins formed proper zzso and zzso zzso bonds in the zzso bypassing the need for in zzso protein zzso zzso zzso sequences facilitated the formation of alpha beta zzso zzso was zzso by affinity zzso using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Typical yields of zzso protein were 4-5 zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso with a panel of zzso sensitive zzso zzso zzso consistent with its zzso integrity and appeared to be suitable for structural studies by X-ray zzso or zzso zzso
