We demonstrate that the zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso can be structurally reshaped in order to specifically complex zzso a steroid zzso commonly used for the zzso zzso of zzso 16 zzso acid zzso distributed across the four zzso which form the binding site of the zzso zzso were subjected to targeted random zzso From the resulting library the zzso zzso was obtained by combined use of zzso display and a zzso colony screening zzso followed by in zzso affinity zzso zzso possesses strong binding activity and high specificity for the zzso group, with a zzso of zzso zzso The zzso compound zzso is bound even more zzso with a zzso of zzso zzso whereas the steroid zzso zzso is not recognized at zzso Fusion proteins between zzso and alkaline zzso were constructed and shown to retain both the zzso function and zzso activity, irrespective of whether the zzso was fused to the N or the C zzso of the zzso protein zzso Our findings suggest that the zzso scaffold can be generally employed for the construction of specific zzso zzso so-called zzso which provide a promising alternative to zzso zzso zzso
