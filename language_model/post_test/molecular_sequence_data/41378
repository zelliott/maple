zzso sensing allows bacteria to sense and respond to changes in population zzso zzso zzso serve as zzso signals for many zzso and zzso zzso signaling is known to control cooperative zzso zzso activities vary from one species to zzso zzso controls a constellation of genes in the opportunistic pathogen zzso zzso which zzso in a number of zzso ranging from soil and water to animal zzso We hypothesized that there would be significant variation in zzso zzso among strains of zzso zzso isolated from different zzso and that differences in the zzso zzso might reveal insights about the ecology of zzso zzso As a test of our hypothesis we used zzso to identify zzso genes in seven zzso zzso zzso of diverse zzso Although our approach certainly overlooks some zzso genes we found a shared set of zzso zzso a core zzso gene set, and we identified zzso zzso sets of zzso zzso zzso accessory zzso Some zzso genes in some strains were not present in the zzso of other zzso We detected a correlation between traits zzso by some genes in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and the ecology of the zzso These findings indicate a role for zzso sensing in extension of the range of zzso in which a species can zzso This study also provides a framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms by which zzso systems operate, the evolutionary pressures by which they are zzso and their importance in disparate ecological zzso
