In the present work zzso previously identified as zzso zzso De zzso zzso zzso using zzso keys were investigated by molecular zzso The complete internal transcribed zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso DNA, and zzso region of the zzso DNA from zzso were amplified and zzso to examine the level of sequence variations and to explore the feasibility of using this region in the identification of this zzso zzso zzso located at the zzso of zzso and at the zzso of zzso zzso genes were used first, and amplified fragments were zzso zzso analyses showed no variation in zzso and zzso region while slight zzso variations involving zzso as well as deletions concentrated in the zzso zzso Based on the sequence analyses a zzso zzso of the zzso region followed by zzso analyses has been set up in the attempt to provide a rapid molecular diagnostic tool of zzso zzso
