For the rapid genetic analysis of zzso zzso virus zzso we developed a zzso mobility zzso zzso that zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso envelope gene spanning the third and fourth variable regions of the envelope surface protein coding zzso zzso sequences were successfully amplified from blood specimens from 98 naturally infected cats from Australia, Canada, Germany, Italy, South Africa, and the United zzso Eighty were clearly zzso to the A or B envelope sequence zzso Three belonged to zzso C, one was zzso infected with viruses harboring the A and B zzso zzso and several were zzso as zzso to any of the established zzso or as probable zzso zzso Some geographic zzso was zzso with zzso A and B found in greater frequency in the western and eastern regions of the United States, zzso zzso A, B, and C were found on more than one continent, and countries with more than two samples analyzed contained at least two zzso The broadest representation of zzso was found in zzso Germany, where three zzso and one virus that was not zzso by zzso were zzso Thirteen samples were selected for DNA sequence determination over the same region of zzso used for zzso Analysis of all available zzso zzso sequences from this and previous studies revealed the existence of zzso viruses generated from zzso zzso zzso and zzso envelope gene zzso zzso A zzso sequences were less diverse than zzso B zzso although both groups had zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso pattern giving rise to diversification in the two zzso zzso with the zzso A viruses showing half as many synonymous site zzso compared to zzso B yet showing similar levels of zzso site zzso These results are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso is an older virus group and is possibly more host adapted than zzso
