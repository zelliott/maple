The efficiencies of 32 zzso zzso 35 DNA zzso and 6 zzso to bind and cleave the full-length zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso I were zzso zzso screening of the zzso revealed that good accessibility of a putative zzso site for zzso zzso is a necessary but not a sufficient prerequisite for efficient DNA zzso zzso of DNA zzso and zzso against the same target sites zzso 1) DNA zzso were more active with longer recognition arms (9 zzso on either zzso whereas zzso revealed higher activities with shorter recognition arms (7 zzso on either zzso 2) It does not only depend on the target site but also on the zzso zzso whether a DNA zzso or a zzso is more zzso 3) The most efficient DNA zzso found in this study had an approximately zzso higher reaction rate, zzso and a zzso higher zzso under single turnover conditions compared with the fastest zzso DNA zzso as well as zzso showed significant activity under multiple turnover conditions, the DNA zzso again being more zzso We therefore conclude that DNA zzso are an zzso very stable and active alternative to zzso for the specific zzso of long zzso zzso
