We provide evidence that zzso A from zzso zzso acts as an zzso The zzso A gene isolated from zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso acids expressing a zzso zzso zzso masses of the native zzso identified from zzso or zzso were identical with the putative zzso acid sequence translated from the corresponding zzso zzso The zzso has a highly zzso zzso zzso region as previously described for zzso zzso zzso The Mr of the native zzso A was determined to be zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso zzso site was located between zzso and zzso The DNA zzso that encodes the processed zzso was subsequently cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The expressed protein exhibited zzso activity on gel activity zzso Analysis of zzso zzso using zzso confirmed the zzso characteristics of the zzso
