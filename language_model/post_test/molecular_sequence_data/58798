A zzso corresponding to the zzso sequence of the S protein from zzso B virus zzso has been previously shown to interact with zzso and promote zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Peterson, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 76, zzso The zzso of this putative fusion zzso has been zzso both at low and high zzso zzso by means of circular zzso and zzso infrared zzso zzso When the zzso is dissolved in zzso a significant population of zzso structure is found in spite of the zzso zzso at position zzso In contrast, this zzso zzso has a high tendency to form large zzso zzso in zzso zzso Most of these zzso can be eliminated by zzso The zzso remaining in the zzso adopts a zzso zzso The zzso can be zzso by the zzso zzso sodium zzso but the zzso still maintains an extended zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso the putative fusion zzso adopts a highly stable zzso zzso Thus, unlike the fusion peptides of other zzso an extended zzso seems to be the preferred structure when interacting with zzso Such a zzso should be responsible for its membrane zzso zzso
