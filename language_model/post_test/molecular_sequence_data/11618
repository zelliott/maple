The zzso zzso for production of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso consists of four steps including the formation of a zzso bond and an zzso zzso production genes were cloned from zzso DNA using zzso zzso zzso blocked at different steps of the zzso zzso Four genes corresponding to each of the zzso steps were found to be clustered in a DNA zzso of about 5 zzso zzso sequencing of a large zzso revealed the presence of ten open reading zzso including the four zzso genes and six genes with unknown zzso
