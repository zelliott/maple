The aim of this study was to analyze the internal transcribed zzso regions zzso of the of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene of four zzso of zzso zzso Three of four Thai strains were isolated from patients and one from the zzso All four strains were confirmed to be zzso zzso by zzso zzso using DNA extracted using a zzso DNA mini zzso The ITS lengths observed were zzso 85 zzso zzso 106 zzso and zzso 176 zzso Five discriminating zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used in this zzso zzso prominent bands were observed after zzso with each zzso 600 zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and 510 zzso with zzso and 310 zzso with zzso All sequences were compared with the Japanese zzso sequence in the zzso zzso After zzso our sequences contained only zzso variation from the zzso zzso The ITS main products of the strain from the environment were similar to those of the three strains from Thai zzso The four Thai strains have essentially the same zzso zzso genes as zzso Japanese zzso zzso zzso
