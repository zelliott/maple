Six zzso clones from zzso zzso whose expression is induced by water deficit and zzso treatment zzso zzso were identified and zzso The sequence analyses of the isolated clones suggest that they zzso two types of zzso abundant zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso heat shock protein zzso a zzso transfer protein zzso and two different zzso proteins zzso One of the putative zzso proteins identified zzso to a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso During the plant response to a mild water deficit zzso w zzso zzso zzso all genes identified present a zzso expression at around 16 or 24 h of treatment, followed by a decline in expression zzso zzso experiments revealed that those genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or maintain their expression when water is added to the soil after a zzso zzso This is not the case for the zzso genes whose transcripts rapidly decrease, reaching zzso levels a few hours after zzso (4 zzso Under water deficit and zzso treatments, the highest levels of expression for most of the genes occur in the zzso excluding the zzso gene whose maximum expression levels are found in the aerial regions of the zzso This indicates that for these zzso both water deficit and zzso expression are under zzso zzso The data presented here support the importance of these proteins during the plant response to water zzso
