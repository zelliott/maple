The zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to induce invasion and zzso in various zzso but the mechanisms by which it promotes zzso are poorly zzso Because the zzso zzso zzso is a known zzso of tumor cell invasion, we sought to determine whether and how zzso regulates zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso as determined by zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells with zzso and a zzso zzso zzso induced zzso zzso as well as cell zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso This was paralleled by an increase in zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso zzso invasion of zzso cells through zzso was zzso by the zzso zzso signaling zzso and could be inhibited with an zzso zzso The stimulation of zzso by zzso was paralleled by an increase in zzso zzso and zzso expression on the cell surface, which was also zzso by zzso zzso and was required for zzso zzso zzso induced and zzso both zzso and zzso on the cell zzso as evidenced by zzso zzso zzso and a protein binding zzso The zzso association of these two zzso as well as zzso invasion of zzso cells, could be blocked with a zzso zzso and with an zzso preventing binding of the zzso zzso domain to zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso expression and association of zzso with zzso and that the cell surface zzso of the zzso by the zzso promotes tumor cell zzso
