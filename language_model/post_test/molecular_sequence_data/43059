The class I zzso zzso zzso zzso interacts with the zzso and zzso stem of zzso zzso zzso hairpin zzso were designed to probe zzso stem and zzso zzso zzso A zzso pair zzso zzso derived from the zzso stem of zzso was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso stem zzso implicated the zzso base as a major identity element for zzso of the zzso zzso A second zzso zzso representing the zzso zzso competitively inhibited zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso zzso did not enhance zzso of the zzso stem zzso Thus, zzso of the zzso identity signal may require zzso continuity of the zzso chain to trigger efficient zzso
