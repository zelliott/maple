zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso was isolated from constructed zzso zzso zzso were curved zzso zzso zzso in diameter and zzso zzso zzso Despite being zzso a member of the zzso zzso zzso cells stained zzso at all growth zzso zzso zzso grew at zzso degrees C, with an optimum at zzso degrees C and no growth at 4 degrees C or below or at 42 degrees C or zzso The zzso degrees zzso range for growth was zzso with an optimum at zzso degrees zzso zzso and no growth was detected at or below pH zzso or at or above pH zzso The zzso range for growth was 0-3 % zzso 9 : zzso zzso zzso zzso as carbon and energy sources beef zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ethanol and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were reduced in the presence of zzso zzso zzso was not used as an electron zzso zzso zzso showed no indication of growth under zzso zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso : 1) and zzso : zzso The zzso DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis indicated that strain zzso fell into the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso as its closest zzso with a zzso published name zzso % zzso Based on molecular genetic evidence and zzso and zzso characters including differences in the DNA zzso content, we propose to place strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type strain of a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso
