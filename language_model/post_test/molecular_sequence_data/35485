The first step in many community ecology studies is to produce a species list from a sample of zzso Community ecologists now have two viable ways of producing a species list: zzso and zzso zzso In this study, we compared the zzso resolution gained by a combined use of both methods and tested whether a change in zzso resolution significantly impacted richness estimates for zzso zzso sampled from ten lakes in zzso National Park, zzso Across all lakes, 77 unique zzso were identified and zzso zzso were reliably identified to species using both zzso and zzso zzso Of the 32 identified to species, zzso zzso were identified solely by comparing the zzso sequence from zzso zzso I to the zzso of Life reference zzso The increased resolution using a combined identification approach compared to identifications based solely on zzso resulted in a significant increase in estimated richness within a lake at the order, family, zzso and species levels of zzso zzso Additionally, young or damaged individuals that could not be identified using zzso were identified using their zzso sequences to the zzso or species level on average zzso of the zzso Our results demonstrate that a combined identification approach improves accuracy of zzso zzso species lists in zzso lakes and subsequent estimates of zzso We encourage the use of zzso for identification purposes and specifically when zzso is insufficient, as in the case of damaged and early life stage specimens of zzso zzso
