zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso and zzso degrades zzso to produce zzso However, it is not clear how the expression of zzso is zzso In this study, the mechanism by which zzso expression is controlled in zzso zzso zzso was examined using a zzso made by the random zzso of a zzso zzso The zzso produced a larger amount of zzso than the wild type in zzso broth or a minimal salt zzso medium supplemented with zzso However, there was essentially no difference in the activity or amount of zzso in the culture zzso between the wild type and zzso when the two were grown on zzso The gene disrupted by the zzso of zzso zzso was cloned and its zzso sequence was zzso In a zzso search, zzso showed a high degree of similarity to genes for zzso zzso regulators of several zzso The introduction of zzso into the wild type and zzso grown on the three media described above decreased the amount of zzso These results indicated zzso to be involved in the repression of zzso in zzso zzso zzso A quantitative zzso analysis indicated that zzso levels corresponded with the activity detected and the amounts of zzso in the wild type and zzso Furthermore, the amount of zzso transcript was zzso zzso to the amount of zzso zzso In addition, the existence of a positive element acting on zzso expression was suggested, because in the zzso lacking zzso the amount of zzso transcript varied in cells grown in zzso zzso or zzso zzso Based on the above results, a model for the regulation of zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso is zzso
