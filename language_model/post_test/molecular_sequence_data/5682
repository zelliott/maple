zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso was used to identify genes zzso proteins of the zzso cassette zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso two genes zzso and zzso zzso proteins of the zzso cassette zzso were zzso One gene zzso was isolated from zzso zzso and is the apparent zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins of molecular weights zzso and zzso respectively, each containing 12 putative zzso regions and two zzso zzso These proteins are arranged in two zzso halves, each half consisting of a zzso region zzso six putative zzso zzso and an zzso zzso The zzso and zzso proteins bear a high degree of similarity to the zzso zzso zzso B resistance protein and to human zzso The second gene identified in zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein of molecular weight zzso containing four putative zzso zzso and an zzso binding zzso The zzso protein is similar to those zzso by zzso and zzso two zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso increased resistance to the zzso agent zzso zzso an zzso B zzso
