A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from zzso of water brine in Arctic zzso zzso The optimal growth of the new strain was observed at zzso degrees zzso the zzso and minimal growth temperatures were 37 degrees C and zzso degrees C, zzso The pH growth range was zzso to zzso zzso zzso and the range of medium zzso was 0 to 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The strain zzso did not produce acid from carbohydrates and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the sole carbon and energy zzso The major fatty acids of the cell wall at optimal growth temperature were zzso 7) and zzso zzso The G + C DNA content was zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequences showed that the studied strain was the closest zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso isolated from the Arctic zzso zzso zzso and zzso differences of the new zzso from closely related species lead to the conclusion that strain zzso belongs to a novel species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
