A gene zzso a zzso zzso designated zzso zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso gene is translated as a zzso consisting of a 94 zzso zzso and a 283 zzso mature zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that this zzso belonged to the zzso family, but could not be grouped into any of its six known zzso The mature zzso zzso has an unusually high content of charged zzso which are mainly distributed on the zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso formed inclusion bodies, but could be efficiently converted to the mature zzso when the inclusion bodies were dissolved in alkaline zzso The zzso underwent a zzso maturation process, wherein the zzso part (85 zzso of the zzso was zzso zzso and the remaining zzso zzso was further processed zzso zzso zzso exhibited optimal zzso activity at zzso degrees C and pH zzso The zzso was stable under zzso conditions zzso zzso and zzso could stabilize the zzso at lower pH zzso In addition, the zzso was not dependent on calcium for either maturation or zzso By zzso analysis, zzso zzso was found to be associated with spores, and could be extracted from the spores with 2 M zzso and alkaline buffers without damaging the coat layer, demonstrating that the zzso zzso is located on the surface of the spore zzso
