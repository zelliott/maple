zzso molecular dynamics simulations in a fully zzso zzso zzso have been performed on single zzso zzso from three putative zzso channel proteins zzso by zzso zzso (from influenza B), zzso (from influenza zzso and zzso (from zzso zzso stability is maintained within a core region of zzso 28 zzso for each zzso zzso zzso are due either to zzso interactions of zzso zzso with the zzso zzso or to the need of the zzso of short zzso to extend into the surrounding zzso environment in order to form zzso The requirement of both ends of a zzso to form favorable interactions with zzso zzso and/or water may also lead to tilting and/or zzso of a zzso zzso zzso that are generally viewed as poor zzso zzso in zzso solution zzso zzso zzso zzso do not destabilize zzso if located within a zzso that spans a zzso zzso However, zzso mismatch such that a zzso ends abruptly within the zzso core zzso the end of the zzso especially in the presence of zzso and Ala zzso zzso bonding of polar zzso with the zzso backbone and with one another occurs when such zzso are present within the zzso core, thus minimizing the energetic cost of burying such zzso
