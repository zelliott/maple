The zzso zzso transfer proteins zzso catalyze exchange of zzso zzso or zzso zzso between membrane zzso in zzso We find that zzso zzso zzso and zzso make up a set of rat zzso zzso zzso substitution of which zzso a dramatic reduction in the relative specific activity for zzso transfer activity without significant effect on PC transfer zzso zzso was of particular interest as it is a zzso zzso in a highly zzso consensus protein zzso C zzso motif in zzso zzso Replacement of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso effectively abolished zzso transfer capability but was essentially silent with respect to PC transfer zzso These findings identify zzso zzso that likely cooperate to form a zzso zzso zzso site or that lie adjacent to such a zzso Finally, the selective sensitivity of the zzso transfer activity of zzso to zzso of zzso suggests a mechanism for in zzso regulation of zzso zzso
