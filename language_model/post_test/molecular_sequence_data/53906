zzso zzso elements constitute a large family of zzso zzso that have been replicating and evolving in zzso for more than 100 zzso and now compose zzso or more of the DNA of some zzso Here, we investigated the evolutionary dynamics of the active human zzso zzso family and found that it arose approximately 4 zzso and subsequently differentiated into two major zzso zzso and zzso each of which contain additional zzso zzso which has not zzso been zzso is younger than zzso and now accounts for at least 50% of the zzso zzso Although zzso contains some active zzso the zzso zzso has replaced it as the zzso dominant zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso that contain zzso zzso are zzso for the presence or absence of the insert in human zzso as compared with zzso of the zzso that contain zzso zzso This value is zzso for zzso that contain zzso zzso which are the youngest subset of zzso and now account for about two thirds of the zzso zzso The successive emergence and amplification of distinct zzso zzso zzso shows that zzso evolution has been as active in recent human history as it has been found to be for zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso elements have been accumulating in humans at about the same rate per generation as recently evolved active zzso zzso zzso
