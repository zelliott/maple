We have used zzso analog interference mapping and zzso substitution to determine the effect of zzso substitution of each zzso in the VS zzso on the zzso zzso A large number of zzso zzso that contribute to zzso activity of the VS zzso were found distributed throughout the core of the zzso The locations of these zzso in the context of a recently developed zzso orientation model of the VS zzso suggest roles in zzso junction structure, zzso zzso internal loop structure and zzso The functional importance of three separate zzso supports the proposal that three zzso turns contribute to local and long-range zzso structure zzso A cluster of important zzso near the loop that is the candidate region for the active site and one very important zzso in the loop that contains the zzso site confirm the functional importance of these two zzso A cluster of important zzso lining the minor groove of zzso I and zzso II suggests that these regions of the backbone may play an important role in positioning zzso in the active structure of the zzso
