zzso zzso C is a zzso acid protein that binds to the von zzso zzso tumor zzso and to zzso A, the zzso active zzso of the zzso zzso II zzso factor, zzso It is zzso in zzso cells, as zzso have been identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein is thought to function as part of a zzso targeting zzso zzso yet the function in zzso has not been zzso In this report we examine the role of zzso C in zzso and establish that zzso zzso C may function in a mode distinct from its role as an zzso zzso The zzso is expressed zzso albeit at low zzso Two hybrid analyses demonstrate that zzso C in zzso interacts with a specific set of proteins that are involved in the stress zzso This suggests a novel role for zzso C and provides insights into additional potential functions in zzso zzso
