zzso of the expressed sequence tag database with the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence using the zzso zzso revealed two partial zzso fragments whose sequence information was then used to isolate by zzso a novel full-length human zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso termed zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that it zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso similar in size and zzso to zzso receptors followed by zzso zzso receptors but not other zzso zzso 51 expressed in zzso cells showed no specific binding for zzso and when expressed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso functional zzso showed no activity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis and in zzso zzso revealed that zzso 51 transcripts were predominantly expressed in the central nervous system with highest abundance in the cortex, thalamus, zzso amygdala, zzso and spinal zzso In contrast, zzso 51 zzso transcripts were almost not detected in the peripheral zzso Gene zzso 51 was localized by radiation hybrid mapping to zzso 9, zzso zzso from the zzso marker, and zzso to the zzso sensory zzso type 1 zzso
