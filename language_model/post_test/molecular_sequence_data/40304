Deciphering the electron transfer zzso characteristics of zzso zzso copper complexes is an important task in connection with the role they are assumed to play in Alzheimer's zzso A systematic analysis of this question with the example of the zzso zzso copper complex by means of its zzso zzso responses and of its zzso reactions with zzso fast electron exchanging zzso complexes revealed a quite peculiar zzso The reaction proceeds through a small fraction of the complex molecules in which the zzso complex is zzso so as the distances and angles in the coordination sphere to vary minimally upon electron transfer, thus involving a remarkably small reorganization energy zzso zzso This zzso mechanism and its consequences on the zzso should be taken into account for reactions involving zzso and hydrogen zzso that are considered to be important in Alzheimer's disease through the production of harmful zzso oxygen zzso
