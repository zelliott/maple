zzso is an economically important disease of zzso caused by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The disease is present in Africa and the Caribbean and there is a risk of spread to the Americas, particularly because of a clinically zzso carrier state in infected livestock and imported wild zzso The zzso agent is closely related zzso to the human and animal pathogens zzso zzso and zzso zzso A dominant immune response of infected animals or people is directed against variable outer membrane proteins of these agents known, in zzso zzso and zzso zzso to be zzso by zzso zzso zzso We zzso by sequence analysis, that zzso zzso the major outer membrane protein of zzso zzso is also zzso by a zzso zzso zzso Two members of the gene family are located in tandem in the zzso The upstream member, zzso is zzso zzso only 2 zzso acid zzso among six different zzso strains from diverse locations in Africa and the zzso In contrast, the downstream member, zzso contains variable and zzso regions between zzso Interestingly, zzso is more closely related in sequence to zzso of zzso zzso than to zzso of zzso zzso The regions that differ among zzso zzso and zzso zzso to previously identified variable sequences in outer membrane protein genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso These data suggest that diversity in these outer membrane proteins may arise by zzso among gene family members and offer a potential mechanism for persistence of infection in carrier zzso
