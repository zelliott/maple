In recent years, zzso have emerged as critical molecules in the regulation of microbial zzso In zzso the synthesis of complex zzso is important for the regulation of zzso but the role of zzso degradation in zzso zzso is not zzso Here, we isolated and characterized the zzso zzso C1 zzso gene from the zzso pathogen zzso zzso and showed that it encodes an zzso that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protects zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are encountered by the fungus in the zzso of activated zzso through a zzso zzso In an zzso mouse model, the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain is almost exclusively found zzso and in a zzso form, and its dissemination to the brain is remarkably reduced compared to that of control zzso Interestingly, the dissemination of the zzso zzso zzso strain to the brain is promptly restored in these mice when zzso zzso are zzso depleted or when infecting an zzso mouse in which zzso are not efficiently zzso These studies suggest that zzso plays a key role in protecting zzso zzso from the zzso environment of zzso whose zzso is important for preventing zzso dissemination of the zzso strain to the central nervous system and the development of zzso
