zzso zzso in zzso or zzso have been reported in zzso zzso Because the zzso zzso are dominant, it has been assumed that they are zzso in the affected zzso To test this, we have carefully examined the DNA sequencing zzso on 43 zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso to determine the ratio of the normal to zzso zzso Of the 43 zzso zzso tumors, we classified 26 as zzso zzso Eight cases were zzso Surprisingly, 9 cases appeared to contain an excess of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso on these 9 cases suggested the increased amount of the zzso zzso zzso was due to amplification (2 zzso or zzso 7 zzso (7 zzso We have previously described the presence of the zzso zzso zzso in 2 of 100 zzso zzso In this report, we have evaluated an additional 53 cases and found 1 additional case that contained the zzso zzso zzso of the DNA sequencing zzso from all 3 cases of zzso zzso melanoma suggests a selective loss of the normal zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso for zzso on these 3 zzso zzso tumors indicated that one showed slight amplification of the zzso gene and the other 2 were present in a zzso zzso zzso These results have important implications concerning the mechanism of zzso in melanoma as well as in the response of the tumor to zzso drugs targeting zzso or zzso
