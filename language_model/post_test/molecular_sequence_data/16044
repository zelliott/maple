zzso zzso cells from chicken zzso are induced to zzso after a long zzso following infection with zzso associated virus type 1, an avian zzso which does not carry a transforming zzso We have isolated from these zzso cells an acutely zzso zzso designated zzso which contains a novel zzso zzso sequencing showed that the zzso virus has zzso zzso zzso of cellular origin inserted between the gag and zzso genes of zzso This zzso designated zzso is zzso zzso to zzso zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso sharing zzso zzso with the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso with the zzso gene product is observed at the zzso and zzso portions of the zzso zzso zzso analysis of normal chicken DNA indicated that zzso is derived from a cellular gene distinct from zzso The zzso gene is transcribed through a major zzso greater than 10 zzso in zzso that is detected at much higher levels in zzso as compared to other embryonic zzso
