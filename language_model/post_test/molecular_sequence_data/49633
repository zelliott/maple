In this study we have cloned a novel member of mouse protein zzso zzso family, zzso which is composed of zzso zzso acids and has a unique zzso zzso The overall similarity of the zzso acid sequence between zzso and zzso was zzso On Northern zzso analysis zzso was found to be expressed specifically in the zzso germ zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells was able to associate with zzso zzso zzso 9 zzso and the association was enhanced by zzso of small zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso exhibits its specific role through its zzso recruitment to zzso
