zzso of zzso zzso is the most frequent genetic aberration in zzso chronic zzso leukemia zzso found in more than 50% of cases, indicating that this region contains a zzso involved in the development of zzso However, the zzso gene in the critical zzso region has not yet been zzso Here, we have cloned and characterized a novel zzso zzso located adjacent to the consensus deleted region, and overlapping the 3' end of zzso tail to zzso Human zzso encodes a putative 221 zzso acid zzso with significant conservation in zzso zzso and expression analysis in primary zzso samples failed to demonstrate any specific zzso in zzso but no zzso expression could be detected in zzso zzso zzso of a zzso island in the promoter region of zzso was further analyzed as a possible mechanism for the absence of zzso zzso and the promoter was found to be zzso in the majority of the zzso samples zzso
