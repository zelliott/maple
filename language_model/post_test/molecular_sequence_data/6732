The cloning and characterization of zzso a new zzso mobile element obtained from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso A zzso of zzso was found in a middle repetitive clone that shows variable zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso zzso and sequencing analyses have shown that most zzso copies are about 1 zzso long, are flanked by 12 zzso zzso terminal repeats and contain zzso repetitive regions on both sides of the zzso As with other elements of the zzso type zzso as the zzso zzso the zzso element generates 8 zzso direct zzso at the zzso zzso zzso region analysis has shown that the longer open reading frame found in zzso copies could zzso part of a zzso However, whether or not the 1 zzso copies of the element are actually the active zzso remains to be zzso zzso shows a very low copy number in zzso zzso a sibling species of zzso zzso An attempt to induce zzso hybrid zzso in hybrids of these two species has been zzso
