The genetic and molecular basis of zzso evolution is poorly zzso particularly in zzso zzso studies of the differences between naturally occurring zzso species have been limited by the expense and difficulty of raising large numbers of animals and the absence of molecular linkage maps for all but a handful of laboratory and zzso zzso We have developed a zzso linkage map for the zzso zzso zzso zzso an extensively studied zzso fish that has undergone rapid divergence and zzso since the melting of glaciers 15,000 years zzso Here we use this map to zzso the genetic basis of recently evolved changes in skeletal zzso and feeding zzso seen in the zzso and zzso zzso species from zzso Lake, British zzso zzso zzso in spine zzso zzso plate number, and zzso zzso number are controlled by genetic factors that map to independent zzso zzso Further study of these regions will help to define the number and type of genetic changes that zzso zzso diversification during zzso zzso
