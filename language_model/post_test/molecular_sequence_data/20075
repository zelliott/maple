zzso zzso zzso occurs in various plant organisms in response to environmental zzso To identify the signaling components involved in the regulation of Pro metabolism upon water stress in zzso zzso zzso a pharmacological approach was zzso The role of zzso zzso C zzso in Pro zzso was assessed by the use of the zzso zzso a commonly employed specific inhibitor of zzso zzso We found that zzso reduced zzso zzso transcript and protein as well as Pro levels in zzso zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso was zzso by measuring the decrease of zzso zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso calcium release zzso zzso suggested that zzso or its derivatives are essential for Pro zzso upon salt stress, involving calcium as a second zzso in zzso stress zzso This observation was further supported by a partial restoration of Pro zzso in zzso and zzso zzso after addition of zzso zzso or when calcium zzso was zzso by zzso acid, a blocker of plant type zzso calcium zzso Taken together, our data indicate that zzso signaling is a committed step in Pro zzso upon zzso but not in the case of zzso zzso zzso acts as a molecular switch to trigger downstream signaling zzso These results also demonstrated the specific involvement of zzso signaling zzso to discriminate between zzso and zzso zzso
