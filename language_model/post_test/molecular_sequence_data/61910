zzso zzso proteins contain a short zzso sequence that separates the zzso zzso from the downstream zzso zzso zzso This short zzso has been shown to play an important role in the assembly of human zzso virus type 1 zzso We have now extended this finding to the zzso zzso motif within the zzso protein of bovine zzso virus zzso zzso of this latter zzso sequence led to dramatic reductions in virus production, which was mainly attributed to the severely disrupted association of the zzso zzso with the plasma zzso as shown by the results of membrane zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso region for virus assembly zzso led to the identification of two key zzso zzso and zzso which are separated by three zzso zzso zzso zzso the same two zzso are present within the zzso zzso zzso region at positions 364 and 368 and have also been shown to be crucial for zzso zzso Regardless of this conservation between these two zzso the zzso zzso zzso could not be replaced by its zzso counterpart without decreasing virus production, as opposed to its successful replacement by the zzso zzso sequences from the zzso zzso such as zzso zzso virus zzso zzso infectious anemia virus and zzso virus, with the sequence from zzso showing the highest effectiveness in this zzso Taken together, these data suggest a pivotal role for the zzso zzso region in the assembly of zzso zzso however, the mechanism involved zzso may differ from that for the zzso zzso zzso
