Mouse kidney contains two zzso zzso zzso that show essentially the same properties except for their zzso zzso However, the structural differences and zzso roles of the two zzso remain zzso In this study, we have isolated zzso for the two zzso from a total zzso sample of mouse kidney by reverse zzso The identity of the zzso was confirmed by characterization of the zzso zzso that showed the same molecular zzso zzso values, pH zzso zzso specificity and inhibitor sensitivity as those of the zzso from mouse zzso We also found that the zzso zzso reduce precursors of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso at low zzso values of zzso zzso The two zzso belonged to the zzso zzso zzso family, and their zzso acid sequences differed only by five zzso zzso The sequences of the two zzso are identical to those of proteins that are predicted to be zzso in a gene for zzso in the database of the mouse zzso However, the zzso for the two zzso were expressed in mouse kidney and other zzso in which their expression levels were zzso The results indicate an important role of zzso in controlling the zzso of various steroid hormones in the mouse zzso and suggest the existence of two genes for the two zzso of the zzso
