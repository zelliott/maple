For this study, we used the zzso zzso zzso a zzso consisting of an zzso zzso zzso with three attached zzso zzso zzso The sugar units were removed and the zzso was zzso Two zzso stationary zzso zzso were prepared in a similar way, one with the native zzso zzso and the other with the zzso Twenty-six compounds were evaluated on the two zzso with seven zzso mobile zzso and two polar organic mobile zzso The compounds were 13 zzso acids or structurally related compounds (including zzso zzso acid, zzso and 13 other compounds (such as zzso zzso zzso The zzso results are given as the zzso zzso and resolution factors along with the peak efficiency and the zzso free energy difference corresponding to the separation of the two zzso The zzso of the two zzso are zzso It is clearly established that the zzso is responsible for the zzso of zzso zzso The difference in zzso free energy between the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso was between zzso and 1 zzso for zzso acid zzso This produced resolution factors zzso times higher with the zzso zzso Four non zzso acid compounds were separated only on the zzso zzso Six and five compounds were better separated on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Although the sugar units decrease the resolution of zzso acid zzso they can contribute significantly to the resolution of a number of non zzso acid zzso zzso
