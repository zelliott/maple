In an attempt to identify relationships among zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and closely related zzso species with which it can be successfully zzso repetitive DNA sequences were zzso zzso with zzso revealed two highly repetitive fragments of 140 zzso and 160 zzso The possibility that these sequences could be used as zzso markers was zzso Average sequences were determined for the 140 zzso and 160 zzso zzso families from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Average sequences (based upon four or five zzso were determined for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 140 zzso zzso family and the zzso zzso zzso zzso ex zzso 160 zzso zzso zzso The average sequences of the 160 zzso zzso families in zzso zzso and zzso zzso differ by only nine zzso The 140 zzso zzso families of the three related species, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are nearly zzso and thus likely represent a recent divergence from a common zzso or a common zzso Each repetitive sequence may contain internal zzso which probably zzso following amplification of the original zzso The 140 zzso zzso repeat probably evolved from the 160 zzso zzso repeat since the missing 18 zzso segment is part of the internal zzso that is otherwise zzso in the zzso zzso arrayed repetitive sequences in plants are likely to be composed of zzso which have been duplicated and zzso
