We have used zzso zzso and zzso zzso to determine the three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso zzso one of four protein zzso of zzso zzso P that shares a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso P is an essential and ubiquitous zzso zzso required for maturation of zzso In bacteria, the zzso zzso zzso is responsible for zzso the zzso zzso leader sequence of precursor zzso molecules zzso whereas the protein zzso assists in zzso zzso Although in bacteria the zzso P zzso consists of one large zzso zzso and one small protein zzso in zzso and zzso the zzso contains several zzso or zzso protein zzso each of which lacks sequence similarity to the bacterial zzso The functional role of the proteins is poorly zzso as is the increased complexity in comparison to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso has been directly implicated in zzso by the observation that it pairs with zzso zzso zzso to functionally zzso the zzso domain of the zzso zzso The protein adopts an zzso sandwich fold highly zzso to the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso Furthermore, the three-dimensional arrangement of zzso zzso structural elements is remarkably similar to that of the bacterial protein zzso zzso zzso have been used to map the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso The data presented permit tantalizing hypotheses regarding the role of this protein zzso shared by zzso and zzso zzso zzso
