zzso of a human zzso cell line zzso with the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso with subsequent serial passage results in the generation of a virus adapted to growth in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Kimura, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso To understand the basis of this adaptation, we zzso cloned zzso zzso from the adapted zzso The cloned zzso zzso consisted of essentially three species zzso zzso and zzso with rearranged regulatory zzso Two zzso sequences are present in the regulatory region of the parental virus zzso but one zzso from the origin of replication was commonly deleted in zzso zzso and zzso We showed that these regulatory regions were required for the efficient growth of zzso in zzso Various zzso strains should be zzso in zzso if their regulatory regions are replaced with those defined in this zzso Since it is difficult to zzso zzso in cells other than primary human fetal zzso cells, this system may be useful for structural and zzso studies of zzso
