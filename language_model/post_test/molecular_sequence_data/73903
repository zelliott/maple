zzso zzso sequences of the X region of more than 130 zzso B virus zzso zzso were determined and derived from patients with a variety of clinical zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso characteristics was zzso The X region zzso is crucial for the replication and expression of zzso because the X protein zzso the zzso genes and this region contains the core promoter, zzso II, and two direct zzso There are several zzso zzso some of which seem to relate to zzso zzso of the X zzso Two kinds of zzso which have important clinical zzso were zzso One is an zzso deletion between zzso zzso and zzso which zzso 20 zzso acids from the zzso zzso of the X zzso This deletion leads to the suppression of replication and expression of zzso DNA, resulting in zzso marker zzso zzso This silent zzso infection is responsible for the majority of zzso to zzso zzso The other zzso substituting T for C zzso zzso T for A zzso zzso and A for G zzso zzso seems to relate to zzso zzso Further sequencing studies and in zzso zzso experiments will clarify the significance of other zzso of the X zzso
