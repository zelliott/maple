Two human zzso clones that zzso different zzso zzso receptors have recently been zzso The zzso zzso type 1 zzso binds zzso only, whereas the zzso zzso type 2 zzso zzso designated zzso also binds growth regulated gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with high zzso In the process of screening a zzso library with these zzso to obtain large clones for use in zzso zzso studies, we isolated an zzso zzso zzso zzso that bears greatest similarity to zzso Using Southern zzso analysis of human zzso zzso zzso cell hybrid zzso with zzso zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso we assigned the three zzso to zzso 2; zzso in zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso preparations using zzso clones from each locus refined this zzso to zzso 2, band zzso for all zzso By virtue of their zzso location, zzso and zzso may be considered candidate genes for several human disorders in which the involved locus has been mapped to zzso zzso or that are associated with structural abnormalities of this segment, including van der zzso syndrome and the zzso diseases zzso and zzso zzso In addition, because this region of zzso zzso is zzso to zzso mouse zzso 1 in the segment containing the zzso locus involved in zzso host resistance to infection with zzso zzso examination for abnormalities of the zzso zzso of the zzso genes should be considered in mice affected by zzso of this zzso
