The zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso III zzso zzso which is zzso by the zzso zzso has been solved by molecular replacement to zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that plays a key role in the zzso of modified zzso by controlling flux to compounds such as vitamin zzso and zzso and zzso the transformation of zzso III into zzso The overall zzso of the zzso is similar to that of the zzso module of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and, as with the latter structures, zzso has the product zzso bound in the zzso The roles of a number of zzso within the zzso structure are discussed with respect to their conservation either across the broader family of zzso zzso zzso or within the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso were generated by zzso of the zzso zzso and tested for SAM binding and zzso zzso Of these zzso only zzso and zzso bound the zzso zzso zzso all the zzso were severely restricted in their capacity to zzso zzso although both the zzso and zzso zzso produced significant quantities of zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The activity of these zzso is interpreted with respect to the structure of the zzso
