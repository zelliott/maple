zzso potato zzso zzso zzso zzso was added to an in zzso zzso system containing zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso activated zzso the zzso although with less efficiency than did the zzso perfectly matched zzso zzso zzso In binding experiments, zzso transcripts of the intermediate strain of zzso were shown to specifically bind to a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso by a strain of zzso that results in severe symptoms in infected tomato plants was at least zzso that by the mild zzso zzso by a strain that results in intermediate symptoms was zzso similar to zzso by the severe zzso To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a differential effect of zzso strains inducing different levels of pathology on any zzso or zzso system zzso This differential effect suggests that zzso of a plant zzso zzso to zzso zzso protein zzso may represent the triggering event in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is surprising, because the primary structures of the mild and severe zzso strains analyzed differ by only a zzso inversion zzso in the lower portion of the zzso region of the zzso This change, according to zzso calculations, should have only a minor effect on the secondary structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso specifically binds to zzso
