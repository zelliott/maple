To determine the value of optical zzso zzso zzso as a diagnostic tool in the critical evaluation of zzso zzso seen in an zzso family with a novel zzso zzso 

zzso and zzso family zzso 

zzso family segregating zzso dominant zzso 

zzso examination included zzso visual zzso zzso zzso direct and indirect zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso analysis was carried out by direct sequencing of zzso zzso products and protein analysis by Western zzso 

zzso variable zzso was seen between 4 affected family zzso zzso differences between twin children suggested that this was due to modifier gene effects rather than zzso zzso segment zzso demonstrated a range of zzso angle abnormalities and zzso zzso in only 3, but zzso body zzso in all 4 affected zzso zzso segment zzso demonstrated zzso zzso zzso profiles in the 2 affected zzso Novel outer retinal changes were also seen, suggestive of a zzso zzso not previously recognized in zzso zzso disease zzso with a novel zzso zzso nonsense zzso with Western zzso analysis suggesting that this led to zzso of zzso zzso 

zzso zzso imaging allowed for a more detailed assessment of anterior and zzso segment disease in children and adults with zzso plus zzso This led to the identification of novel features and highlights a practical, zzso strategy well suited to zzso studies and the zzso management of zzso glaucoma in zzso
