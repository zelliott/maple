The zone of polarizing activity zzso is a region at the zzso margin of the limb bud that zzso zzso zzso when grafted to the anterior of a second zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso Sonic zzso related to the zzso segment polarity gene zzso which is expressed specifically in the zzso and in other regions of the zzso that is capable of polarizing limbs in zzso zzso zzso acid, which can convert anterior limb bud tissue into tissue with polarizing activity, zzso zzso Sonic zzso expression in the anterior limb zzso zzso cells that express Sonic zzso into anterior limb buds is sufficient to cause zzso limb zzso Like the zzso Sonic zzso expression leads to the zzso of zzso zzso Sonic zzso thus appears to function as the signal for zzso patterning in the zzso
