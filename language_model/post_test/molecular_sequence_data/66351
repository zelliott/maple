The zzso of the zzso wine zzso zzso zzso is a zzso mapping zzso of zzso zzso It contains 35 genes coding for the seven basic zzso of zzso zzso found in zzso (the genes zzso for zzso zzso zzso are zzso the zzso protein zzso two zzso and 25 zzso zzso Although protein zzso analysis showed a divergent zzso zzso several traits appeared zzso The zzso gene blocks between the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were maintained and changes in gene order and putative promoters were due to restricted zzso zzso New zzso hairpin elements were identified scattered throughout zzso zzso The large zzso zzso gene zzso the first zzso zzso containing a putative active reverse zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso analysis of the zzso protein confirmed its closer relationship to zzso zzso zzso while being only zzso related to all other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The findings point towards an early migration event of a zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
