Fifteen zzso clones were derived from zzso or zzso mice zzso with a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso 24 zzso zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso chain of zzso zzso influenza virus zzso All of the clones proliferated when the zzso was presented in association with zzso By using shorter zzso it was shown that the zzso response was focused predominantly on the region at the zzso end of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso to zzso Individual clones recognizing this region differed in their absolute requirements for zzso at the zzso of the site and also in their patterns of efficiency of recognition of shorter zzso One particular clone defined another site of zzso recognition within zzso 314 to zzso The response of the clones to zzso zzso identified certain zzso within the sites that were critical for recognition, with the substitution zzso having a differential effect on clones responding to the zzso zzso Only one of the clones responded well to influenza virus zzso This clone also required relatively low zzso of the parent zzso for optimum stimulation and was suppressed by higher zzso The data demonstrate striking zzso in the zzso response even to a short synthetic zzso with different zzso clones recognizing slightly different but overlapping areas of the zzso
