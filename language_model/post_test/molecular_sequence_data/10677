A new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is described that belongs to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which are characterized by three extra zzso between zzso 1 and zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed a novel type of alternative zzso within the zzso The alternative zzso occurs such that two different zzso can be generated, which differ in their first 25 zzso zzso zzso is an zzso of the zzso Meis genes and it shares a new zzso domain of 130 zzso acids with zzso A thorough analysis of all zzso zzso genes was performed and a new zzso is zzso Four zzso classes are identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso two types in zzso the mating type genes zzso and the zzso zzso and two types in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso class has a new zzso motif downstream of the zzso For the zzso class, a zzso domain, the zzso domain, was defined upstream of the zzso zzso of the zzso domain and the zzso domain shows significant sequence similarity revealing the existence of an zzso group of zzso genes that zzso two associated zzso zzso Thus zzso zzso genes were already present in the common zzso of plants, zzso and animals and represent a branch distinct from the typical zzso zzso
