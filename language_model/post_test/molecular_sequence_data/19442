To investigate the transforming growth factor zzso gene zzso zzso in Brazilian patients with zzso zzso and to evaluate the zzso correlation in these zzso 

A total of 11 unrelated families were zzso The diagnosis of zzso zzso was based on clinical and zzso zzso zzso DNA was extracted from peripheral blood zzso and zzso 4 and 12 of the zzso were amplified by zzso chain reaction followed by direct sequencing on both zzso 

Five different zzso in the zzso were found in the zzso We identified the following zzso lattice zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In three of the 11 studied families there was no zzso in zzso 4 and zzso 

This is the first report of zzso in the zzso in a series of Brazilian patients with zzso zzso The findings indicate that zzso screening should be considered in the diagnosis of zzso zzso
