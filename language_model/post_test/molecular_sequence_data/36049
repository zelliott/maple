The neural cell zzso zzso zzso has been strongly implicated in several aspects of neural zzso zzso zzso zzso has been proposed to involve a zzso interaction between zzso on adjacent zzso The zzso binding domain zzso is an zzso acid sequence within zzso and has been shown to be involved in zzso zzso zzso but the relationship of this domain to zzso segments zzso zzso zzso has not been zzso In the present study, a synthetic zzso corresponding to the zzso has been used as a zzso to determine its role in zzso zzso zzso A neural cell line expressing zzso zzso and its derived clone which does not express zzso zzso clone 3) zzso similarly to plates coated with zzso zzso A zzso zzso to zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso by only zzso a value not statistically different from zzso caused by zzso zzso Both these experiments suggested no direct zzso zzso To test whether the zzso zzso bound to cell surface zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis was inhibited using zzso After treatment, zzso cell zzso to the zzso zzso but not to control zzso was significantly zzso zzso cell zzso to the zzso zzso could be inhibited by zzso M zzso but not zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso caused dramatic reduction of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of zzso cells with zzso caused only modest reductions in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso with sodium zzso also decreased the zzso of zzso cells to the zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that, within the zzso system, the zzso zzso does not participate in zzso interactions but binds to cell surface zzso zzso zzso This interaction potentially represents an important mechanism of zzso zzso and further supports the view that zzso has multiple structurally independent binding zzso
