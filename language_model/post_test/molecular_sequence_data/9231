zzso is critical for the maintenance of tissue architecture due to its role in zzso zzso zzso zzso are the genetic cause of zzso zzso zzso Cancer zzso and zzso zzso represent a clinical burden, due to the uncertainty of their zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso most zzso lead to zzso although the zzso factor is unknown for the zzso We hypothesized that zzso could account for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and tested our hypothesis using in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to calculate the impact of each zzso in zzso zzso stability, and the analysis was zzso with evolutionary zzso by zzso Interestingly, zzso patients zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso present a younger age at diagnosis or death, suggesting that the loss of zzso stability of zzso accounts for the disease zzso To zzso the biological relevance of zzso zzso in zzso we investigated a group of newly identified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of which zzso is predicted to be zzso We show that this zzso is not functional in zzso exhibits shorter zzso and is unable to mature, due to premature zzso degradation, a zzso reverted by stabilization with the artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we report zzso structural models suitable to predict the impact of the majority of zzso zzso zzso and we show that zzso zzso leads to zzso in zzso and increased zzso in zzso
