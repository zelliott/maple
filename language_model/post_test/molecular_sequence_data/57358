The zzso sequence of a zzso of zzso base pairs of zzso zzso zzso II has been zzso The sequence contains three complete open reading zzso In addition to the already known gene zzso coding for a zzso shared by all three DNA directed zzso zzso two new open reading frames could be zzso zzso codes for a protein of 183 zzso acids with zzso to one of the proteins of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso can zzso but stop growing after five to seven cell divisions on zzso zzso with high zzso of zzso does promote zzso zzso codes for a protein of zzso zzso acids with zzso to zzso a zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso are not zzso
