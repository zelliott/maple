We describe a structural domain common to proteins related to human zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the sequence of zzso identified a domain near the zzso common to zzso and two other zzso proteins zzso and zzso which we term a zzso zzso This domain was also present in zzso zzso zzso and was found in all available zzso zzso (including zzso but not in the zzso zzso zzso nor in any zzso zzso Analysis of zzso alignments by the zzso likelihood ratio method gave evidence for strong zzso selection on all zzso of zzso zzso zzso potentially indicating zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso of the zzso family is zzso by the zzso zzso which is required for normal formation of zzso zzso To investigate function of the zzso domain, human zzso green fluorescent protein zzso and fragments including the zzso domain were expressed in zzso zzso Both whole zzso and the zzso domain showed zzso zzso with zzso In zzso both whole zzso zzso and zzso bound to zzso zzso using zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain in zzso cells blocked production of zzso a process that requires zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso domain binds zzso and represents a domain that evolved with the zzso
