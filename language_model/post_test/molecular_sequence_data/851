Fusion of the influenza virus envelope with the zzso membrane of host cells is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The most zzso region of zzso is at the zzso of the zzso zzso a relatively zzso sequence of zzso acids referred to as the fusion zzso This domain is critical both for setting the trigger for fusion and for zzso target zzso during the fusion zzso The zzso is set by zzso of the zzso precursor zzso when the zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso positions itself into the zzso interior and makes contacts with zzso zzso to generate a fusion competent neutral pH zzso This essentially zzso the zzso such that subsequent zzso of the zzso environment can induce the irreversible zzso changes that result in membrane zzso A key component of these zzso structural zzso involves the zzso of the fusion zzso from its buried position and its relocation to interact with the target zzso The role of the fusion zzso for both zzso the neutral pH structure and interacting with cellular zzso during the fusion process is zzso
