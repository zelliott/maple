zzso Y zzso has the potential to form two zzso secondary zzso a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and an zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso solution and forms stable zzso at the zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso zzso are stabilized at zzso Furthermore, the negative zzso zzso of zzso zzso at 222 zzso zzso degree zzso suggests that zzso interactions with the zzso zzso structure may stabilize the zzso in zzso zzso before it binds to cell surfaces, even at zzso zzso In order to investigate the role of these zzso structures, five zzso models with multiple zzso in positions zzso have been zzso and zzso Our data demonstrate that the zzso properties of zzso result from its potential to form zzso secondary and zzso structures and not from specific zzso acid sequences in this zzso However, specific zzso on the zzso face of the zzso zzso that have been zzso in the models appear to be required to reproduce the full potency of zzso in our pharmacological zzso A possible role for the zzso structures in zzso in presenting such specific zzso to cell surface receptors in the correct zzso is zzso
