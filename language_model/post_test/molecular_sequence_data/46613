The Shaker type zzso zzso zzso channel consists of four zzso zzso alpha zzso The channel expression and kinetic properties can be modulated by auxiliary zzso zzso beta zzso via formation of zzso zzso zzso beta zzso Because each zzso zzso could recruit more than one zzso beta zzso and different zzso beta zzso could potentially zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso complexes is therefore critical for understanding the functional regulation of Shaker type zzso zzso We expressed and zzso zzso beta 2 zzso in zzso insect zzso The zzso zzso beta 2, examined by atomic force and electron zzso techniques, is found predominately as a square-shaped zzso complex with side dimensions of 100 zzso 100 zzso and height of 51 zzso Thus, zzso beta 2 is capable of forming a zzso in the absence of zzso alpha zzso The center of the zzso beta 2 complex was observed to be the most heavily stained region, suggesting that this region could be part of an extended zzso structure connecting the inner mouth of the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso
