zzso zzso is a zzso species highly zzso for the zzso conservation of numerous zzso In zzso this fungus is sometimes isolated from grape berries where its presence may lead to the production of zzso a powerful earthy zzso which can impair grapes and wines zzso However, the discrimination of zzso zzso from related zzso is difficult because it is based on ambiguous zzso characters and/or expensive and time-consuming molecular zzso In this context, the complete sequences and secondary structures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were achieved and compared with those of two other zzso related zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The comparison has shown a high conservation in size and sequence of the core and of the variable zzso (more than zzso of zzso zzso of the four zzso arguing for a close zzso relationship between these four species of the zzso zzso Large (from 10 to 18 zzso zzso zzso sequences were evidenced in the zzso zzso and zzso variable zzso The size variations (10 to 18 zzso of the zzso zzso sequence allowed the distinction of the four zzso the zzso zzso (15 zzso was specifically recovered in zzso zzso the zzso zzso (16 zzso shared by the three zzso species, was lacking in zzso zzso A couple of zzso zzso zzso were defined to generate a zzso product containing the zzso to zzso variable zzso This product contained the two regions of the four zzso showing the highest rates of zzso zzso namely the V2 variable domain and, surprisingly, a zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso sequence was shown to specifically possess in zzso zzso a recognition site for the zzso restriction zzso zzso this zzso generates a zzso pattern of the zzso product with two bands zzso zzso zzso specific to zzso zzso and easily zzso by zzso gel zzso This leads to a zzso test usable for zzso zzso discrimination among grape berries isolated zzso zzso The zzso test was validated by a comparative analysis involving 29 strains belonging to 17 species currently isolated from grape berries in the Bordeaux zzso
