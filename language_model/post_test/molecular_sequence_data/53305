zzso is an exceptionally large protein zzso approximately 3 zzso that spans half the zzso in muscle, from the zzso to the zzso In the zzso it interacts with zzso zzso that are a principal component of the zzso linking zzso zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso involves repeating approximately 45 zzso acid sequences zzso near the zzso of zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso domain of zzso The zzso of zzso 7 zzso of zzso when zzso with the zzso acid zzso portion of zzso zzso was studied by zzso zzso zzso using zzso of zzso and found to be zzso over a stretch of 18 zzso Complex formation resulted in the protection of one site of preferential zzso of zzso at zzso as determined by limited zzso experiments coupled to mass zzso zzso zzso zzso show zzso of zzso to be positioned close in space to the backbone of zzso around zzso These observations suggest that the mode of binding of zzso to zzso is similar to that of zzso I to zzso C and of zzso zzso to zzso These complexes would appear to represent a general alternative binding mode of zzso zzso to target zzso
