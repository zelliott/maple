A zzso domain, zzso of the zzso inhibitor zzso possesses the structural feature of two zzso zzso connected by a short zzso In order to understand the structural requirements for zzso activity, two zzso each having the sequence corresponding to a single zzso structure of zzso were zzso and their zzso properties zzso One zzso zzso with the sequence zzso was active against almost all the bacterial strains zzso However, the zzso activity of zzso was reduced compared to the parent zzso zzso The other zzso zzso with the sequence zzso was only zzso zzso against zzso zzso A zzso zzso devoid of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso retained the zzso activity of zzso against most of the bacterial strains zzso Only zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were resistant to zzso Replacement of zzso 26 by zzso in zzso zzso improved the zzso zzso The zzso zzso retained the zzso activity of zzso toward zzso bacteria, but it was less active against zzso zzso The random zzso zzso was as zzso as zzso Moreover, the random zzso zzso in contrast to zzso a strong zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso of the zzso terminal zzso from zzso zzso strongly reduced the zzso potency of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso of zzso zzso increased the zzso potency of the peptides zzso We concluded that the order of the zzso acids in the sequence of the peptides is not, per se, a critical feature for zzso zzso zzso interaction between zzso and bacterial membrane is probably the most important feature involved in the zzso mechanism of the zzso zzso
