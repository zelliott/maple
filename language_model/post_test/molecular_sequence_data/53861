The recently proposed reorganization of the order zzso and description of new zzso are broadening our perception of this once narrowly defined zzso We have recovered four strains of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso representing zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which displayed zzso life cycles typical of members of the zzso One of these zzso strains was found zzso infecting an zzso isolate recovered from a case of zzso zzso in North America, with three others found in zzso recovered from environmental sources in North America zzso zzso and Europe (one zzso zzso of nearly full-length zzso zzso gene sequences of these zzso by neighbor joining, zzso and distance zzso methods revealed their zzso with other members of the zzso but in a lineage separate from those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso similarities, zzso and including the recently described species zzso zzso zzso similarities, zzso to zzso With sequence similarities to each other of zzso to zzso these four zzso of zzso zzso may represent three distinct species and, perhaps, new zzso within the recently proposed family zzso zzso labeled zzso zzso targeted to zzso zzso signature regions were able to readily differentiate two groups of zzso zzso which corresponded to two zzso zzso These results reveal significant zzso diversity occurring among the zzso in nontraditional host species and supports the existence of a large environmental zzso of related zzso Considering that all described species of zzso are known to be zzso further investigation of zzso zzso as zzso agents is zzso
