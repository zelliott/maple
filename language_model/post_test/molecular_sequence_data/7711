A zzso gene zzso nitrate zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso and zzso The structural gene comprises zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which showed a high degree of similarity to nitrate zzso from other zzso zzso The coding sequence is interrupted by six zzso varying in size from 48 to 98 zzso The zzso positions are all zzso among the zzso genes from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A zzso transformation system was developed for an industrial zzso zzso mold, zzso zzso zzso based on the nitrate zzso zzso of the nitrate zzso zzso
