zzso zzso is a zzso zzso capable of meeting its energy requirements by zzso and is thus an ideal system for studying the zzso of zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso exhibiting a zzso loss of the zzso electron transport zzso The corresponding zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and able to restore respiratory zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene results in a zzso zzso and reduced levels of respiratory protein zzso zzso added zzso can partially restore electron transport chain function to zzso zzso from the deletion zzso The zzso zzso sequence predicts a zzso of 307 zzso acids containing a zzso targeting zzso zzso is zzso identical to the zzso predicted by the zzso coli open reading frame, zzso zzso The zzso zzso when introduced into zzso coli, zzso the respiratory zzso of an zzso zzso that maps near zzso suggesting that it is the zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso We conclude that the zzso gene encodes the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
