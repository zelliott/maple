A zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso by zzso The zzso gene encodes a 72 zzso protein containing a putative zzso domain near its zzso and a zzso zzso domain near its zzso The zzso protein zzso on zzso zzso and zzso binds to activated zzso both in zzso and in zzso This binding is zzso through the zzso binding domain on zzso and the zzso domain on zzso zzso of an inactive zzso form of zzso gives rise to cells with markedly abnormal shape with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso does not, however, suppress zzso associated with zzso cells or the zzso defeat caused by zzso of zzso zzso zzso Gene disruption of zzso establishes that, like zzso zzso function is required for cell zzso In budding zzso zzso expression restores mating function to zzso cells and, in zzso zzso zzso of an inactive form of zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso protein is likely to be an zzso for zzso or a related zzso and suggest that zzso is involved in the maintenance of cell polarity and in zzso
