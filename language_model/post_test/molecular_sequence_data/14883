zzso zzso constitute the largest zzso of the Ras protein zzso zzso proteins regulate zzso zzso and zzso and display distinct binding preferences for zzso and zzso zzso many of which have not been zzso zzso The underlying molecular recognition zzso binding partner preferences and zzso are not well zzso 

Comparative analysis of the zzso acid sequences and the three-dimensional zzso and zzso molecular interaction fields of 62 human zzso proteins revealed a wide range of binding properties with large differences between some zzso zzso This analysis assists the functional zzso of zzso proteins 12, 14, 26, 37 and 41 and provided an explanation for the shared function of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso have very different zzso zzso indicating that they may bind to different zzso proteins and thus, exert different zzso The zzso V zzso zzso which are associated with zzso differ subtly in the interaction properties of their switch regions, and this may explain exchange factor specificity and exchange zzso 

We have zzso conservation of sequence and of molecular interaction fields to cluster and zzso the human zzso zzso The analysis of three zzso molecular interaction fields provides detailed insight that is not available from a zzso approach zzso Based on our results, we predict novel functions for some zzso proteins and provide insights into their divergent functions and the zzso of their binding partner zzso
