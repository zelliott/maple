The zzso complex zzso is a key structure of zzso zzso the stable pairing zzso of zzso zzso during zzso zzso Its remarkable zzso structure is zzso well zzso and can be found in almost all sexually zzso zzso However, comparison of the different SC protein components in the common zzso model organisms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed no sequence zzso This zzso challenged the hypothesis that the SC arose only once in zzso To pursue this matter we focused on the evolution of zzso and zzso the two major structural SC proteins of zzso zzso our comparative zzso and expression studies revealed that zzso and zzso are also components of the SC in the zzso zzso zzso In contrast to previous zzso we therefore conclude that zzso and zzso form zzso groups of zzso proteins across zzso
