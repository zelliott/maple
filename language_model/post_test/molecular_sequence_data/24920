A zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso which arose spontaneously on zzso 13, causes excess skin, increased body weight, and mild zzso zzso Fine gene mapping in this study indicated that zzso is tightly linked to patched zzso that encodes a zzso zzso protein for zzso zzso characterization of the zzso gene of the zzso zzso and an zzso test using a zzso knockout zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is caused by a deletion of the most zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso exhibit normal spinal zzso development as compared with zzso zzso which die around 10 zzso with severe neural tube zzso the zzso zzso domain lost in zzso zzso is zzso for zzso of zzso signaling in early zzso However, compound zzso of zzso and zzso zzso which survive up to birth and die zzso had increased body weight and exhibited abnormal zzso axis formation of the limb zzso These findings indicate that zzso is a negative regulator of body weight and zzso zzso of zzso signaling in the anterior zzso of the limb zzso and that the zzso zzso domain of zzso is involved in its repressive zzso
