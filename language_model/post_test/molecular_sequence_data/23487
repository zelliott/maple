zzso zzso type II zzso is characterized by inheritance of primary zzso zzso but, unlike zzso is not zzso zzso and not associated with the hybrid zzso gene zzso Analysis of two zzso previously demonstrated linkage of zzso with a locus at zzso zzso We sought to determine whether zzso in the zzso or zzso boundaries in zzso zzso protein zzso A regulatory zzso zzso which resides within the linked zzso are associated with zzso 

zzso enabling sequencing of all zzso and zzso boundaries were designed by zzso search using known zzso zzso and comparison with an zzso mouse zzso zzso from four affected and two unaffected subjects from an Australian family with zzso demonstrating linkage at zzso were compared with published zzso 

A probable zzso zzso sequence error, resulting in an zzso acid change, was zzso Two of seven single zzso zzso zzso identified were in zzso and five in zzso Neither zzso zzso resulted in an zzso acid zzso All zzso zzso were at least 16 zzso from the closest zzso boundary and therefore unlikely to interfere with gene zzso zzso none of the identified zzso was exclusively associated with affectation zzso 

zzso in the zzso or zzso boundaries of zzso do not appear to be responsible for zzso in this family, but a zzso in the promoter or remaining zzso or zzso or 3' untranslated regions could zzso zzso a zzso within another gene residing at the zzso locus may be zzso
