The gastric pathogen zzso zzso uses a type IV zzso system to inject the bacterial zzso protein into gastric zzso zzso Within the host cell, zzso becomes zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate here that zzso zzso zzso mediate zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso First, the zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso specifically blocks zzso zzso and zzso zzso thereby zzso the zzso zzso zzso of gastric zzso zzso Second, zzso is in zzso zzso by zzso expressed zzso Third, zzso zzso and zzso derived from zzso zzso but not zzso derived from zzso zzso and zzso cells zzso zzso in zzso Fourth, a zzso zzso fusion protein is zzso in zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Because a zzso fusion protein zzso in an zzso motif is not efficiently zzso in any of these zzso cells, the zzso zzso motif appears to constitute the major zzso zzso site zzso among zzso zzso zzso
