zzso zzso the final step in the synthesis of zzso zzso via the Kennedy zzso by the transfer of zzso from zzso to zzso zzso zzso an analogous reaction with zzso as the zzso donor for the synthesis of zzso zzso Together these two zzso activities determine both the site of synthesis and the fatty zzso composition of zzso and zzso zzso de zzso A human zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed and zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed one zzso zzso zzso transcript that was ubiquitous and not zzso with respect to zzso in any particular cell zzso The open reading frame predicts a protein zzso of 416 zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso Da containing seven zzso zzso A predicted zzso zzso resides within the active site of the zzso with the final two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso positioned within this zzso zzso was successfully expressed in a zzso active form in zzso zzso cells devoid of zzso zzso or zzso activities zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso displayed broad zzso zzso utilizing both zzso and zzso as zzso donors to a broad range of zzso resulting in the synthesis of both zzso and zzso In zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso efficiently incorporated both zzso zzso and zzso into zzso demonstrating that zzso has the ability to zzso both zzso and zzso containing zzso in zzso and in zzso
