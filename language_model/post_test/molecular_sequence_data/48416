zzso deer zzso zzso have different dietary preferences to other zzso and are tolerant to zzso zzso Because the rumen bacteria in domestic zzso deer have not been zzso zzso it is important to investigate its rumen bacterial population in order to understand its gut health and to improve the productivity of domestic zzso zzso 

The rumen bacterial diversity in domestic zzso deer zzso zzso fed oak zzso zzso zzso and corn zzso diets zzso zzso were zzso using zzso zzso gene libraries and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso Overall, 239 sequences were examined from the two groups, 139 clones from the OL group were assigned to 57 operational zzso units zzso and 100 sequences from the zzso group were divided into 50 zzso zzso sequences belonging to the zzso zzso were the dominant bacteria in both groups zzso OL and zzso zzso and sequences related to zzso zzso were present in both zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences were abundant in the OL group compared to those in the zzso group, while zzso zzso and zzso zzso sequences were prevalent in the zzso zzso zzso showed that bacterial communities clustered with respect to diets and the zzso zzso was the dominant bacteria in the rumen of domestic zzso zzso However, the distribution of zzso zzso from two groups was zzso In addition, other zzso bacteria, such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found in the rumen of domestic zzso zzso 

The rumen of domestic zzso deer zzso unique bacteria which may represent novel zzso The bacterial composition appeared to be affected by diet, and sequences related to zzso zzso may represent new species that may be related to the degradation of fiber biomass or zzso Moreover, the mechanism and biological functions of zzso zzso in the rumen ecosystem, and synergistic interactions with other zzso should be zzso
