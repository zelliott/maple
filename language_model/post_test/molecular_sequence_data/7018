A deletion zzso of human zzso zzso was produced in the zzso space of zzso coli and had full activity in an zzso cell proliferation zzso Libraries of random zzso acid zzso were constructed at each of 105 positions in the gene for zzso zzso eight zzso zzso at each position were produced in zzso shock zzso and screened for zzso 15 zzso were found with zzso of zzso greater than that of native zzso The majority of zzso acids in zzso could be zzso without substantial loss of zzso zzso of zzso predicted to be in the zzso core of the protein often resulted in reduced activity and/or low zzso zzso Only five zzso predicted to be on the surface of the protein were intolerant of substitution and hence are candidates for sites of interaction with the zzso We therefore propose that the majority of zzso in zzso serve a structural role and permit the display of a few key zzso in the correct zzso for recognition by the zzso
