The zzso zzso acid zzso zzso is densely distributed in the zzso brain and is primarily involved in zzso fast zzso synaptic zzso Recent studies in both zzso expression systems and cultured zzso have shown that the zzso zzso can be zzso on their zzso zzso zzso and zzso All zzso sites reside at zzso zzso or zzso on the zzso zzso zzso Several key protein zzso such as protein zzso A, protein zzso C, zzso protein zzso II, and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso family zzso are involved in the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso Other zzso receptors zzso receptors and zzso zzso zzso also regulate zzso receptors through a protein zzso zzso Emerging evidence shows that as a rapid and short-term zzso the dynamic protein zzso directly zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso trafficking and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso properties of the zzso zzso as well as zzso interactions between the zzso zzso zzso and various zzso interacting zzso These zzso zzso the major molecular mechanisms that ultimately affect many forms of synaptic zzso
