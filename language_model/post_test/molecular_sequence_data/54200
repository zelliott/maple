zzso specific resonance assignment constitutes an important step towards high-resolution structure determination of proteins by zzso and is aided by selective identification and assignment of zzso acid zzso The traditional approach to selective labeling yields only the chemical shifts of the particular zzso acid being selected and does not help in establishing a link between adjacent zzso along the zzso chain, which is important for sequential zzso An alternative approach is the method of zzso acid selective zzso or reverse zzso which involves selective zzso of specific zzso acid types against a zzso zzso labeled zzso Based on this method, we present a novel approach for sequential assignments in zzso The method involves a new zzso experiment named, zzso i zzso zzso zzso which aids in linking the zzso zzso of the selectively zzso zzso zzso and its zzso neighbor, zzso in zzso double and triple resonance zzso This leads to the assignment of a zzso segment from the knowledge of the zzso acid types of zzso zzso i and zzso thereby speeding up the sequential assignment zzso The method has the advantage of being relatively zzso zzso to zzso labeled protein and can be coupled with zzso synthesis and/or automated assignment zzso A detailed survey involving zzso of different zzso acid types individually or in pairs reveals that the proposed approach is also robust to zzso of zzso at zzso zzso Taken together, this study represents the first application of selective zzso for sequence specific resonance assignments and opens up new avenues to using this methodology in protein structural zzso
