Using a genetic selection for zzso of a zzso nonsense zzso in zzso we have isolated a G to A transition zzso at position zzso in the decoding region of zzso zzso This zzso displayed no zzso zzso suppressing zzso zzso and zzso nonsense zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso examination of a series of zzso at zzso and its zzso partner zzso revealed various effects on nonsense suppression and zzso zzso that prevented zzso base pairing between these zzso were observed to increase zzso and zzso However, double zzso that retained pairing potential produced an zzso or zzso zzso Previous studies of zzso resistance zzso and zzso and zzso zzso have placed zzso and zzso near the site of zzso zzso The results of this study demonstrate that the nature of the interaction of these two zzso influences the zzso of zzso zzso
