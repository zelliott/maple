zzso zzso levels and activities of zzso of zzso carbon metabolism zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alcohol zzso were determined in zzso continuous cultures of an industrial strain of zzso zzso at different dilution rates zzso ranging from zzso to zzso zzso The activity of most zzso measured remained constant over this range except for alcohol zzso zzso which decreased zzso with increasing dilution zzso A decrease in zzso activity occurred with increasing dilution rate but reached a minimum at D zzso zzso and from zzso remained zzso A decrease in zzso zzso activity and a slight decrease in zzso activity was zzso At D zzso zzso at the onset of the zzso effect, most zzso zzso remained constant except for zzso zzso and zzso zzso which increased at D zzso zzso and alcohol zzso zzso which zzso The zzso and zzso zzso levels obtained at the different dilution rates were in accordance with the activity zzso The zzso level of zzso decreased with increasing dilution rates, whereas the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but no significant change could be zzso These results indicate that there is no zzso or zzso regulation of zzso flux between D zzso zzso and zzso zzso except at the branch point between zzso and zzso metabolism zzso zzso zzso at D zzso zzso zzso regulation of the zzso effect does not seem to involve zzso regulation of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
