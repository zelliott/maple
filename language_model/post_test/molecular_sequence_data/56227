We have analyzed the structure of genes zzso the zzso cycle zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and their expression during zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA gel zzso zzso analyses of zzso and zzso clones indicated that there are approximately six zzso zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso that can be divided into at least two zzso based upon their divergence in zzso and 3' untranslated zzso We showed previously that zzso zzso zzso accumulates during late zzso and zzso Here, we present results which indicate that several zzso zzso genes are expressed at both stages of zzso First, zzso zzso were used to show that zzso zzso by representatives of both gene zzso accumulated in both late maturation stage zzso and in zzso of zzso zzso Second, a single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso together with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and 3' zzso regions, respectively, was expressed in both zzso and zzso of transgenic tobacco zzso The results indicated that zzso of zzso zzso in late zzso and zzso does not result from the alternate expression of distinct members of the gene zzso
