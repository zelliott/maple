Genes for the zzso that make plant cell wall zzso zzso remain to be zzso We report here the isolation of a complementary DNA zzso clone zzso one such zzso zzso zzso zzso that makes the zzso zzso backbone of zzso a zzso storage zzso in zzso seed zzso zzso The soybean zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso contained high levels of zzso activities that localized to zzso zzso zzso is closest to group A of the cellulose zzso zzso sequences from zzso and zzso Our results provide the zzso proof for the involvement of the zzso genes in zzso formation in zzso
