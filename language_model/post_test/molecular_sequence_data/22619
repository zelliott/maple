The inner core of zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso that can be decorated by zzso zzso zzso modification of zzso II zzso can occur at the 3, 6, or 7 zzso We used a zzso DNA sequence of zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso to search the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso and identified a zzso of zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso containing zzso was amplified from zzso zzso zzso and inserted into the zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso producing strain zzso LOS isolated from this strain lost the ability to bind zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of this zzso by genetic removal of the zzso zzso restored zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso analysis of LOS isolated from the zzso indicated that this strain contained two zzso modifications on its zzso zzso lacked a zzso modification on its zzso a finding consistent with the hypothesis that zzso encodes a protein zzso zzso addition onto zzso zzso The DNA zzso zzso was cloned into an expression zzso and zzso was zzso zzso zzso was able to mediate the addition of zzso to LOS isolated from zzso
