The zzso zzso factor is required for muscle satellite cell zzso and zzso of the zzso precursor zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso but is rapidly zzso during zzso Here we report that zzso and zzso are induced during zzso differentiation and zzso zzso by directly targeting its 3' untranslated region zzso zzso of either of these zzso in zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso of these zzso causes persistence of zzso protein and delays zzso A zzso form of zzso is sufficient to inhibit zzso Since both these zzso are induced by zzso and since zzso promotes the expression of zzso an inhibitor of zzso our results revealed a zzso switch that exists either in a zzso zzso state or a zzso zzso zzso
