zzso and deletion analyses of zzso class III small nuclear zzso genes transcribed by zzso zzso zzso III have defined three functional promoter zzso a zzso sequence element zzso at around zzso a zzso sequence element zzso at around zzso and a zzso box at around zzso Although binding studies have identified factors that bind to these sites in zzso it is not known exactly how proteins interact with the promoters of these genes in zzso In this study, we have used zzso zzso and zzso I treatment of zzso cells and zzso respectively, followed by zzso zzso chain reaction, to obtain in zzso zzso of proteins binding to the promoter of the Pol zzso zzso zzso Our results show that most of the zzso promoter elements of this gene are protected in zzso in these cells, and the pattern of zzso I protection suggests that a zzso lies between the zzso and the zzso zzso protection was also seen upstream of the zzso over a sequence corresponding to the binding site of a zzso zzso zzso zzso which interacts with components of zzso zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso structure plays a role in the cascade of zzso interactions that regulate expression of this pol zzso zzso
