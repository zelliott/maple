The zzso zzso zzso system of zzso coli resolves both zzso zzso and zzso of certain plasmids including those of zzso In this manner, zzso zzso zzso contributes to the accurate distribution of circular zzso at cell zzso Two related zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for this zzso The zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso were isolated from libraries of zzso zzso DNA by genetic zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso The putative proteins specified by the zzso zzso genes can substitute for and are highly zzso to the corresponding proteins in zzso zzso The distribution of zzso acid zzso zzso however, between pairs of zzso zzso zzso The immediate genetic contexts of equivalent zzso zzso zzso in zzso with genes of apparently unrelated function, are zzso between the two zzso This is the first description of the identification of a pair of functional zzso of the zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso
