zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso zzso is closely related to zzso zzso zzso Whether sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso acts directly on the zzso channel remains zzso We studied the effects of these compounds on zzso channel expressed in zzso zzso 

The coding sequence of a truncated form of mouse zzso zzso zzso number zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso into the zzso zzso zzso containing the correct zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was then subject to zzso zzso to generate the templates for in zzso zzso zzso The channel was expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso clamping was used to measure the effects of sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso channel zzso 

zzso zzso activated and zzso zzso and zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso did not have any significant effect on the zzso zzso 

zzso channel expressed in zzso zzso can be used as a pharmacological tool for the study of inward zzso zzso zzso
