New therapeutic targets for zzso reductions in energy zzso zzso or storage are crucial given the worldwide epidemic of zzso The gut microbial community zzso is essential for processing dietary zzso We found that zzso of adult zzso zzso zzso mice with a normal zzso harvested from the zzso zzso zzso of conventionally raised animals produces a zzso increase in body fat content and insulin resistance within 14 days despite reduced food zzso Studies of zzso and zzso mice revealed that the zzso promotes zzso of zzso from the gut zzso with resulting induction of de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso is selectively suppressed in the zzso zzso of normal mice by zzso Analysis of zzso and zzso normal and zzso knockout mice established that zzso is a circulating zzso zzso inhibitor and that its suppression is essential for the zzso deposition of zzso in zzso Studies of zzso animals indicate that these host responses do not require mature zzso Our findings suggest that the gut zzso is an important environmental factor that affects energy harvest from the diet and energy storage in the zzso Data zzso The sequences reported in this paper have been deposited in the zzso database zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
