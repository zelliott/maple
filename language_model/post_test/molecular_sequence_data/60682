The zzso protein from zzso zzso that was previously known as zzso protein I, or zzso protein I, has been shown to be zzso by a gene belonging to the major zzso gene zzso zzso of this gene in zzso coli yielded a zzso protein of which each zzso comprises 106 zzso and contains one zzso zzso The sequence of this protein is very similar to that of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and the four zzso zzso of the zzso cluster occur in the same zzso The zzso zzso protein differs from the zzso zzso one by the absence of the zzso zzso the presence of a zzso zzso extension, and a lesser number of zzso and polar zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso of the two zzso are nearly zzso These data show that the zzso zzso zzso protein I, which is therefore proposed to be designated zzso is the counterpart of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso The occurrence of the zzso gene in the zzso gene zzso together with the previous demonstration of a specific interaction between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso suggest that both proteins might be involved in nitrogen zzso with possibly similar zzso
