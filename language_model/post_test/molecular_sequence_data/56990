The gene zzso coding for a zzso zzso protein zzso was identified on a zzso zzso zzso cloned from zzso DNA of zzso zzso The cloned zzso zzso increased resistance against zzso and zzso C zzso to zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence revealed that zzso consists of 175 zzso acids zzso and has an zzso of zzso It shows zzso zzso sequence zzso with the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sequence preceding the gene contains three zzso Two of them overlap with a zzso zzso box, and the zzso one zzso with a second zzso box that zzso with the promoter of the adjacent zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso The zzso is transcribed in a direction opposite to that of zzso The sequence coding for the N zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso indicates that the first 74 zzso are identical to those of the zzso coli zzso The results suggest that the two bacterial zzso are members of a group which differs from the known zzso of zzso zzso zzso because their zzso sequence zzso with these proteins is only about zzso
