zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso removes zzso zzso after the zzso from zzso zzso Here I examined how the length of a zzso and the zzso on each side of the zzso site affected zzso zzso I performed in zzso zzso reactions of zzso with various zzso or various zzso zzso using zzso zzso from mouse zzso cells or pig zzso On the whole, the efficiency of zzso zzso by zzso zzso decreased as the zzso became longer, except in the case of a zzso composed of zzso zzso or zzso plus 1 or 2 zzso which was not able to be removed at zzso The distribution of zzso lengths deduced from zzso nuclear zzso zzso sequences reflects this property of zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso varied depending on the zzso zzso of a zzso in the order G approximately A zzso U zzso zzso This effect of the zzso zzso was independent of the zzso zzso The distribution of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso reflects this differential zzso zzso
