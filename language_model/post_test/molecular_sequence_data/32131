The history of repeated zzso or zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso complex was assessed from zzso zzso zzso The data suggest that four independent zzso zzso from the Pacific, gave rise to the current lineage diversity in the North zzso Unlike in many other prominent North Atlantic zzso zzso no evidence for zzso trans-Atlantic connections was found in the zzso zzso zzso The earliest branch of the zzso tree is represented by the zzso North American populations zzso zzso separated from the zzso zzso complex proper in the Early zzso at zzso The ensuing zzso zzso established the North European zzso zzso zzso which now prevails on the North Sea and northeast Atlantic zzso about two million years ago, and the currently northwest Atlantic zzso zzso lineage in the Canadian zzso in the Middle zzso The final zzso introduced a lineage that now prevails in a number of North European marginal seas and is still hardly distinguishable from North Pacific zzso zzso zzso zzso We used zzso simulation analyses to assess the age of the latest invasion from the Pacific to the northeast zzso The results zzso the hypothesis of recent, zzso zzso between northeast Pacific and the North European marginal seas in historical zzso Yet they also poorly fit the alternative hypotheses of an early zzso zzso invasion zzso 11 thousand years zzso or an invasion during the previous zzso zzso zzso thousand years zzso zzso time estimates rather fall in the Middle zzso before the Last zzso zzso in conflict with the conventional thinking of zzso zzso zzso an early zzso zzso may still be regarded as the most plausible zzso Today, the most recently invaded Pacific zzso lineage is found zzso with the earlier established European Atlantic zzso lineage in the Baltic Sea and in zzso Sea populations east of the zzso peninsula, and it is practically exclusive in the White and zzso zzso Yet zzso does not always constitute an unequivocal zzso marker at individual zzso the marginal populations represent hybrid swarms of the Atlantic and Pacific lineages in their nuclear zzso
