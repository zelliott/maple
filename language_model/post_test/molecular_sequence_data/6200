zzso for identifying zzso of various zzso bacteria by DNA zzso with random zzso zzso have been described zzso In these methods many zzso are screened and the zzso that generate the most zzso DNA pattern are zzso A new strategy that zzso the primer selection process for zzso zzso has been developed in our zzso In this approach, one or more zzso zzso is introduced into the core zzso primer sequence at various zzso zzso zzso show that a single zzso zzso in the primer sequence can significantly change the DNA profile obtained for the same zzso The more removed the zzso zzso is from the 3' end of the zzso the less dramatic is its effect on zzso zzso This method utilizing zzso zzso zzso zzso was tested on clinical zzso of zzso pneumoniae, and results were confirmed with zzso zzso zzso zzso obtained with zzso zzso were in total agreement with those obtained with zzso zzso zzso We propose that the use of a core zzso primer sequence with one or more zzso zzso at various positions can zzso the generation of unique DNA fingerprints individual zzso A general method for selecting the most useful zzso zzso zzso is zzso
