In the Eastern Mediterranean Sea, deep zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso contain zzso environments where zzso reduction is an important microbial zzso zzso The objective of this study was to characterize the zzso community in the brine and interface of the zzso zzso and zzso based on a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso community was diverse, except for the zzso brine of the zzso zzso The similarity of the zzso sequences between different environments was very low demonstrating that each environment had a unique zzso zzso zzso had zzso similarity to zzso sequences from zzso database and were mostly related to the zzso Each environment was dominated by a different family within the zzso except for the zzso zzso which was dominated by sequences related to the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso communities inhabiting the zzso and zzso zzso are highly diverse with low similarities to each other and contain a zzso species composition that is very different from zzso species compositions in previously studied zzso
