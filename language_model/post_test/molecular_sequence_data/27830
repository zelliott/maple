zzso of the human zzso BK virus zzso and zzso virus zzso were amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso by using a single pair of zzso zzso zzso that were complementary to the same regions of both zzso The sequences flanked by the zzso were unique for each virus and could be differentiated by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or by zzso with zzso The DNA fragments resulting from amplification of zzso and zzso were 176 and 173 zzso pairs, zzso The sensitivities of zzso for amplification of cloned zzso and zzso zzso were 10 and 100 copies, zzso zzso with the zzso zzso was specific for each zzso A total of 57 urine samples from three groups of subjects were processed by DNA extraction or boiling and were tested by zzso zzso samples collected from zzso patients zzso zzso zzso and previously documented to be positive for zzso zzso or both were positive by zzso Ten percent of urine samples from healthy adults zzso zzso 30) that were previously negative for zzso and zzso were positive for one or both viruses by zzso zzso samples zzso zzso zzso from four zzso bone zzso transplant recipients were zzso negative for zzso zzso was detected in zzso brain tissue from a patient with progressive zzso zzso zzso diagnosis of virus in clinical specimens could be made within 1 day of zzso of the zzso The zzso method is attractive for use in diagnosing zzso infections because of its sensitivity, zzso and rapid turnaround zzso
