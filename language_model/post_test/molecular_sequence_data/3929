The activity of zzso proteins is regulated by accessory zzso which include members of the zzso protein zzso zzso by the presence of a highly zzso zzso acid J domain, zzso zzso activate the zzso activity of zzso proteins and stabilize their interaction with unfolded zzso zzso zzso have been identified in most zzso where they are involved in nearly all aspects of protein synthesis and zzso Within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have also been shown to assist in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso degradation zzso of zzso zzso zzso By using zzso methods, we identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso It is the first zzso type II zzso zzso to be zzso The signal sequence of zzso remains zzso and serves as a membrane anchor, zzso its J domain into the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso and associated with zzso in zzso when they were zzso in zzso zzso In zzso experiments demonstrated that the J domain of zzso zzso the zzso activity of zzso in a zzso zzso However, zzso of the hallmark zzso zzso (His zzso zzso in the J domain totally abolished this zzso zzso zzso expression was detected in all human zzso examined but showed the highest level of the expression in the liver, zzso and zzso We found that zzso was highly induced at both the zzso and protein level in response to zzso stress, indicating that this protein might be involved in either protein folding or zzso zzso
