zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at a relatively high rate and can zzso many tightly bound zzso zzso Despite these properties, zzso of the stability of stalled zzso complexes have shown lifetimes that are much shorter than those of the zzso zzso zzso In this work, we demonstrate that the apparent instability of stalled complexes actually arises from the action of trailing zzso zzso zzso in the same zzso zzso the stalled zzso Moreover, the instability caused by collision between two zzso is position zzso A second zzso is blocked from promoter binding when a leading complex is stalled 12 zzso or less from the zzso The trailing complex can bind and make zzso transcripts when the leading complex is between 12 and 20 zzso from the promoter, but it cannot zzso the first complex since it is in a unstable initiation zzso Only when the leading complex is stalled more than 20 zzso away from the promoter can a second zzso zzso zzso and zzso the leading zzso
