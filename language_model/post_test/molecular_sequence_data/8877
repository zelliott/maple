Previously, we explored the epidemic pattern and molecular characterization of zzso zzso isolated in zzso Korea in 2008, and the present study extended these observations to 2009 and zzso In Korea, zzso showed the seasonal prevalence from late fall to spring, and widely detected in preschool children and peoples over 60 years of zzso zzso pattern of zzso was similar in 2008 and in 2010, but pattern in 2009 was affected by pandemic influenza zzso 2009 zzso zzso samples were subjected to sequence determination of the zzso gene region, which resolved the isolated zzso into five zzso zzso 6, 7, 9 and 10) and zzso zzso zzso zzso 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 12, 13, 16 and zzso The most prevalent zzso was zzso and occupied 130 out of 211 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of prevalent zzso in these periods with reference strains of the same zzso was conducted to genetic analysis by a zzso zzso The zzso zzso strains were zzso into seven distinct genetic groups, which are supported by high zzso values and previously reported zzso All Korean zzso zzso strains belonged to either VI cluster or zzso zzso The divergence of zzso sequences within VI and zzso zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso strain which was isolated in June 2010 was a zzso that did not belong to cluster VI or zzso and showed zzso zzso zzso divergence with cluster VI and zzso zzso
