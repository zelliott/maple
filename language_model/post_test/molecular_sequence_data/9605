The specific targeting of protein surface functional groups remains a largely unexplored aspect in molecular zzso In this study, a series of zzso zzso peptides serve as models for the recognition of zzso pairs in zzso A zzso is described that contains two zzso groups separated by 4-5 A by a rigid zzso zzso Modeling studies indicate that such a zzso would be suitable for binding with two zzso zzso when the zzso acids are separated by two zzso + 3) or three zzso + 4) other zzso acids in an zzso zzso Studies employing circular zzso zzso demonstrated that the addition of the zzso to the i + 3 zzso zzso caused a zzso enhancement of zzso structure in zzso zzso at 25 degrees zzso Other zzso peptides zzso + 1), zzso + zzso zzso + zzso zzso + zzso showed lower zzso zzso zzso but weaker binding and zzso induction were observed under zzso conditions (10 zzso zzso pH zzso These results, along with studies employing a series of related zzso zzso suggest a zzso binding model composed of specific hydrogen interactions between each zzso zzso with each zzso zzso when the zzso adopts a zzso zzso
