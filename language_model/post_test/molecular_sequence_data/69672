A total of 5 zzso zzso receptors have been zzso zzso and zzso into various cell types which have recently been used to discern zzso zzso displaying high degrees of selectivity for binding to types 2, 3, and zzso These have now allowed us to examine which zzso is involved in SS zzso of zzso rat pancreatic insulin zzso The type 4 selective zzso zzso which had little affinity for zzso types 1, 2, or 5, was at least zzso to SS in preventing insulin zzso In contrast, the type 3 selective zzso zzso was totally devoid of zzso zzso zzso such as zzso which have extremely high affinity for type 2 receptors but far less for types 1, 3, 4 and 5, were considerably less potent than SS in this zzso Thus, 2 major zzso zzso functions of SS on zzso zzso 2) and insulin release appear to be zzso by entirely different zzso zzso
