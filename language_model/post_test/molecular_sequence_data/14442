A novel zzso strain, designated CW zzso was isolated from a zzso forest soil sample in zzso Province, zzso zzso were strictly zzso zzso bent zzso The strain grew zzso at zzso zzso and pH zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso respiratory zzso was zzso with zzso present as a minor zzso The polar zzso composition of strain CW zzso consisted of zzso zzso zzso two zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained zzso zzso zzso and zzso the major zzso acids of the zzso were zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that CW zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and grouped with members of the species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarities of CW zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CW zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of the isolate showed zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with its four closest zzso The zzso relationships of strains zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso were further clarified by means of a direct experimental zzso results showed that strains zzso and zzso showed the same major fatty acid, polar zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso sugar and respiratory zzso compositions as members of the zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso and zzso analysis, it is proposed that: strain CW zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with CW zzso zzso AB zzso zzso as the type zzso and the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso should be reclassified as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is zzso
