An zzso zzso zzso bottom halves of zzso induction of zzso zzso by zzso was analyzed in zzso shoot zzso Total zzso and zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso and two zzso zzso corresponding to two zzso zzso acid sequences zzso and zzso found in zzso from other species, were used for the zzso chain reaction zzso A partial length zzso zzso zzso was obtained and zzso A zzso zzso sequence zzso and zzso deduced zzso acid sequence zzso as compared to zzso of carrot cell wall, was zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that there was an obviously transient induction of zzso zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso was rapidly induced to a maximum level at 1 h after zzso treatment and gradually decreased zzso The zzso level in the bottom half of the zzso zzso was significantly higher than that in the top half of the zzso zzso The kinetic induction of zzso zzso was consistent with the transient zzso of zzso activity during the zzso of the zzso This indicates that the expression of the zzso zzso could be regulated by zzso at the zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that there were two to three zzso DNA fragments which zzso with the zzso zzso zzso
