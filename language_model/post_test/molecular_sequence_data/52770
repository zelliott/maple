zzso the human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso zzso is known to interact with the tumor zzso protein zzso and the human zzso E6 transforming zzso In a zzso screen, we identified a zzso zzso zzso that binds to the zzso domain of zzso The zzso for this zzso zzso or zzso is most abundant in zzso and absent from adult brain zzso The protein sequence of zzso has all the characteristic protein zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso binds specifically to zzso of zzso through its zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso at zzso in zzso cells, and the zzso zzso of zzso is required for its zzso zzso In zzso zzso B zzso zzso This evidence shows how zzso could link zzso or other zzso proteins to signal zzso pathways regulating the cell cycle or cellular zzso
