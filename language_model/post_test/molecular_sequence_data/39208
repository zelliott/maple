zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of an zzso open reading frame zzso a protein of 295 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso Analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence showed that zzso acid zzso important for zzso activity and the metal binding zzso zzso in all of zzso zzso zzso were also zzso and belonged to type zzso zzso The zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso was a zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso (K zzso zzso zzso zzso occurred at pH zzso and 80 to 90 degrees zzso The zzso was very unstable compared to zzso zzso zzso which was completely zzso by heating at 80 degrees C for 5 zzso It seemed likely that the zzso zzso zzso played a critical role in regulating the zzso of zzso
