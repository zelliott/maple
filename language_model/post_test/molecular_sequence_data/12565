zzso zzso zzso protein functions in the incision step of the zzso zzso repair of DNA damaged by ultraviolet zzso zzso was previously shown to act zzso on circular zzso zzso DNA and also to have a zzso zzso activity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using two different zzso DNA structures, zzso Y and zzso we have determined that zzso specifically zzso the zzso single strand in these zzso zzso zzso is more active on the zzso structure than on the zzso Y zzso zzso also acts on a bubble structure that contains an zzso region of 14 zzso but with a lower efficiency than on the zzso Y or zzso zzso The incision points occur at and around the single zzso junction in the three classes of DNA zzso
