The zzso chain reaction zzso is widely used as a diagnostic tool in clinical laboratories and is particularly effective for detecting and identifying infectious agents for which routine culture and zzso methods are zzso zzso zzso disease zzso is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in zzso patients, and optimal diagnostic criteria are zzso Although zzso methods have long been used for the diagnosis of invasive zzso zzso variable performance in clinical practice has limited their zzso This shortcoming is a consequence of differing sample selection, collection and preparation protocols coupled with a lack of zzso of the zzso zzso Furthermore, it has become clear that the performance of zzso zzso in general is compromised by the zzso of experimental controls, insufficient zzso of zzso performance as well as lack of transparency in reporting experimental zzso The recently published zzso Information for the publication of real-time zzso zzso zzso zzso guidelines provide a blueprint for good zzso zzso design and zzso reporting of experimental detail and zzso We report the first real-time quantitative zzso zzso zzso targeting zzso species that has been zzso zzso and validated in strict compliance with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso designed to target the zzso zzso DNA sequence of zzso species, has an efficiency of zzso zzso zzso a dynamic range of at least six orders of magnitude and limits of zzso and detection of 6 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It does not amplify zzso zzso zzso or zzso species and its clinical sensitivity is demonstrated in zzso material from proven zzso cases, as well as zzso zzso and zzso data in matched zzso zzso and blood zzso The zzso specificity and sensitivity of this zzso make it an ideal molecular diagnostic tool for clinical zzso
