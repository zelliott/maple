zzso as well as zzso and spatial regulation of the cell cycle play a key role in plant zzso Here, we investigated the function and regulation of an alfalfa zzso zzso zzso zzso in three distinct root zzso zzso in primary and secondary root development, zzso development, and zzso zzso zzso Using transgenic plants carrying the zzso zzso gene fusion, in combination with other techniques, zzso expression was localized in zzso and zzso cells in the lateral root and zzso zzso Rapid induction of zzso by zzso factors demonstrated that this gene is implicated in cell cycle zzso of differentiated cells developing to zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso cells both during zzso development and formation of giant cells in zzso zzso indicating that zzso was zzso for zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso in transgenic plants corresponded to wild type protein levels and had no apparent zzso In contrast, zzso expression of zzso halted zzso of zzso zzso suggesting a role for zzso in the formation or activity of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso by zzso as expected from the presence of zzso response elements in the zzso Moreover, zzso also affected the spatial expression pattern of this zzso by shifting the zzso expression from the zzso to the zzso zzso
