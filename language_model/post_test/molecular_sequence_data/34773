Nuclear zzso effect zzso distance restraints are the main experimental data from protein nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso for computing a complete three zzso solution structure including zzso zzso In general, zzso restraints must be assigned before they can be used in a structure determination zzso zzso assignment is very time-consuming to do zzso challenging to fully zzso and has become a key bottleneck for zzso zzso structure zzso The difficulty in automated zzso assignment is zzso there can be tens of possible different assignments for an zzso peak based solely on its chemical zzso Previous automated zzso assignment approaches rely on an ensemble of structures, zzso from a subset of all the zzso to zzso filter ambiguous zzso These zzso are zzso in nature, provide no guarantees on solution quality or running time, and are slow in zzso In this paper we present an accurate, efficient zzso assignment zzso The zzso first zzso the zzso in zzso zzso to zzso an accurate backbone structure using only two backbone residual zzso zzso zzso per zzso The zzso then filters ambiguous zzso assignments by merging an ensemble of zzso zzso from a protein zzso database, together with zzso zzso from the zzso backbone zzso The protein zzso database was built from zzso resolution structures zzso zzso in the zzso Data Bank zzso The zzso has been successfully applied to assign more than 1,700 zzso distance restraints with better than zzso accuracy on the protein human zzso using real zzso zzso zzso The zzso assigns these zzso restraints in less than one second on a zzso zzso
