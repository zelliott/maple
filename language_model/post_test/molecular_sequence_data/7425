A nuclear factor zzso has previously been identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso suspension cell nuclear extracts that binds in zzso to three zzso zzso elements zzso boxes I, II, and III, zzso to zzso in the zzso region of the bean zzso zzso zzso gene zzso To define the functional role of the three zzso boxes in development, we examined transgenic tobacco plants carrying a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso activity by zzso zzso We show that the zzso promoter deleted to position zzso and lacking all three zzso boxes directs the same qualitative pattern of expression in initiating lateral roots and in developing seeds as the full length promoter zzso Thus, zzso of expression in these zzso is zzso by sequence elements located downstream of the three zzso zzso However, specific deletions within the zzso to zzso region zzso zzso Thus, deletion of box II zzso zzso activity in initiating lateral zzso Further deletion of box III fails to restore expression but subsequent deletion of an additional 43 zzso to position zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso activities consistent with these results are present in nuclear extracts of bean roots and zzso These studies reveal zzso elements within the zzso promoter, and potential trans factors, that permit zzso and zzso zzso patterns of regulation to be combined with a flexible response to environmental zzso
