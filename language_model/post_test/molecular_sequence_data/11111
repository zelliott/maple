zzso zzso zzso is a neural protein zzso C zzso zzso enriched in nerve growth cones that has been implicated in growth cone zzso Here we investigated whether zzso is a zzso zzso for zzso zzso II zzso in zzso rat cortical growth cone zzso Using zzso zzso and known zzso of zzso in combination with zzso mass zzso and zzso acid analysis, we demonstrate that zzso growth cone zzso is zzso at multiple sites, on both zzso and zzso zzso zzso with previous reports, stimulation of zzso activity increased the zzso of only those zzso fragments containing zzso Under zzso conditions, however, zzso was predominantly associated with fragments not containing zzso Mass zzso of zzso zzso of zzso which had been zzso from zzso growth cones, revealed that in zzso zzso occurs within peptides zzso and zzso These peptides contain the major and minor in zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso of zzso chick zzso generated a zzso zzso zzso zzso confirming that zzso of the zzso domain occurs across evolutionary diverse zzso We conclude that zzso in growth cones is not only a zzso for zzso but also for zzso
