The cardiac zzso zzso family includes zzso zzso factor and brain or zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso factor zzso Although these peptides contribute to cardiovascular zzso their respective roles remain zzso To study regulation of zzso zzso factor and zzso gene expression during progression of hypertension, we developed a quantitative zzso chain reaction protocol to measure their transcript level in spontaneously zzso rat zzso zzso At the onset of hypertension, zzso zzso factor transcripts in 5-week-old zzso were 50% of those of zzso zzso zzso rats, whereas the level of zzso transcripts was similar in zzso and twofold higher in zzso Because zzso are the major sites of zzso zzso factor gene expression and zzso contribute predominantly to cardiac zzso zzso total zzso zzso factor zzso zzso zzso in the hearts of 5-week-old zzso was about 50% of that in zzso rats, and total zzso zzso content was already higher than in control zzso In left zzso and zzso zzso progression of hypertension led to a zzso increase of twofold and fourfold in zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso levels, respectively, with no zzso change in right zzso In the zzso of older zzso zzso zzso factor and zzso zzso levels were comparable to those of zzso zzso These data indicate that, although increased blood pressure stimulates both zzso zzso factor and zzso gene zzso regulation of the two zzso zzso genes is not temporally coordinated in all cardiac zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso is already induced in the zzso at the onset of the zzso stage, and in older zzso the zzso gene is zzso to progression of hypertension compared with zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso might represent a very sensitive marker of cardiac changes in zzso
