Human zzso zzso is the primary zzso for zzso fusion by zzso strains of human zzso virus type 1, whereas mouse zzso zzso lacks this zzso An array of 23 zzso hybrids containing increasing amounts of zzso extending from the N zzso generated by random zzso had a zzso pattern of zzso activity with zzso and zzso revealing active regions in the zzso zzso domain zzso and at the junction of zzso loop zzso The zzso zzso in which divergent zzso were replaced with the corresponding zzso zzso sequence zzso gained zzso function in fusion but not infection zzso A zzso double zzso with substitution of human sequences for divergent zzso from the zzso and zzso loop 3 had zzso zzso activity in fusion zzso and gain of function in infection zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso receptors composed of zzso zzso fused to zzso zzso excluded the possibility that differences in zzso activity resulted from variations in cell surface zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso activity of the zzso zzso is modulated by zzso zzso illustrating the complexity of zzso requirements for interaction with zzso
