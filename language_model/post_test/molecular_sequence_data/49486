The zzso organ zzso of the mouse has two zzso compartments expressing distinct families of zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso We report here that two families of major zzso complex zzso class zzso zzso the zzso and the zzso families, show restricted expression in zzso zzso Our data suggest that zzso expressing a given zzso specifically zzso one or a few members of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso analysis demonstrates that in zzso sensory zzso zzso belong to large zzso complexes that include zzso receptors and zzso zzso In cultured cells, zzso appear to function as escort molecules in transport of zzso to the cell zzso zzso zzso mice exhibit zzso of zzso in the zzso and a specific zzso in zzso aggressive zzso The functional characterization of zzso highlights an unexpected role for zzso molecules in zzso detection by zzso zzso zzso
