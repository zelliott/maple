The zzso zzso at the zzso zzso induced either by vacuum zzso at 160 zzso or zzso at 254 zzso in zzso preparations of zzso coli zzso zzso DNA, have been characterized from 72 zzso zzso zzso by DNA zzso In plasmids zzso in zzso vacuum zzso is five times more zzso than zzso In the zzso zzso base zzso largely zzso with zzso (G, zzso C, zzso A, zzso zzso zzso transitions being the most abundant type of base change for vacuum zzso zzso and zzso zzso Most of the zzso transitions appear to occur at zzso sites, which are located at the zzso DNA zzso zzso but not all, hot spots for zzso transitions are identical for vacuum zzso and zzso zzso resulting from a loss of the zzso zzso are specific for zzso zzso and were not detected after treatment with vacuum zzso They occur predominantly at zzso runs of the transcribed DNA zzso Only a few deletions were detected following zzso with vacuum zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, their frequency is not enhanced compared with the spontaneous zzso zzso The data confirm the important role of base substitution zzso in zzso zzso which is not only valid for the zzso range, but extends towards the vacuum zzso zzso
