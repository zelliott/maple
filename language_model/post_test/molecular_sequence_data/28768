Nuclear factor Y zzso is a highly zzso zzso zzso that recognizes with high specificity and affinity the widespread zzso box promoter zzso We previously cloned the genes of 23 zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso 264 (2001) zzso Now that the zzso zzso sequencing project is complete, we present the zzso alignments and expression profiles of the remaining six genes coding for the three zzso zzso zzso with our previous reports, most of the new members of the three zzso show a unique zzso pattern, while another zzso is rather zzso
