zzso protein 1 zzso also known as bone zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with demonstrated zzso zzso As the zzso zzso zzso was shown to provide zzso guidance cues and to prevent the reduction of zzso growth in the zzso cortical cultures, it was suggested that an in zzso efficient zzso delivery could enhance zzso growth and functional zzso in the damaged zzso In the present work, we engineered a zzso zzso in which zzso was fused to a protein zzso domain derived from zzso zzso protein to deliver the zzso zzso zzso into cells and obtain its zzso zzso zzso the expensive and not much efficient in zzso zzso zzso When tested on rat zzso cells, a widely used in zzso zzso differentiation model, the resulting fusion protein zzso demonstrated to enter zzso into the cells, lose zzso sequence and interact with membrane receptors zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso In comparison with nerve growth factor zzso and zzso it proved itself effective to induce the formation of more organized H and M zzso Moreover, if used in combination with zzso it zzso a significant zzso zzso zzso and more precocious zzso outgrowth with respect to zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso fused with zzso zzso domain shows zzso activity and may be a promising zzso factor in zzso zzso
