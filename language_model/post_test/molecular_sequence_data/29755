We report here the identification of a bacterial protein capable of interacting with zzso death receptors in zzso and in zzso The protein is zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and has zzso in other zzso zzso This zzso which we refer to as zzso protein zzso with death zzso zzso zzso zzso in a variety of zzso cell lines when expressed by transient gene zzso zzso induction can be blocked by zzso zzso indicating that zzso triggers cell death by engaging the host zzso zzso zzso interacts with death zzso of tumor necrosis factor zzso family receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not with the respective downstream zzso In infected zzso cells, zzso is expressed late in the infectious cycle of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso in the proximity of the inclusion zzso The results suggest a role for zzso modulating the zzso pathways of cells zzso revealing a new mechanism of zzso zzso
