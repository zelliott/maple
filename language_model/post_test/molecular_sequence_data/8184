We have determined the solution structure of the zzso domain of zzso zzso by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso In solution, this zzso region of zzso forms a zzso consisting of two structures that closely resemble zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso previously identified by zzso studies to be important for DNA binding of the zzso as well as several adjacent basic zzso acids are zzso zzso The identification of an zzso domain in zzso provides a new potential target for drug zzso
