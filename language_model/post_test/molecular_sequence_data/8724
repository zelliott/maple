zzso and zzso are antibiotics which inhibit zzso zzso zzso at the initiation and zzso steps, zzso In zzso coli, resistance to each zzso results from zzso in the beta zzso of the core zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso studies found zzso resistance zzso associated with the beta zzso and zzso resistance zzso with zzso To understand the basis of bacterial zzso we isolated the zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a zzso product that is zzso identical to zzso coli zzso Two spontaneous zzso zzso carried the same zzso substitution in zzso and this substitution alone was sufficient to zzso zzso in zzso zzso falls within Region zzso which is zzso among the largest zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Among zzso zzso in Region F promote resistance to zzso a toxin which zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso in Region F cause zzso zzso To determine whether zzso in the beta zzso of zzso zzso could also zzso zzso we made three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso region of zzso Together these results suggest that beta and zzso interact to form an zzso binding site, and that this site is important for zzso zzso
