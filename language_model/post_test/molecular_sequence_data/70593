We present an evolutionary analysis of 13 species of zzso including 4 newly zzso species with zzso as their intermediate host, based on complete small zzso zzso zzso Those species with zzso as their intermediate host form a zzso zzso and there are at least two major zzso within this group, one containing those species forming zzso and with dogs as their definitive host and the other containing those species forming zzso and with cats as their definitive zzso Those species with zzso as their intermediate host form the zzso sister group to these zzso Most of the species have considerable zzso differences zzso in more than 100 zzso zzso except for zzso zzso and zzso zzso There is a large suite of zzso differences indicating that those species infecting zzso and zzso hosts have had very different evolutionary zzso and similarly for the zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso sequences that represent the different structural regions of the zzso zzso have very different zzso behavior within zzso The evolution of these regions should be functionally zzso and their differences can be explained in terms of the importance of the zzso sequences to their zzso
