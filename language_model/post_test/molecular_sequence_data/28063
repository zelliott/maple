Human protein C, like other zzso zzso is normally zzso as an inactive zzso It is converted to its active form zzso by limited zzso with the zzso zzso This zzso results from the removal of a zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of the heavy zzso zzso We report here a successful strategy for the zzso of human protein C during zzso cellular processing, resulting in the zzso of activated protein C from zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso resulted in the expression of a zzso with less than zzso of the expected zzso However, the replacement of the zzso zzso with an zzso sequence zzso involved in the zzso processing of the human insulin zzso precursor resulted in the direct expression of fully activated protein zzso The zzso protein was shown to be correctly processed by zzso sequence zzso This strategy for successful expression of an activated form of protein C may apply to the expression of active forms of other zzso which are naturally expressed as zzso
