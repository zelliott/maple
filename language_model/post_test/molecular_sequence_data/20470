After the recent discovery of bacterial zzso synthetic zzso have been engineered by using natural and artificial zzso zzso In contrast to natural zzso the majority of synthetic zzso in bacteria reported to date are ON switches that activate gene expression in response to the zzso zzso In this study, we adopted a zzso approach to design libraries predisposed to contain OFF zzso that respond to zzso zzso zzso The first library design exploited a zzso zzso sequence located near the zzso of the zzso zzso which would be less accessible to the zzso when the zzso is bound to zzso In the second library, an zzso sequence was zzso placed in the zzso zzso zzso which is stabilized upon zzso zzso OFF zzso were obtained by dual genetic selection of these zzso The results underscore the importance of effective library design to achieve desired zzso zzso
