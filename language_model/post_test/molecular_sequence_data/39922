zzso expression of zzso an zzso zzso is lethal to zzso zzso For the efficient production of zzso in zzso coli, we developed an expression system in which the gene for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso was fused to an zzso zzso gene to neutralize the basic property of zzso and successfully zzso the zzso fusion gene in zzso zzso The zzso gene was linked to a modified zzso intervening sequence gene by a zzso zzso chain reaction, thus producing an zzso zzso fusion zzso The zzso zzso zzso fusion gene was zzso and expressed in zzso coli zzso upon induction with zzso The expression levels of the fusion zzso reached the maximum at the zzso while further increases in the copy number of the fusion gene substantially reduced the zzso expression zzso The fusion peptides were isolated and zzso to generate the separate zzso and zzso zzso About 60 zzso of pure zzso zzso was obtained from 1 L of zzso coli zzso The zzso zzso zzso was found to have a molecular weight similar to that of chemically zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed zzso activity and disrupted bacterial membrane zzso as the native zzso zzso zzso
