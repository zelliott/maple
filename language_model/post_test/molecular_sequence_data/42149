The synthetic zzso zzso the sequence of which is zzso to the zzso site of the brain specific protein zzso C zzso zzso zzso and zzso was tested for its utility as a zzso zzso in crude tissue zzso The zzso of zzso shows zzso and protein zzso In prolonged zzso the addition of the protein zzso inhibitor sodium zzso results in increased zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso was compared to that of another widely used zzso zzso zzso zzso is as potent as zzso and more selective than zzso as a zzso zzso Greater than zzso of zzso incorporation into zzso can be inhibited by a selective zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed an apparent zzso of 147 zzso virtually identical to previously published zzso observed for zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso In addition, we zzso several zzso and zzso zzso using zzso as zzso in the presence or absence of zzso We show that the relative zzso activity zzso with zzso zzso well to the relative amount of zzso known to be present in various zzso and zzso zzso Overall, this report shows that zzso can be used to selectively zzso zzso even in tissue containing low zzso zzso
