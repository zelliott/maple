zzso zzso virus zzso has been shown to cause central nervous system zzso in experimental animals and several studies have implicated zzso in the zzso of multiple sclerosis zzso We have used the zzso chain reaction to look for DNA of both type 1 zzso zzso and type 2 zzso zzso in zzso zzso brain zzso from patients with zzso and other neurological zzso zzso which amplify a zzso of the normal cellular gene zzso were included in the reactions to assess the preservation of DNA in the tissue zzso 77 plaques of zzso from 23 patients with zzso were zzso zzso DNA was amplified from only one zzso This plaque involved the zzso root entry zone in the zzso and it is suggested that the presence of viral DNA was related to the site examined rather than to the zzso per zzso zzso DNA was amplified from none of the zzso As expected, zzso DNA was detected in the brains of 6 patients who died of zzso encephalitis and zzso DNA was amplified from the brain of a zzso with zzso zzso zzso In sections of brain from 39 patients with a wide range of other neurological diseases zzso DNA was detected in the zzso of only 1 patient, who had AIDS associated with zzso zzso subsequent investigation confirmed the presence of zzso zzso brain stem zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
