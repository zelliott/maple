zzso zzso in zzso arise by processing of zzso primary transcripts at a zzso zzso sequence zzso Previous results indicated that processing at zzso sites interrupted the sequence zzso that it functioned primarily as a signal for 3' end formation of zzso We have determined the precise zzso site for zzso processed at the zzso sequences associated with the zzso gene and the omega zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In both cases zzso occurred two bases downstream of the zzso zzso left the zzso group attached to the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso These results demonstrate for the first time that mature zzso zzso terminate with an intact zzso zzso In light of the recent identification of a protein complex within zzso that binds to zzso terminating with an intact zzso zzso these results support the idea that the zzso sequence functions not only within zzso as a processing site, but within mature zzso as well, possibly for the stabilization and/or zzso
