The zzso zzso of the zzso bond preceding zzso is an zzso slow process, although important in many biological processes in both zzso and zzso In zzso this zzso is zzso by zzso zzso zzso Here, we present the molecular and zzso characterization of zzso zzso family members of the model zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso and zzso were found to be zzso to zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso from human, respectively, zzso represents a novel zzso zzso apparently present only in plants, that contains an active zzso zzso zzso All zzso zzso were zzso expressed and zzso from zzso coli, and zzso protein zzso zzso used a liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso characterization of the zzso zzso zzso revealed that they possess zzso activity toward synthetic zzso although they exhibited different zzso zzso depending on the zzso acid zzso terminal to zzso These differences were also studied in a structural context using molecular modeling of the zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction revealed that the three zzso genes of zzso are zzso expressed in all plant zzso zzso was found to be zzso during the later stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso Yellow Fluorescence zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso leaf zzso cells revealed that zzso and zzso zzso were localized in the zzso and in the nucleus, in contrast to zzso which was clearly localized in zzso Divergent zzso zzso expression profiles, and zzso zzso indicate that plant zzso zzso are probably involved in a wide range of zzso and zzso zzso
