The zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso the most destructive viral pathogen of zzso display a high level of zzso As a result of genetic bottleneck induced by the zzso of zzso material, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso displayed different zzso All successfully grafted plants showed severe symptoms of stem pitting and zzso zzso while plants in which zzso buds died displayed mild zzso Since complex zzso population structure was detected in the parental host, the aim of this work was to investigate how it changed after the virus transmission, and to correlate it with observed zzso The coat protein gene sequence of the zzso zzso was identical in parental and grafted plants and clustered to the zzso group 5 encompassing severe reference zzso In zzso displaying severe symptoms, the zzso zzso zzso to other zzso groups were zzso as zzso zzso plants were zzso with buds taken from unsuccessfully grafted zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, they displayed no severe symptoms despite the presence of zzso group 5 zzso zzso The results suggest that the appearance of severe symptoms in this case is probably induced by a complex zzso population structure found in zzso displaying severe symptoms, and not directly by the zzso zzso zzso
