A zzso for crystal protein genes of zzso zzso is zzso zzso used are the zzso zzso and the zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso Fourteen genes are zzso zzso proteins active against either zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso One zzso zzso encodes a general zzso protein and shows no structural similarities with the other zzso zzso studies with single zzso proteins demonstrated that every described crystal protein is characterized by a highly specific, and sometimes very zzso insect host zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences reveals sequence elements which are zzso for zzso zzso The expression of crystal protein genes is affected by a number of zzso Recently, two distinct zzso zzso regulating zzso during different stages of zzso have been identified, as well as a protein regulating the expression of a crystal protein at a zzso zzso Studies on the zzso mechanisms of toxicity suggest that zzso zzso crystal proteins induce the formation of pores in zzso of susceptible zzso In zzso binding studies with zzso toxins demonstrated a strong correlation between the specificity of zzso zzso toxins and the interaction with specific binding sites on the insect zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso crystal proteins in zzso zzso and in transgenic plants has been zzso These approaches are potentially powerful strategies for the protection of zzso important crops against insect zzso
