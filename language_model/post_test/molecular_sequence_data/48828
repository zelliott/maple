A novel zzso designated zzso zzso was isolated from the zzso stems of a coastal zzso zzso zzso zzso collected from the city of zzso zzso Province, east zzso The strain was found to have zzso and zzso characteristics typical of members of the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence of strain zzso zzso revealed that the strain formed a distinct zzso within the zzso tree based on zzso zzso gene sequences and the highest sequence similarity zzso zzso was to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to other species of the zzso zzso was lower than 97 zzso Based on zzso zzso values and comparison of zzso and zzso data, zzso zzso could be distinguished from the closest zzso related species, zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, based on these data, it is evident that strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
