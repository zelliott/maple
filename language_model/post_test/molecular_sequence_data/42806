As an aid to the management of the zzso population of the brown bear zzso zzso a zzso method based on the amplification of a Y zzso specific sequence has been developed, and tested using hairs found in the field as a source of zzso This method involves a zzso zzso chain reaction zzso which allows the detection of a very small amount of DNA, probably a single zzso gene zzso The sex can reliably be identified using about zzso of DNA extract as zzso It is possible that this approach could, with adjustments, be used to identify the sex of other species of zzso zzso
