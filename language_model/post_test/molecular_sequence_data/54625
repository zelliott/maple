zzso zzso zzso is an zzso human pathogen and the zzso agent of the sexually transmitted infection, zzso Despite the fact that the zzso is not normally exposed to zzso zzso or visible light, the zzso expresses a zzso zzso which in other organisms encodes a DNA zzso that repairs zzso zzso zzso with energy provided by visible zzso We show that a zzso zzso zzso is not more sensitive to zzso zzso independent of visible light exposure, and that the zzso zzso cannot complement an zzso coli zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso had a reduced colony size that was not a result of a growth zzso and the zzso cells exhibited an altered zzso Although the zzso zzso exhibited increased sensitivity to zzso zzso it showed increased survival on media containing zzso acid or zzso but did not have an increased zzso rate to these antibiotics or zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed increased negative DNA zzso but while the protein bound zzso DNA, it did not express zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso has a previously zzso role in maintaining DNA zzso that is important for normal cell zzso
