One decade ago, vascular zzso was commonly considered a zzso lining of blood vessels that functioned only to prevent blood zzso and to separate the vascular space from zzso By comparison to many other cell types, zzso cells were thought to be less active, less complex, and less zzso Since that time, research concerning the zzso has expanded dramatically and produced a new image of the vascular lining as an active participant in a wide variety of zzso zzso including inflammation and zzso Nowhere has the excitement been more intense than in the study of the molecular mechanisms of zzso zzso to zzso Recent efforts resulted in the zzso zzso and cloning of multiple zzso zzso zzso that support zzso through an interaction with specific zzso (or zzso on zzso The zzso two of which are found on zzso and one on zzso support zzso through the recognition of zzso zzso members of the zzso zzso including zzso and zzso bind to zzso zzso zzso In various combinations, these and other molecules support zzso zzso to the vessel wall and zzso key steps in our response to infection and tissue zzso
