The zzso system that identifies zzso interactions in a zzso expression system was used to investigate zzso anterior zzso zzso zzso Four zzso clones of a protein interacting with the zzso zzso domain of zzso zzso were zzso Their zzso sequences revealed that they zzso zzso zzso factor 4 zzso A full-length zzso of zzso zzso was obtained by the zzso chain reaction, and its deduced zzso acid sequence showed 88 and zzso identity to human and mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of zzso prepared from 11 zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso is zzso zzso showed that zzso is present in the hormone producing cells of the anterior zzso but absent in some cells of the anterior zzso Further binding analysis revealed that zzso also interacts with itself and zzso This evidence of zzso zzso as well as zzso with zzso and zzso in the anterior zzso suggests a novel mechanism for the regulation of gene expression in this zzso
