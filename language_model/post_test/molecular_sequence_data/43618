The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso region zzso position zzso to zzso of bovine zzso type 1 zzso was zzso This region contained three open reading frames zzso zzso to zzso zzso virus DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso major zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso assembly protein zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso and 826 zzso acids long with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso They showed a high zzso with zzso zzso despite large differences in the G + C content of the zzso segment ranging from zzso for zzso zzso virus to zzso for zzso Particularly well zzso among zzso are the putative functional zzso of the zzso and zzso proteins which are zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso clustered in the zzso zzso with the animal zzso zzso In this group, the zzso position was shown to vary according to the investigated zzso Indeed, zzso virus clustered with zzso in the zzso tree but with zzso zzso 1 in the zzso zzso
