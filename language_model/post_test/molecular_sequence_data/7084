The genetic properties of the zzso zzso element of zzso zzso suggest that it is a prion zzso zzso form of zzso a regulator of nitrogen zzso In extracts from zzso zzso zzso was partially resistant to zzso K compared with zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso strains induced a zzso to zzso increase in the frequency with which zzso zzso zzso of just the zzso 65 zzso of zzso increased the frequency of zzso induction zzso Without this zzso zzso the zzso domain performed the nitrogen regulation function of zzso but could not be changed to the zzso prion zzso Thus, this domain induced the prion state in zzso whereas in zzso it zzso zzso of the adjoining nitrogen regulatory domain to prion zzso
