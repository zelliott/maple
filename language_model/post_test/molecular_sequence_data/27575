We isolated a full-length zzso zzso from human adrenal where zzso is expressed at high zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows two zzso acid differences from the sequence of zzso obtained from zzso zzso resistant cultured zzso The zzso acid substitution zzso at zzso 185 in zzso from zzso resistant cells occurred during selection of cells in zzso As previously reported, cells zzso with the zzso zzso carrying zzso acquire increased resistance to zzso compared to other zzso The other zzso acid substitution zzso at zzso zzso probably reflects genetic zzso The zzso zzso the major member of the zzso gene family expressed in human zzso is sufficient to zzso zzso on culture zzso
