zzso zzso zzso zzso is a useful model system for the study of gene control in response to severe water zzso zzso gene discovery efforts utilizing desiccated zzso have identified two zzso designated zzso and zzso with significant similarity to early zzso proteins zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso zzso a 212 zzso acid deduced zzso zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso is zzso zzso in zzso zzso a 224 zzso acid deduced zzso zzso with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso and zzso are zzso grouped with zzso sequences derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso zzso and zzso zzso abundance in response to a variety of zzso zzso zzso transcript levels increased in response to slow zzso rapid zzso zzso zzso and zzso in high zzso The zzso transcript was only zzso in response to zzso or zzso in high zzso It is zzso that zzso and zzso are an zzso response to zzso zzso within the moss zzso and play a key role in the protection and/or repair of the zzso zzso
