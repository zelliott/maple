We have zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso of 14 zzso and 12 zzso zzso of human zzso The zzso which include all 8 zzso were used to predict secondary structures, zzso possible functional zzso reveal zzso regions suitable for zzso acid amplification and perform zzso zzso The final zzso of the zzso protein precursor gene and the adjacent zzso region were highly zzso and, except for 35 zzso with zzso to a sequence in the zzso of a coronavirus zzso zzso unique to zzso zzso This confirms that the zzso is a suitable target for universal and specific detection of zzso zzso For the deduced 72 zzso zzso acids of the zzso protein zzso distances between the zzso were found to vary from zzso substitution per site between zzso 3 and 7 to more than one substitution per site between zzso 4 and the other zzso Different zzso of the same zzso were closely zzso which indicates that the presently used zzso zzso differentiate between zzso distinct zzso zzso secondary structures with minimal free energy were predicted using computer zzso Comparative sequence analysis verified the significance of certain of the predicted structural zzso
