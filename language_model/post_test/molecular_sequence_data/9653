The chemical structure of the cell wall zzso of zzso zzso was analyzed using two-dimensional zzso techniques without chemical zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso indicated that it consists of an zzso zzso backbone zzso with side zzso A sequential zzso assignment of the side chains through nuclear zzso effect zzso zzso indicated that the zzso side chain contains an zzso zzso unit at the zzso zzso The structure was significantly different from the zzso of zzso The zzso ratio of the side chains calculated from the zzso signal dimensions indicated that zzso zzso of the backbone zzso zzso units are not zzso with side chains and are responsible for the zzso of the zzso with factor 9 zzso
