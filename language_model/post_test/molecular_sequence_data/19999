zzso zzso zzso zzso duplex DNA containing the sequence zzso zzso stands for C or G, zzso zzso a zzso zzso to generate staggered products with single zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso functions as a zzso that interacts with its target DNA in zzso zzso ratio and report crystal structures of zzso in the absence and in the presence of zzso In the complex with DNA, zzso makes specific contacts with all five bases of the target sequence and not just with a zzso as the zzso of a typical zzso restriction zzso Our data are inconsistent with zzso zzso and suggest that the zzso introduces zzso breaks by zzso zzso individual DNA zzso although this remains to be confirmed by kinetic zzso zzso is remotely similar to the DNA repair protein zzso and shares approximately zzso sequence identity with the restriction zzso zzso which is specific for the related sequence zzso zzso stands for A or zzso As expected, zzso is structurally similar to zzso and recognizes zzso bases in the target sequence similarly but not zzso zzso has a unique machinery for the recognition of the central zzso
