Crystal structures of zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso at zzso and 100 K have been refined to zzso of zzso and zzso against data to zzso and zzso A resolution, zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso are similar to those observed for the same zzso in the complex of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso were grown from solutions containing zzso and zzso the electron density at the active site is consistent with zzso and zzso zzso and zzso probably work in concert to stabilize the zzso of zzso which in turn is the zzso in the displacement of zzso from the zzso of zzso Once formed, zzso is stable in the active site of the zzso under the conditions of the structural zzso The direct observation of zzso in the active site is consistent with the putative generation of zzso along the reaction zzso of the zzso
