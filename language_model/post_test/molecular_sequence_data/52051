We have used the zzso chain reaction to amplify zzso from expressed bovine major zzso complex class I zzso zzso obtained from zzso and zzso zzso were used to identify the number of expressed zzso Data from three animals suggest that there are four major expressed zzso representing the products of two (or more) zzso We have also demonstrated the presence of an alternatively spliced zzso which has been observed in five zzso The alternative zzso removes zzso 7 (the major site of class I zzso which predicts a truncated zzso with a zzso portion 16 zzso acids shorter than zzso This phenomenon was detected for only a single class I zzso within each zzso
