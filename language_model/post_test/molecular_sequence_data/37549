Analysis of zzso sequence data from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the existence of two open reading frames zzso zzso zzso zzso These open reading frames are linked by a zzso zzso region containing zzso stretches and are transcribed in opposite zzso The corresponding zzso are referred to as zzso and zzso and consist of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso represent extremely zzso integral membrane proteins with 15 predicted zzso segments and an overall zzso acid sequence similarity of zzso Multiple sequence alignments revealed that zzso is closely related to zzso zzso whereas zzso shows highest zzso to bacterial zzso Northern zzso experiments with zzso from zzso cells harvested in the zzso growth phase indicated that only zzso was produced under these zzso Analysis of washed zzso showed that zzso had a specific activity of zzso U zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso membrane zzso prepared from zzso cells showed that zzso of 1 zzso of zzso was coupled to the zzso of about 1 zzso of zzso across the zzso zzso zzso conditions for zzso expression could not be determined zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso represent the first examples of this zzso class in zzso zzso and may be part of their zzso zzso
