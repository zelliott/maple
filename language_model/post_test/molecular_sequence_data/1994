zzso is an zzso protein with a zzso zzso domain that was initially characterized as having functional involvement in cell spreading on the zzso zzso zzso zzso As one approach to understanding the functional properties of zzso we have combined zzso and zzso zzso Through analysis of a new zzso of eight animal zzso we showed that the zzso region of the zzso zzso to a predicted zzso zzso This domain architecture is zzso in zzso zzso and reveals a structural parallel between the zzso and certain zzso zzso zzso zzso although the zzso of the two groups appears zzso In view of the fact that a number of zzso proteins have been shown to zzso zzso protein pull-down zzso and studies of cellular zzso were carried out with zzso deletion zzso and point zzso zzso to investigate the roles of the zzso and zzso zzso We obtained evidence for zzso and zzso between the two zzso These studies provide evidence that zzso zzso through a zzso mechanism involving the zzso zzso
