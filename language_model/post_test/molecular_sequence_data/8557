A zzso two-dimensional Southern zzso method has been developed and was used to examine the distribution of a class of zzso repeated sequences in human zzso This method consists of two separate restriction zzso zzso including an in zzso zzso and two-dimensional zzso using a zzso zzso zzso The first zzso region of the human zzso full-length sequence was used to probe human zzso DNA from zzso tissue zzso About 900 zzso signals were resolved from each DNA sample within a zzso zzso The bulk of the fragments were between zzso to 23 zzso in zzso At a minimum 15 zzso signals were detected between DNA samples from male and female individuals and at a minimum 16 zzso signals were detected between two different female zzso This approach can potentially be used to perform high-resolution human zzso zzso zzso
