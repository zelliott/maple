This study aimed to determine the microbial diversity in the starter of zzso zzso 

The plate method was used to zzso the zzso meanwhile, the zzso zzso of bacteria and the internal transcribed zzso of zzso were used to determine microbial zzso Several zzso were accordingly zzso Among the bacteria, zzso and zzso were detected only on the surface of the starter, whereas zzso was dominant within the zzso Among the zzso zzso and zzso were the main zzso in surface and interior starter, zzso in addition, zzso was found in interior starter, while other species of zzso were detected on the zzso 

The zzso and zzso chain zzso methods revealed the significant microbial diversity in different locations in the starter of zzso zzso 

This study is the first to identify the bacterial and zzso communities associated with the starter of zzso Liquor using both traditional and molecular zzso it is also the first to compare the microbial diversity on the surface of starter with that in the zzso The results enrich our knowledge on zzso zzso and can be used to promote the development of the traditional zzso zzso
