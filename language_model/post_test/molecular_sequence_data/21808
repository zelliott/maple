zzso is a virulent zzso group III zzso whose linear zzso comprises zzso zzso At the zzso level, zzso differs from other zzso However, a number of its structural and zzso proteins revealed a relationship to the group II zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso Unlike the zzso zzso the zzso zzso does not contain zzso replication and zzso zzso Instead, the respective genes are scattered throughout the zzso zzso Moreover, most genes for zzso zzso of zzso are lacking in zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso contains nine similar genes for zzso zzso which may be involved in the attrition of the zzso gene order for the zzso core genes of zzso zzso The zzso apparently possesses an unusual modification of C or G zzso zzso zzso of its DNA was only achieved with restriction zzso recognizing pure zzso zzso zzso zzso extraction leads to a significant loss of zzso DNA from the zzso layer, a property not yet described for other zzso belonging to the T4 zzso
