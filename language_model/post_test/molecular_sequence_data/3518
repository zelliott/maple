The first electron nuclear double resonance zzso study of a member of the zzso zzso zzso family of zzso is zzso using the zzso nitrate zzso from zzso zzso Rapid zzso zzso zzso revealed that during turnover the intensity of a zzso zzso signal known as zzso zzso zzso This signal is split by two interacting zzso that are not zzso zzso zzso analysis resolved broad symmetrical resonance features that arose from four classes of zzso zzso coupled to the zzso zzso from two of these were lost upon exchange into zzso zzso suggesting that they may originate from zzso or zzso zzso One of these signals was also lost when the zzso was zzso in the presence of zzso Since these zzso are very zzso coupled zzso groups, they are not likely to be zzso directly to the zzso This suggests that zzso of a zzso group does not occur on reduction to zzso but most probably accompanies reduction of zzso to zzso A resonance feature from a more strongly coupled zzso that was not lost following exchange into zzso zzso could also be resolved at zzso zzso The zzso of this feature, determined from zzso zzso collected at a range of field positions, indicated a zzso distance of zzso zzso A, consistent with this being one of the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso
