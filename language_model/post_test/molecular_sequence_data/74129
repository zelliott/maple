The evolutionary basis for high species diversity in tropical regions of the world remains zzso Much research has focused on the zzso of zzso in the Amazon Basin, which harbors the greatest diversity of zzso zzso The leading hypotheses on zzso diversification of zzso zzso are the zzso zzso marine zzso and zzso barrier zzso Recent advances in the fields of zzso and zzso modeling permit a modern zzso of these zzso Our approach combines zzso molecular zzso analyses using zzso DNA sequence data with zzso modeling of species ranges at the last glacial maximum zzso to test these hypotheses for three zzso species of zzso zzso zzso zzso The cumulative results of all tests reject every prediction of the zzso barrier hypothesis, but are unable to reject several predictions of the zzso zzso and marine incursion zzso zzso dating analyses suggest that population structure formed recently zzso but are unable to reject the possibility that zzso events may be responsible for structuring populations in two of the three species zzso The available data therefore suggest that either marine zzso in the zzso or climate changes during the zzso zzso shaped the population structure of the three species zzso Our results also zzso the traditional zzso zzso hypothesis, and offer a novel framework for future research into the zzso
