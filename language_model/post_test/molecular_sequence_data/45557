The human zzso pathogen zzso zzso can use proteins as the sole source of nitrogen for zzso The zzso of zzso zzso which have been shown to contribute to zzso of zzso zzso allows the fungus to digest host proteins to produce peptides that must be taken up into the cell by specific zzso To understand in more detail how zzso zzso zzso proteins as a nitrogen source, we undertook a comprehensive analysis of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We identified eight zzso genes zzso putative zzso zzso almost all of which are represented by zzso zzso in strain zzso zzso of these genes was zzso induced when zzso zzso was grown in zzso zzso which contains bovine serum zzso as the sole nitrogen zzso Whereas deletion of single zzso genes in strain zzso did not affect its ability to zzso proteins as a nitrogen source, zzso triple zzso had a severe growth zzso in zzso which was rescued by zzso of a single copy of zzso zzso or zzso In addition, forced expression of zzso or zzso under control of the zzso promoter also restored growth of an zzso zzso demonstrating that at least zzso zzso functional zzso zzso The various zzso zzso differ in their zzso preferences, as shown by the ability of strains expressing specific zzso genes to grow on peptides of defined length and zzso We present evidence that in addition to the known role of zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso and zzso these proteins can also transport longer peptides up to at least eight zzso acids in zzso ensuring an efficient zzso of the various peptides produced via zzso zzso of proteins by the zzso zzso zzso As even zzso zzso by zzso zzso of a single gene exhibited differences in their efficiency to take up specific zzso the zzso zzso represent an example for how the evolution of gene families containing zzso expressed and functionally zzso members increases the nutritional versatility and, presumably, the adaptation of zzso zzso to different host zzso
