DNA replication is a pivotal event in the cell cycle and, as a consequence, is tightly controlled in zzso zzso The initiation of DNA replication is dependent upon the completion of zzso and upon the commitment to complete the cell cycle made during zzso zzso of the protein factors required for initiating DNA replication is essential to understand how the cell cycle is zzso Recent results indicate that initiation complexes assemble in multiple stages during the cell zzso First, origins are bound by the zzso origin recognition complex zzso which is essential for DNA replication in zzso zzso present at little more than one complete complex per replication origin, binds to origins immediately after initiation in the previous cell zzso zzso binding occurs by the recognition of a zzso sequence that includes the essential zzso consensus sequence zzso and the functionally important B1 element adjacent to the zzso A novel zzso complex zzso assembles at origins at the end of zzso in actively cycling cells and remains at origins until DNA replication zzso Finally, zzso which is periodically zzso at the end of zzso interacts with replication zzso zzso interaction requires an intact zzso strongly suggesting that interaction occurs through zzso zzso interacts with and is required for the zzso of the zzso protein zzso and together, zzso and zzso are required for the zzso zzso Separate regions of zzso are required for zzso and zzso suggesting that zzso may act to recruit zzso to replication origins where zzso of some key component may cause origin zzso
