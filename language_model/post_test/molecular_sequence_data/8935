To analyze the secondary structure of zzso tissue growth factor zzso for the prediction and screening of candidate zzso domain of zzso 

zzso method was employed to predict and screen zzso zzso domain based on the analysis of secondary structure of zzso and its zzso and physical zzso 

The results showed that the candidate zzso zzso locate in zzso zzso zzso zzso the corresponding zzso acid sequences are zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

There were 3 candidate zzso zzso of zzso which might be the targets for newly zzso zzso zzso of zzso
