The role of the immune response to the human zzso B virus zzso envelope proteins in zzso of viral zzso has been well zzso The similarity between zzso zzso member of the zzso family, and the closely related duck zzso B virus zzso has allowed, use of the latter as a convenient model for the study of molecular mechanisms of zzso replication and zzso In this brief review, we will examine the zzso and zzso envelope proteins and their role as targets for virus zzso
