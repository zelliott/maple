zzso connections in the nervous system are directed onto specific cellular and zzso zzso zzso guidepost cells in the zzso zzso zzso zzso drive zzso from the zzso motor zzso onto adjacent target zzso and zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is a central component of the synaptic guidepost zzso zzso is expressed zzso by primary zzso zzso cells during zzso zzso zzso binds zzso the zzso on zzso and directs zzso zzso and zzso formation to adjacent regions of zzso zzso and zzso zzso have defects in synaptic zzso the zzso zzso forms fewer zzso onto its normal targets and forms zzso zzso onto inappropriate zzso zzso of zzso in secondary zzso cells causes zzso zzso of zzso and synaptic markers in zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso Our results indicate that local interactions between zzso zzso proteins can determine specificity during zzso zzso
