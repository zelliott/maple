zzso regional zzso of the zzso gene can be detected in up to zzso of patients with acute zzso leukemia zzso We used a zzso chain reaction zzso based zzso to detect abnormal regional zzso at this locus in patients with primary zzso syndromes zzso zzso was detected in 13 of 20 patients zzso with zzso and was detected in nine patients with zzso and normal zzso There was no correlation between detection of this zzso and the zzso of zzso Four of the 13 patients zzso with abnormal zzso have progressed to zzso with a median time to progression of zzso zzso The zzso median survival of the cohort with abnormal zzso was 17 months, while that of the cohort with normal zzso is not yet zzso These preliminary findings suggest that detection of abnormal zzso at this locus may be useful as a diagnostic tool in zzso Furthermore, zzso of the zzso gene may be a poor zzso feature that predicts progression to acute leukemia in patients with primary zzso
