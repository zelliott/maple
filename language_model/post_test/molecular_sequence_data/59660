The length of zzso 1 of the red zzso gene is zzso among Africans but not among Caucasians or zzso This zzso was found to result from the presence or absence of a block of zzso zzso comprised of three zzso elements and zzso zzso of intervening zzso zzso This additional sequence in the zzso zzso 1 of the red zzso gene was shown to have inserted into a fourth and older zzso element present in the zzso from of zzso zzso Furthermore, the size and sequence of the zzso zzso 1 of the red zzso gene is equivalent to that of the adjacent green zzso zzso The block containing the three zzso elements was not found in zzso 1 of the red or green zzso genes of Old World monkeys and orangutans but was present in zzso 1 of both the green and red zzso genes of gorillas and zzso The zzso sequence of this block in Old World primates and the estimated ages of the three elements suggest that their zzso occurred zzso in the Old World monkey lineage prior to zzso of the ancestral zzso zzso zzso After gene duplication, deletion of the entire block containing the three zzso elements from one of the genes created the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between the adjacent and highly zzso red and green zzso genes may have resulted in the formation of the zzso zzso zzso of the other zzso
