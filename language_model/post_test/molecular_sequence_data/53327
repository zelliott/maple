zzso zzso activities were studied in adult rat zzso zzso following sequential zzso on zzso Q and zzso zzso A zzso level of activity was present following cell zzso zzso on zzso Q revealed three zzso of activity, zzso zzso zzso and zzso A fourth peak, zzso was detected upon subsequent zzso of the zzso Q zzso on zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso contained predominantly a 49 zzso form of zzso zzso Peak zzso contained a 43 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso indicated both forms of zzso zzso were zzso No other bands of zzso zzso activity were zzso Both forms of zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso and have therefore been named zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso 12 as a zzso zzso zzso whereas the behavior of zzso zzso suggested both a zzso zzso zzso and higher molecular mass zzso Both activities zzso zzso on zzso zzso and two-dimensional zzso mapping indicated the same sites were zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso activity with zzso blocked zzso by zzso However, whereas zzso zzso inhibited only the zzso zzso zzso inhibited both zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate the presence of two forms of zzso zzso in adult zzso zzso Both forms are activated indirectly by the zzso zzso zzso zzso and directly by zzso zzso zzso but independently zzso
