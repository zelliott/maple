In budding zzso a switch between the mutually exclusive pathways of cell cycle progression and zzso is controlled at Start in late zzso zzso zzso zzso promote zzso by arresting cells in zzso phase before zzso zzso cell cycle arrest requires a functional zzso zzso We have found that zzso zzso and protein zzso are regulated independently during the cell zzso zzso zzso and protein are highly expressed in early zzso but decline sharply at zzso zzso is zzso just before it disappears at zzso suggesting that modification may target zzso for zzso Although zzso zzso levels rise again during late S or zzso phase, zzso of zzso protein to functional levels is restricted until after nuclear zzso
