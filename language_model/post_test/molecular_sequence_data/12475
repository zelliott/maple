zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso component of plant cell walls and the most abundant zzso The underlying mechanisms of the zzso degradation of cellulose are of increasing commercial and ecological zzso zzso zzso from the zzso soil zzso zzso zzso is an zzso the zzso core of which consists of 210 zzso acids and is known to zzso the zzso links with inversion of zzso at the zzso zzso The major products of cellulose zzso are zzso and zzso The crystal structures of the zzso V zzso from zzso zzso in native, product zzso inactive zzso zzso and zzso zzso forms, have been determined at resolutions of zzso A or zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso domain with long zzso zzso A 40 A groove exists along the surface of the zzso and this contains the zzso zzso zzso 10 and zzso zzso The two zzso zzso sit to either side of the zzso binding groove in an ideal zzso for zzso zzso by zzso their zzso groups being separated by approximately zzso zzso The complex between zzso and inactive zzso reveals excellent density for an zzso in six of the zzso seven zzso binding zzso No sugar zzso however, is seen bound to the zzso zzso at the point of zzso The geometry of the zzso site suggests that the zzso would favor the binding of zzso with an zzso zzso bond, as found in the transition state, as opposed to the binding of zzso The zzso complexes reveal zzso water suitably placed for participation in a single displacement reaction as first suggested by zzso in 1953 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 28, zzso A large zzso change takes place upon zzso zzso This zzso zzso has the effect of increasing the zzso environment of the zzso zzso zzso enclosing the active site at the point of zzso and bringing a third zzso zzso zzso in close proximity to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso has been used to confirm their significance in zzso
