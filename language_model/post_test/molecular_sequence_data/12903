zzso hormone zzso is a brain zzso protein that controls insect zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso the zzso of which consists of 109 zzso zzso zzso sequence similarity to any other proteins has not been zzso By zzso pattern analysis and modeling of the zzso structure based on the known three-dimensional zzso structures of growth factor family with zzso zzso we propose that the zzso zzso adopts the fold unique to the structural zzso of the growth factors, zzso growth factor zzso transforming growth zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso growth zzso zzso The insect zzso zzso appears to be a member of the growth factor zzso sharing a common ancestral gene with the three zzso growth factors, zzso zzso 2 and zzso
