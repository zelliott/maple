zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso catalyze an identical reaction differing in zzso specificity in only the zzso of a single zzso However, the proteins show little sequence zzso at the zzso acid zzso Here we investigate the zzso of zzso selectivity of these zzso The zzso coli zzso zzso zzso cloned into a zzso expression zzso and zzso in zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso of the natural zzso zzso with values of zzso and zzso of zzso and zzso zzso In the synthetic direction, zzso zzso efficiently zzso an zzso addition using a limited number of zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A zzso scale reaction between zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso produced the zzso zzso of the R zzso in zzso zzso a result complementary to that observed using the related zzso zzso The native crystal structure has been solved to a resolution of zzso and displays the same zzso zzso as zzso zzso We have also determined a zzso structure of a Schiff base complex between the zzso and its zzso This model predicts that a single zzso acid change, zzso in zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso plays an important role in determining the zzso course of zzso zzso and this prediction was borne out by zzso zzso zzso However, additional changes in the zzso sequence are required to prepare an zzso with both high zzso efficiency and altered zzso
