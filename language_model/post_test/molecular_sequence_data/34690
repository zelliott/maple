To investigate the prevalence of zzso cell zzso zzso in systemic zzso zzso and the target zzso zzso 

zzso of 113 patients with zzso of different kinds, 46 patients with zzso disease, 23 patients with zzso zzso 19 patients with zzso zzso 8 patients with zzso zzso 7 patients with microscopic zzso and 10 patients with zzso syndrome were collected to detect the protein expression of zzso by Western zzso with the protein of the zzso cells of the line zzso zzso line as zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso liquid zzso zzso mass zzso was used to detect the target zzso related to zzso zzso of 57 patients with systemic lupus zzso zzso 25 patients with zzso arthritis zzso and 20 healthy persons were collected as zzso 

The zzso rate of the zzso patients was zzso not significantly different from that of the zzso patients zzso but significantly higher than those of the zzso patients zzso P zzso zzso and healthy persons zzso P zzso zzso The zzso from the zzso patients reacted with the zzso cell zzso zzso with the molecular size of 26 to 125 zzso and the zzso from the zzso patients reacted with the zzso zzso with the molecular size of 15 to 97 zzso The zzso zzso with the molecular size of 47 zzso was commonly found in the zzso of the zzso zzso patients and zzso patients, however, was not found in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso protein reacted by 47 zzso protein was identified by zzso techniques as zzso 

A group of zzso zzso zzso can be found frequently in patients with zzso and zzso zzso zzso against a common zzso zzso zzso
