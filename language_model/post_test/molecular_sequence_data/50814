The production of substance P zzso and the zzso zzso its precursor zzso zzso is regulated by nerve growth factor zzso in zzso root zzso zzso We have shown previously that two regions of the bovine zzso promoter are capable of zzso the induction by zzso of the downstream structural gene in zzso zzso zzso Both regions contained a sequence element, similar to a known zzso factor binding site, which is present in several other zzso zzso We show here that zzso cells contain a zzso DNA binding protein zzso which can interact specifically with this zzso zzso activity was increased by zzso treatment of zzso zzso
