The zzso and zzso families of zzso DNA zzso zzso by zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso nuclear and zzso zzso are characterized by the sequence motifs zzso and zzso zzso These zzso have been shown to occur in different zzso zzso zzso are found in zzso zzso and group I zzso and as free standing open reading frames zzso zzso zzso occur in group I and group II zzso and as zzso Here, statistical models zzso zzso models, zzso that zzso both the zzso motifs and more variable regions of these families have been created and employed to characterize known and potential new family zzso A number of new, putative zzso and zzso zzso have been identified including an zzso zzso zzso Analysis of an zzso multiple alignment of 130 zzso family members and the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso I zzso has enabled definition of the core elements of the repeated domain zzso 90 zzso that is present in this family of zzso A zzso zzso charged zzso is proposed to be involved in zzso zzso analysis of the two families indicates a lack of exchange of zzso between different mobile elements zzso and between hosts from different zzso zzso However, there does appear to have been considerable exchange of zzso zzso amongst elements of the same zzso Such events are suggested to be important for the formation of elements of new zzso
