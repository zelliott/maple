The zzso region zzso of zzso C virus zzso contains an internal zzso entry site zzso that directs translation of the viral open reading frame zzso The zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso in most zzso and multiple segments within this region are important for its zzso zzso zzso analysis of a full-length zzso zzso clone derived from a Japanese zzso patient showed the zzso was zzso zzso long due to a zzso T zzso at position zzso The influence of this T zzso on the zzso activity in directing zzso translation was zzso The zzso of the zzso was approximately five- and two- to zzso more active in directing zzso expression in zzso and zzso expression systems, respectively, when compared with the zzso of the zzso of a previously reported zzso zzso In addition to the T zzso another point zzso involving an A to C transition at position 119 was also present in the zzso zzso comparison of the zzso activities in engineered zzso that contained each of the two zzso indicated that the zzso at position zzso is responsible for the enhanced zzso activity of the zzso Further determination of the abilities of the engineered zzso zzso A, G, or C insertions at the same position to initiate translation indicated that both T and zzso zzso insertions lead to enhanced zzso zzso
