Internal zzso size in zzso occurs over a narrow size zzso zzso zzso shorter than 50 zzso are poorly included in zzso unless accompanied by strengthened zzso sites or accessory sequences that act as zzso zzso suggesting zzso interference between zzso and other zzso factors binding simultaneously to the 3' and zzso zzso sites of zzso Despite these problems, very small naturally occurring zzso zzso Here we studied the factors and mechanism involved in recognizing a zzso included zzso zzso from the cardiac zzso T zzso zzso of this zzso is dependent on an zzso located downstream of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso contains six copies of the simple sequence zzso The zzso activates zzso zzso and will work when located either upstream or downstream of the target zzso suggesting an ability to bind factors that bridge zzso zzso A single copy of this sequence is sufficient for in zzso zzso inclusion and is the binding site for the known bridging zzso zzso factor 1 zzso The zzso and its bound zzso act to increase recognition of the upstream zzso during zzso definition, such that competition of in zzso reactions with zzso containing the zzso repeated sequence zzso zzso of the upstream zzso assembly of the zzso on the 3' zzso site of the zzso and zzso of zzso These results suggest a model in which zzso bridges the small zzso during initial zzso thereby effectively extending the domain of the zzso
