In the newly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso become localized zzso along the zzso zzso axis of the zzso The zzso apparatus then zzso so as to cleave the zzso into anterior and zzso zzso that differ in both size and zzso zzso Here we describe a role for zzso a member of the zzso family of protein zzso in zzso cell division in zzso zzso In zzso zzso the initial zzso zzso is misplaced and zzso factors, including the zzso protein zzso are zzso Our findings support a model in which zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso to control zzso positioning and acts through zzso as yet unknown factors, to control the zzso of zzso zzso These findings in conjunction with work from zzso zzso indicate a possible zzso role for zzso family zzso in the regulation of zzso placement during cell zzso
