zzso is a naturally fermented rice zzso mash traditionally used for zzso vegetables in Japan; its zzso and zzso cycles sometimes continue for many zzso Here, we investigated the structure and dynamics of the bacterial community in zzso by conducting zzso and quantitative zzso chain reaction zzso analyses of zzso zzso zzso genes zzso Of the 16 different samples zzso 13 showed zzso zzso suggesting that aged zzso samples tend to realize a zzso favorable zzso zzso The zzso acid bacterial community of each of the 16 samples was classified into 3 types according to the presence or absence of 2 zzso species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso The dynamics of the bacterial community during zzso and the subsequent zzso process were examined using a laboratory model of zzso zzso with an aged zzso sample zzso zzso zzso zzso grew rapidly in the first 2 days, accompanied with a rapid decrease in pH and an increase in zzso levels, while zzso zzso grew with a longer doubling time and slow zzso during the 20 days after zzso On the other hand, spontaneous zzso of the zzso model prepared from fresh rice zzso without the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the growth of some zzso species such as zzso and zzso within the first 10 zzso thereafter, zzso zzso was dominant, while zzso zzso was not detected during the zzso experimental zzso These results suggest that the naturally established zzso community in aged zzso is effectively involved in the zzso of the microbial community of zzso during the zzso and zzso zzso
