zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a widespread zzso catalyzing the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso a reaction that zzso in many zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the model zzso zzso zzso possesses on the zzso island a gene zzso zzso an zzso CA zzso zzso as zzso In the present work, the zzso open reading frame from zzso zzso strain zzso was zzso zzso and zzso zzso and it was proven to be an active zzso The zzso and zzso roles of the zzso gene in zzso and symbiotic zzso were examined by using an zzso zzso zzso disruption zzso zzso Our analysis revealed that zzso is expressed in both zzso zzso and zzso bacteria during growth in batch cultures, where gene expression was induced by increased medium zzso zzso zzso plants zzso with the zzso zzso strain showed no differences in zzso traits and nutritional status but consistently formed a higher number of zzso exhibiting higher fresh weight, N content, zzso activity, and zzso zzso Based on these results, we propose that although zzso is not essential for zzso development and symbiotic nitrogen zzso it may participate in an auxiliary mechanism that buffers the zzso zzso creating an environment favorable for zzso zzso thus zzso its diffusion and transport to the zzso In addition, changes in the zzso zzso abundance suggest the recycling of at least part of the zzso produced by zzso
