The properties of zzso DNA junctions differ from those of zzso junctions in several zzso Most apparently, bases zzso the branch are zzso to single strand specific agents in zzso junctions but not zzso zzso To determine the basis for this, we have designed and zzso a series of complexes in which a short duplex, a neck, progressively extends from a parent zzso DNA zzso These structure allow us to investigate how a zzso branch forms, and how its properties change as the neck zzso zzso of the properties of a zzso duplex with those of the neck structures using native gel zzso with reporter arms attached reveals progressively greater geometrical zzso of the complexes as the number of zzso in the neck zzso zzso by zzso specific zzso indicates that the zzso to zzso zzso near the branch occurs when only a single pair is zzso The branch in each neck interacts tightly with zzso as does a zzso in the same zzso The thermodynamics of neck formation have been evaluated by zzso and from the concentration dependence of zzso temperature zzso Each neck complex is zzso with respect to duplex DNA or a zzso duplex, and has a lower zzso of formation despite the increased number of zzso zzso A model is proposed to account for these properties in which the bases in the pair adjacent to the duplex interact directly with the duplex, via transient zzso
