A zzso DNA unwinding activity was found in highly zzso zzso of the calf zzso zzso DNA binding protein zzso also known as replication protein A zzso or replication factor A zzso This activity depended on the zzso of zzso or zzso and used zzso with a lower zzso zzso promoted the zzso DNA zzso alpha to perform DNA synthesis on zzso templates containing replication zzso zzso The rate and amount of DNA synthesis was found to be dependent on the concentration of zzso At a zzso mass excess of zzso over zzso DNA, products of zzso zzso in length were zzso This comprises or even exceeds the length of a zzso Okazaki zzso The zzso DNA zzso activity is most likely a distinct protein rather than an inherent property of zzso as zzso from zzso experiments between zzso and zzso The association of a zzso with zzso and the zzso action of this complex to the DNA zzso zzso synthesis of zzso DNA suggests a cooperative function of the three zzso activities in the process of zzso DNA zzso
