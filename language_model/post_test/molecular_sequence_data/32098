zzso of the zzso system is tightly regulated by an array of zzso that control zzso differentiation and zzso of various cell zzso To identify genes that are essential for zzso zzso we screened zzso mice that had been zzso zzso by zzso zzso to produce altered blood cell zzso We identified a zzso mouse line with a drastic reduction in the number of T and B cell lineages in zzso zzso and peripheral blood, as well as severe zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with a zzso single zzso zzso zzso marker set mapped the zzso zzso to zzso 3A and subsequent direct DNA sequencing revealed a zzso point zzso in the zzso donor site of the third zzso of the candidate gene for zzso a zzso survival zzso Such zzso resulted in skipping of zzso 3 and production of an internally truncated zzso zzso Furthermore, using zzso proteins produced in a zzso system, we demonstrated that zzso had no zzso zzso activity even at a dose that was 30 times more than that required for a zzso protein to manifest a full activity in a zzso T cell survival zzso Our data suggest that this zzso mouse line provides an alternative animal model for the study of severe combined zzso zzso syndrome in zzso
