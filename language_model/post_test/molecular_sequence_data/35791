The Chinese zzso cell line, zzso is zzso at the zzso zzso and each zzso can be distinguished on the basis of a unique DNA restriction pattern, protein zzso profile and in the zzso of the zzso zzso it zzso Although each zzso produces four zzso zzso 1650 and zzso zzso zzso in zzso the relative distribution of these zzso differs for each; the zzso zzso zzso represents the major zzso species generated from one zzso while the 1000 zzso zzso is the major species generated from the zzso The zzso that predominantly expresses the zzso zzso transcript is zzso zzso when zzso cells are subjected to selection in zzso We have analyzed the 3' ends of both zzso zzso and have found that the three major zzso arise by zzso of multiple zzso zzso A four base deletion in one zzso changes the consensus zzso signal zzso to zzso resulting in the zzso of a cryptic zzso signal lying 21 zzso zzso Surprisingly, this zzso in the third zzso signal appears to affect not only the zzso of this zzso but also the efficiency with which the first zzso located zzso zzso upstream from the third site, is zzso
