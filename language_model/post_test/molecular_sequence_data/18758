Comparative zzso zzso and genetic analysis revealed significant similarities among strains of the zzso zzso and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences and zzso zzso of the type strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed sequence similarity of zzso and less than zzso zzso indicating that these strains represent different species of same zzso Both strains had zzso zzso zzso and zzso as major polar zzso Their fatty acid profiles were almost zzso with the zzso fatty acids zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In view of this, we propose to transfer the member of the zzso zzso to the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso and to zzso the description of the zzso zzso Further, a novel zzso strain zzso was isolated from a zzso hot spring located at zzso India, and was identified following a zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso rods and zzso by a single polar zzso zzso temperature for growth was zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed zzso similarity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of strain zzso with these two type strains was well below zzso The DNA zzso base composition was zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
