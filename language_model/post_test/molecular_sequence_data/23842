zzso systematic analysis of the zzso gene zzso characterized the evolutionary origin, frequency and range of structural variation in calcium interaction zzso that are considered intrinsic for membrane targeting and zzso channel zzso zzso zzso of zzso repeat zzso in an estimated 100 distinct zzso contained zzso acid changes consistent with the functional loss of type two zzso zzso At least zzso of zzso zzso contained a novel zzso motif zzso in particular zzso and manifest in all zzso apparently via zzso zzso The first zzso zzso from zzso zzso was classified in the zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso This zzso had intact zzso sites but disruption of the normally zzso zzso 4 region implicated in calcium channel zzso zzso a tandem pair of novel zzso from the zzso zzso zzso resembled zzso A13 in gene structure and zzso the charged zzso acids associated with the internal zzso zzso but were devoid of external type 2 zzso sites and incorporated zzso motifs instead, like zzso zzso The selective erosion of zzso sites in zzso zzso and the occurrence of alternate zzso in the same exposed, zzso zzso are pervasive features of the zzso This suggests greater complexity than previously appreciated in the mechanisms controlling zzso membrane interaction and calcium channel zzso
