zzso induce both zzso zzso and egg shell zzso zzso zzso protein synthesis in zzso However, while zzso is strictly under zzso control, recent reports suggest that additional mechanisms are involved in zzso protein zzso During sexual maturation both zzso and zzso levels increase in the circulation of female zzso As zzso have been shown to interfere with zzso induction in fish we investigated whether cortisol zzso had similar effects on zzso zzso In the present study we determined both the natural variation in zzso and zzso during an annual zzso cycle in female Arctic zzso zzso zzso and the effect of zzso of juvenile Arctic zzso with zzso zzso and zzso During sexual maturation the expression of zzso and zzso correlated to plasma levels of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso and zzso protein levels following zzso with zzso and F showed that F antagonized zzso induction of zzso However, F was observed to zzso the expression of zzso protein in the same zzso These results indicate that in Arctic zzso zzso and zzso proteins are not regulated by the same mechanisms and suggest that zzso protein expression does not necessarily imply exposure to zzso compounds alone, and may thus not be zzso suited as a zzso of exposure to zzso zzso
