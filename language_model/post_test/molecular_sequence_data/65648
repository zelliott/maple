zzso zzso zzso of proteins is mainly a zzso process in which one or a few zzso acids at zzso sites on the protein are zzso zzso The zzso of proteins by zzso can lead to zzso of zzso acid zzso side zzso zzso of the zzso bonds and formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso In an attempt to zzso the products of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso fragments of zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso methods and zzso zzso as a model zzso system were zzso The zzso solution zzso zzso was incubated at 37 degrees C for 24 h with metal : zzso : hydrogen zzso 1 : 1 : 4 zzso ratio in zzso zzso pH zzso zzso targets for all studied peptides are the zzso zzso coordinated to the metal zzso For the zzso and zzso peptides the zzso of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso is zzso The zzso of the zzso bond zzso for the zzso zzso was detected as metal binding zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso near the zzso zzso were observed supporting the participation of this zzso zzso in the coordination of the zzso zzso
