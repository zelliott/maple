zzso human tissue zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso cells carries, in part, zzso zzso which are characterized by the presence of a zzso alpha zzso zzso In order to study the zzso of this novel structural element, corresponding zzso zzso zzso were zzso in zzso using a crude zzso preparation from zzso liver which was shown to contain Gal beta zzso alpha zzso zzso Products were analyzed for transfer of zzso acid zzso by zzso zzso The results demonstrated that zzso of zzso did not zzso zzso it may be concluded that transfer of the zzso group is the final step in the zzso of this structural zzso
