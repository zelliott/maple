The distribution of zzso zzso on the zzso 55,000 zzso zzso alpha and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso preparations of zzso zzso zzso alpha and zzso beta were reduced and zzso and zzso with zzso When the zzso zzso were mapped by zzso each zzso yielded only one zzso containing zzso zzso of the zzso was achieved by a zzso zzso zzso zzso were applied to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and beta zzso were zzso with buffer containing 50 zzso zzso as the zzso zzso Further zzso of each zzso was accomplished by reverse phase zzso zzso zzso were characterized with respect to zzso acid and zzso compositions and zzso by automated zzso degradation; alpha zzso was a zzso zzso with three zzso sugar zzso zzso comparisons revealed a zzso identity between alpha zzso and a corresponding segment of rabbit zzso zzso zzso beta zzso was a zzso zzso characterized by the presence of one zzso and five zzso sugar chains and a zzso internal zzso zzso zzso alignments revealed an zzso or greater identity between beta zzso and internal peptides of zzso zzso and human zzso zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that in the case of zzso alpha and zzso zzso the pig zzso of rabbit zzso and mouse zzso respectively, zzso zzso are confined within zzso zzso rather than widely dispersed on the zzso zzso Such zzso of zzso zzso may represent an essential zzso of the structure and biological activity of zzso zzso
