The zzso zzso zzso was found to be persistently infected with zzso zzso 3 zzso The persistently infected zzso culture produced approximately 1 zzso zzso zzso units of virus per zzso of culture zzso and a majority of cells in the culture were zzso as determined by infectious center zzso and zzso zzso of the persistent infection was achieved by zzso zzso cells for 33 days (12 zzso in medium containing zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso specific for the zzso attachment zzso After several passages in zzso zzso cured zzso cells had zzso zzso levels of zzso in zzso zzso zzso no infectious centers per 3 zzso zzso cells, zzso no zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso no zzso zzso zzso by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso Additionally, mice zzso with cured zzso cell zzso did not generate zzso directed against zzso These observations demonstrate that persistent zzso infection of a zzso zzso can be cured by passage in medium containing zzso zzso and suggest that the maintenance of this persistent infection is dependent on horizontal zzso transmission of virus in the zzso
