The synthesis of the zzso Absorbing compounds named zzso zzso has been detected in a few zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso requires zzso and its zzso function has been zzso The distribution of the ability to produce zzso appeared to be related to the zzso zzso zzso In view of the potential significance of zzso in zzso zzso we here studied the distribution of this trait among zzso zzso of the zzso Of the 94 zzso species zzso strains and 33 zzso tested, almost half were zzso and zzso was the main compound zzso zzso synthesis was observed for representatives of five of seven zzso classes, indicating that this trait is widely distributed in this zzso zzso detection proved useful for the differentiation of species of the zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso that are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tolerance studies in zzso supported the idea that the habitat of origin of each strains is important in the level of zzso synthesis and that zzso have a zzso function in zzso The zzso value of this trait in zzso zzso is zzso
