The zzso relationships among 36 zzso described species or subspecies within the zzso zzso were investigated by cloning and sequencing their 60 zzso zzso protein zzso genes using a set of universal zzso zzso zzso zzso The cloned partial zzso DNA sequences from nine zzso zzso strains were highly zzso zzso DNA sequence zzso mean zzso indicating that the zzso gene of multiple zzso within the same species have little zzso At the subspecies level, DNA sequence similarity among members of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso ranged from 91 to zzso At the zzso level, sequence similarity among 23 distinct species of zzso ranged from 74 to zzso zzso zzso By comparison, the highest sequence similarity of zzso zzso and zzso coli with members within the zzso zzso was only 70 and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso distance method revealed remarkable zzso between the tree derived from partial zzso gene sequences and that based on zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso gene sequences correlated less zzso The results demonstrate that DNA sequences from the highly zzso and ubiquitous zzso gene offer a convenient and accurate tool for zzso identification and zzso analysis of zzso
