A DNA zzso analysis identified the zzso zzso family member, zzso as a transcript that is zzso during induction of zzso by zzso zzso zzso depended on zzso zzso to induce zzso and activate the death zzso Further, zzso independently induced zzso zzso and zzso and zzso alone zzso cell death in zzso cells, dependent on the zzso of zzso zzso function, however, was zzso by a disabling point zzso within the zzso zzso zzso these results argue that zzso is a downstream zzso zzso of zzso in response to a zzso zzso death stimulus provided by zzso zzso zzso functioned downstream of zzso and zzso induction to inhibit the zzso death pathway, with the ratio of zzso zzso and zzso zzso determining cell death or survival in zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso or treated with the pan zzso zzso zzso allowed zzso of high levels of zzso zzso compared to control zzso Of note, a significant fraction of either zzso or zzso zzso was found associated with the zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso in addition to zzso may be a target of zzso zzso
