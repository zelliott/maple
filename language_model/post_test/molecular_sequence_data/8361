Multiple forms of zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso strains isolated from the zzso blood or zzso fluid expressing either Class I or Class II zzso zzso expression was observed less frequently in case as opposed to carrier zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso were not always zzso Several heavily zzso strains had no zzso zzso protein as determined by Western zzso using an zzso previously used to detect such proteins in adhesive zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso B strain zzso produced large numbers of zzso but expressed barely zzso amounts of zzso A zzso zzso of this strain with increased expression of zzso zzso exhibited increased adherence to Chang zzso zzso cells and human zzso vein zzso cells zzso but with more rapid binding to the zzso No zzso in zzso sequence occurred in this zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso in increased zzso A zzso zzso isolated from the zzso zzso was zzso but was zzso indicating that any zzso adherence function requires zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produced zzso in zzso that were easily detached from the bacterial surface and were frequently associated with zzso surfaces after bacteria had been sheared off, but zzso infrequently replaced bacteria during infection with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso which appeared to produce zzso distinct zzso zzso was able to withstand considerable zzso force and remained firmly attached to zzso This raises the possibility that the observed zzso may arise from better zzso of zzso to the bacterial surface in addition to increased zzso to some host cell zzso
