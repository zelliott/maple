Previous analyses of zzso zzso revealed a loss of control of directional cellular expansion and coordination of growth of adjacent cells, and defects in zzso and zzso We isolated zzso using a zzso approach, and show that it is a member of a family of at least three genes in zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso transcript was most abundant in flowers, where it accumulated to the highest levels in developing zzso and zzso The putative zzso protein has two zzso regions that are similar to the zzso zzso of a variety of proteins from plants and animals, including a class of zzso involved in zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins indicated that zzso is a nuclear zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the novelty of the zzso sequence suggest the existence of previously unknown participants in regulation of directional processes in zzso zzso
