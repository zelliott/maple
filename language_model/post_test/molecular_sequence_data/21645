Limited or regulatory zzso plays a critical role in many important biological pathways like blood zzso cell zzso and zzso A better understanding of mechanisms that control this process is required for discovering new zzso events and for developing zzso with potential therapeutic zzso Two features that determine the zzso of zzso bonds to zzso are the sequence in the vicinity of the zzso bond and the structural context in which the bond is zzso In this study, we assessed statistical significance and zzso power of individual structural zzso and combination zzso for the identification of zzso zzso The analysis was performed on a data set of zzso zzso events documented in zzso for a variety of zzso regulatory zzso and their zzso zzso with known zzso zzso The results confirmed the significance and provided a ranking within three main categories of structural features: exposure zzso flexibility zzso local zzso Among secondary structure zzso the largest frequency of zzso zzso was confirmed for zzso and lower but significant frequency for zzso Limited zzso has lower albeit appreciable frequency of occurrence in certain types of zzso which is in contrast with some previous zzso zzso deduced directly from the zzso acid sequence displayed only marginal zzso zzso zzso structural models showed a zzso performance comparable to protein zzso with zzso established zzso Overall, this study provided a foundation for accurate automated prediction of segments of protein structure susceptible to zzso processing and, zzso other zzso zzso
