Many plant virus coat proteins have binding sites for zzso zzso particularly zzso It has been speculated that the purpose of such sites is to ensure that plant viruses release their zzso only in the host zzso which has a low calcium zzso By comparison to tomato bushy stunt virus, two of the zzso acids that probably interact directly with calcium zzso in zzso zzso virus zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso with zzso zzso by zzso zzso to create the zzso zzso zzso coat zzso and zzso accumulated to zzso levels in isolated zzso zzso zzso were able to zzso and to initiate de zzso replication in zzso although no symptoms were observed in plants zzso with zzso zzso zzso accumulated to much lower levels than zzso zzso in zzso leaves and was not detected in zzso zzso zzso The lower zzso of zzso in plants may be due to a decreased capacity to move efficiently from cell to cell, and we suggest the possibility that zzso coat protein plays an active, pivotal role in zzso movement zzso
