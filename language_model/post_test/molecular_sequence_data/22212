zzso form structural filaments in the zzso zzso in zzso zzso cause muscular dystrophy, zzso and other diseases, including zzso zzso To identify new binding partners for zzso A, we carried out a zzso screen with a human zzso zzso library, using the zzso domain of zzso A as zzso The zzso region of zzso was recovered zzso Previous investigators showed that nuclear zzso of zzso are essential for zzso zzso during zzso Our zzso fragment, which includes two regions unique to zzso zzso and zzso bound directly to both A- and zzso zzso in zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso A zzso zzso and zzso was reduced zzso Studies in living cells suggested zzso interactions were zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso two independent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso at the nuclear zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso at the nuclear envelope suggesting its zzso or stability requires zzso In human cells zzso zzso against the zzso domain zzso gave both diffuse and zzso zzso zzso by indirect zzso and recognized at least three bands larger than 1 zzso in zzso of isolated zzso zzso In zzso cells that zzso zzso a zzso zzso of zzso zzso became zzso zzso and zzso at sites lacking zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso of nuclear zzso binds zzso in zzso and might contribute to nuclear organization during zzso
