zzso zzso was used to examine the zzso importance of 2 zzso and 4 zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso acid zzso zzso The zzso that were selected as targets for zzso were those that were also zzso in a number of high molecular weight acid zzso from zzso organisms, including human zzso and zzso acid zzso Both wild type zzso and zzso proteins were zzso in zzso coli using an expression system based on the zzso zzso zzso promoter, and the proteins were zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso proteins by circular zzso and zzso zzso zzso revealed no significant zzso zzso The replacement of zzso and zzso zzso that were localized in a zzso zzso zzso motif resulted in the complete elimination of zzso zzso zzso Critical roles for zzso zzso and zzso were also established because the corresponding zzso proteins exhibited residual activities that were not higher than zzso of that of wild type zzso In contrast, the replacement of zzso did not cause a significant zzso of the kinetic zzso The results are in agreement with a previously zzso distant relationship between acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso These and earlier results are also consistent with the conclusion that 2 zzso zzso participate in the zzso mechanism of acid zzso with zzso playing the role of a zzso zzso of the zzso group, whereas zzso may act as a zzso donor to the alcohol or zzso
