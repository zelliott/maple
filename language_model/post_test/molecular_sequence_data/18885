zzso of zzso zzso zzso have been described as highly diverse due to their asexual nature and absence of a single cell stage with only one zzso This has raised fundamental questions concerning zzso selection and transmission of the genetic zzso to next zzso Although this concept has become textbook knowledge, it is only based on studying a few zzso including zzso zzso To provide a more comprehensive insight into the genetic makeup of zzso zzso zzso we applied de zzso zzso sequencing of individual zzso of zzso zzso This revealed a surprisingly low level of zzso between zzso In contrast, within a nucleus, the zzso zzso repeat unit turned out to be highly zzso This finding zzso a long-lasting hypothesis on the complex genetic makeup of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assembly resulted in the first draft reference zzso sequence of an zzso zzso zzso Its length is 141 zzso representing over 27,000 zzso gene zzso We used the zzso sequence to zzso the zzso relationships of zzso zzso with other zzso zzso This zzso demonstrated that zzso are more closely related to zzso than to its zzso sister zzso
