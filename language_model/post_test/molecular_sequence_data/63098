In zzso of zzso zzso zzso transformation of zzso to zzso marks the transition from zzso to zzso zzso zzso factors required for this zzso step were identified by zzso zzso of zzso zzso that were impaired in zzso development in zzso but not in true zzso Several zzso with zzso zzso were isolated and dubbed snowy zzso zzso Here we describe the identification and detailed characterization of the snowy zzso 2 zzso The zzso zzso gene was identified using a zzso cloning zzso zzso was shown to zzso a novel protein which contains a single zzso zinc finger zzso The zzso protein fused to zzso was shown to be present in zzso zzso of zzso has almost no zzso impact on the levels of transcripts zzso zzso proteins but leads to a significant reduction of zzso protein zzso Even though transcripts of zzso have been found zzso in green zzso as well as in roots zzso changes due to zzso zzso are confined to zzso The zzso in zzso of zzso are unaffected in their zzso zzso Upon precocious zzso zzso of zzso and wild type are zzso The zzso zzso affects zzso zzso only at the end of dormancy during seed zzso The transition from zzso to zzso growth is dramatically impaired in zzso when zzso were kept in the dark for more than 5 days prior to light zzso
