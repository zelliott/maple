In this study, the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso was used as an zzso to accelerate organic matter degradation of rabbit food with added organic zzso which was used as a model food waste for zzso The zzso strain rapidly zzso the organic acids present in the raw zzso material, leading to an increase in pH beyond the neutral level, within 2 zzso Both zzso and zzso bacteria proliferated faster in the zzso with zzso zzso than in that without zzso Although the zzso died with the increase in zzso temperature, it affected the early stages of composting prior to the zzso stage and accelerated the composting process by 2 days by eliminating the initial lag phase seen in the growth of other zzso Moreover, populations of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso became dominant during the zzso stages of both composting with and without zzso zzso
