It was previously shown that zzso zzso polystyrene derivatives specifically zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso present in the zzso of systemic lupus zzso zzso These zzso are potential candidates as stationary zzso in affinity zzso We wondered whether these zzso zzso might allow the zzso of DNA binding proteins such as zzso zzso II zzso factors from zzso cell nuclear zzso Indeed, these proteins play a major role in gene regulation in zzso cells and their zzso still requires numerous zzso To study the zzso of zzso zzso polystyrene zzso zzso zzso zzso polystyrene derivatives were zzso at various rates and zzso cell nuclear extracts were zzso on these zzso zzso proteins were zzso with increasing zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and the biological activities of the zzso zzso factors were tested by in zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso of zzso factors depended on the substitution rate in zzso groups of the zzso It appears that specific interactions were developed between the zzso and the zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso factors kept their biological zzso These results lead us to propose the zzso of zzso zzso II zzso factors using the zzso polystyrene zzso as stationary zzso
