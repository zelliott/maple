zzso protein zzso zzso zzso comprise a newly identified class of zzso zzso In most cases their zzso and the zzso they zzso are not zzso In order to begin to explore the functions of the zzso in cell physiology and in zzso development, we examined the expression patterns of two closely related zzso zzso zzso zzso namely zzso and zzso zzso in fetal rat lung and in selected adult rat zzso In the zzso in zzso zzso and zzso show that the zzso zzso and protein are expressed exclusively in the zzso In the early embryonic or fetal lung zzso 13 to zzso zzso is expressed by all of the zzso cells of the forming zzso zzso This widespread pattern of expression is lost later in fetal life zzso zzso as the lung matures and acquires the zzso and zzso features of the adult zzso zzso gene expression is then confined to two zzso zzso cells of the zzso zzso namely the zzso Clara cell and the zzso type II zzso The zzso gene products were also found abundantly expressed in zzso zzso cells of adult zzso skin, and small zzso all of which are continuously renewing zzso The rat zzso delta zzso on the other hand, is specifically expressed in the zzso of the developing zzso The level of the zzso delta zzso decreases as the lung zzso These results suggest that the two closely related zzso zzso zzso are zzso expressed in a zzso zzso They are expressed mostly in zzso cells or in cells which have potential to zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
