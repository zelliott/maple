In zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments on 3 zzso zzso 5) zzso solutions of zzso zzso zzso zzso show a decrease in the relative height of the zzso zzso band associated with zzso stretching zzso at 72 degrees C (1 zzso The peak height changes are accompanied by significant band zzso and the integrated band intensity does not change within experimental zzso The effect of increased pressure at 72 degrees C was to hinder broadening of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pH 5) was also heated at 76 degrees C, 80 degrees C, and 95 degrees C for different periods of time, and zzso were zzso to room temperature for zzso and zzso activity zzso After 9 zzso at 76 degrees C, the protein exhibits zzso activity less than 50% of the initial value, and approximately 50% reduction in activity is achieved after 3 zzso at 80 degrees C or 1 zzso at 95 degrees zzso The zzso results suggest that different zzso zzso zzso are attained during prolonged zzso at these different zzso It is apparent from these studies that the zzso stretch intensity is decreased zzso
