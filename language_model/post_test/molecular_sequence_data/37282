zzso zzso is one of over 20 proteins known to be involved in human zzso zzso zzso equivalent to each of the seven zzso of the native zzso together with an eighth zzso zzso to the most stable region in the zzso precursor zzso formed at pH zzso that includes zzso in the native strand E plus the eight succeeding zzso (named zzso zzso were zzso and their ability to form zzso zzso Surprisingly, only two zzso both of which zzso the region that forms strand E in native zzso are capable of forming zzso zzso in zzso These peptides zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of intact zzso The peptides form zzso under the zzso conditions shown previously to promote zzso formation from the intact protein zzso zzso at low and high zzso zzso and also associate to form zzso at neutral zzso zzso formed from these two peptides enhance zzso of the intact zzso No correlation was found between secondary structure zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and the ability of the peptides to associate into zzso zzso However, the presence of a relatively high content of aromatic zzso zzso with the ability of the peptides to form zzso zzso On the basis of these results we propose that zzso zzso may be important in the zzso of partially folded zzso into zzso zzso and discuss the relevance of these results for the assembly mechanism of the intact protein in zzso
