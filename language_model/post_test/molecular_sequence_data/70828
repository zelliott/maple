Signaling events leading to B cell growth or zzso are beginning to be zzso but detailed information is still zzso To identify signaling molecules involved in B cell zzso zzso zzso zzso we used the immature B cell line, zzso to investigate protein zzso zzso zzso whose expression was modulated by zzso zzso Among the zzso cloned by reverse zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso domain zzso zzso was selectively elevated zzso within 3 h after zzso zzso zzso In contrast, expression of another zzso domain zzso zzso was zzso Western zzso analysis revealed that zzso of zzso was located in the zzso zzso while zzso was in the membrane zzso To examine the direct contribution made by zzso to zzso signal zzso we zzso an zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso Two stable clones were established in which zzso expression was reduced by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of DNA synthesis was significantly rescued in the zzso and zzso phase cell cycle arrest and zzso were almost completely zzso zzso zzso these results indicate that zzso is a positive, crucial regulator in determining B cell fate triggered by zzso zzso
