We have obtained the complete coding sequence of a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso which we previously characterized zzso after isolation from rat zzso An open reading frame of zzso zzso acids encodes a protein with a molecular mass of 62 zzso containing three zzso sequences present in the isolated zzso The total sequence obtained is zzso zzso long, including zzso zzso of zzso sequence and zzso zzso of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence and the zzso and zzso sequences have zzso and zzso identity, respectively, with those of a zzso human lung zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for which zzso is zzso in a large number of human cell zzso Our data therefore demonstrate that this major zzso zzso zzso of brain is the rat form of zzso
