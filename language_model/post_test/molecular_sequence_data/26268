zzso zzso zzso the rat zzso cell zzso for zzso was isolated from a zzso library and functionally expressed in cultured zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso as predicted from the zzso is a single zzso zzso with a 348 zzso zzso domain which contains three zzso zzso zzso This domain is connected to a structure containing seven putative zzso segments which displays sequence similarity to G zzso zzso Thus, the zzso is identical in its structural design to the zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, both receptors display 50% sequence similarity in their large zzso zzso and zzso identity across the seven zzso zzso zzso of the cloned zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso The selectivity for zzso is zzso by the fact that the related human zzso hormones human zzso and human zzso do not stimulate zzso zzso in zzso expressing cells even when these hormones are present at high zzso
