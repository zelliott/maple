The zzso zzso zzso zzso has an outstanding capacity to produce and store zzso resembling zzso of higher zzso Here, the identification of two genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso major zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso zzso expression of either zzso or zzso in a zzso of the budding zzso zzso zzso defective in zzso synthesis restores the formation of this neutral zzso Whereas zzso requires zzso as a zzso for zzso of zzso zzso is an zzso independent zzso zzso using zzso as zzso Growth of zzso zzso strains deleted of zzso and/or zzso on zzso containing medium significantly decreases zzso zzso Most interestingly, when zzso acid serves as the carbon source the ratio of zzso zzso in zzso to zzso is significantly increased in strains defective in zzso but not in zzso In zzso experiments revealed that under these conditions an additional zzso dependent zzso zzso contributes to zzso synthesis in the respective zzso Taken together, evidence is provided that zzso zzso contains at least four zzso zzso namely zzso zzso and two additional zzso zzso zzso one is zzso dependent and specifically induced upon growth on zzso zzso
