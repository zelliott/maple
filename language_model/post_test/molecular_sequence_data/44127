A zzso shuttle zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso I gene zzso of zzso was used to isolate DNA fragments from zzso zzso zzso zzso that possessed promoter activity in zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso resistance levels in zzso coli and in zzso zzso zzso and of zzso zzso levels in zzso zzso identified a zzso zzso that exhibited a high level of promoter activity in both zzso zzso analysis revealed that the promoter activity of zzso (a zzso zzso of zzso was about twice that of zzso one of the strongest characterized zzso zzso zzso contained two zzso arranged zzso zzso and zzso with overlapping and adjacent zzso and zzso regions, zzso Both promoters appear to be recognized with different efficiencies by the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso
