zzso of the zzso insect zzso contain a high mobility group protein that is zzso to the zzso high mobility group proteins zzso zzso These proteins facilitate the assembly of higher order zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso of zzso zzso was found to be zzso The zzso sites were mapped to zzso zzso and zzso and were found to be zzso for the zzso zzso (and zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso In zzso arrested cells, the extent of zzso at zzso increased, whereas zzso at zzso remained zzso In zzso cells, zzso at zzso and zzso was strongly zzso The DNA binding affinity of zzso zzso was not influenced by single zzso at zzso or zzso In contrast, zzso at both of these sites resulted in a zzso weakening of the binding activity and altered the mode of zzso zzso Since both human and zzso zzso zzso similarly to the insect zzso zzso possess zzso sites for zzso and zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso zzso our results may reflect a general mechanism that regulates the properties and function of this class of putative zzso zzso
