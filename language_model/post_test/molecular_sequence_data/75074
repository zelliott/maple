The complete gene 4 zzso sequence was determined for zzso zzso and each of 11 viral zzso selected by zzso zzso zzso Gene 4 is zzso bases in length and encodes a zzso zzso of zzso zzso acids with a calculated Mr of zzso A zzso zzso zzso site, located at zzso acid zzso divides zzso into zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso directed at zzso were used to select zzso that escaped zzso Each zzso contains a single gene 4 zzso that permits viral growth in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso were identified in six distinct zzso regions in zzso and zzso Five of the six zzso regions were found in zzso The zzso regions were primarily associated with zzso or limited zzso zzso zzso One region was identified in zzso by three zzso zzso that neutralize a broad range of zzso zzso The zzso zzso region is largely zzso and is similar to putative fusion sequences of zzso and zzso Forest zzso
