The specialized zzso zzso zzso zzso interference by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso into small fragments about 25 zzso in zzso In the crystal structure of an intact zzso zzso the zzso domain, a module that binds the end of zzso is separated from the two zzso zzso III zzso zzso zzso by a flat, positively charged zzso The 65 zzso distance between the zzso and zzso III zzso matches the length spanned by 25 base pairs of zzso Thus, zzso itself is a molecular ruler that recognizes zzso and zzso a specified distance from the zzso zzso
