Human zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso reduction of the zzso zzso zzso activity product, zzso to zzso A domain of zzso zzso zzso has primary structural features that resemble zzso zzso zzso A zzso repeat of five zzso zzso a basic domain, and a zzso zzso characterize the zzso In zzso a zzso replaces zzso The secondary structure model of zzso predicts an zzso for this zzso zzso translated by the rabbit zzso zzso system appears on a zzso gel as a single band with molecular mass of approximately 69 zzso The protein on a zzso gel separates into two zzso zzso proteins of approximately zzso + zzso zzso The zzso form, but not zzso zzso binds to a zzso DNA zzso corresponding to the mouse zzso zzso promoter region encompassing two zzso protein zzso zzso The specificity of DNA binding is suggested by the zzso zzso zzso does not bind to the same DNA zzso with one or zero zzso zzso zzso a zzso random DNA with one zzso site does not form a complex with zzso zzso in zzso translated zzso does not interact with the zzso DNA zzso with two zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso blocks both the formation of the approximately zzso specimens and zzso DNA complex zzso and zzso zzso preparations of zzso or zzso do not bind to DNA with two zzso zzso The potential significance of the zzso binding is suggested by the finding that the response of zzso in zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso with zzso reduced zzso activity, to zzso zzso zzso formed by zzso is zzso whereas induction by zzso is not zzso We propose a role for zzso in the signaling cascade for zzso complex zzso necessary for zzso zzso stress zzso
