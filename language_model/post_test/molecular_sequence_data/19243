zzso induction of functional zzso T cells by zzso vaccination in animal models has resulted in many clinical trials to test this approach in zzso melanoma zzso In this phase I clinical trial, 11 zzso melanoma patients were vaccinated zzso with 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso colony stimulating zzso The zzso vaccine was well tolerated at all tested doses, and led to grade 1-2 toxicity zzso Although all patients did show a rise in zzso zzso zzso in only 3 patients zzso zzso zzso were zzso In 2 cases, the response was directed against zzso and consisted of zzso and zzso of the zzso population; however, in both instances these cells did not produce zzso on stimulation with the unmodified zzso The third patient mounted a small zzso response against zzso In a fourth patient, a zzso zzso response zzso was found that was present before zzso but was not affected in size nor in function by the zzso None of the 11 patients responded clinically according to response evaluation criteria in solid tumors zzso Although this study is a small scale phase I clinical trial, the efficacy that was observed was disappointingly zzso In accordance with previously published zzso vaccination studies, these results add to the increasing evidence that zzso vaccination in itself is not potent enough as an effective melanoma zzso in zzso zzso
