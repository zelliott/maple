We have carried out a genetic screen designed to isolate regulators of zzso zzso One of these regulators is the Grunge zzso which encodes a protein with motifs found in human zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Grunge is the only zzso protein in zzso whereas several exist in zzso We provide evidence that Grunge is required for the proper regulation of zzso but also has multiple activities in fly zzso First, Grunge is crucial for correct zzso during zzso via a failure in the repression of at least four zzso genes known to regulate zzso Second, Grunge acts positively to regulate zzso expression in zzso parts of the zzso Grunge has other regulatory functions in the leg, including the patterning of zzso parts along the entire zzso axis and the proper spacing of zzso in all zzso
