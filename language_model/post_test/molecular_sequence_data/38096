Although zzso zzso was first characterized as a zzso zzso it is now known to be localized in the nucleus depending on various cellular events, such as cell zzso The suggested roles of zzso zzso are: to 1) regulate the biological pool of the essential metals zinc zzso and copper zzso and especially to supply zzso to zzso zzso factors through activated cell zzso and 2) to protect DNA from zzso stress including those caused by zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the nucleus might be zzso depending on cellular events, by a structural change in zzso itself or through the appearance of nuclear binding zzso Supporting the former possibility, zzso is known to have some structural features, zzso highly zzso zzso zzso which are anticipated to act as nuclear zzso signal zzso In addition, zzso appearance of zzso zzso without zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso have been zzso Supporting the latter possibility, zzso proteins might participate in the nuclear trafficking of zzso zzso an zzso zzso or a nuclear zzso of zzso We now provide an overview of the current knowledge on both zzso
