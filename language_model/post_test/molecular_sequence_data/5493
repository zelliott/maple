In zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso two zzso are required to catalyze the synthesis of zzso zzso from zzso zzso The genes zzso the class I and class II zzso zzso zzso have been cloned from both zzso The class II zzso catalyze the first zzso step from zzso to zzso zzso Representatives of the class II type zzso have been isolated only from zzso and the zzso acid sequence of these zzso contain regions of internal zzso The class I zzso catalyze the last two zzso steps from zzso to zzso The class I zzso from both zzso are zzso to the products of the zzso zzso zzso genes isolated from mouse and rat zzso in the article by Vance et zzso in this zzso Like the zzso zzso gene products, the zzso zzso class I zzso can catalyze all three zzso steps to PC zzso zzso zzso zzso in which either the class II or class I zzso is deleted, grow slowly in the absence of zzso and exhibit low levels of zzso However, in zzso zzso zzso lacking either one of the two zzso are zzso zzso Thus, both zzso are required in zzso zzso for zzso growth in the absence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso genes are regulated at the level of zzso in response to the soluble zzso zzso and zzso as well as to growth zzso The mechanism of regulation of the zzso zzso zzso is not yet understood but appears to occur zzso in response to zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso genes are regulated zzso in response to growth zzso
