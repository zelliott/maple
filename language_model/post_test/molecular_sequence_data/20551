The increasing need for large-scale zzso applications of single zzso zzso zzso in model and zzso organisms requires the development of low-cost technologies accessible to minimally equipped zzso The method presented here allows efficient discrimination of zzso by zzso zzso in a single reaction with standard zzso zzso A common reverse primer and two forward zzso zzso with different tails amplify two zzso zzso products of different zzso which are further separated by zzso gel zzso zzso specificity is improved by the introduction of a zzso mismatch within the 30 end of the zzso zzso This is a simple and inexpensive method for zzso detection that does not require zzso zzso
