We have isolated two zzso repeated zzso from human DNA which contain long blocks of zzso and zzso zzso zzso These two repeat unit types, together with other less common zzso are apparently zzso zzso along each repeat zzso zzso methods have been developed for these highly zzso zzso including typing by zzso chain reaction followed by Southern zzso zzso zzso analysis in Centre zzso du zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used to map the zzso to zzso 15 and zzso In normal individuals, zzso at these zzso can contain thousands of repeats, greatly exceeding repeat copy number at most zzso and other simple repeat zzso No evidence for longer, zzso repeats was observed among the limited number of repeats zzso These zzso may represent a transitional state between simple repeat zzso and some zzso
