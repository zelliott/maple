zzso arthritis zzso is an zzso disease that is strongly associated with the expression of several zzso zzso including zzso zzso Although the zzso that zzso zzso remains zzso it has been shown that many patients have zzso directed to type II collagen zzso To test the hypothesis that zzso is capable of zzso an immune response to zzso we have generated transgenic mice expressing zzso zzso zzso When the zzso transgenic mice were zzso with human zzso zzso they developed a severe zzso arthritis, evidenced by severe swelling and zzso of the limbs and marked inflammation and erosion of zzso zzso The development of the zzso arthritis was accompanied by strong zzso T and B cell responses to zzso The T cell response was focused on a dominant zzso contained within zzso from which an eight zzso acid core was zzso The B cell response was characterized by high zzso of zzso specific for zzso and a high degree of zzso with zzso type II zzso These data demonstrate that zzso is capable of presenting peptides derived from zzso and suggest that this zzso transgenic model will be useful in the development of zzso therapies for zzso
