zzso low molecular weight protein zzso might be important in relation to portal vein tumor zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso This study aimed to screen and to detect these zzso 

We selected zzso of 3 groups from 12 healthy volunteers, 12 zzso patients without zzso and 12 zzso patients with zzso zzso By using two-dimensional gel zzso zzso in which the first dimension was zzso zzso serum protein images of 3 groups were analyzed by Image Master zzso The differential protein spots were further identified by zzso zzso 

Compared with zzso zzso zzso there were more protein bands between 3 and 20 zzso in zzso zzso gel and low molecular weight zzso protein spots zzso 20 zzso were clearly zzso Fifteen differential protein spots representing five proteins were found in the three groups by zzso comparison and were then zzso Compared with the healthy group, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso II were down regulated in zzso groups while zzso was over zzso All the five proteins were less in zzso group than in zzso zzso 

The expression of low zzso serum protein changes obviously in the beginning and progressive stage of zzso and zzso expressed low zzso proteins might be the potential zzso in early zzso and surveillance of treatment for zzso and zzso
