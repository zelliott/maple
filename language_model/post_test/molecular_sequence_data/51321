Use of zzso bonds for zzso linkage in zzso zzso synthesis was investigated using zzso zzso zzso Three zzso zzso handles were zzso for the introduction of zzso linkage to the synthesis zzso This work showed that only zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso acid were fully compatible with zzso zzso synthesis and zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and quantitative synthesis results were comparable to those obtained by conventional zzso synthesis using zzso zzso The resulting zzso which swelled in water or zzso zzso may be suitable for various zzso applications, including use as zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso released zzso zzso peptides suitable for various uses in solution zzso direct zzso with activated protein carrier, specific labeling in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso linkage allowed easy zzso adjustment of the zzso loading of zzso
