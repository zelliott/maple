zzso are a hallmark of zzso zzso but most are not disease zzso zzso to soluble liver zzso zzso and to liver and zzso zzso zzso have been described as disease specific, occurring in about zzso of all patients with zzso zzso but no zzso zzso are zzso zzso We tested 2000 serum samples from patients with various liver diseases and controls for zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso samples positive for zzso zzso were used for zzso of zzso expression zzso zzso clones were tested against a panel of serum samples positive for zzso and LP zzso and control serum samples, and the zzso mapped by deletion zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso and LP zzso were zzso Of 2000 serum samples screened, 35 were positive for zzso zzso These positive samples came from patients with zzso zzso three from patients with an overlap syndrome zzso zzso zzso and secondary zzso zzso zzso cloning and zzso experiments identified a 422 zzso protein present in two zzso zzso as the sole target zzso zzso zzso were critical for immune zzso 

The identified zzso encodes the primary target zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso has a previously unknown zzso zzso and presumably codes for an zzso zzso suggested to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are disease specific and zzso a dominant zzso suggesting a specific zzso immune zzso Identification of the zzso target zzso will allow establishment of a reliable, widely available diagnostic zzso Furthermore, its role in the zzso of zzso zzso can now be zzso
