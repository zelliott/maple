zzso zzso to zzso by an unknown zzso A logical candidate mechanism is through recognition of zzso by zzso T zzso The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of a lack of zzso on the zzso that develops in zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A zzso zzso in the zzso gene that causes a loss of zzso expression was identified in offspring of a male zzso rat that had been treated with the zzso zzso The zzso was crossed into zzso lines on the Lewis zzso zzso and zzso progeny were compared on a mixed zzso background as well as after at least 10 zzso to zzso zzso zzso function was assessed by generating zzso T zzso zzso against zzso zzso strain zzso 

zzso zzso rats showed normal zzso and zzso zzso zzso levels but no zzso expression of either protein and an almost complete zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Two disease zzso previously observed in different zzso lines also occurred in the respective zzso rat zzso There was no significant difference in disease prevalence or severity between zzso rats and zzso zzso 

All of the previously described disease manifestations in zzso rats arise in the absence of any functional zzso T zzso It thus seems unlikely that classic T cell recognition of zzso is of primary importance in this animal zzso The possibility of a secondary role of a zzso mechanism cannot be entirely zzso
