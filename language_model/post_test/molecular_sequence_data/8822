It was previously shown that three distinct but zzso elements are required for 3' end formation of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the efficiency element zzso and related zzso which function by enhancing the efficiency of positioning zzso zzso positioning zzso such as zzso and zzso which position the zzso zzso and zzso the actual site of zzso In this study, we have shown that several zzso zzso including the zzso zzso signal zzso are also positioning zzso zzso zzso revealed that optimum sequences of the positioning element were zzso and zzso and that this element can tolerate various zzso of zzso However, the zzso sequence was completely zzso The major zzso sites determined in zzso corresponded to the major zzso sites observed in zzso Our findings support the assumption that some components of the basic zzso machinery could have been zzso among zzso plants, and zzso although 3' end formation in zzso is clearly distinct from that of higher zzso
