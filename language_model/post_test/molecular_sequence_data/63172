zzso genes predictably share similar evolutionary histories to an extent delineated by zzso This correlation should extend across multiple linked genes in a zzso species such as zzso zzso due to its low effective zzso zzso To test this zzso we performed a molecular population zzso analysis of zzso zzso and divergence in zzso regions surrounding four zzso zzso Three of these zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso have been previously implicated as targets of selection and we would predict stronger correlations in zzso between neighboring zzso due to genetic zzso around these zzso The remaining zzso zzso was identified in a study of linkage zzso surrounding the zzso zzso zzso Although we found broad valleys of reduced zzso variation around two of our focal zzso zzso and zzso all zzso regions exhibited extreme variation in the patterns of zzso and evolution between neighboring zzso Although three of our four regions contained potential targets of selection, application of the zzso test of selection in conjunction with a zzso test supports the selection hypothesis only for the region containing zzso The degree of zzso in evolutionary histories between linked zzso within each region generally correlated with estimates of zzso and linkage zzso for that region, with the exception of the region containing zzso We discuss the implications of these data for future population zzso analyses and zzso studies in zzso zzso
