zzso modifications are central to the regulation of all zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso lies within the zzso domain at a structurally important zzso We identify zzso of zzso zzso as a modification that is enriched at zzso zzso and associated with repeat sequences and zzso inactive zzso zzso We show that this new mark is dynamic during the two main zzso zzso events in zzso In primordial germ cells, zzso is present at the time of zzso but it disappears zzso during zzso In early mouse zzso it is inherited exclusively zzso zzso the modification is rapidly removed, suggesting an important role for zzso turnover in zzso Taken together, our findings establish zzso as a previously zzso zzso modification that is zzso localized to repressive zzso We zzso that zzso helps to zzso zzso and perhaps the surrounding zzso in an appropriately zzso state during zzso
