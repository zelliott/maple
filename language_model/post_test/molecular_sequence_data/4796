zzso a zzso and zzso zzso has been proposed to be important in the formation and maintenance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with both the zzso zzso complex as well as the zzso zzso zzso Although the nature of zzso association with the zzso zzso complex remains zzso it is known that zzso binds directly to the zzso a zzso group of zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso system to identify zzso zzso we present evidence for the zzso of zzso directly with zzso The C zzso of zzso binds specifically to the C zzso of zzso We further refined this site of interaction to these zzso zzso zzso motifs that flank their respective zzso zzso We also show that the interaction between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso is specific and is not due to a zzso zzso domain zzso From the accumulated evidence of zzso interactions presented here and elsewhere, we propose a partially revised model of the organization of the zzso zzso zzso
