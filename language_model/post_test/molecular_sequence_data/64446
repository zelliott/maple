zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the conversion of cholesterol to zzso the first step in overall steroid hormone zzso in zzso zzso On the basis of alignment with structurally characterized zzso zzso zzso we have identified the putative zzso loop of zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso in this zzso Wild type and zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli and compared with respect to zzso distribution and turnover zzso About zzso of the wild type zzso was found in the bacterial zzso indicating loose association of the zzso with the zzso The zzso and zzso replacements increased the fraction of zzso in the bacterial zzso zzso and the latter zzso also showed an almost zzso increase of the turnover zzso These data indicate that the putative zzso loop is the site of attachment to the membrane in zzso zzso and changes in the zzso interactions may affect the rate of zzso
