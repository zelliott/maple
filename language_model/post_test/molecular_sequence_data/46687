The mechanisms underlying the initiation of zzso zzso disease are not well zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso disease zzso a mouse model of multiple zzso is initiated by zzso zzso T cells targeting zzso infected central nervous zzso zzso zzso cells zzso leading to chronic zzso of zzso zzso zzso T cells via zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso mice have the ability to zzso process and present virus zzso at both acute and chronic stages of the zzso zzso to the initiation of zzso zzso disease, only zzso zzso isolated from zzso mice with zzso zzso damage, not those isolated from zzso mice or mice with acute disease, were able to zzso present a variety of zzso protein zzso to specific zzso zzso These results offer a mechanism by which localized zzso T zzso inflammatory zzso destruction leads to the zzso of zzso zzso that can process and present zzso self zzso to zzso T cells, and thus provide a zzso basis by which zzso spreading zzso
