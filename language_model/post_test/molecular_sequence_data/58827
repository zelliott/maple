A zzso zzso was employed to detect sequence zzso to the zzso gene of the zzso family of zzso elements in a wide variety of zzso zzso products of the appropriate size were obtained from most insects zzso of 108 zzso zzso most other zzso zzso of zzso zzso and many zzso (18 of zzso zzso zzso a sample of cloned zzso products from eight insects, one zzso and two frogs revealed that each had multiple distinct members of the family in their zzso In the most extreme case, the horn fly zzso zzso yielded evidence of zzso distinct types of zzso family zzso Most of the sequences obtained indicate that the elements are within the range of variation already known from zzso zzso flies, fish and zzso zzso however, had novel length zzso or divergent zzso indicating that they represent new zzso of these zzso These results indicate that this family of zzso is extremely common in animal zzso with multiple representatives in most zzso
