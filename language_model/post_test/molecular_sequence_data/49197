The zzso bacteria zzso zzso are vertically transmitted through female hosts and are known to cause selective death of male offspring in zzso One strain of zzso zzso causes male killing in zzso species, and a zzso zzso of zzso designated zzso has been zzso It is not known why zzso does not kill zzso In an attempt to understand the mechanism of male killing, we investigated the population dynamics of zzso and zzso throughout the zzso course of the laboratory host zzso zzso by using a quantitative zzso zzso In the early development of the host zzso the zzso of zzso were significantly higher than those of zzso at the zzso and zzso zzso whereas at the egg, zzso and zzso zzso the zzso of the two zzso were almost the zzso Upon adult zzso the zzso of the two zzso were similar, around 2 zzso zzso zzso copy zzso However, throughout host aging, the two zzso showed zzso different population growth zzso The zzso of zzso increased zzso for 3 weeks, attained a peak value of around 4 zzso zzso zzso copy zzso per zzso and then zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso were almost constant throughout the adult portion of the life zzso In adult zzso consequently, the zzso of zzso was significantly higher than the zzso of zzso except for a short period just after zzso Although infection of adult females with zzso resulted in almost zzso male killing, production of some male offspring was observed within 4 days after emergence when the zzso of zzso were as low as those of zzso Based on these results, we proposed a threshold density hypothesis for the expression of male killing caused by the zzso The zzso of the bottleneck in the vertical transmission through host generations were estimated to be 5 zzso zzso for zzso and 3 zzso zzso for zzso
