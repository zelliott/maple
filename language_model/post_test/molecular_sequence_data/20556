We investigated the role of the divergent transforming growth zzso zzso member, zzso factor zzso in regulating response to zzso used in the treatment of zzso zzso A clear zzso expression pattern of zzso was shown in a panel of zzso cancer cell lines following acute exposure to zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso before chemotherapy treatment significantly zzso cells expressing zzso zzso but not zzso or zzso cells, to drug-induced zzso Similarly, zzso of zzso expression zzso zzso drug-resistant daughter cell lines to their respective zzso zzso zzso expression and treatment with zzso zzso both significantly attenuated drug-induced zzso Further analysis revealed that zzso activated the zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso 1/2 signaling zzso Furthermore, zzso with the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso Together, these data suggest that zzso may be a novel inhibitor of drug-induced cell death in zzso cancer cells and that the mature zzso form of the protein activates the zzso zzso zzso as an acute mechanism of zzso
