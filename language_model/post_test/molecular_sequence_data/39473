The family of zzso metal zzso zzso functions in diverse organisms from bacteria to zzso zzso functions in metal transport across the zzso membrane of zzso and defective zzso causes sensitivity to several zzso zzso zzso zzso transport metal zzso at the plasma membrane of cells of both the zzso and in peripheral zzso and defective zzso cause zzso The driving force for the zzso transport is zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso between metal zzso and zzso varied at different conditions due to a zzso zzso zzso Though the metal zzso transport by zzso the zzso zzso of zzso is also a zzso force, a zzso of sodium zzso was zzso The mechanism of the above phenomena could be explained by a combination between zzso and channel zzso
