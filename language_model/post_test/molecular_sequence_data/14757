Recent studies showed that two single zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso near the gene zzso coding for zzso were associated with the zzso treatment response of the combination therapy of zzso plus zzso We established the use of zzso amplification zzso zzso system zzso chain reaction zzso for detecting zzso zzso zzso zzso in 56 Chinese chronic zzso C patients infected with zzso C zzso zzso zzso zzso The new zzso showed zzso zzso and was confirmed by direct zzso Among the 56 samples, zzso zzso and zzso zzso accounted for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso The proportion of zzso in zzso group was higher than that in zzso group zzso zzso zzso zzso For zzso clinical decision-making, using the new zzso zzso zzso could provide similar information to zzso zzso due to a strong association between the two zzso in Chinese zzso The zzso system in this study can be implemented using basic laboratory zzso making it convenient for clinical and research zzso
