We describe a structural validation of the use of presentation scaffolds for control and zzso of zzso zzso of zzso The protein zzso by inserting the sequence zzso into the zzso loop region of the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso binding to the zzso alpha zzso beta 3 and alpha V beta zzso In the X-ray crystal structure of their protein at zzso A resolution, the zzso loop exhibits defined electron density that is consistent with models for the zzso zzso of zzso of these receptors based on previous zzso zzso Furthermore, a search of a zzso database with zzso information derived from the structure of zzso identified constrained peptides and zzso known to be zzso of the zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso
