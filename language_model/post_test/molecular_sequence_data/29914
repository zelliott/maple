The vast majority of human zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso as the attachment site on susceptible zzso Twelve zzso zzso zzso were isolated and shown by competition binding studies to recognize three zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of three zzso representing each of the binding sites demonstrated that they were equally effective at blocking viral zzso By using in zzso zzso and translation systems, a series of progressive zzso zzso of zzso molecules was zzso zzso of these fragments with each of the three zzso indicated that all three zzso reside within the first 82 zzso acids of the zzso Attempts to demonstrate specific binding of these in zzso zzso fragments to zzso were zzso The inability to show zzso binding was most likely due to a failure of the zzso to properly zzso the zzso zzso since native, zzso zzso molecules isolated from cell zzso were also inactive in virus binding zzso
