Native zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso known for binding zzso zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, forms zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso La Rosa and Daly zzso zzso 34, zzso making zzso studies with this 32 zzso protein zzso zzso moreover, binds zzso with a similar affinity to that of native zzso zzso data presented here indicate that zzso zzso Da zzso binding to zzso while not zzso the overall structure of the zzso does zzso specific zzso zzso zzso which map to zzso related zzso within a ring of positively charged side chains on the surface of zzso zzso zzso to zzso binding models which zzso around zzso zzso zzso this study indicates that a loop containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso and zzso are even more affected by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding data support these zzso findings by indicating that zzso more than zzso zzso are crucial to the zzso binding zzso
