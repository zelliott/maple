The zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso zzso method was used for both examining zzso at the zzso gene locus and determining zzso zzso zzso in spouses of unexplained zzso zzso zzso DNA samples were prepared from peripheral zzso cells from patient and control zzso Two hundred and thirty base pair fragments of the second zzso of the zzso genes were selectively zzso zzso zzso were zzso with the restriction zzso zzso I, zzso III, zzso I, zzso I and zzso I, and subjected to zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso showed that habitual zzso and their husbands had neither significantly frequent zzso nor shared common zzso at the zzso locus when compared to the control zzso Since significant zzso zzso was not observed between the spouses and unexplained zzso zzso in order to determine whether or not zzso zzso is responsible for the genesis of unexplained zzso zzso it is imperative to further examine the zzso between other zzso gene zzso
