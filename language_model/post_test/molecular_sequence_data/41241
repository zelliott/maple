The zzso zzso are a ubiquitous family of zzso zzso involved in the transport of transition metal zzso zzso into zzso based on sequence characteristics and zzso zzso these integral membrane zzso play key roles in metal zzso metal zzso and the zzso of zzso The zzso have the simplest architecture of the five zzso families and have been suggested to play a role in zzso zzso A zzso from zzso zzso zzso designated zzso has been zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso is specific for zzso A single zzso binding site is present, and zzso electron zzso zzso and X-ray zzso zzso data are consistent with zzso coordination by oxygen and nitrogen zzso including a zzso and likely a zzso Surprisingly, there is no evidence for coordination by zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the signature zzso zzso metal binding motif does not abolish the zzso zzso activity or affect the zzso analysis, establishing that this zzso is not involved in the initial zzso binding by zzso In contrast, replacements of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso His zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso abolish zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso indicating that these zzso are necessary for zzso zzso These data represent the first in zzso characterization of a zzso and its zzso binding zzso
