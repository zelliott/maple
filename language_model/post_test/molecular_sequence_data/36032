zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which is one of the most aggressive, zzso tumors in humans, is considered to originate from zzso differentiated zzso zzso To define the genetic zzso associated with such zzso we examined nine cases of zzso zzso zzso for zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso screening for zzso by zzso protection analysis demonstrated that two out of nine zzso zzso contained sequence zzso in the zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing identified the zzso zzso in these two zzso one was a nonsense zzso at zzso zzso and the other was a zzso deletion at zzso 176 resulting in the creation of a stop zzso downstream due to zzso The fact that no zzso were detected in zzso zzso of zzso zzso from the same patients shows that these zzso of the zzso gene occurred after development of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso gene zzso triggers the progression from differentiated into zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso
