zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differentiation is characterized by a zzso of the initial zzso which follows passage through S phase in the presence of zzso zzso to terminal cell division is first detected in a portion of the cell population during this prolonged zzso zzso commitment is zzso This study has examined changes in two known cell cycle regulators, zzso and zzso A, in zzso zzso in the absence and presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso and the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso A, and zzso A protein changed during cell cycle progression in zzso and all of them were suppressed during zzso The suppression of the zzso zzso activity and zzso A expression continued through the prolonged zzso in zzso cultured with zzso whereas zzso protein level did not vary through the cell cycle in zzso cultured without or with zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso gradually increased as cells progressed from zzso to zzso In induced zzso an increase in zzso of zzso occurred during the prolonged zzso and prior to the exit of the bulk of the cells from zzso to zzso These results suggest that in zzso zzso zzso zzso per zzso is not a limiting factor in determining zzso to S zzso The persistent suppression of zzso A expression and zzso zzso zzso activity may play a role in zzso commitment to terminal zzso
