DNA zzso help maintain the zzso by zzso chemically modified bases from zzso zzso coli zzso DNA zzso I zzso specifically zzso the removal of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular basis for the zzso recognition and removal of zzso from DNA is currently a matter of speculation, in part zzso to the lack of a structure of a zzso zzso bound to damaged zzso Here, high-resolution crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso form and in a zzso product complex with zzso DNA and zzso zzso are zzso Despite its structural similarity to the zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso has evolved a modified strategy for engaging damaged zzso In contrast to other zzso structures, the zzso zzso is not flipped into the zzso active zzso This is the first structural demonstration that zzso relaxation must occur in the DNA upon base zzso Together with zzso studies of zzso zzso activity, these data provide a model for the specific recognition and zzso of zzso from zzso
