zzso zzso are highly zzso tumors of soft tissue which are characterized by the zzso resulting in zzso fusion transcript zzso Diagnosis of these tumors based on zzso can be challenging, particularly when minimal biopsy specimens are presented to the zzso zzso by molecular methods of zzso transcripts is a useful adjunct for diagnosis in these zzso We have developed an zzso which combines zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso to detect and zzso the zzso transcripts from zzso zzso Small zzso from zzso transcripts as well as zzso transcripts are zzso labeled with zzso allowing detection and size discrimination by zzso zzso In a study of 32 zzso soft tissue tumor zzso the zzso detected zzso transcripts from zzso zzso zzso zzso All five zzso negative specimens yielded no intact zzso as evidenced by lack of a zzso zzso zzso transcripts were not detected in zzso zzso peripheral nerve sheath tumors or zzso zzso zzso Representative zzso were zzso and confirmed the zzso results obtained by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso is a rapid and accurate method for the detection and zzso zzso of zzso transcripts from fixed tissue zzso
