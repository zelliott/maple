The zzso zzso family 18 consists of two members, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Despite the enormous progress on zzso zzso study, little information regarding zzso is available to date in lower zzso In this study, we identified a zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso named zzso which consisted of a signal zzso a zzso domain, a zzso zzso region and a zzso domain zzso zzso zzso comparison and zzso analysis showed that zzso was the common zzso of zzso and zzso implicating that zzso and zzso evolved from an ancient gene like zzso via gene zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso was expressed in the zzso zzso and hind gut in a zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso activities as well as zzso activity zzso demonstrated that like human zzso zzso zzso was able to bind to zzso zzso to zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso and to inhibit the growth of the fungus zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso lacking CB domain retained partial capacity to bind to zzso but its zzso activity was almost completely zzso These findings suggest that the CB domain is necessary for the execution of both zzso and zzso activities of zzso zzso It is also the first study showing the presence of a zzso zzso with both zzso activity and zzso activity in zzso zzso
