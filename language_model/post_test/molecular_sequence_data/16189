zzso gene expression is required for rapid zzso zzso induction of the zzso zzso genes in zzso zzso Here we show by Northern zzso zzso analysis that zzso gene expression is itself zzso zzso Like the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso gene is severely zzso zzso Like the zzso zzso but in contrast to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is expressed at readily zzso zzso levels in cells grown in zzso zzso zzso We determined the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene and its zzso zzso Within the zzso region of the zzso zzso we found two sequences similar to the zzso elements of the other zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that only the most zzso zzso of these sequences is required for zzso zzso The coding region of zzso consists of a zzso open reading frame in the direction of zzso A comparison of the deduced zzso sequence with the protein data bank revealed three regions of striking similarity between the zzso protein and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso One of these regions also showed striking similarity to sequences within the zzso protein of zzso zzso On the basis of these protein sequence similarities, we propose that the zzso protein binds a zzso identical to or structurally related to one of the zzso or products of the zzso zzso
