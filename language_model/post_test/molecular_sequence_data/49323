The zzso zzso gene family encodes zzso zinc finger zzso factors closely related to the zzso zzso zzso genes are expressed in multiple areas of developing zzso zzso including the zzso neural tube where they act as potent neural crest zzso Here we describe the characterization of a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and further describe the expression of a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis and sequence comparisons suggest the gene zzso that formed the zzso zzso family were specific to the zzso zzso In zzso maternal zzso transcripts are localized during zzso stages by zzso cell division, whereas zzso expression by neural plate cells zzso during zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso zzso and zzso during zzso before being eliminated first from zzso cells and then from all zzso during zzso After zzso expression is zzso in the zzso neural tube and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso expression with zzso zzso expression leads to two main zzso First, zzso expression allows us to define zzso compartments between zzso and zzso zzso showing primitive subdivision of zzso segmented zzso Second, we show that neural zzso expression is a zzso zzso whereas the precise pattern of neural expression has evolved differently on the different zzso zzso Based on these observations we suggest that a change in zzso regulation, specifically the evolution of a zzso neural expression domain in zzso zzso was an important step in the evolution of the neural zzso
