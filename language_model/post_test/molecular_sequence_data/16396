zzso or zzso of an zzso gene are two mechanisms that allow pathogens to escape recognition zzso by the corresponding resistance gene in the zzso We studied these two mechanisms for the zzso zzso gene in field populations of the zzso barley pathogen zzso zzso The product of the zzso zzso zzso causes leaf necrosis and elicits a defense response on plants with the zzso resistance zzso A high zzso deletion frequency zzso was found among zzso zzso from different geographic populations on four zzso zzso was also zzso for 196 zzso to identify DNA zzso and corresponding zzso zzso Positive diversifying selection was found to act on zzso A total of 14 zzso types were found, 11 of which had not been described zzso The zzso of the zzso types was tested on zzso and zzso barley zzso zzso carrying three of these types were virulent on the zzso zzso One type each was found in California, Western Europe, and zzso Additionally, a field experiment with one pair of zzso lines was conducted to study the selection pressure imposed by zzso on field populations of zzso zzso zzso of zzso was the only mechanism used to zzso the zzso zzso in the field zzso In this first comprehensive study on the population zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso was commonly achieved through deletion of the zzso zzso gene but rarely also through point zzso in zzso
