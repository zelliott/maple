zzso transfer protein zzso zzso the zzso transfer of lipids that have zzso zzso to either zzso or zzso zzso including simple zzso zzso and zzso The present study provides a quantitative understanding of zzso action involving zzso zzso that have high and low zzso stress, zzso small and large zzso zzso zzso and zzso When the zzso zzso transfer was monitored in real time using an established zzso resonance energy approach, the initial zzso transfer rates zzso and net transfer equilibrium zzso were determined for zzso transfer from zzso and zzso over the temperature range of zzso degrees zzso zzso exhibited a linear dependence with respect to varying zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso suggesting a first order dependence on the zzso bulk zzso zzso parameters associated with the zzso zzso complex and zzso net transfer were determined from linear zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Although initial transfer rates were lower for zzso than for zzso the zzso energy barriers were higher for zzso while the zzso free energy of the transition states were zzso The formation of a zzso complex was predominantly zzso driven, whereas the net transfer of zzso was mainly zzso zzso The zzso step for zzso action appeared to be the surface processes leading to the zzso complex formation and release associated with a zzso mode of zzso Because surface processes leading to the zzso complex formation were limiting for zzso action with zzso and zzso it was concluded that zzso is likely to be a valuable tool to probe and manipulate zzso environments in zzso
