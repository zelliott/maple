zzso zzso display many complex zzso body zzso including mushrooms and zzso but their anatomical simplicity has zzso efforts to understand the evolution of these zzso We performed a comprehensive zzso analysis of zzso using sequences from nuclear and zzso zzso DNA, with an emphasis on understanding evolutionary relationships of zzso mushrooms and zzso zzso zzso of character states on our zzso trees suggested that zzso similar zzso mushrooms evolved at least six times, from zzso diverse zzso zzso zzso of zzso mushrooms are in a single zzso which we call the zzso Recently discovered 90 zzso fossil mushrooms are probably zzso suggesting that zzso the origin of this zzso must have occurred no later than the zzso and zzso the zzso mushroom zzso has been maintained in certain lineages for tens of millions of zzso zzso and other forms with enclosed zzso structures zzso evolved at least four zzso zzso of zzso from forms with exposed zzso structures zzso is correlated with repeated loss of zzso spore discharge zzso zzso zzso body forms and spore zzso mechanisms have evolved among zzso Nevertheless, it appears that zzso have never been zzso derived from zzso which suggests that the loss of zzso has constrained evolution in these zzso
