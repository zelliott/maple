zzso diseases are marked by the cerebral zzso of zzso modified forms of the cellular prion protein zzso known as zzso The region zzso the zzso zzso of human zzso seems to have a key role in this zzso conversion, because a synthetic zzso zzso with this sequence zzso adopts different secondary structures in different zzso To investigate the molecular zzso of the zzso characteristics of zzso we zzso a series of zzso including zzso zzso zzso A and zzso K, with zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively at position 111, zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso V with an zzso zzso at position zzso and zzso zzso with an zzso substitution at position 117 and zzso of the zzso The analysis of the secondary structure and zzso properties of zzso and its zzso showed the zzso zzso zzso is central to the zzso changes of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso yields a predominantly random zzso structure, zzso the molecular zzso and decreases the propensity of zzso to generate zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying an zzso substitution at position zzso does not demonstrate a zzso ability superior to that of zzso However, the presence of Val at position 117 increases the zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are not required for zzso because the effects of zzso zzso on primary zzso cultures were similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso zzso proliferation is related to the presence of zzso zzso suggesting that zzso in prion zzso without zzso deposits is a zzso effect rather than a direct effect of zzso zzso zzso
