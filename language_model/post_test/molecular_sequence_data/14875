zzso lineage diversification is an important component of global zzso but it presents challenges to our ability to catalog and understand that zzso Because of their relative zzso simplicity and broad geographic zzso zzso are an ideal study group for investigating this zzso This study generated molecular data from 109 zzso individuals to test zzso species zzso and examine patterns of cryptic lineage diversification within the small north temperate moss zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses and statistical zzso network analyses of ITS and zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions indicate that the zzso comprises six distinct molecular zzso Five of these molecular groups zzso to previously recognized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Koch, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the sixth group does not zzso to any existing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso probability support for the zzso of species varied widely and depended on both the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the analysis method zzso Low zzso resolution of species is attributable to the lack of zzso DNA sequence zzso and zzso zzso of three zzso in the zzso and ITS gene trees, both suggesting recent divergence within the zzso zzso of the zzso vouchers for the sixth molecular group reveals that they form a group zzso within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso One subtle zzso character zzso frequency of a zzso zzso was identified that has utility in discriminating these two genetically distinct but zzso very similar zzso
