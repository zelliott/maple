zzso protein zzso is a plasma protein zzso by zzso zzso a structural analogue of the complement component zzso can activate complement via the classical zzso and plays an important role in host zzso zzso of the human zzso gene was studied using the human zzso cell line zzso zzso extracted from zzso cells was zzso to zzso amplified by the zzso chain reaction and zzso by Southern zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso cells was increased by zzso zzso zzso and heat zzso decreased by zzso 1 zzso and unaffected by zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso and transforming growth factor beta zzso zzso zzso shift zzso demonstrated zzso binding sites in the zzso region of the zzso and formation of specific complexes between DNA and nuclear protein extracted from zzso cells treated with zzso or zzso Human zzso is an zzso zzso and zzso of its gene is enhanced by zzso zzso and heat shock but inhibited by zzso The actions of the zzso appear to be zzso by specific zzso zzso
