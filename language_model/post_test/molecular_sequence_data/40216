zzso of the zzso gene in zzso coli was attempted by means of the expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso A short zzso of zzso was cloned into the zzso expression zzso in reverse orientation, using the zzso and zzso restriction zzso This construct zzso was used to transform zzso coli cells, and the zzso zzso was induced simply by adding zzso to the culture zzso We demonstrated that the zzso zzso effectively silenced zzso using zzso activity zzso zzso and Western zzso Because the concentration of the zzso zzso was always high in cells that expressed zzso we zzso that this zzso acts by zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso performed with a series of zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso which is zzso by the zzso zzso is an essential requisite for zzso zzso Indeed, the presence of the intact zzso sequence positively affects zzso stability and, zzso zzso zzso Our observations will contribute to the understanding of the main zzso of zzso as exerted by zzso as well as provide useful support for the design of robust and efficient zzso gene zzso
