The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso molecular motor that employs a rotary zzso cycle to couple a zzso membrane potential to the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso contains two copies of the b zzso that form a zzso as part of a narrow, peripheral stalk structure that connects the membrane zzso and soluble zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of the b zzso is unknown making the nature of any interactions or zzso changes within the zzso complex difficult to zzso We have used circular zzso and zzso zzso analyses of a series of zzso and zzso truncated b proteins to investigate its stability and zzso zzso zzso of the b zzso exhibited distinct zzso cooperative unfolding with zzso values between 30 and 40 degrees zzso CD zzso for the region zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso which reduced to zzso in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso parameters for zzso zzso zzso and zzso were similar to those reported for several zzso zzso zzso Together these results are most consistent with a zzso and unstable parallel zzso at the interface of the b zzso
