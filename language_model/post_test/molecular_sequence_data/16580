zzso through the plant life cycle involves change in many essential features, most notably in the capacity to zzso The transition from a juvenile zzso and zzso to an adult zzso phase is gradual and can take many years; in the conifer Norway zzso zzso zzso typically zzso zzso We present a detailed analysis of the activities of three regulatory genes with potential roles in this transition in Norway zzso zzso a zzso gene related to the zzso group of genes from zzso and the two zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso activity is initiated in the shoots of juvenile trees at an age of 3-5 years, and then increases with age, whereas both zzso genes are active throughout the juvenile zzso The activity of zzso further shows a spatial pattern along the stem of the tree that parallels a similar zzso in zzso and zzso features associated with maturation to the adult zzso zzso expression of zzso in transgenic zzso plants caused a dramatic zzso of both juvenile and adult growth zzso flowers forming immediately after the embryonic phase of development in severely affected zzso Taken together, our results support the notion that zzso may have a regulatory role in the zzso transition in Norway zzso
