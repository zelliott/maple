A large number of zzso found zzso to have different optimum pH of zzso stability, were studied to reveal the basic principles of their preference for a particular zzso The zzso free energy of folding was modeled zzso as a function of pH as well as the net charge of the zzso The optimum pH was determined in the zzso calculations as the pH of the minimum free energy of zzso The experimental data for the pH of zzso stability zzso optimum zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso It was shown that the optimum pH results from two factors - zzso acid composition and the organization of the zzso groups with the zzso zzso It was demonstrated that the optimum pH and zzso point could be quite zzso In many cases, the optimum pH was found at a pH corresponding to a large net charge of the zzso At the same time, there was a tendency for proteins having zzso optimum zzso to have a zzso ratio smaller than one and vice zzso The correlation between the optimum pH and zzso ratio is significant if only buried groups are taken into zzso It was shown that a protein that provides a favorable zzso environment for acids and zzso the bases tends to have high optimum pH and vice zzso
