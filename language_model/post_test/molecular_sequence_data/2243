The three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein zzso from snake zzso has been determined to zzso resolution by zzso crystal structure zzso zzso replacement methods were used, and the structure refined to a residual R zzso zzso The sites of 62 water molecules and 1 zzso zzso have been located and zzso The structure of zzso a is very similar to that established earlier for zzso zzso These toxins from zzso of the same snake differ in sequence only at zzso 26, which is zzso in zzso a and His in zzso zzso The substitution leads to only minor variations in zzso hydrogen zzso Furthermore, the distribution of zzso parameters and the implied regional zzso are similar in the two zzso In particular, the highly mobile character of the peripheral segment zzso in both structures supports the specific role proposed for this segment in zzso binding to the zzso zzso Forty-eight of the zzso sites determined are first surface zzso approximately one-half of these are equivalent to zzso sites in zzso zzso
