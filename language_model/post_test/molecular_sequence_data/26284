Channel proteins are zzso zzso (or zzso zzso organized around a central zzso zzso We present here a molecular model of the pore forming structures of two channel proteins with different primary structures and zzso size: the zzso sodium channel and the zzso zzso zzso We report low-energy arrangements of zzso zzso calculated by zzso potential energy functions and zzso routines and further refined using molecular zzso The zzso pore is considered to be a zzso or zzso zzso of 3-5 zzso zzso arranged such that the polar zzso line a central zzso zzso and the zzso zzso face the zzso zzso zzso The channel lining exposes either charged zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso A bundle of four parallel zzso constrained to C4 zzso the zzso axis aligned with the symmetry zzso and the zzso constrained to idealized zzso angles, produces a structure with a pore of the size zzso for the sodium channel protein zzso approximately 16 zzso Similarly, a zzso array zzso with constraints to maintain zzso symmetry and backbone zzso characteristic of zzso adopts a structure that appears well suited to form the lining of the zzso zzso zzso zzso area approximately 46 zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso satisfy the zzso energetic, and dynamic requirements to be the molecular structural motif underlying the function of zzso zzso
