The binding of zzso and zzso zzso to a zzso zzso the three repeats zzso portion of zzso zzso has been zzso zzso zzso have been used to investigate the zzso zzso and zzso of the species obtained in a wide range of pH and at a 1 : 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso techniques have been used to investigate the role of zzso and zzso sites in zzso metal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso techniques were performed to understand the details of metal binding sites and the zzso zzso of the zzso The effects of the zzso zzso with the two metals have been followed by zzso selective zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso disappearance in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso showed common binding donor zzso the main zzso and zzso binding zzso of the zzso zzso is associated with zzso and zzso zzso The specific zzso of zzso zzso indicated that the coordination involves zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso All the three zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso as well as zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in an zzso arrangement are involved in the coordination in the zzso pH zzso The involvement of zzso zzso from the zzso (or zzso side chain can also be zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso important structural changes within the zzso portion of the zzso constraining it to leave its zzso zzso A model of the structure of zzso and zzso species can be obtained from our zzso
