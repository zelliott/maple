The embryonic zzso heart is divided into two major chambers, an anterior zzso and a zzso zzso Although the fundamental differences between zzso and zzso zzso are well zzso it is not known when and how cardiac zzso zzso patterning zzso The expression patterns of two zzso cardiac zzso zzso cardiac zzso light chain 2 zzso and zzso zzso heavy chain zzso allow us to distinguish two populations of zzso precursors at an early stage, well before the heart tube zzso These zzso zzso which may represent the zzso and zzso zzso are organized in a zzso pattern within the zzso zzso Our examinations of zzso and zzso expression throughout the process of heart tube assembly indicate the important role of an intermediate structure, the cardiac zzso in the conversion of this early zzso pattern into the zzso pattern of the heart zzso To gain insight into the genetic regulation of heart tube assembly and zzso we examine zzso and zzso expression in several zzso zzso zzso of zzso that cause zzso zzso demonstrate that the achievement of a proper cardiac zzso pattern does not depend upon cardiac zzso On the other hand, cardiac fusion does not ensure the proper zzso orientation of the zzso and atrium, as demonstrated by the heart and soul zzso which blocks cardiac cone zzso Finally, the zzso zzso interferes with the establishment of the early zzso zzso zzso Altogether, these data suggest new models for the mechanisms that regulate the formation of a patterned heart tube and provide an important framework for future analyses of zzso zzso with defects in this zzso
