The ability of zzso to evolve resistance to zzso drugs leads to treatment zzso By zzso sequencing of zzso zzso B zzso zzso acids responsible for drug resistance have been zzso Less information is available, however, on the extent and distribution of these zzso acids in zzso zzso B viruses circulating mainly in developing zzso More zzso patients in the developing world are now using zzso drugs, and hence there is a need to monitor drug resistance zzso in zzso zzso B zzso This study examines the prevalence of drug resistance zzso in 28 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA was extracted from peripheral blood zzso zzso The region encompassing gag zzso to zzso zzso was amplified by the zzso chain reaction followed by direct zzso zzso analyses for drug zzso zzso in zzso e zzso and reverse zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso Overall, zzso of the generated sequences were zzso zzso zzso The generated sequences revealed only secondary zzso but no primary, zzso zzso The most frequent secondary zzso in the zzso and zzso genes were, respectively, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso This study reveals many naturally occurring zzso in zzso zzso C zzso from zzso zzso zzso Such zzso could lead to rapid treatment failure and development of drug-resistant zzso zzso in individuals undergoing zzso zzso
