zzso growth factor signaling zzso plays a pivotal role in the regulation of growth at the cellular and the zzso level during animal zzso zzso with impaired zzso are zzso delayed and small due to fewer and smaller zzso In the search for new zzso zzso we identified zzso in the gene zzso zzso the single fly member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso function are viable but severely reduced in zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso display zzso reminiscent of reduced zzso such as zzso zzso female sterility, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis places zzso downstream of the insulin zzso zzso and upstream of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso at the same level as zzso zzso the single fly insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso larvae display a similar reduction in zzso activity as judged by the zzso of a zzso reporter and the zzso of protein zzso B zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso double zzso are zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso fulfill independent but partially redundant functions in the zzso of zzso upon zzso zzso
