zzso and prolonged inflammatory reaction is seen in a wide variety of disorders, and high level of zzso zzso Factor alpha zzso has been linked to these zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression is important in the regulation of inflammatory zzso In our previous study, we have shown that a zzso factor zzso zzso factor zzso significantly zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that zzso and its synthetic zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso gene expression in human cells in zzso Thus, in the present study, the role of zzso in regulating zzso inflammation was zzso Our data showed that a synthetic zzso named zzso corresponding to this region functions independently from zzso to cause a significant suppression of zzso gene expression in mouse primary zzso The zzso when delivered into cells and zzso reduces serum zzso level in mice and prevents zzso lung zzso and zzso zzso Our findings highlight the regulation of zzso by zzso and its short zzso zzso These in zzso and in zzso observations serve to pave the way for zzso approaches in the treatment of inflammatory zzso
