The zzso for a previously described growth zzso designated as zzso growth inhibitor zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso of Experimental zzso In zzso has been cloned from a zzso library which was derived from terminally differentiated bovine zzso zzso zzso of the zzso showed an open reading frame coding for a protein of 133 zzso zzso In six positions differences were found between the sequence determined from the zzso and that determined previously by zzso acid sequence zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed abundant zzso zzso in the terminally differentiated zzso zzso whereas in virgin zzso liver or zzso transcripts were not zzso By use of in zzso zzso technique zzso of zzso in the developing bovine zzso zzso was zzso zzso amounts of zzso zzso were detected in the zzso cells of embryonic zzso zzso in the zzso of developing zzso and in terminal parts of ducts and zzso zzso cells of differentiated zzso There was a geographical zzso of zzso zzso concentration in bovine zzso zzso reaching a maximum in the zzso parts of the zzso An zzso analysis with different zzso and zzso directed zzso against zzso confirmed the in zzso zzso data with respect to the zzso and zzso zzso expression in bovine zzso zzso The results suggest a close relationship between zzso zzso and zzso processes in the normal bovine zzso zzso
