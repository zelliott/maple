We report automated DNA sequencing in zzso zzso A microchip zzso with zzso zzso is aligned on a heating plate affixed to a zzso zzso zzso are loaded into sample reservoirs by using an zzso zzso device, and the chip is zzso with an array of zzso in the focal plane of a zzso scanning detection zzso Under computer control, high zzso is applied to the appropriate reservoirs in a programmed sequence that zzso and separates the DNA zzso An integrated zzso zzso fluorescent detector automatically scans all 16 zzso The system routinely yields more than 450 bases in 15 zzso in all 16 zzso In the best case using an automated zzso program, zzso bases have been called at an accuracy of zzso zzso including automated chip loading and sample injection, normally are completed in less than 18 zzso The advantages of DNA sequencing on zzso zzso chips include uniform signal intensity and tolerance of high DNA template zzso To understand the fundamentals of these unique features we developed a theoretical treatment of zzso chip injection that we call the differential concentration zzso We present experimental evidence consistent with the predictions of the zzso
