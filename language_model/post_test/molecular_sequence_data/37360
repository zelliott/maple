The zzso structure of the zzso coli zzso zzso has been established at zzso resolution and refined to R zzso zzso The zzso zzso is a class D zzso zzso that is especially active against the zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to the structures of zzso zzso and zzso belonging to other zzso the zzso zzso is zzso rather than zzso and represents the zzso characterized by an enlarged zzso loop near the zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso zzso in this loop cannot interact directly with zzso and, instead, projects into zzso In this structure at pH zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 70 in the zzso site is zzso One oxygen atom of the zzso group is hydrogen bonded to zzso 120 and zzso zzso The other oxygen atom is more exposed and hydrogen bonded to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso In the overlay of the class D and class A binding sites, the zzso group is displaced zzso zzso A from the zzso group of zzso 166 of class A zzso However, each group is zzso from the site of the water zzso expected to function in zzso and which could be activated by the zzso group of zzso zzso In this zzso zzso structure, no water zzso is seen in this site, so the water zzso must enter after formation of the zzso 67 zzso
