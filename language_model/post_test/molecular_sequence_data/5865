The zzso protein zzso zzso is an zzso zzso of widespread occurrence in zzso zzso This zzso protein zzso is activated by zzso zzso by a mechanism involving zzso Once zzso the zzso zzso the alpha zzso of protein synthesis initiation factor zzso thereby zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that there may be additional zzso and that signal zzso and gene zzso pathways also may be regulated by the protein zzso As well as being important in zzso the zzso effects of zzso zzso is implicated in regulating cell proliferation in zzso cells and may have a zzso zzso function under normal zzso Studies using cell lines expressing inactive zzso of zzso and mice with zzso disruptions of the zzso gene are leading to greater insights into the biological significance of this zzso
