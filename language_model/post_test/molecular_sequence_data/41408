zzso recognition complex zzso is highly zzso with several zzso zzso getting zzso modified by zzso or zzso in a cell zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that a zzso repeat containing protein zzso zzso zzso the zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso levels are cell zzso with highest levels during zzso and progressively decreasing during S phase, but the mechanism remains to be zzso We now demonstrate that zzso is zzso in zzso with elevated zzso observed at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso linkage, suggesting that zzso zzso mediates its regulated zzso zzso zzso is zzso in the form of nuclear zzso and is predominantly associated with zzso We demonstrate that zzso associates with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso at the zzso repeat domain, a region that is also recognized by zzso Furthermore, zzso associates only with the zzso form of zzso and zzso depletion results in the zzso zzso of zzso Based on the results, we suggest that zzso protects zzso from zzso degradation in zzso
