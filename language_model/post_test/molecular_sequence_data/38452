A zzso zzso with similarity to calcium zzso zzso has been identified adjacent to zzso in zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso while zzso is a zzso zzso both of which are required to form the zzso zzso core in zzso zzso zzso in zzso result in a rough zzso zzso with a requirement for elevated calcium zzso to allow growth, suggesting that zzso of the zzso core exposes a highly zzso charged zzso This is consistent with the zzso core being one of the main sites for binding calcium in the zzso outer zzso zzso zzso zzso has a normal zzso layer, as measured by silver zzso and Western zzso This indicates that zzso zzso are not zzso affected in their zzso zzso zzso fusion analysis indicates that zzso is zzso expressed and is not directly regulated by the calcium zzso zzso of zzso increased the concentration of calcium required for growth, consistent with zzso zzso calcium export from the zzso The location of zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso of zzso zzso suggests that zzso might provide a specific export zzso for calcium to the zzso zzso
