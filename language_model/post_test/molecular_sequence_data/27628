The primary sequences of zzso essential and zzso regulatory zzso light chains were analyzed and zzso using zzso based on the different structural properties of their zzso acid zzso This process allowed zzso of the structural zzso between the proteins zzso and improved the prediction of their mean secondary structure and functionally important segments or zzso On the basis of the crystal structure of zzso C, a model of the zzso essential light chain with a fairly compact form is zzso The possible sites of interaction between zzso light and heavy chains from rabbit skeletal muscle were also investigated by a zzso method adapted to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the essential light chain and segments zzso zzso and zzso in the regulatory light chain are suggested to constitute some of these sites, as most of them were found to have the features of zzso zzso
