zzso zzso and zzso make zzso silk an attractive resource for the production of artificial zzso zzso silk zzso zzso contain hundreds of repeated zzso zzso blocks and are difficult to produce zzso in soluble zzso Most previous attempts to produce artificial zzso silk fibers have included zzso steps in zzso zzso It is here demonstrated that a miniature zzso from a protein in zzso silk of zzso zzso can be produced in a soluble form in zzso coli when fused to a highly soluble protein zzso Although this miniature zzso contains only four zzso zzso blocks followed by a zzso zzso domain, zzso fibers are spontaneously formed after zzso release of the fusion zzso The structure of the fibers is similar to that of zzso zzso and although zzso from zzso proteins they are as strong as fibers spun from zzso zzso Moreover, the fibers appear to be zzso because human tissue culture cells can grow on and attach to the zzso These findings enable controlled production of zzso zzso at large scale under zzso zzso
