zzso zzso is a highly zzso 43 zzso acid zzso protein that functions as an inhibitor of primary and secondary zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso domain at the zzso was previously shown to be important in the binding of zzso to zzso zzso This zzso segment is followed by a basic segment whose role is zzso In this study, the role of the basic zzso acids in the zzso zzso thermodynamics has been determined using zzso zzso zzso and equilibrium zzso zzso zzso Single point zzso of the basic side chains to zzso lowered the binding affinity to the surface but did not zzso the zzso surface coverage and the zzso zzso The structural and dynamic properties of the single point zzso as characterized by solid-state zzso techniques were not altered zzso zzso replacement of all four basic zzso acids with zzso lowered the zzso equilibrium constant by zzso and the zzso surface coverage by nearly zzso The initial zzso phase of zzso exhibited by native zzso is preserved in this zzso along with the zzso structure and the dynamic properties of the zzso zzso These results help to refine the two binding site model of zzso zzso proposed earlier in our study of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Campbell, zzso and Stayton, zzso zzso zzso 45, zzso The basic charges function to reduce zzso charge zzso on the zzso surface, and in their absence, there is a considerable decrease in zzso packing density on the surface at binding zzso
