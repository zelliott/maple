In an attempt to identify proteins involved in copper transport in the type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso One major zzso membrane zzso of zzso 28,500 Da was identified and designated zzso The gene zzso this zzso was isolated and zzso and it shared a low identity with a calcium channel zzso An zzso zzso in zzso of zzso zzso zzso grew very poorly, suggesting that zzso is important for growth of this zzso zzso may be involved in transport of copper and/or other zzso metals zzso in zzso zzso zzso
