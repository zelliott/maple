Our laboratory recently reported that zzso in the human zzso zzso protein zzso gene are responsible for familial zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso acid zzso in the zzso correlate with increased risk for childhood zzso zzso Here, we report the cloning and zzso characterization of the mouse zzso zzso the zzso of human zzso Like its human counterpart, zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids with a molecular weight of approximately 150 zzso The zzso gene product, zzso contains 37 zzso that span approximately 51 zzso The protein shows zzso zzso acid identity with human zzso It shows very high conservation across species and is zzso to the zzso zzso zzso which is a member of the zzso zzso The zzso gene maps to zzso 4 in a region that is zzso to human zzso zzso Because no animal model of zzso currently exists, cloning of the mouse zzso gene is an important first step toward creating a mouse model for zzso In addition, cloning of zzso is crucial to the characterization of the putative zzso zzso zzso
