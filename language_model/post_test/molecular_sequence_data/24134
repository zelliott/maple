A new cry zzso zzso cry zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso sequence indicated that the open reading frames zzso consists of zzso bases and encodes a protein of zzso zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso and an zzso value of zzso zzso comparison revealed that the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso had zzso to zzso identity with those of the known zzso zzso The zzso was one zzso longer than the known zzso (except for zzso zzso I zzso to zzso II zzso to zzso III zzso to zzso of the zzso were zzso zzso and zzso identical to the corresponding zzso of zzso Additionally, the cry zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli zzso under the control of zzso promoter and the zzso isolated from the culture medium was toxic to 3rd zzso zzso zzso zzso
