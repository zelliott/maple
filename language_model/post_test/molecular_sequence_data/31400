zzso zzso zzso is one of the zzso zzso that play key roles in tissue zzso and repair and in progression of diseases such as cancer, arthritis, zzso and zzso For zzso to cleave triple zzso zzso the triple zzso structure has to be locally zzso before zzso but this process is not well zzso We report crystal structures of zzso inactive full-length human zzso in complex with peptides of zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso during zzso zzso are bound to the active site of the zzso by forming an extended zzso with zzso or zzso inserted into the zzso specificity zzso The structure of the zzso part of the peptides is variable and interacts with different parts of the zzso zzso Those areas are designated zzso zzso in that they accommodate different zzso structures, whereas the precise positioning of the zzso backbone is maintained in the active zzso These modes of zzso interactions have led us to propose how triple zzso collagen strands fit into the active site zzso of the zzso
