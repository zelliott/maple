The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene is responsible for familial zzso zzso and is also associated with the development of sporadic tumors of the colon and zzso To investigate whether or not zzso of zzso play any role in tumors arising in other zzso we examined zzso zzso of this gene in sporadic zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the lung and zzso zzso isolated from tumors were examined by means of a zzso protection analysis, coupled with the zzso chain reaction followed by DNA sequencing of the zzso chain reaction zzso By screening a part of the zzso coding region, we detected zzso zzso in four of ten pancreatic zzso each of these zzso would yield a truncated zzso product due to a zzso or zzso pair zzso These results imply that zzso in zzso contribute to zzso in the zzso
