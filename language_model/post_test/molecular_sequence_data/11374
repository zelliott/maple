Multiple sequential fraction collection of peptides and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso under applied zzso has been demonstrated from complex zzso zzso zzso The collection methodology was adapted from a high-resolution zzso mapping procedure and, as such, requires active temperature control of the sample, zzso vials, and collections zzso because the zzso buffer system is higher zzso Resolution was compromised in the zzso zzso separation due to heavy sample loading and to reduced zzso The latter was a requirement for this buffer system in order to control zzso heating at the current levels zzso collections were routinely performed at approximately zzso zzso The collection buffer was zzso by the addition of zzso methanol zzso thereby improving collection zzso zzso zzso were group zzso secondary analysis of the zzso collections agreed with zzso zzso with respect to the number of peptides contained in a given zzso zzso collected zzso zzso were analyzed by zzso sequencing and zzso mass zzso to verify zzso identity and zzso zzso zzso sequence or mass zzso were obtained for repeat zzso The isolation of the single pure zzso indicates that unique zzso structures can be collected by zzso and then analyzed by other zzso
