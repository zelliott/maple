We demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso functions as the promoter for I zzso sterile zzso The zzso itself, when placed zzso to the bacterial cat or zzso zzso is able to direct zzso by using zzso start sites that are generally the same as those found with bona fide I zzso zzso In general, promoter activity is dependent on the same sequence motifs important for zzso zzso However, it appears that a zzso within the zzso zzso zzso has a much more severe effect on the promoter activity of the zzso than the same zzso has on its zzso zzso This result is consistent with the known role of the zzso as a promoter element, and this is discussed in relation to the biological role of sterile zzso
