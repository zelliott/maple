zzso P is responsible for the maturation of the zzso of zzso molecules in all cells studied to zzso This zzso has to recognize and identify its zzso site on a large number of different zzso This review covers what is currently known about the function of the zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso and the protein zzso zzso in particular with respect to zzso zzso Recent genetic and zzso data show that the two C zzso in the zzso zzso sequence of a precursor interact with the zzso through zzso zzso This is suggested to result in unfolding of the zzso acid zzso and exposure of the zzso zzso Furthermore, other close contact points between zzso zzso and its zzso have recently been zzso These data, together with the two existing three-dimensional structure models of zzso zzso in complex with its zzso establish a platform that will enable us to seek an understanding of the underlying mechanism of zzso by this elusive zzso
