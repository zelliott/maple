zzso is one of the most abundant DNA binding proteins of zzso Unlike zzso integration host factor of zzso coli, with which zzso shares many properties, including a strong sequence zzso and similar predicted structure, zzso seems to bind zzso to DNA whereas zzso binds to specific zzso In this work we compare the binding characteristics of zzso and zzso to a DNA zzso containing the minimal origin of replication of zzso coli zzso and we zzso the effect of zzso on the binding capacity of zzso to this zzso zzso We show that zzso interacts randomly and zzso with zzso as opposed to the specific binding of zzso to this same DNA zzso In addition, we show that zzso can zzso the binding of zzso to its specific zzso zzso Depending on the relative zzso of zzso and zzso zzso is able either to activate or to inhibit the binding of zzso to zzso
