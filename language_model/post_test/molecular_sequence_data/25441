zzso restricted zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso or zzso in place of zzso zzso at positions 7 and 23 were zzso by the liquid phase zzso Their biological properties in the zzso of zzso binding and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso employing rat vascular smooth muscle cells zzso zzso activity using rat isolated zzso were zzso We found that the constrained and/or zzso altered ring zzso generally did not influence the zzso binding activity, however, zzso zzso and zzso activities were quite sensitive to zzso zzso Furthermore, a lack of correlation between zzso zzso activity and zzso activity was zzso zzso between these activities was typical in the case of zzso which showed quite weak zzso activity in spite of its full zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso This result suggests that zzso zzso alone is not sufficient to promote zzso zzso and that the other second zzso may mediate this zzso
