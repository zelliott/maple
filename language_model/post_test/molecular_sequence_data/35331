zzso zzso is a major cause of chronic zzso and an established risk factor for gastric zzso This zzso also exhibits an extraordinarily high genetic zzso 

The genetic diversity of zzso zzso strains from Venezuelan patients with chronic zzso was evaluated by zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes using DNA extracted directly from zzso The zzso sequence and prevalence of size zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso products were introduced in this zzso 

The frequency of zzso zzso was associated zzso with zzso grades of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso The frequency of zzso and its zzso zzso were higher zzso in cases with zzso zzso zzso The most prevalent combined zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso fragments allowed us to define zzso zzso and to increase the number of zzso detected (from 19 to zzso A zzso tree made with zzso sequences showed that the zzso zzso strains analyzed here were grouped with those of Western zzso 

Our results show that patients from the western region of Venezuela have an elevated prevalence of infection with zzso zzso strains carrying known zzso zzso with high genetic zzso This highlights the importance of identifying gene zzso for an early detection of virulent zzso
