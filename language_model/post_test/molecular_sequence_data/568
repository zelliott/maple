zzso eight zzso zzso zzso including 27 Chinese, 35 Indian and 16 Malay zzso from Malaysia were zzso by zzso sequence typing zzso of seven zzso genes and compared with the global zzso zzso zzso analysis assigned the zzso to previously identified zzso zzso ancestral zzso zzso zzso and zzso and revealed a new zzso zzso within zzso zzso analysis allowed us to identify population segregation sites that divide the zzso zzso populations and the zzso The majority of Malay zzso were found to be grouped together with Indian zzso 

The majority of the Malay and Indian zzso zzso zzso share the same origin while the Malaysian Chinese zzso zzso is zzso The Malay population, known to have a low infection rate of zzso zzso was likely to be initially zzso zzso free and gained the pathogen only recently from cross infection from other zzso
