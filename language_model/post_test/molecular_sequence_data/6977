The zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family zzso zzso protein zzso shown to be involved in signal zzso from the membrane to the zzso We isolated from a mouse brain library zzso zzso containing a previously unidentified zzso pair alternatively spliced zzso located between zzso 8 and 9 and, therefore, designated zzso zzso Human and mouse zzso zzso also contain the zzso pair alternatively spliced zzso 10 previously described in the avian zzso zzso Independent zzso of these two zzso located between the zzso region 2 zzso and the zzso domain zzso gives rise to zzso potentially zzso four distinct zzso By using specific zzso generated against different portions of zzso we identified at least 10 protein zzso in adult mouse zzso Some zzso in the range of zzso zzso are not recognized by zzso directed against peptides zzso by zzso 1 and 2, indicating the existence of zzso proteins with two different zzso zzso The other zzso in the range of zzso zzso contain the zzso acids zzso by zzso 1 and 2, by either or both of the alternatively spliced zzso and, zzso by another of the unidentified zzso Analysis of zzso zzso expression by reverse zzso chain reaction and zzso of zzso proteins in different zzso of the adult mouse showed a zzso pattern of zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso containing zzso acids zzso by zzso 10 are specifically expressed in neural zzso Taken together, these results suggest that distinct zzso proteins could be involved, in a zzso manner, in signal zzso zzso
