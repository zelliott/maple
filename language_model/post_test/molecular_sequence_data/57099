To introduce a free zzso into zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso 161 in domain I of the toxin was changed to zzso by zzso zzso The free zzso provides a convenient site for zzso attachment of ETA to other proteins in the production of zzso zzso The zzso was then introduced into a zzso of ETA that is impaired in zzso zzso termed zzso that has the zzso zzso inserted between zzso 60 and zzso The resulting double zzso zzso zzso was zzso to three different zzso zzso via a zzso linkage, and the zzso were tested for zzso with cells in zzso Each zzso was extremely potent against cells that expressed surface zzso for the zzso zzso but had little zzso for cells that did not bind the zzso For comparison, we also zzso zzso A chain to each of the three zzso zzso and found that the resulting zzso were at least zzso of magnitude less potent than the corresponding zzso made with zzso This study demonstrates that zzso makes potent and specific zzso and may potentially be useful in selectively eliminating zzso of cells in zzso and in zzso
