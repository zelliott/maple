zzso cells express small zzso zzso to silence target genes or regulate zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso small zzso that are thought to each regulate multiple zzso zzso To gain a deeper understanding of processes regulated by small zzso zzso techniques are required to identify and detect zzso This unit describes standard laboratory methods for and comments about zzso technologies for the identification and detection of small zzso This unit also outlines a zzso reporter gene zzso for assessing the regulatory potential of a zzso on a candidate zzso zzso
