Maintenance of long-term zzso zzso requires de zzso gene zzso Here we report the direct isolation, using zzso display, of genes whose expression level was altered after induction of long-lasting zzso in the zzso of freely moving awake zzso zzso display using zzso primer combinations revealed 17 zzso bands that showed a zzso change in expression zzso These zzso represented at least 10 different genes zzso zzso all of which showed zzso at 75 zzso after zzso induction and a return to zzso expression levels within 24 zzso Three of these genes were known only from expressed sequence tags zzso two were known genes whose zzso by zzso has not been described zzso and zzso and five were known genes whose zzso by zzso has already been reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso We characterized the expression profiles of genes in the two former categories with respect to zzso zzso dependency, tissue zzso and zzso regulation using northern zzso and zzso zzso The zzso of all five of these genes was zzso zzso and correlated with the persistence of zzso suggesting that these genes may play functional roles in prolonged zzso zzso
