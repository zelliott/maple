In this study, we identified a zzso DNA marker using randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso zzso in Yellow River zzso zzso zzso from the Yellow zzso Two hundred and zzso random zzso were used in pooled DNA samples and individual DNA samples from male and female fish for zzso zzso When using the primer zzso a novel zzso zzso product was identified in all male zzso DNA sequencing revealed that this zzso zzso long DNA zzso has a low similarity to a repetitive sequence in zzso zzso zzso In order to confirm the amplification results, two zzso were designed within the zzso sequence in order to amplify the zzso zzso from zzso DNA of male and female zzso for zzso by zzso The results indicated bands specific for males but not zzso zzso results were obtained in dot zzso and Southern zzso zzso experiments when using this zzso zzso as the zzso The zzso pattern was observed in 30 individuals from three separate common carp stocks, suggesting that the sequence is zzso in common carp zzso However, no zzso signals were found in grass zzso zzso zzso which are related to common zzso We submit to use this zzso zzso as a marker to rapidly and accurately identify the gender of Yellow River zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso region may be characterized and used to study mechanisms of zzso evolution in this fish zzso
