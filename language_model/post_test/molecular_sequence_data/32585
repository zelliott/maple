We report the first zzso labeling of zzso zzso for zzso investigation, demonstrating efficient and complete labeling of intact zzso Using a zzso strategy, we evaluate the performance of the MASCOT search engine in the analysis of combined natural abundance and zzso zzso We find that zzso labeling appears to increase the ambiguity associated with zzso identifications due in part to changes in the number of zzso zzso acids when the zzso label is zzso This is reflected by changes in the zzso of false positive identifications with respect to MASCOT zzso However, by determining the nitrogen count from each pair of labeled and zzso peptides we may improve our confidence in both heavy and light zzso
