A human zzso disorder designated as zzso syndrome or permanent zzso zzso has been ascribed to a stem cell zzso leading to a specific zzso of zzso alpha zzso beta 1-3 zzso zzso 3 zzso activity in affected zzso To test for the possibility that an zzso of the beta zzso gene might be zzso instead of zzso we have investigated whether zzso or sodium zzso both zzso of gene zzso would reactivate expression of beta zzso in cloned zzso T cells derived from a patient affected by the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that a single treatment induced de zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso beta zzso the product of beta zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso on zzso zzso which is present on normal but not on beta zzso T cells, was also zzso Although no beta zzso activity was zzso in zzso zzso syndrome T cells, after exposure to zzso zzso activity reached nearly normal zzso Both agents failed to reactivate beta zzso in zzso T zzso cells, which also lack beta zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso syndrome T cells contain an intact beta zzso gene copy and that the zzso zzso in this patient is due to a persistent and complete but zzso repression of a functional zzso In contrast, the cause of beta zzso zzso appears to be different in zzso T zzso
