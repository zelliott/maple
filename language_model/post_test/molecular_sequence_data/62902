The plant respiratory chain contains a complex setup of zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso consequences of which are highly zzso An expression construct for the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of bacterial and zzso type II zzso zzso was introduced into zzso zzso zzso lines with high transcript and protein levels for zzso had up to zzso increased activity of external zzso zzso in isolated zzso as compared to the wild type zzso In two lines, the external zzso zzso activity was instead zzso zzso indicating that the corresponding zzso zzso gene had been zzso zzso of external and internal zzso zzso zzso were unchanged in the transgenic zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso encodes an external zzso specific for zzso and dependent on calcium for zzso zzso lines zzso zzso had specifically increased protein levels for alternative zzso and zzso zzso as compared to the zzso and one zzso zzso This indicates zzso in the zzso control, or zzso conditions influencing it, for the different categories of zzso proteins that bypass zzso zzso The potential effects of external zzso zzso on other cellular processes are zzso
