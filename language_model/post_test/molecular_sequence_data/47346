zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes were used to carry and express zzso B and T cell zzso for zzso zzso of mice, with the aim of developing a zzso vaccine zzso zzso G zzso was composed of the zzso half zzso zzso of the zzso rabies virus zzso zzso 1) G containing zzso site III and the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso G zzso was composed of the zzso half zzso zzso of the European bat zzso 1 zzso 5) G containing zzso site II linked to zzso zzso sites II and III are involved in the induction of zzso zzso The B cell zzso was the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso The T cell zzso was the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso involved in the induction of both zzso T cell zzso production and protection against zzso zzso G carrying foreign zzso induced weak zzso production against rabies and polio viruses and provided weak protection against zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso containing various combinations of B and zzso zzso zzso simultaneous zzso responses against both parental zzso and zzso and provided good protection against zzso The level of zzso and cellular immune responses depended on the order of the foreign zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso can be used not only to broaden the spectrum of protection against zzso but also to express foreign B and zzso zzso The potential usefulness of zzso zzso zzso for the development of zzso vaccines against animal diseases and zzso including zzso is zzso
