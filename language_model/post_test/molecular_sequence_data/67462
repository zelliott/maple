We introduce a conceptual bridge between the previously zzso fields of zzso and mathematical spatial zzso which enables the spatial parameters of an emerging epidemic to be directly estimated from sampled pathogen zzso zzso By using zzso history to correct for spatial zzso we illustrate how a fundamental spatial zzso the diffusion zzso can be estimated using robust zzso statistics, and how zzso in zzso can be readily zzso We apply this framework to the spread of the West Nile virus across North America, an important recent instance of spatial invasion by an emerging infectious zzso We demonstrate that the zzso of West Nile virus is greater and far more variable than previously measured, such that its dissemination was critically determined by rare, long-range movements that are unlikely to be discerned during field zzso Our results indicate that, by ignoring this zzso previous models of the epidemic have substantially overestimated its basic zzso zzso More generally, our approach demonstrates that easily zzso genetic data can be used to measure the spatial dynamics of natural populations that are otherwise difficult or costly to zzso
