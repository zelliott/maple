zzso bodies zzso are nuclear zzso whose zzso structure and molecular composition have been zzso from plants to zzso Furthermore, zzso are often found to zzso with specific DNA zzso in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Much as zzso sequences are called zzso organizers, we term these coiled zzso sequences zzso body zzso zzso The only sequences that have been shown to be zzso in human cells are the zzso U2 and zzso gene zzso We wanted to determine whether other zzso genes might also act as zzso In this paper we show that human zzso genes (the zzso zzso zzso associate with zzso in zzso zzso In addition, we have analyzed the zzso organization of the zzso locus by constructing a zzso and zzso clone zzso We found that, unlike the zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes are not zzso zzso Rather, zzso genes are clustered on human zzso zzso with evidence for large zzso zzso within the zzso Thus all of the zzso identified to date are composed of either zzso repeated or tightly clustered zzso The evolutionary and cell biological consequences of this type of organization are zzso
