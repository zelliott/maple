The sequence of the zzso zzso zzso region of a zzso channel from the kidney zzso was altered to match that of the closely related inward zzso zzso channel by changing two zzso zzso zzso zzso 117 and zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso channel expressed in zzso zzso zzso had an apparent zzso constant at zero zzso zzso in the presence of zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which was more than 50 times lower than the zzso of the zzso channel zzso zzso zzso zzso The increased sensitivity to zzso was accounted for by the point zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that the increased affinity involved an increase in the zzso for zzso block and a decrease in the zzso Block by zzso was also zzso The single-channel zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was increased by zzso whereas the degree of inward zzso zzso zzso and apparent affinity for zzso were essentially zzso When the neutral zzso zzso within the second putative zzso domain of the zzso channel was zzso with zzso acid, the corresponding zzso acid in zzso the degree of inward zzso was enhanced but zzso block and single-channel inward zzso were zzso Thus the site of zzso binding appears to be distinct from the locus of internal zzso block and from at least one of the sites that determines zzso zzso
