zzso proteins play a key role in the zzso expression of zzso genes in T zzso zzso and zzso are the zzso zzso family members in the peripheral immune zzso zzso is found abundantly in the zzso of resting T cells, whereas zzso expression is induced during T cell zzso To investigate zzso regulation, we characterized the structure of the zzso zzso gene and its zzso zzso A zzso sequence zzso to the zzso start site is highly zzso between mouse and human and possesses both zzso and zzso promoter zzso Multiple binding sites for zzso factors were identified within this region, including a consensus zzso zzso This promoter segment was zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso site zzso zzso promoter activity and inhibited formation of an zzso DNA zzso protein complex containing zzso in primary T zzso zzso of zzso increased zzso zzso promoter activity, whereas this zzso was attenuated in zzso zzso This study suggests that pre-existing zzso contributes to the subsequent induction of zzso during T cell zzso
