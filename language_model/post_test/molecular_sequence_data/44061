In this report we generate a partial zzso of the zzso zzso using zzso DNA sequences from twelve species of zzso belonging to five zzso Electric zzso and electric organ zzso are also zzso We have zzso and aligned zzso bases from the zzso zzso zzso and 559 bases from the zzso zzso from zzso species of the zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were used as zzso Three zzso methods generated zzso partial zzso for these zzso Our analysis focuses on the zzso zzso which is a zzso zzso with at least zzso nominal zzso Six zzso from zzso had distinctive zzso but were zzso zzso in that they all had the zzso body zzso DNA analysis fully supports the zzso data that the six zzso represent distinct zzso The group from zzso is zzso while zzso zzso from West Africa is a separate zzso zzso zzso a second distinct zzso is a sister group to the six species from zzso zzso is the sister group of all the zzso of the zzso zzso so far zzso thereby confirming previous zzso zzso zzso zzso is the sister group of the family zzso also confirming an earlier zzso hypothesis based on zzso The molecular data adds polarity to electric organ zzso zzso zzso appear to be zzso zzso with zzso stalked zzso zzso on the zzso side, represents an ancestral state for the zzso while zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso represent the zzso zzso Two species with zzso zzso zzso on the zzso side may represent a transitional zzso At least two species of zzso appear to have reverted to zzso stalked zzso possibly through zzso
