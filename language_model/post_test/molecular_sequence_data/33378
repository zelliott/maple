The inherited zzso syndrome familial Mediterranean fever zzso is characterized by zzso episodes of fever, which are independent of any bacterial or viral zzso This disease is associated with point zzso in the zzso gene product zzso Although the precise molecular functions of zzso are unknown, it seems to be involved in the maturation and zzso of zzso zzso two thirds of all zzso zzso cluster in the zzso zzso domain of zzso To investigate the molecular consequences of zzso zzso we determined the crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain at zzso zzso The comparison with other zzso complex structures revealed a shallow zzso which seems to be involved in binding the zzso zzso The bottom of this cavity is covered mainly with zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso recognizes its zzso by zzso contacts and surface zzso zzso zzso cluster around two sites on the zzso zzso zzso two zzso including those zzso with the most severe disease zzso are observed in the vicinity of the predicted zzso binding site, suggesting that they will have a direct impact on zzso zzso A second zzso hot spot was observed on the opposite side of the zzso domain in the zzso of its artificial zzso Although most zzso zzso are zzso exposed, several will modify the zzso zzso of zzso The experimental crystal structure of the zzso zzso domain serves as a basis for an accurate zzso of these zzso
