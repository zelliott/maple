zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein involved in cell growth, differentiation and zzso In this study, a new zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned from zzso zzso zzso by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso zzso The full-length zzso sequence of zzso was zzso in size, containing a zzso region zzso of zzso and a zzso of zzso The deduced protein sequence of the open reading frame zzso showed highest similarity zzso to the zzso of the zzso fish zzso zzso An abundant zzso of the determined zzso zzso has been detected in liver and skin of zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso was zzso zzso in liver after infection with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Singapore grouper zzso zzso while the expression was zzso after stimulation with zzso A zzso zzso zzso mature zzso zzso was successfully expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso and the zzso against zzso was obtained for further zzso zzso may be an important zzso in the innate immunity of zzso
