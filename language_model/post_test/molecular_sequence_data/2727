zzso of the zzso gene coding for an outer membrane protein of zzso coli is regulated by a zzso zzso mechanism that requires the zzso gene product that acts on zzso located upstream of the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that this zzso upstream sequence displays a zzso zzso of the DNA zzso To characterize the structure and function of this upstream zzso a series of deletion zzso and zzso zzso of the upstream sequence of the zzso promoter were constructed, and their abilities as to zzso and activities of the zzso promoter were examined after they had been connected to the zzso zzso The zzso extending from position zzso to zzso are essential not only for zzso recognition of the zzso promoter by the zzso zzso but also for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso It was also demonstrated that the zzso extending from position zzso to zzso play a role in stimulation of the zzso zzso A local structural zzso in the zzso promoter was observed in some of the zzso zzso Based on the results, the structure and function of the upstream sequence of the zzso promoter are discussed in relation to zzso of the zzso promoter by the zzso zzso
