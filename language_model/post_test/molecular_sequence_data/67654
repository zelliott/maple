zzso zzso also called zzso is classified as a type II zzso zzso and is highly expressed in developing as well as in mature zzso Along with zzso zzso zzso is a candidate marker gene for zzso Its function is unknown, but it has been reported to have zzso zzso zzso in a knockout mouse model did not substantiate that zzso It has zzso to zzso Single zzso zzso of zzso have been associated with zzso zzso zzso and Alzheimer's disease in zzso In the present study, three zzso zzso with deduced molecular weights of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso I) zzso were proposed and verified by Western zzso from cells with green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso and by zzso of zzso from human zzso and cultured zzso zzso of each zzso zzso followed by zzso imaging showed that zzso I and II had zzso zzso while zzso III was zzso zzso of zzso demonstrated differential expression of each zzso zzso in patient's specimens taken from zzso zzso zzso biceps zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso increased the expression of both zzso zzso and myostatin, indicating a potential negative feedback loop between zzso and its zzso zzso of all zzso zzso simultaneously also reduced zzso zzso zzso protein three-dimensional zzso modeling predictions indicated each zzso zzso had different structures and potential zzso zzso 1, modeled as a zzso zzso zzso 2, a zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3, an zzso zzso zzso domain scaffolding zzso Further functional studies with each zzso zzso may help us to better understand regulation of zzso zzso zzso development, response to injury and strain, as well as mechanisms in zzso These results may indicate novel therapeutic targets in specific zzso zzso as well as treatments for zzso zzso
