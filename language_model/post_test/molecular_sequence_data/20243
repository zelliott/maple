The zzso are a family of proteins that bind free iron in the blood and bodily zzso zzso zzso function to deliver iron to cells via a zzso zzso process as well as to remove toxic free iron from the blood and to provide an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in bodily zzso such as milk) are only known to have an zzso function, via their ability to tightly bind free iron even at low zzso and have no known transport zzso Though these proteins keep the level of free iron low, zzso bacteria are able to thrive by obtaining iron from their host via expression of outer membrane proteins that can bind to and remove iron from host zzso including both serum zzso and zzso Furthermore, even though human serum zzso and zzso are quite similar in sequence and structure, and coordinate iron in the same manner, they differ in their affinities for iron as well as their zzso binding zzso the human zzso zzso only binds serum zzso and two distinct bacterial transport systems are used to capture iron from serum zzso and zzso zzso of the recently solved crystal structure of zzso human serum zzso to that of human zzso provides insight into these zzso
