zzso is a potent inhibitor of zzso promoter activity and subsequent gene zzso This property has been exploited to suppress the expression of a variety of zzso for regulating tumor proliferation or viral zzso In this paper, we describe a novel zzso zzso designed to express human zzso zzso zzso and to reduce the promoter activity in the zzso Mouse zzso zzso cells were zzso zzso with an expression construct containing a truncated human zzso gene promoter fused to the zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso into these cells of the zzso zzso zzso zzso targeted to the 26 zzso zzso element in the human zzso gene promoter resulted in a zzso decrease in the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso zzso may be useful as an alternative program of gene regulation in the zzso
