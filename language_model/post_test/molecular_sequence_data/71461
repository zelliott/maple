zzso are zzso zzso with a complex life cycle in human and snail zzso They express zzso genes that conceivably determine distinct properties of the zzso at different zzso zzso Here we report the zzso gene zzso which is zzso expressed in zzso residing in the snail zzso The zzso and the gene were cloned and zzso The zzso from cap site to the zzso addition site, is zzso zzso zzso It encodes a protein of 117 zzso acids with a zzso signal zzso of 18 zzso indicating that zzso is a zzso or a zzso zzso In the gene the zzso is split into four zzso spread over zzso zzso of zzso zzso
