A zzso zzso zzso to human zzso zzso was raised in zzso zzso cell using zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso zzso and had a zzso of zzso zzso zzso M for zzso zzso zzso for zzso was demonstrated by Western zzso of normal human serum using zzso zzso gel zzso As judged by zzso zzso inhibited binding of zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso studies further showed that zzso complexes of zzso were not formed, and zzso displaced zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso reacted with the major zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso terminal zzso of zzso but zzso did not react with this zzso These results indicate that interaction of zzso with zzso causes zzso changes which inhibit binding of zzso
