We have previously isolated and zzso a soluble zzso zzso that acts as zzso in the stimulation of steroid zzso In this report we have used synthetic peptides whose sequences match those obtained from zzso to generate zzso zzso and show that these zzso bind to zzso zzso protein as determined by zzso zzso The presence of zzso was detected by Western zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso One of the zzso was also used to purify zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from affinity columns produce a zzso stimulation of zzso zzso This effect was blocked by the use of an inhibitor of zzso zzso These results suggest the involvement of zzso in zzso the zzso signal to zzso in zzso zzso zzso We also describe a partial zzso clone with a predicted zzso acid sequence that matches the sequences of the internal peptides of zzso
