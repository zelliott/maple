We have used two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso to determine the solution structures of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso The determination of the structure was based on total relaxation zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso using the program zzso zzso procedures to consider the experimental zzso in zzso zzso during these calculations have been zzso The zzso distance restraints were applied in restrained molecular dynamics zzso Twenty final structures each were generated for both the zzso and XL from both zzso and zzso zzso starting zzso The zzso zzso zzso of the coordinates for the 40 structures for the zzso and XL were zzso and zzso A, zzso The zzso of the zzso with respect to the XL is zzso zzso The local DNA structure is distorted in both zzso with the zzso zzso by 34 degrees and 25 degrees for the zzso and XL, respectively, and an overall zzso repeat of 11 base pairs, caused by zzso of the zzso The zzso is a zzso intermediate on the path to zzso zzso zzso local structural distortion is induced by both zzso but the DNA returns to zzso structure within three base pairs of the damage zzso There is no significant bend in the zzso axis of either the zzso or the zzso We have evaluated the accuracy of the two major methods of converting zzso data into zzso zzso the isolated zzso approximation zzso and the complete relaxation rate zzso analysis zzso Both methods were evaluated by comparing the resulting calculated zzso distances generated to known zzso fixed distances in the zzso The overall structures were evaluated by checking their agreement with zzso evidence from zzso zzso Only the modified zzso method gave correct zzso zzso
