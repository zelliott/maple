zzso zzso zzso zzso are ubiquitous in soil and are zzso and zzso highly zzso zzso methods based on universal zzso detection of the zzso marker gene have been successfully applied to describe zzso populations in the zzso However, the use of highly zzso zzso and zzso amplification conditions render these methods prone to amplification bias, while less zzso primer sets will not amplify all zzso zzso We have developed a zzso approach with six zzso protocols using less zzso to zzso primer sets that all amplify the same zzso zzso as a previously published zzso protocol for universal zzso These protocols target different groups of zzso and allowed for direct comparison of the zzso products by use of restriction zzso length zzso zzso The new protocols were zzso on DNA from 14 reference strains and were subsequently tested with bulk DNA extracts from six zzso These analyses revealed that the new zzso primer sets amplified zzso sequences that were not detected by the universal primer zzso Furthermore, they were better suited to distinguish between zzso populations in the different zzso Because the novel primer sets were not specific for zzso groups of zzso they do not serve as an identification zzso however, they proved powerful as zzso tools for zzso of soil zzso zzso
