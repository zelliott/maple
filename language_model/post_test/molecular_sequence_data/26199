zzso zzso derivatives of zzso zzso of zzso were prepared, and their binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was zzso The results suggest the involvement of an zzso critical hydrogen bond in the highest affinity zzso zzso which now appears to require two hydrogen bonds from the zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso to the zzso and one from the protein to zzso of that zzso The data obtained with a series of zzso zzso at position zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso support the binding patterns and zzso zzso previously from studies with large numbers of zzso zzso and this family of zzso
