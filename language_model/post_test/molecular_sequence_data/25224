The defective zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso based element which encodes a zzso zzso particle with zzso zzso zzso is induced by agents which elicit the zzso zzso In a zzso zzso strain which carries the zzso zzso zzso is induced by raising the growth temperature from 37 degrees C to 48 degrees zzso A zzso zzso has been cloned which zzso the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of this zzso contains an open reading frame zzso which encodes a protein of 113 zzso acids zzso This zzso sequence resembles that of other zzso zzso and suggests that the zzso region forms a zzso zzso typical of the zzso domain of many bacterial regulatory zzso The zzso is preceded by four zzso direct repeats, each of which contains an internal zzso zzso and by sequences resembling a zzso zzso The zzso sequence of an equivalent zzso from the zzso zzso strain has also been zzso There are three zzso differences within the zzso compared to the wild type, one of which lies within the zzso zzso This zzso encodes a zzso protein of zzso
