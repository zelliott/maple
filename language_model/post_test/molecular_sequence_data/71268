Human lung zzso protein D zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso and zzso in the innate immune surveillance against zzso in the lung through recognition of zzso zzso present on the surface of zzso The involvement of this protein in innate immunity and the allergic response make it the subject of much zzso 

We have determined the crystal structure of a zzso zzso of zzso at zzso A zzso The structure comprises an zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso An interesting zzso from symmetry was found in the projection of a single zzso zzso into the zzso of the zzso the asymmetry of this zzso influences the orientation of one of the adjacent zzso The zzso between the three zzso presents a large positively charged zzso 

The fold of the zzso of zzso is similar to that of the zzso protein zzso but its orientation relative to the zzso zzso region differs somewhat to that seen in the zzso zzso The novel central packing of the zzso zzso within the zzso and the resulting zzso orientation of the zzso has unexpected functional zzso The positively charged surface might facilitate binding to zzso charged structures, such as zzso
