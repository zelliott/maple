The dog zzso zzso was cloned to facilitate the identification and characterization of selective zzso zzso zzso The dog zzso is zzso identical to the human zzso zzso Despite such high zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso were clearly differentiated by each zzso zzso By contrast, zzso zzso binding and functional activity were not differentiated by the two zzso The basis of the differences was investigated by preparing zzso receptors followed by zzso zzso zzso a single substitution of zzso to zzso in the dog zzso explained the major differences in binding affinities and functional zzso The single zzso acid replacement of zzso of the human zzso with zzso resulted in a zzso decrease of binding affinity of the zzso zzso compound zzso zzso the replacement of zzso of the dog zzso with zzso resulted in a zzso increase of affinity for this zzso These results show that zzso of the zzso zzso is critical for the binding of this structural class of zzso zzso and that the dog zzso can be zzso by substituting zzso for zzso This study provides the first identification of a critical zzso in the binding pocket occupied by zzso zzso zzso and reinforces cautious zzso of zzso activity across highly zzso zzso
