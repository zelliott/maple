Members of the zzso zzso zzso have been grouped together by function and by the presence of zzso zzso acids in the zzso domain, including four zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso However, no consensus sequence motif has been described in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso We now report the presence of a zzso consensus sequence zzso eight zzso acids in zzso which is found in the zzso domain of all the zzso zzso The zzso motif zzso can be divided into two complementary families that have zzso consensus zzso The consensus sequences were found by allowing similar zzso acids zzso zzso Al, aromatic zzso zzso to be grouped zzso The first motif zzso has the sequence zzso while the second zzso is zzso An overall consensus sequence for the zzso zzso and zzso is derived by allowing aromatic and zzso zzso to be considered zzso zzso zzso Several alternative zzso zzso zzso contain two copies of the zzso within the same zzso zzso The conservation of the zzso motif in zzso receptors suggests that it plays a critical role in zzso function and defines a new feature of the zzso zzso zzso
