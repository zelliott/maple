A novel zzso for degradation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in a newly isolated zzso zzso zzso et zzso 1996 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We now report the cloning and molecular zzso of four genes from this zzso zzso that exist on a zzso zzso zzso and zzso the three zzso zzso involved in this zzso together with a putative zzso zzso The zzso expressed degradation zzso proteins are zzso zzso zzso zzso the first zzso in the zzso pathway, is a zzso zzso which displays only low sequence identity with a hypothetical protein from zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso and zzso suggests that it is a zzso The most likely zzso that could potentially zzso an zzso transition metal zzso are in the sequence zzso which would be unique for a zzso Situated immediately downstream of zzso with the same direction of zzso is a gene zzso whose conceptual translation zzso zzso zzso shows significant sequence identity and similar potential zzso spanning regions to the zzso family of zzso zzso A gene zzso is situated downstream of the zzso and zzso zzso but transcribed in the opposite zzso The gene encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso linear zzso zzso to a zzso degradation zzso This zzso belongs to the zzso zzso family of active site zzso zzso The final gene in the cluster zzso is located upstream of the zzso gene and is transcribed in the opposite zzso It codes for zzso zzso zzso which mediates further zzso degradation of the zzso This protein shows significant sequence identity to a hypothetical protein from zzso zzso It is suspected to be a zzso based on zzso by metal zzso It is zzso on the basis of comparison with other zzso that the genes in this cluster may all be involved in cell wall zzso cycling and subsequently act zzso in zzso of zzso zzso
