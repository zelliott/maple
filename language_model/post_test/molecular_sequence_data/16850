To reveal the molecular regulation mechanism of selective zzso zzso in zzso zzso we isolated the zzso zzso zzso cellular zzso zzso protein zzso which zzso death zzso zzso signal zzso Two alternative zzso zzso of zzso zzso cellular zzso form zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso form zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified from a zzso library prepared from zzso zzso cells of pig zzso zzso and zzso indicated high identities with human and zzso zzso and both of them contain two tandem specific zzso acid regions zzso zzso zzso zzso in their zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso inhibit the death zzso zzso signal by binding to other zzso factors zzso by zzso zzso contains a short zzso region, while zzso has a zzso domain in the zzso zzso The reverse zzso chain reaction analysis revealed that both zzso and zzso zzso were highly expressed in zzso cells of healthy zzso suggesting that these zzso play important roles in the regulation mechanism of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The present data will contribute to understanding of the zzso roles of zzso in the zzso regulation in zzso zzso
