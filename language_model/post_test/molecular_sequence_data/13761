A new gene zzso with zzso and differential expression in fetal brain has recently been isolated from a zzso zzso boundary area near zzso The corresponding zzso has an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a 3' untranslated region of zzso zzso and a highly zzso zzso untranslated zzso The coding and 3' zzso sequence is specified by 6 zzso within nearly 87 zzso of isolated zzso zzso The zzso end region of the transcript maps adjacent to the only zzso defined zzso island in a zzso zzso that may be associated with part of the mental zzso of some zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anomalies, and mental zzso syndrome zzso In addition to zzso and zzso acid similarity to an zzso from a zzso infant brain zzso library, the predicted protein has extensive similarity to two zzso zzso zzso of, as yet, unknown zzso The zzso locus is, therefore, likely part of a family of genes with two members expressed in human zzso The extensive conservation of the predicted protein suggests a fundamental function of the gene product and will enable evaluation of the role of the zzso gene in zzso in model zzso
