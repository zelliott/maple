zzso has been shown to be an effective method to improve the efficiency of gene expression and the zzso of DNA zzso To zzso the procedure and test for its efficacy in more clinically relevant large animal models, we studied the effects of zzso DNA vaccination with different zzso parameters in zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso the zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso a fused gene of zzso and zzso were injected zzso followed by zzso once a month for several zzso The zzso as well as cellular immune responses were closely followed for more than a zzso The different zzso parameters resulted in considerably different zzso in immune responses, suggesting that zzso of zzso parameters is important in developing clinical application of DNA zzso
