zzso tuberculosis is arguably the world's most successful infectious agent because of its ability to control its own cell growth within the zzso zzso growth rate is closely coupled to zzso transcription, which in zzso coli is regulated through zzso and zzso The mechanisms of zzso zzso control in zzso which lack zzso are zzso Here we identify zzso as an essential zzso protein that controls zzso zzso Loss of zzso is lethal for zzso in culture and during infection of zzso zzso depletion leads to sensitivity to killing by zzso stress, zzso and DNA damage, accompanied by failure to reduce zzso zzso zzso can functionally replace zzso for stringent control of zzso transcription, even though zzso associates with a different site on zzso zzso These findings highlight a distinct molecular mechanism for regulating zzso zzso in zzso that is critical for zzso tuberculosis zzso
