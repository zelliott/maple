The simplest naturally occurring model system for studying zzso folding and assembly is the zzso zzso formed by the zzso zzso zzso of the heavy chains of zzso Here, we describe the structure of zzso zzso zzso as determined by X-ray zzso and an analysis of the folding zzso of this zzso Under conditions where zzso zzso does not contribute to the folding zzso formation of the zzso structure is the zzso zzso zzso formation of zzso is a slow process, even compared to other zzso zzso while the subsequent association of the folded zzso is zzso After long-time zzso the majority of the unfolded zzso molecules reaches the native state in two serial zzso involving the zzso of the zzso bond to the zzso zzso The species with the wrong zzso accumulate as a zzso zzso zzso the zzso to the correct zzso zzso is the prerequisite for zzso of the zzso zzso In contrast, in the zzso zzso of the same zzso zzso zzso occurs after zzso demonstrating that within one zzso comprised of highly zzso zzso both the zzso of zzso formation and the stage at which zzso zzso occurs during the folding process can be completely zzso
