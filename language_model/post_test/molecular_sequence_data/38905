A zzso and salicylic acid zzso zzso activity has been recently identified in tobacco that is related to a previously identified class of zzso zzso zzso To identify members of the zzso gene family associated with this zzso activity, we have attempted to isolate those zzso genes that are induced by pathogen zzso Using a zzso differential display zzso we have isolated two tobacco zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are rapidly induced in resistant tobacco plants after infection by tobacco mosaic virus zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso proteins with a single zzso domain that contain the zzso zzso zzso Unlike other isolated zzso proteins that contain the zzso zinc zzso zzso and zzso appear to contain the zzso zinc zzso Nonetheless, both zzso and zzso are capable of binding DNA molecules with the zzso zzso element recognized by other zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso genes could be rapidly induced not only by zzso infection but also by zzso or its biologically active zzso that are capable of inducing zzso genes and enhanced zzso Interestingly, induction of both genes by zzso infection was still observed in resistant tobacco plants expressing the bacterial zzso zzso gene zzso although the levels of induction appeared to be zzso Identification of zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso proteins should facilitate future studies on the regulation and functions of this novel group of zzso zzso
