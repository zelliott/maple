Transfer zzso zzso hold a central place in protein synthesis by interpreting the genetic information stored in DNA into the zzso acid sequence of zzso thus functioning as zzso zzso In recent years, however, various studies have shown that zzso have additional functions beyond participating in protein zzso When suffering from certain nutritional zzso zzso change the level of zzso to became zzso and these zzso zzso act as zzso molecules to regulate global gene zzso so that the stressed zzso zzso with the adverse environmental zzso In budding zzso and certain zzso cells, the retrograde movement of mature zzso from zzso to nucleus serves as a mechanism for the surveillance system within the nucleus to continue monitoring the integrity of zzso On the other hand, this retrograde action effectively reduces the global protein synthesis level under conditions of nutritional zzso Quite recently, various publications have shown that zzso are not stable molecules in an absolute zzso Under certain zzso or environmental zzso they are specifically zzso into fragments of different lengths in the zzso loop or zzso left zzso These zzso are not a meaningless random degradation zzso Instead, a novel class of signal molecules such as zzso halves or zzso may be produced, which are closely correlated with the zzso of global gene zzso Investigation of the regulatory functions of zzso is a zzso which seeks to reveal the structural and functional diversity of zzso as well as their vital functions during the expression of genetic zzso
