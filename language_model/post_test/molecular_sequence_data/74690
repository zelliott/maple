zzso zzso is an zzso member of the bovine pancreatic zzso zzso zzso zzso that exhibits innate zzso zzso zzso has been granted both zzso and zzso status by the zzso Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of zzso zzso and is poised to become the first zzso agent based on a zzso zzso into the mechanism of zzso zzso have zzso several important zzso for zzso including efficient zzso of zzso activity to the zzso and preservation of zzso zzso Nevertheless, the most striking similarity between zzso and bovine seminal zzso another naturally zzso zzso is their zzso to zzso by the potent zzso zzso inhibitor protein zzso zzso typically binds to its zzso zzso with zzso zzso extraordinary feat considering the modest sequence identity among the bound zzso zzso zzso such as zzso A or its human zzso zzso 1, have the potential to be more attractive zzso agents than zzso zzso to their higher zzso activity, low potential for zzso favorable tissue distribution, and high therapeutic index, but are limited by their sensitivity to zzso These zzso zzso zzso can be transformed into potent zzso by zzso them with zzso using protein engineering strategies such as zzso zzso zzso fusion to a targeting zzso and chemical zzso In several instances, these engineered zzso exhibit greater zzso in zzso than does zzso zzso we review the zzso characteristics of zzso complexes and progress towards the development of zzso zzso zzso through the zzso of zzso
