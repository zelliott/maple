We report here the isolation of a new member of the zzso factor zzso family zzso present in the zzso zzso cell line, but not its zzso zzso zzso with this zzso zzso zzso zzso increased with zzso maturation of zzso cells, and decreased with zzso zzso differentiation of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso was most abundant in brain and zzso While zzso protein was predominantly zzso its membrane association increased following exposure to zzso like many members of the zzso zzso Using the zzso zzso system, six molecules which interact with zzso were identified including zzso a zzso of the zzso protein conducting channel zzso zzso of zzso confirmed a stable association between zzso and zzso in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso a novel member of the zzso zzso family, interacts with the zzso zzso
