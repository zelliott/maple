The mouse zzso zzso zzso suppresses translation in zzso and zzso zzso to zzso by binding to zzso elements in the 3' untranslated regions of specific zzso We have now zzso zzso from zzso and brain zzso extracts and cloned its zzso We find that the mouse zzso zzso contain an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids with a zzso zzso domain within its C zzso a zzso zzso and a group of putative zzso zzso zzso shows zzso identity to the human zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 10, zzso As shown for zzso zzso also binds to zzso zzso containing a broad range of consensus zzso many of which are similar to the Y and H zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and an zzso was prepared against the zzso zzso The identity between zzso and zzso was confirmed by demonstrating that zzso of zzso from zzso extracts abolished formation of the zzso zzso Based upon its DNA binding to target sequences in clustered zzso regions, we propose that zzso may be involved in DNA zzso or DNA repair in male germ zzso
