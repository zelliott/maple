zzso zzso is a zzso T zzso zzso originally described as a growth factor for B cell zzso and zzso that was recently shown to stimulate growth and differentiation of normal B and T zzso Here, we describe a zzso for zzso that was isolated from a library prepared using zzso of a zzso helper T cell clone activated with a zzso zzso The zzso which zzso with a zzso of approximately zzso zzso encodes a zzso consisting of 211 zzso acids with a typical signal sequence of 24 zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso which form the mature protein (Mr zzso zzso No zzso site but several potential zzso sites were identified in the predicted zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of zzso with that of human zzso 6 disclosed a zzso of zzso at the DNA level and of zzso at the protein level with a maximum of 57% for the segment spanning zzso zzso of mature zzso Considering the functional zzso that was previously established between these two zzso we therefore propose that zzso be renamed zzso zzso zzso
