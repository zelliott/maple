zzso rats develop zzso zzso and mild zzso which is characteristic of human zzso diabetes zzso zzso We cloned and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in the zzso Comparing the DNA sequences of the zzso zzso gene and zzso zzso zzso normal zzso we found a deletion in the zzso zzso zzso bases in zzso which was flanked by two zzso direct repeats zzso at positions zzso and zzso numbered according to the zzso gene zzso one of which was zzso The promoter region, the first and second zzso were missing in the zzso The region upstream and downstream of the zzso including zzso 3, 4 and 5, was zzso between the two zzso and did not contain any base zzso We found that the gene mapped to zzso 14 in zzso zzso rats are the naturally occurring knockout animals with the zzso disrupted zzso zzso
