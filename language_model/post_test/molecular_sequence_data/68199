zzso coiled zzso zzso were zzso and their folding properties characterized in order to define the role of charged border zzso at the coiled zzso interface for the controlled formation of zzso and zzso zzso Three peptides were designed to form parallel coiled coils with zzso and zzso occupying the zzso interface positions a and zzso respectively, of the zzso repeat zzso The zzso designated zzso with the zzso repeat sequence zzso contained zzso and zzso in the interface border positions e and zzso respectively, and was designed to form a coiled zzso zzso at neutral zzso Two other zzso designated zzso and zzso have the zzso repeats zzso and zzso zzso zzso contains only zzso acid at both e and g zzso zzso only zzso zzso and zzso were designed to form a stable coiled zzso zzso when combined at neutral zzso All three zzso were prepared by zzso synthesis and zzso by zzso zzso liquid zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso formed a stable zzso coiled zzso structure as determined by circular zzso and zzso zzso The zzso content of zzso was highest at neutral pH and decreased at extremes of zzso The zzso structure of zzso at zzso zzso had a zzso of zzso degrees C and exhibited a concentration dependence of zzso zzso consistent with zzso zzso In contrast to results with zzso a mixture of zzso and zzso but neither alone, forms zzso at neutral zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
