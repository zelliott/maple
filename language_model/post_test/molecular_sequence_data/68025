A panel of eight zzso zzso zzso was obtained against zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso of the eight zzso indicate that four of them recognize zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and four are directed against zzso zzso and recognize a zzso (or zzso within the 43 zzso zzso zzso zzso Using these zzso zzso zzso missing one or more zzso zzso acids can be distinguished from molecules with an intact zzso either in zzso zzso zzso or by zzso zzso A sandwich zzso using the combination of two zzso one from each group, can zzso both zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso with a detection range from 1 to 10 zzso in either buffer or zzso Using only one zzso a competitive zzso capture zzso can zzso zzso or natural zzso zzso 1, 2, and 3 with a detection range from 5 to 100 zzso for zzso with a zzso in position 47 zzso None of the zzso recognizes zzso after it is zzso to zzso The ability of any one of these zzso zzso to interfere with zzso binding to zzso as measured by zzso of zzso zzso activity zzso with the range of zzso affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with one zzso from Group A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one from Group B zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso completely blocks the ability of zzso to bind zzso This zzso panel is thus useful for probing the zzso zzso integrity of zzso for sensitive free zzso zzso and the combined use of two zzso has potential applications as an antidote for zzso in zzso
