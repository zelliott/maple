zzso regulation of the zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed in zzso zzso revealed that either zzso or zzso bound to the region close to that recognized by zzso The zzso promoter activity was zzso approximately zzso by zzso expressed zzso or zzso and approximately zzso by zzso respectively, in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso with either of zzso or zzso dramatically activated the promoter approximately zzso or approximately zzso zzso Especially zzso zzso by zzso and zzso was surprising, because these zzso factors are known to inhibit the respective zzso activities of each zzso These zzso effects of zzso and zzso with zzso were inhibited by zzso of zzso indicating that zzso serves as a zzso for the zzso gene zzso zzso regulation of the zzso gene through four zzso factors is zzso
