The presence of Y zzso sequences in zzso syndrome zzso patients has been suggested in previous zzso zzso analysis estimated at about zzso of patients with a 45, X constitution and molecular analysis zzso zzso analysis with several Y zzso zzso and zzso of specific zzso identified the presence of Y zzso material in about zzso of 45, X zzso We have developed a very sensitive, zzso method to detect Y specific sequences in DNA from zzso zzso This protocol permits the detection of a single cell carrying a Y sequence among zzso zzso zzso We studied 18 zzso patients with 4 zzso zzso In 11 patients we detected a positive amplification for at least one Y zzso The existence of a simple and sensitive method for the detection of Y sequences has important implications for zzso patients, in view of the risk for some of the females carrying zzso material of developing zzso and zzso Additionally, some of the zzso associated zzso such as zzso anomalies, could be correlated with the presence of Y zzso specific zzso
