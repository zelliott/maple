zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso domain protein that associates with protein zzso C in an zzso zzso We have identified a human zzso which shares a significant sequence zzso with rat zzso The isolated zzso zzso designated human zzso zzso was zzso zzso in length and zzso a predicted protein of zzso zzso acids which had zzso overall identity to rat zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was predominantly expressed in heart and skeletal muscle, while zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso expressed in various human zzso The zzso location of the gene was determined on zzso zzso region, between markers zzso and zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso analyses using both a zzso zzso hybrid cell panel and a radiation hybrid mapping zzso
