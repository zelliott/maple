zzso zzso is a mechanism used by G zzso receptors to diversify their properties and zzso We previously demonstrated that these interactions occur through salt bridge formation between zzso of the involved zzso Recent studies claim that zzso zzso binds to an zzso zzso located in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso third zzso zzso This is the same zzso involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso through zzso interaction between the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso located in the zzso segment of the zzso of the zzso zzso Mass zzso analysis indicates that an zzso interaction involving the zzso zzso zzso zzso and several zzso zzso zzso are mainly responsible for the zzso zzso zzso zzso could also form multiple zzso complexes by means of zzso interactions with an zzso localized in the zzso segment of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso disrupted the binding of zzso to the zzso but not to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso disrupted the zzso interactions between the zzso zzso zzso and the more zzso zzso zzso zzso A model is introduced with the possible functional implications of zzso zzso These in zzso findings imply a possible regulatory role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso
