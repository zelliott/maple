The zzso zzso zzso zzso relies on zzso zzso including zzso of proteins required for recognition and invasion of host zzso We have characterized the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso L zzso one of five zzso found in the zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso is the primary target of the compound zzso zzso zzso zzso which was previously shown to inhibit zzso invasion by blocking the release of invasion proteins from zzso zzso zzso As shown by zzso labeled zzso and zzso zzso zzso is associated with a discrete zzso structure in the zzso region of zzso zzso but is found in multiple zzso throughout the zzso of zzso replicating zzso zzso fails to label cells lacking zzso due to targeted disruption of the zzso gene in two different zzso zzso We present a structural model for the zzso of zzso by zzso based on a zzso A resolution crystal structure of zzso in complex with its zzso We discuss possible roles for zzso as a zzso involved in the degradation or limited zzso of zzso proteins involved in zzso
