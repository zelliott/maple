The rat zzso II type 2 zzso zzso gene was isolated, and zzso regions in its zzso area were zzso zzso extension and zzso protection analyses revealed a single zzso initiation site at the position 24 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso The zzso region of zzso contained several zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B, and zzso and zzso elements zzso The treatment of zzso cells with zzso zzso caused a marked decrease zzso in the zzso zzso level, which was blocked by the inhibitor of protein zzso A and did not require new protein zzso The protein level was also reduced zzso after a zzso exposure to zzso and the binding affinity was zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso decreased zzso by zzso as compared with control zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses of the zzso region zzso zzso revealed that there were one negative zzso to zzso and two positive zzso regions zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso and that the zzso motif located at zzso zzso zzso the promoter activity of the rat zzso zzso The region between zzso and zzso containing zzso box and zzso site accounted for zzso of the promoter zzso These findings indicate that the promoter activity of the rat zzso gene is modulated by several zzso regions and that zzso markedly zzso the expression of the zzso mainly by inducing zzso zzso zzso rather than zzso zzso of the gene zzso Thus, zzso factors that zzso zzso as an zzso signal may zzso zzso function of zzso II by reducing zzso zzso
