We have previously demonstrated that zzso envelope zzso binding to specific zzso decreases after zzso of zzso zzso in normal human zzso This zzso is proven to be zzso by the classical complement zzso In this study zzso zzso zzso and/or synthetic peptides were zzso to solid phase, and then complement zzso human zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were added either after each other or zzso and the amounts of bound zzso and deposited zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso of zzso binding to zzso zzso was found, and zzso seems to be at least partially responsible for this zzso zzso of zzso did not affect this zzso Higher amounts of zzso zzso significantly and zzso enhanced zzso and zzso fixation to zzso zzso In the case of synthetic peptides corresponding to the zzso region of zzso significant zzso binding to the zzso peptides was also zzso and zzso of peptides zzso to solid phase with normal human serum almost totally abolished the zzso zzso
