It is now well accepted that G zzso receptors activated by zzso binding become targets for zzso leading to zzso of the zzso Using a series of zzso deficient zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have explored the role of zzso on the ability of the zzso to interact with G proteins and zzso Using a zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso of the wild type zzso lowers its affinity for G zzso whereas zzso receptors lacking four potential zzso sites retain their ability to couple to G zzso zzso zzso receptors lacking only two potential zzso sites are again unable to couple to G zzso Furthermore, whereas zzso wild type zzso in whole cells zzso with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso binds zzso the zzso receptors lacking four potential zzso sites display no interaction with zzso However, the zzso receptors lacking only two potential zzso sites are restored in their ability to bind and zzso with zzso Thus, there is a zzso threshold of zzso zzso that simultaneously results in an zzso of G protein binding and an induction of zzso zzso These results are the first to demonstrate that less than zzso levels of zzso zzso can block G protein zzso independent of zzso zzso We therefore propose that zzso alone may be sufficient to zzso the zzso in zzso raising the possibility that for certain G zzso zzso zzso may not be the primary function of zzso
