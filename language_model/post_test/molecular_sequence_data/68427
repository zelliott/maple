To characterize the role of zzso zzso cells in zzso host defense, we have examined zzso zzso expression and regulated expression of zzso zzso by human zzso zzso zzso 

zzso expression by the human zzso zzso cell lines, zzso zzso zzso and zzso was assessed by using zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was analyzed by nuclear zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis, and zzso zzso zzso 

The cell lines zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso for zzso and transforming growth factor beta zzso In addition, some cell lines expressed zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso zzso None of the cell lines expressed zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso Cell lines zzso zzso either zzso or after stimulation with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso Increased zzso zzso after zzso alpha stimulation of zzso cells was accompanied by increased zzso zzso levels and an increased zzso rate of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso at the zzso surface of polarized zzso zzso In further studies, freshly isolated human colon zzso cells also zzso zzso 

These results support the notion of zzso communication between zzso zzso cells and zzso immune and inflammatory zzso
