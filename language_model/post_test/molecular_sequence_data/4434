zzso zzso species have a specialized zzso system zzso zzso to target zzso zzso proteins during zzso The signals of zzso and zzso sufficient for the zzso of zzso reporter zzso were mapped to the first 15 zzso No common zzso acid or zzso sequence could be identified among the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso signal yielded zzso defective in zzso zzso however, no point zzso could be identified that specifically abolished zzso zzso zzso that completely altered the zzso sequences of these signals also failed to prevent zzso Thus, the signal that leads to the type III zzso of zzso proteins appears to be zzso in their zzso zzso rather than the zzso zzso
