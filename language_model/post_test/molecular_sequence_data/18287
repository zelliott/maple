zzso spores of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contain several unusually abundant species of zzso Thirty-nine zzso clones corresponding to prevalent transcripts were isolated from a library zzso using zzso zzso from zzso zzso these clones represented only five distinct zzso Each corresponding zzso accounted for from zzso to 9 percent by mass of zzso zzso from zzso spores and together represented greater than 20 percent of the zzso The expression of the corresponding zzso and a gene zzso zzso was analyzed in spores during zzso and during growth in zzso The zzso zzso and zzso from one abundant zzso clone zzso were expressed zzso Two clones zzso and zzso zzso only to zzso from spores and zzso zzso Two clones zzso and zzso showed zzso specific to zzso zzso zzso of the number of genes zzso to each zzso clone indicated that four clones corresponded to one or two copies per zzso zzso and one zzso to an approximately zzso family of zzso A sequence of the gene corresponding to zzso was obtained to investigate its function and to identify sequences zzso high levels of gene expression for use in constructing zzso for the transformation of zzso zzso
