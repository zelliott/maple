It has been demonstrated recently that certain repetitive sequences and even expressed zzso genes are capable of zzso but little is known about the zzso or zzso zzso of this process in human zzso zzso may contribute to gene zzso and genetic instability in cancer zzso We have used the human cell line zzso to generate a method for investigating de zzso zzso in breast cancer zzso The strategy employs a reporter construct zzso into zzso cells that encodes zzso zzso gene zzso sequences interrupted by an zzso derived from the zzso gene and sandwiched between two promoters in opposite zzso the zzso is not produced in zzso cells expressing the zzso until zzso via a spliced zzso zzso zzso intermediate has occurred, zzso a functional gene product and thereby resistance to zzso A stable zzso line that showed presence of reporter zzso DNA and expression of reporter zzso zzso was obtained and used to demonstrate spontaneous zzso of zzso zzso tester cells were subjected to selection in zzso zzso and zzso clones were isolated at a frequency of zzso A simple zzso zzso of colonies fixed and stained in zzso dishes can be used to verify zzso zzso zzso Expanded populations of zzso colonies were determined to be derived from reporter sequences that had zzso via an zzso intermediate by Southern zzso zzso This experimental zzso may be used for exploring zzso and environmental factors that influence host zzso zzso of unbiased cellular sequences in breast tumor zzso Genes zzso Cancer zzso zzso
