The indirect flight muscle zzso of insects is characterized by a near zzso zzso lattice structure that likely evolved to achieve high power zzso In zzso zzso the zzso rod binding protein zzso plays a crucial role in thick filament organization and zzso zzso Here we investigate the extent to which the zzso zzso of zzso contributes to zzso structure and mechanical performance using transgenic zzso expressing a truncated zzso lacking the 44 zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso and X-ray zzso zzso show decreased zzso lattice order in the zzso line compared with control, a transgenic zzso rescued line zzso zzso fibers produced roughly 1/3 the zzso work and power of zzso with reduced zzso of maximum work zzso zzso zzso 154 zzso and power zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating slower zzso cycling zzso These reductions in work and power stem from a slower rate of zzso recruitment and decreased zzso binding in zzso zzso although the mean duration of zzso attachment was not different between both zzso The decreases in lattice order and zzso zzso resulted in zzso flies being unable to beat their zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso of zzso is necessary for normal zzso lattice organization, thereby zzso the zzso binding required to achieve high power output for zzso
