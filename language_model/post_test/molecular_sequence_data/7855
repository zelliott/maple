The regulation of B cell death plays roles in the selection of zzso B cells in zzso immune responses, controlling B cell zzso and perhaps limiting zzso The present work addresses whether zzso zzso zzso B cells to undergo zzso and, if so, whether zzso zzso signaling can rescue zzso B cells from zzso zzso zzso triggering by zzso zzso zzso was studied in human zzso B cell populations that were separated by density zzso into zzso enriched for either low density, zzso B cells or high density, resting B zzso Low density zzso B cells express zzso and undergo zzso zzso by analysis of cellular zzso or DNA fragmentation by zzso zzso The induction of zzso in low density zzso B cells by zzso zzso is inhibited by zzso signals provided by zzso zzso zzso zzso cells, but not by control zzso zzso cells zzso zzso In addition, the rescuing effect of zzso cells is inhibited specifically by zzso zzso zzso The zzso effects of zzso and zzso signaling were also studied in Ramos zzso a homogeneous B cell tumor line of zzso center zzso that expresses zzso and zzso Similar to the behavior of low density zzso B cells, Ramos zzso zzso zzso zzso which is prevented by zzso zzso These data show that zzso zzso zzso in low density zzso B cells and that zzso interactions rescue low density zzso B cells or the B cell tumor Ramos zzso from zzso zzso and suggest roles for zzso and zzso in B cell death and selection, zzso
