Aging of zzso zzso zzso target zzso zzso is the critical event that zzso zzso delayed zzso zzso Aging has classically been considered to involve zzso loss from zzso zzso rendering the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been thought to age zzso however, it can be zzso under zzso zzso The present study was undertaken to determine whether zzso human zzso zzso zzso domain zzso ages classically by zzso zzso zzso zzso the oxygen analogue of zzso was used for zzso zzso values for zzso against zzso were as zzso zzso zzso 17 200 zzso 180 zzso zzso zzso zzso approximately 90 zzso at pH zzso and approximately 60 zzso at pH zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso values for zzso against zzso were as zzso zzso zzso 1880 zzso 61 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 0 zzso at pH zzso and approximately 60 zzso at pH zzso aging was complete at all time points tested at pH zzso but no aging occurred at pH zzso Mass zzso revealed a mass shift of zzso zzso zzso Da for the active site zzso peak of aged zzso zzso corresponding to a zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the analogous mass shift for aged zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the intact zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso does not age by zzso zzso However, because zzso aged zzso zzso yields an intact zzso capable of zzso zzso aging could occur by zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso does not age at pH zzso but ages immediately and completely at pH zzso zzso we conclude that the zzso zzso ages by zzso rather than classical zzso zzso
