To study the expression of zzso protein in zzso blood group Del zzso 

zzso blood samples were collected from 3 voluntary blood donors with different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and 4 zzso 2 zzso positive with the zzso of zzso and zzso and 2 zzso negative with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequencing were used to detect the zzso zzso and the expression of Del zzso 

The Del individuals all showed complicated zzso zzso zzso including 6 zzso zzso with zzso 7-9 zzso zzso 7 and 9 zzso zzso 8 and 9 zzso zzso 9 spliced and 2 long transcripts with zzso 8 and 9 spliced or zzso 9 zzso but containing an additional segment of sequence from zzso zzso 7 zzso zzso zzso those transcripts all being out of zzso 9 and the zzso transcript being the most similar to the normal zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso does not exist in the Del blood group that does not code normal zzso zzso
