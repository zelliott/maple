The zzso recent transfer of the gene for zzso c zzso zzso 2 zzso from the zzso to the nucleus in zzso is shown to have involved novel zzso zzso The acquired zzso targeting zzso is bordered by two zzso zzso of the import of soybean zzso indicates that the zzso is zzso in a three-step process which is independent of zzso The final processing step takes place only in the zzso of zzso species, and not in several zzso zzso The unusually long zzso of 136 zzso acids consists of three zzso the first 20 zzso acids are required for zzso targeting and can be replaced by another zzso the central portion of the zzso is required for efficient import of the zzso protein into zzso and the last 12 zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso are required for correct maturation of the imported zzso The acquisition of a unique zzso and the capacity for zzso zzso to remove this zzso zzso are considered to be essential adaptations for targeting of zzso to the zzso and therefore zzso of the transferred gene in the zzso
