zzso zzso zzso fragments binding different zzso forms zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been generated from an zzso zzso library to study how a protein environment regulates the zzso potential, starting from a protein other than a natural zzso These zzso are characterized by zzso and zzso zzso zzso by competitive zzso methods zzso of the zzso zzso and by molecular zzso The three-dimensional models of the zzso sites are consistent with the experimental zzso zzso of zzso 5 to zzso increases the zzso potential, mainly due to an zzso zzso interacting with the zzso zzso Thus zzso 5 shows an zzso zzso zzso confirming the idea that positively charged zzso in the vicinity of zzso increase the zzso zzso The results obtained with zzso which do not resemble a natural zzso show that when the zzso nucleus of the zzso is not involved in zzso the zzso potential is not significantly zzso These results are in contrast to those obtained with chicken zzso zzso
