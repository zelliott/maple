Several class A basic zzso zzso zzso factors have been cloned from the developing mouse and chick nervous zzso The cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the mouse and zzso zzso in the zzso have zzso coding regions highly zzso to other known class A zzso zzso The genes corresponding to zzso and zzso are abundantly expressed during development of the central nervous zzso zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso zzso and in cells at the initial stages of differentiation (for example in the external zzso cell layer of the zzso and in the lateral region of the zzso zone in the developing neural tube and zzso They are also expressed at high levels in zzso active regions such as limb zzso zzso and zzso zzso The expression of zzso and zzso decreases once cellular differentiation is zzso Based on the expression of zzso and zzso in regions of active cellular proliferation and differentiation and on the known role of other zzso factors in development, we suggest that zzso and zzso play important roles during development of the nervous system as well as in other organ zzso
