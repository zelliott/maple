The microbial population structure and function of natural zzso communities maintained in zzso continuously stirred tank zzso at different zzso to zzso ratios and in the absence of zzso were analyzed using an integrated approach of molecular techniques and chemical zzso The population structure, determined by zzso zzso gel zzso and by the use of zzso zzso was linked to the functional changes in the zzso At the zzso zzso to zzso zzso ratio of zzso zzso zzso zzso electron donor zzso zzso zzso was mainly carried out by incompletely zzso zzso bacteria, which formed zzso of the total bacterial zzso zzso and zzso species were the most abundant zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were mostly zzso although less than zzso of an zzso population could still be observed at this limiting concentration of zzso In the near absence of zzso zzso at very high zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were the dominant microbial zzso zzso bacteria represented by zzso zzso species formed more than zzso of the population, while zzso bacteria related to zzso zzso zzso about zzso of the microbial zzso At an zzso zzso to zzso zzso ratio of 2 zzso zzso zzso under zzso conditions, a different zzso route was followed by the mixed zzso zzso Apparently, zzso was fermented to zzso and zzso while the majority of zzso and zzso were dependent on these zzso zzso This was consistent with the presence of significant levels zzso of total zzso of zzso zzso zzso and a corresponding increase of zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso accounted for zzso of the total microbial zzso
