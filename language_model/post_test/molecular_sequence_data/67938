Only decades after the introduction of zzso zzso bacterial zzso zzso have evolved to catalyze their degradation with remarkable zzso Their closest known relatives, zzso with zzso zzso activity, dubbed zzso zzso zzso share only zzso sequence identity and also differ in the zzso of their zzso zzso zzso was therefore presumed to have evolved from a yet unknown zzso whose primary activity was the zzso of zzso sensing zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 45, zzso However, how zzso zzso from this presumed zzso remains a zzso In this study we investigated loop zzso as a means of reconstructing a zzso zzso zzso that relates to zzso by few zzso zzso zzso in nature, loop zzso is a common mechanism of divergence of zzso functions, zzso this process in the laboratory is a zzso zzso and zzso analyses enabled us to zzso one of zzso zzso zzso into a zzso zzso A deletion in loop 7, combined with an zzso highly zzso point zzso led to the emergence of an zzso activity that is zzso in zzso zzso values of up to 2 zzso zzso The appearance of the zzso activity was accompanied by only a minor decrease in zzso zzso zzso This specificity change demonstrates the potential role of zzso zzso in the divergence of new zzso functions and highlights the critical contribution of loop zzso to the rapid divergence of new zzso zzso
