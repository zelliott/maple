zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso zzso is a modular zzso composed of an zzso zzso module belonging to zzso zzso family 26 and two putative zzso zzso zzso belonging to family 31 in the zzso zzso To investigate the functions of these three zzso five deletion zzso lacking individual zzso were zzso The binding zzso of these zzso showed that a repeating unit of the zzso was a zzso zzso zzso while the zzso module per zzso was not likely to contribute to the binding activity when zzso zzso was used for the zzso The repeating zzso were found to specifically bind to zzso zzso but not to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or soluble zzso Both the zzso and the binding activities for zzso zzso but not soluble zzso were enhanced by zzso in a zzso manner, indicating that the zzso of zzso bound to zzso through zzso zzso This property of the zzso was successfully applied to the zzso of a zzso zzso from the cell extracts of zzso coli transformed with the zzso gene and the detection of zzso proteins including zzso from the extract of a turban zzso zzso zzso
