This study demonstrates the presence of positive and negative regulatory elements within a zzso zzso region of the rat zzso zzso zzso gene promoter that cooperate to direct cell zzso expression in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso element zzso was identified in the zzso part of this zzso This element was recognized by the zzso zzso factor zzso previously shown to regulate expression of other zzso zzso The zzso zzso was inactive in both zzso and zzso zzso cells, but zzso expression from a zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso deletion of this element allowed zzso gene promoter activity in zzso cells, and zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene promoter activity in zzso zzso The zzso part of the zzso gene promoter showed zzso enhancing activity, which zzso promoter activity in zzso cells, but was inactive in zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso region suppressed the activity of the zzso zzso in zzso cells, even after zzso zzso Thus, at least two kinds of regulatory elements cooperate to direct zzso gene expression to zzso zzso namely a zzso zzso element and a zzso zzso
