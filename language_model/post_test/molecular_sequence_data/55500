zzso zzso zzso are zzso for the zzso zzso of terminal zzso Most representatives comprise a zzso and a zzso which are zzso by separate genes zzso zzso Only six presumed self-sufficient zzso zzso zzso have previously been submitted to databases, and one has so far been zzso zzso can be supported by another zzso zzso zzso by zzso a gene in direct neighborhood of zzso The present report describes the identification of a further zzso zzso which was detected in zzso zzso zzso Based on the initially available sequences of zzso zzso zzso directed at zzso sequences were designed and a zzso zzso zzso from strain zzso was obtained after zzso and subsequent zzso zzso Six open reading frames zzso were detected and compared to zzso fragments of strains zzso either two- or zzso zzso Among the proteins zzso by the zzso the zzso zzso showed the highest divergence on zzso acid level when comparing proteins from different zzso That finding, a rare distribution of zzso genes among bacteria, and the general observation of evolution from simple to complex systems indicate that zzso zzso evolved from zzso zzso Analysis of gene products from zzso and zzso zzso revealed that a fusion of zzso to zzso might have happened at least twice among zzso This points to a zzso evolution of zzso zzso
