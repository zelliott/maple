Biological nitrogen fixation is a fundamental component of the nitrogen cycle and is the dominant natural process through which fixed nitrogen is made available to the zzso While the process of nitrogen fixation has been studied extensively with a limited set of cultivated zzso examinations of zzso gene diversity in natural systems reveal the existence of a wide range of zzso zzso These zzso zzso remain zzso as do their contributions to nitrogen fixation in natural zzso We have employed a novel zzso stable isotope probing zzso method to identify zzso zzso in soil that are responsible for nitrogen fixation in zzso zzso of zzso zzso genes from zzso DNA provide evidence for nitrogen fixation by three microbial groups, one of which belongs to the zzso while the other two represent deeply divergent lineages of zzso bacteria within the zzso and zzso zzso Analysis of zzso genes from zzso DNA also revealed three microbial groups, one of which was associated with zzso while the others were associated with two zzso groups that are deeply divergent within zzso cluster zzso These results reveal that zzso zzso zzso can mediate nitrogen fixation in zzso and that zzso can be used to gain access to DNA from these zzso In addition, this research provides the first evidence for nitrogen fixation by zzso outside of the order zzso
