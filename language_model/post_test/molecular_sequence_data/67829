zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are expressed at the surface of human zzso cells zzso that capture and transmit human zzso virus zzso zzso to zzso zzso With the goal of reducing viral zzso by targeting zzso we have designed a new class of zzso zzso zzso We report the synthesis of zzso composed of a zzso head, a zzso zzso essential for zzso in zzso media, and a zzso chain of variable zzso These zzso presented unusual properties based on a cooperation between the zzso head and the zzso chain, which enhanced the affinity and decreased the need for zzso With an optimal zzso zzso they exhibited strong binding affinity for zzso zzso in the zzso zzso as assessed by surface zzso zzso The most active molecules were zzso zzso zzso able to inhibit the interaction of the zzso envelope with zzso and to drastically reduce zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso in the low zzso zzso This new class of compounds may be of potential use for prevention of zzso zzso and also of infection by other zzso human zzso
