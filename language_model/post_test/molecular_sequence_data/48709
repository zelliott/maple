zzso zzso are an abundant class of zzso small zzso molecules that zzso gene expression at the zzso zzso They play important roles in multiple biological processes by regulating genes that control zzso timing, growth, stem cell division and zzso by binding to the zzso of target zzso Despite the position Atlantic salmon zzso zzso has as an economically important zzso animal, there has been little research on zzso in this zzso zzso about zzso and their target genes may be used to control health and to improve performance of economically important zzso However, before their biological function can be zzso they must be identified and zzso The aims of this study were to identify and characterize zzso genes in Atlantic salmon by deep sequencing analysis of small zzso libraries from nine different zzso 

A total of 180 distinct mature zzso belonging to 106 families of evolutionary zzso zzso and 13 distinct novel mature zzso were discovered and zzso The mature zzso corresponded to 521 putative precursor sequences located at unique zzso zzso About zzso of these precursors were part of gene zzso and the majority of the zzso zzso gene clusters discovered were zzso across zzso zzso of expression levels in samples from different zzso applying zzso indicated that there were tissue specific expression differences in three zzso and one novel zzso zzso zzso was detected in heart tissue only, while two other clustered zzso zzso 212 zzso seems to be at a higher expression level in brain zzso These observations correlate well with their expected functions as regulators of signal pathways in cardiac and zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso is one of the novel zzso discovered and its function remains zzso However, differential expression analysis using zzso suggests that this zzso is enriched in liver tissue and the precursor was mapped to zzso 7 of the zzso zzso 

The identification and zzso of evolutionary zzso and novel zzso zzso zzso as well as the characterization of zzso gene clusters provide biological knowledge that will greatly facilitate further functional studies on zzso in this zzso
