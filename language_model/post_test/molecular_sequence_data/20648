zzso zzso beta zzso a major zzso downstream of various zzso signals, mediates multiple cellular functions through zzso and regulation of its zzso On the basis of protein sequence analysis, we identified zzso protein 1 zzso a protein involved in zzso and cell proliferation processes in many human cancer cells, as a new zzso zzso We provided evidence showing that zzso is indeed a bona fide zzso of zzso zzso physically associated with zzso and zzso it at zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and induced its zzso zzso zzso growth suppression was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells as compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Our findings of molecular interactions between zzso and zzso may enable further understanding of the upstream regulation mechanisms of zzso and of the diverse functions of zzso
