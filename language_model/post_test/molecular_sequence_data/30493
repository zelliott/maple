Cloning and sequencing of the zzso of a new member of the zzso beta G gene family is zzso zzso of the sequence with those of other zzso beta G zzso reveals a remarkable conservation of their sequence zzso than zzso and of their general structural zzso an zzso domain is followed by zzso and zzso zzso zzso termed A and B, zzso Most zzso beta G contain two zzso A in tandem followed by a single domain zzso In some zzso beta G members described here, alternative zzso skips the zzso domain in some zzso yielding two- and zzso zzso zzso Individual zzso beta G members have specific short zzso zzso displaying little sequence zzso The zzso beta G family is closely related to the zzso gene zzso A detailed comparison of the sequence of both families is given and used to construct an evolutionary tree, using the method of Li, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the number of zzso of synonymous zzso and zzso zzso sites and of the zzso ratio suggests that the zzso beta G gene family appeared zzso with the expansion of the zzso zzso and belongs to the class of rapidly evolving zzso Very little selective pressure has been exerted on the body of the zzso especially on domain zzso The analysis also suggests that zzso beta G genes zzso different zzso zzso would have been positively selected and fixed during the zzso The zzso beta G gene family was assigned to zzso 19, which also carries the zzso zzso
