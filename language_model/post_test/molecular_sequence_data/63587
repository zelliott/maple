zzso sequencing has the potential to revolutionize zzso and impact all areas of biomedical zzso New technologies will make zzso widely available for such applications as identifying zzso variations or interrogating the zzso content of a large sample zzso zzso The increase in speed, sensitivity and availability of sequencing technology brings demand for advances in zzso technology to perform associated analysis zzso The zzso zzso zzso can produce tens of millions of reads, ranging in length from approximately zzso zzso in a single zzso zzso mapping the reads back to a reference zzso is a critical task in almost all zzso Two sources of information that are often ignored when mapping reads from the zzso technology are the 3' ends of longer reads, which contain a much higher frequency of sequencing zzso and the zzso quality zzso 

To investigate whether these sources of information can be used to improve accuracy when mapping reads, we developed the zzso zzso which can map reads having a wide range of lengths and allows zzso quality scores to determine which positions in each read are more important when zzso We applied zzso to analyze data zzso from two human zzso regions for varying read zzso and varying criteria for use of quality zzso zzso is freely available for downloading at zzso 

Our results indicate that significant gains in zzso read mapping performance can be achieved by considering the information in 3' ends of longer reads, and appropriately using the zzso quality zzso The zzso tool we have developed will enable researchers to effectively exploit this information in targeted zzso zzso
