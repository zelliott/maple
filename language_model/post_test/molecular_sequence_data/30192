The zzso motif within the zzso zzso zzso is required for full zzso activity and is known to bind one, or perhaps a family, of related ubiquitous nuclear zzso Here, we present the isolation of a zzso that encodes an apparently novel zzso protein designated zzso The major open reading frame of the zzso predicts a protein of 59 zzso with a zzso zzso situated adjacent to an zzso motif that has been proposed to assume a zzso zzso Both of these motifs have been shown (for other zzso to facilitate zzso interactions and DNA zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso cells stimulates zzso from an artificial promoter consisting of four zzso sites linked to a zzso box and also zzso zzso of a reporter gene when it is linked to multiple copies of a particular zzso zzso zzso but not when it is linked to the intact zzso Using zzso fusion zzso we mapped a strong zzso zzso domain within zzso that is distinct from the zzso zzso and zzso motifs and includes a potential negative zzso zzso Like the other zzso proteins detected in nuclear zzso in zzso zzso also binds to the zzso site found in the zzso major late zzso
