zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with significant sequence similarity in both the zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso A zzso form of the zzso zzso zzso was found to have both zzso and zzso activities, and therefore zzso the first two steps in the zzso zzso zzso Genes zzso very similar proteins are also found in three other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All of these predicted zzso contain unique zzso insertions in corresponding positions in the zzso domain but the insertions differ in size and zzso Such insertions are a common feature of zzso proteins but their origin and function is zzso zzso of the zzso sequence in the zzso zzso protein renders the zzso domain zzso although the zzso activity is zzso zzso the zzso sequence in zzso zzso with the zzso sequence from zzso zzso restores some of the zzso activity and also enhances zzso zzso We conclude that although the insertions are evolving rapidly they have an essential role in the activity of the zzso zzso
