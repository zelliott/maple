The powerful zzso drugs such as zzso and its derivatives induce some zzso and protection of zzso from zzso brain injury and some other neurological zzso The drugs form complexes with diverse zzso but apparently the zzso complex was shown to be involved in the protection and zzso of zzso We used several different sequence attributes in searching diverse zzso databases for similar motifs as those present in the zzso A zzso library of zzso zzso has been designed and used in searching for the similarity of sequence motifs extracted from the multiple sequence alignments of diverse groups of proteins zzso zzso and the target motifs which are zzso in various zzso The following sequence attributes were used in the establishment of the degree of convergence between: zzso zzso acid zzso sequence similarity zzso of the zzso motifs and zzso zzso zzso AA composition zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso AA propensity to form a particular secondary zzso The sequence hallmark of two different groups of zzso zzso zzso zzso namely zzso repeat zzso zzso which are present in the zzso zzso and in the large zzso proteins zzso were used to search various zzso zzso The zzso zzso has revealed that the zzso motifs have similar sequence attributes as a number of zzso sequence segments of functionally unrelated membrane zzso including some of the zzso from diverse G zzso receptors zzso It is proposed that binding of the zzso complex to the zzso via the zzso motifs and its interaction with some membrane proteins could be in part responsible for some zzso and zzso of the brain during some zzso zzso
