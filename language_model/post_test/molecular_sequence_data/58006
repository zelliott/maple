zzso zzso zzso zzso are candidate zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso arthritis zzso We have investigated the possibility that responses to class zzso zzso recognition sites in human cartilage zzso zzso zzso may depend upon whether these sites are available as free zzso zzso or as part of intact zzso Analysis of mouse zzso responses to intact or zzso zzso zzso from human zzso cartilage, and to synthetic peptides of the zzso zzso zzso attachment region zzso repeat sequence showed that recognition of zzso zzso in the zzso region was strongly dependent upon the form of zzso zzso The results show that the zzso region contains cryptic zzso recognition sites and raise the possibility that fragments of zzso released through the action of zzso zzso in inflamed zzso may be capable of zzso T cells with zzso for zzso which are not made available following processing of intact zzso T cells with zzso for cryptic zzso in PG may play a role in the zzso of zzso
