New protein folds have emerged throughout evolution, but it remains unclear how a protein fold can evolve while maintaining its function, particularly when fold changes require several sequential gene zzso Here, we explored hypothetical evolutionary pathways linking different zzso families of the zzso zzso These pathways entail successive gene zzso through a series of zzso all of which should be sufficiently active to maintain the zzso zzso By means of directed evolution, and starting from zzso zzso zzso we selected all the required zzso along these paths (a duplicated fused gene and zzso partially truncated at their zzso or 3' coding zzso that maintained function in zzso These zzso led to new functional genes that resembled natural zzso from three known classes or that belonged to a new class first seen in our evolution experiments and subsequently identified in natural zzso Our findings show that new protein zzso can evolve gradually through zzso gene zzso and provide new insights regarding these zzso
