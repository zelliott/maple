We report a comprehensive analysis of sequence features that allow for the production of autonomous human heavy chain variable zzso zzso that are stable and soluble in the absence of a light chain zzso Using zzso zzso libraries and conventional zzso methods, we analyzed the entire former light chain interface and the third zzso determining region zzso Unlike the zzso variable zzso of zzso heavy chain zzso zzso zzso in which autonomous behavior depends on interactions between the zzso former light chain interface and zzso we find that the stability of many in zzso evolved zzso zzso is essentially independent of the zzso sequence and instead derives from zzso that increase the zzso of the former light chain interface by replacing exposed zzso zzso with structurally compatible zzso zzso The engineered zzso can be expressed zzso at high yield, are predominantly zzso at high zzso unfold zzso and are even more zzso than typical zzso zzso zzso Many of the stabilizing zzso are rare in natural zzso and zzso zzso and thus could not be predicted by studying natural sequences and zzso The results demonstrate that autonomous zzso zzso with structural properties beyond the scope of natural zzso can be derived by using zzso zzso which differ from those found in zzso zzso zzso These findings should enable the development of libraries of synthetic zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso by structural zzso
