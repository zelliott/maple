zzso of zzso with longer zzso sequences is an essential step in zzso acid zzso in zzso and in zzso in zzso zzso and in therapeutic applications of zzso A major factor determining sensitivity and selectivity of zzso is the number of base pair zzso that occur in an zzso alignment of the zzso zzso and a longer sequence zzso 

The zzso match count between the probe and the target is defined as the number of zzso alignments between the two sequences that have exactly k zzso and the zzso match count is defined as the sum of the zzso match counts for zzso between 0 and zzso We derive a novel formula for the probability of a zzso zzso This formula is based on the assumption that the target is zzso zzso text zzso zzso are zzso zzso distributed in the target and satisfy zzso second parity zzso Our model predicts that the zzso in both the probe and the target significantly affects the match count zzso The ratio of zzso match counts in two distinct zzso for a given probe is a measure of its zzso We calculated such ratios for pairs of bacterial zzso with different combinations of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the extreme values of these ratios indicates that zzso with a high zzso power exist for each tested zzso
