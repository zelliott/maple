To obtain zzso species identification directly from clinical specimens and cultures, the zzso zzso zzso zzso was amplified using previously published zzso that detect all zzso zzso The restriction zzso that could potentially produce the most restriction zzso length zzso zzso was determined from all available zzso DNA sequences in zzso to produce a novel data set of zzso for 31 slowly growing zzso zzso zzso a zzso II database was constructed from zzso for 10 zzso that have been used in the literature to differentiate slowly growing zzso zzso The combination of zzso and zzso were the best choice of zzso for zzso clinically relevant slowly growing zzso zzso A total of zzso specimens were studied by zzso with 195 negative and 197 positive zzso The zzso product was zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso (new to this zzso to obtain a zzso species identification based on the zzso The species identification obtained by zzso was confirmed by DNA sequencing zzso numbers are shown in zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tuberculosis zzso The total number of specimens zzso identified were from culture zzso zzso mark zzso culture bottles zzso zzso blood zzso directly from zzso positive specimens zzso tissue zzso and urine zzso zzso species identification was obtained from all zzso zzso positive zzso The total number of specimens zzso were identified as zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This method reduces the time taken for zzso species identification from 8-10 weeks for culture and zzso zzso to 4-6 weeks for culture and zzso to 2 days for zzso specimens by zzso The precise 2 day identification obtained may provide significant advantages in clinical zzso
