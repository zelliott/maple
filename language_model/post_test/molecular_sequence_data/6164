The highly zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter contains multiple binding sites for zzso within the first 400 zzso of the cap zzso Therefore the ability of individual zzso elements to zzso zzso alone or in combination was zzso We show that different zzso sites vary in their affinity for zzso and that increasing affinity zzso with zzso zzso In addition, several adjacent zzso sites zzso enhanced promoter zzso Thus, the strength of promoter zzso correlated with both the number of zzso elements and their affinity for zzso zzso
