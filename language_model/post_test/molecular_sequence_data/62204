A zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was isolated as a candidate gene for a zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso protein has four characteristic zzso zzso among plant zzso zzso reported so far, namely a dual specificity protein zzso zzso domain, zzso domain, putative zzso domain zzso and zzso region, indicating that zzso is the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso expressed zzso protein physically zzso with three zzso types of zzso in an overlay zzso with labeled zzso showing high affinity to zzso and zzso but lower affinity to zzso The zzso for the putative zzso bound both zzso and zzso significantly but bound zzso only zzso Moreover, zzso overlay zzso with zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso in the middle of the basic zzso zzso motif zzso acids zzso are critical for binding zzso In comparison with the transient zzso of a zzso zzso zzso transcript, a prolonged zzso of zzso expression was found in response to wounding and tobacco mosaic zzso hypersensitive zzso In transgenic tobacco plants zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso salicylic zzso zzso and zzso was zzso These results suggest that plant zzso are involved in these zzso zzso zzso via zzso
