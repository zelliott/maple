A high-level expression system for the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso gene was constructed to obtain a sufficient amount of the zzso for structural zzso About 300 zzso of the zzso was zzso from 2 1 of culture zzso Both zzso were needed to zzso zzso zzso The zzso coli zzso and the zzso zzso were compared with respect to zzso properties and zzso zzso Both zzso showed different zzso zzso Relatively high zzso was observed between the small zzso of both zzso by Western zzso analysis using zzso prepared against either zzso
