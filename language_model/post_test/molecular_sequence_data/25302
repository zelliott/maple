zzso resistance to the zzso antibiotics zzso and zzso is zzso by zzso zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso zzso induced the synthesis of a zzso 40 zzso zzso protein designated zzso The resistance protein was partially zzso and its zzso sequence was zzso A zzso zzso DNA restriction zzso of zzso was cloned into zzso coli and zzso When expressed in zzso coli, this zzso zzso a zzso 40 zzso protein that zzso with zzso from zzso membrane zzso The zzso translation initiation zzso for zzso specified the zzso present at the zzso of the protein indicating the absence of signal zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from the sequence of the zzso gene consisted of zzso zzso acids giving a protein with a calculated Mr of zzso zzso was structurally related to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and of zzso coli zzso The zzso gene was able to zzso an zzso coli zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, the zzso resistance protein zzso was structurally and functionally related to zzso zzso that zzso the target of zzso zzso Based on these observations we discuss the possibility that resistance is due to modification of the zzso zzso
