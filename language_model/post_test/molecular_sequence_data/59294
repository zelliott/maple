The zzso protein zzso zzso functions as a signal in patterning of both the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Lack of zzso zzso activity is associated with zzso zzso similar to those of zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso protein is confined to the cells that produce it, suggesting that zzso plays a role in processing or zzso of zzso zzso encodes a novel zzso protein that appears to be concentrated at the zzso zzso We present both genetic and in zzso evidence demonstrating that zzso is involved specifically in the processing of zzso We identified a human sequence related to zzso suggesting the existence of a family of proteins involved in processing of zzso
