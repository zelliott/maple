The 65 zzso heat shock protein zzso has been implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso derived from the sequence of zzso 65 zzso zzso stimulates specifically zzso from patients with zzso In this investigation, we show that both zzso and zzso T cells were significantly zzso with zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the human zzso zzso zzso zzso only zzso T zzso zzso studies showed that zzso T cells were class II zzso whereas zzso T cells were class I zzso We then used truncated or zzso zzso and demonstrated that zzso zzso appear to be important, and zzso zzso critical, in stimulating the T zzso Thus, zzso zzso 105 may constitute a zzso zzso zzso in zzso We zzso that the high load of zzso that colonize the oral zzso may initiate an immune response by the microbial zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulating the numerous zzso cells in the oral zzso to activate a zzso immune response to the zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso 60, initiating the zzso changes that lead to zzso
