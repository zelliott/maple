While the zzso chain reaction zzso has been shown to be effective in detecting serum zzso B virus zzso DNA, a systematic evaluation of the characteristics of optimal primer pairs has not yet been zzso Several factors related to the selection of primer pairs were examined and the findings are summarized as zzso zzso zzso specific for the zzso or zzso region of the zzso zzso are equally effective in amplifying serum zzso zzso maximum amplification is seen using zzso separated by no more than 500 zzso and, zzso zzso with up to zzso mismatch are effective at amplifying zzso zzso
