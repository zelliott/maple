The deposition of the beta zzso zzso in zzso plaques and cerebral blood vessels is a hallmark of Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso The major component of the zzso deposit is a zzso zzso termed zzso zzso of zzso zzso which is derived from processing of a larger zzso precursor protein zzso It is hypothesized that a zzso zzso is involved in the processing of zzso We have discovered a new zzso zzso from the zzso brain by zzso chain reaction amplification of DNA sequences representing active site zzso regions of zzso zzso A zzso clone was identified as one out of one million that encodes zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso can be detected in some zzso species but not in mice, rats, or zzso zzso is expressed predominantly in brain, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot be detected in fetal brain but is seen in adult zzso The zzso gene maps to zzso zzso a region which shows genetic linkage with late onset familial Alzheimer's zzso When zzso zzso is zzso with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso embryonic zzso cells, zzso fragments are detected using zzso zzso to zzso These zzso cells release an abundance of truncated zzso zzso zzso and shows a reduction of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso to zzso cells in monkey zzso and the zzso zzso In addition, zzso is localized to zzso cells in our zzso brain zzso The zzso potential and zzso in brain may indicate a role for this zzso in zzso precursor processing and zzso
