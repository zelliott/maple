A straightforward zzso zzso approach is shown to enable one to describe the stability of the alpha zzso in the presence of zzso zzso The zzso can be used with even the simple zzso models and it is demonstrated explicitly with the popular 2 zzso 2 zzso model zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Bragg zzso zzso zzso Physics 31, zzso It involves a conceptual dissection of the zzso chain into interacting zzso the behavior of any block with zzso interactions is treated then with conventional binding zzso zzso This dissection is a manifestation of zzso which is a zzso framework for the description of the behavior of complex zzso zzso zzso Robert, zzso Decker, zzso Richey, zzso zzso Gill, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 84, zzso The method is demonstrated through applications to existing, detailed data for the pH and salt zzso of the zzso transition in the S zzso and in synthetic zzso
