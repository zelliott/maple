Recent structural and functional characterization of the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has demonstrated that zzso structure is present, similar to that previously described for the human and zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to zzso characterize the identified zzso secondary and zzso structures, zzso zzso zzso experiments, nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and native gel zzso were used to investigate various potential zzso in the zzso domain in zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that alternative secondary structures are not mutually exclusive in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso structure contributes zzso zzso zzso to the stability of the zzso zzso half the stability observed for the human zzso zzso and identify additional base pairs in the 3' zzso stem near the zzso zzso In addition, sequence conservation in an adjacent overlapping hairpin appears to prevent zzso and alternative zzso in the context of the entire zzso zzso Thus, this work provides a detailed in zzso characterization of the zzso features of the zzso zzso zzso zzso region for comparison with other zzso zzso zzso
