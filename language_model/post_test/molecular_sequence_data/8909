zzso editing plays an important role in zzso gene expression in various organisms, including flowering plants, changing the zzso information at precise zzso Here, we present evidence that the zzso zzso zzso nuclear gene zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso protein is required for zzso editing in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso b zzso transcripts at the zzso and zzso sites, zzso Its putative zzso zzso zzso zzso fulfills the same role in zzso zzso Both the zzso and the zzso proteins show preferential zzso to zzso but are also detected in zzso In zzso the corresponding zzso zzso causes growth defects in kernels and zzso zzso and zzso growth are reduced, leading to the production of small but viable zzso zzso plants have zzso and shorter leaves, exhibit a strong delay in flowering time, and generally do not reach sexual zzso Whereas zzso zzso do not have major zzso zzso zzso lack complex III and are characterized by a compromised zzso increased transcript levels, and the induction of alternative zzso The results suggest that zzso zzso editing at the zzso site is necessary for zzso zzso cell division, and plant growth in zzso
