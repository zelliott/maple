zzso is an zzso protein abundantly expressed in the developing mouse central nervous zzso Its restricted expression in neural precursor cells suggests that it is involved in the regulation of zzso cell zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our previous studies showed that zzso alone binds to zzso while the binding of zzso is not detected under the same zzso Joining of zzso to zzso however, increases the affinity to greater than that of zzso alone, indicating that zzso contributes to zzso We have determined the three-dimensional solution structure of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso It folds into a compact alpha beta structure zzso a zzso zzso zzso packed against two zzso which is characteristic of zzso zzso Special structural features of zzso include a zzso in zzso and a shallow twist of the zzso The smaller zzso nuclear zzso enhancement values for the zzso of loop 3 between zzso and zzso suggest that this loop is flexible in the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso The smaller zzso zzso values for the zzso around the border between zzso and the following loop zzso 5) suggest this region zzso zzso exchange in the zzso to zzso zzso Chemical shift zzso analysis indicated that zzso binds to an zzso zzso obtained by in zzso selection under the conditions for zzso zzso and thus the nature of the weak zzso of zzso was successfully characterized by zzso which is otherwise difficult to zzso zzso the zzso of the surface composed of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso region are involved in the zzso The appearance of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of loop 3 and zzso zzso zzso of zzso bases upon complex formation suggests the formation of zzso hydrogen zzso The structural arrangement of the rings of the zzso aromatic zzso of zzso and zzso is suitable for stacking interaction with zzso zzso known to be one of the major zzso zzso but a survey of the zzso data suggested that the stacking interaction is not zzso achieved in the complex, which may be related to the weaker zzso of zzso
