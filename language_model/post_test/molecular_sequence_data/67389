The zzso signaling zzso controls cellular proliferation in the zzso In response to zzso zzso transits into the nucleus and associates with members of the zzso factor zzso family of zzso zzso zzso complexes bind zzso responsive DNA elements zzso to activate target gene zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a direct target of zzso zzso We recently identified the zzso 3' zzso which maps zzso downstream from the zzso zzso stop zzso To investigate the role of the zzso 3' zzso in the zzso we generated a mouse model with a germ line deletion of this zzso The zzso architecture was largely preserved in knockout zzso however, removal of the zzso 3' zzso compromised the zzso zzso In comparison to zzso zzso knockout zzso contained an increased number of zzso cells and a reduced number of differentiated cells zzso both zzso and zzso zzso Using a model of zzso we found that knockout zzso repaired more rapidly during the recovery period of the zzso These results indicate that regulation of zzso expression through the zzso 3' zzso contributes to zzso zzso Furthermore, our study implicates zzso as an important regulator of zzso zzso following zzso
