Active sorting at the zzso zzso zzso drives efficient export of fully folded zzso proteins into coat protein complex II zzso zzso whereas zzso and zzso proteins are retained and/or zzso A number of zzso proteins depend upon zzso cargo receptors for linkage to the zzso coat and zzso zzso However, the mechanism by which cargo receptors recognize zzso cargo is poorly zzso Here we examine the sorting zzso required for export of zzso alkaline zzso zzso by its cargo zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso indicated that zzso recognizes sorting information in the zzso domain of zzso This zzso domain sorting signal must be positioned near the inner leaflet of the zzso membrane for zzso zzso Moreover, only assembled zzso zzso were efficiently recognized by zzso while an zzso zzso blocked in zzso assembly failed to exit the zzso and was subjected to zzso zzso These results further refine sorting information for zzso export of zzso and show that recognition of folded cargo by export receptors contributes to strict zzso quality zzso
