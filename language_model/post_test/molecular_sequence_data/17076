A new set of zzso zzso zzso classified into different immunity groups was previously zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were unable to grow in zzso zzso cells, presumably due to an exclusion mechanism expressed zzso by the zzso zzso zzso In this work, to analyze the exclusion phenomenon, we constructed a zzso library from zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso A DNA zzso containing an open reading frame for a 77 zzso acid zzso was selected by its ability to zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso This zzso shows high zzso acid sequence identity with putative zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso gene from a zzso zzso zzso excluded 13 of 20 zzso from different infection immunity zzso This exclusion was observed in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that were excluded in these cells were unable to zzso cells defective in the outer membrane zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso exclusion was only observed in zzso zzso zzso production after DNA zzso or the spontaneous induction of zzso zzso in zzso cells was not zzso In addition, zzso zzso which is zzso by zzso was inhibited in zzso zzso Our results show that not only zzso infection via zzso but also a zzso transport activity zzso zzso are inhibited by zzso presumably by zzso of zzso
