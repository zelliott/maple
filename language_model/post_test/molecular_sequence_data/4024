zzso interference zzso is the process of zzso zzso gene zzso in animals and plants initiated by zzso zzso zzso that is zzso to the silenced zzso This technology has usually involved injection or zzso of zzso in model zzso zzso The longer zzso are processed into short (19 25 zzso small interfering zzso zzso by a zzso protein complex that includes an zzso III related zzso zzso a zzso family member, and possibly a zzso and an zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso cells it is known that zzso 30 base pairs or longer can trigger zzso responses that are zzso zzso thus limiting the application of zzso as an experimental and therapeutic zzso zzso of zzso zzso with short 3' zzso however, can mediate zzso in a zzso manner in cultured zzso zzso One limitation in the use of zzso as a therapeutic zzso in zzso cells is that short, highly defined zzso need to be delivered to target zzso feat thus far only accomplished by the use of zzso duplex zzso delivered zzso to zzso In this report, we describe a zzso Pol III promoter system capable of expressing functional zzso zzso following zzso into human zzso In the case of the zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso DNA and the zzso zzso we were able to achieve up to 4 logs of zzso of expression from the zzso zzso
