We used the repetitive character of zzso elements to isolate a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso as we have called it, has zzso to zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis showed a zzso untranslated region zzso an open reading frame zzso with no zzso zzso a downstream zzso that had structural zzso to that of the I factor, and, finally, a 3' zzso which ended in several zzso zzso The results of our zzso and structural analyses shed light on the evolution of zzso zzso zzso and support the hypothesis that an zzso of these elements was structurally zzso
