zzso are ubiquitous components of zzso zzso suggesting that they have played a significant role in zzso zzso In zzso zzso eight of 10 zzso insertions of the zzso zzso family are located within 15 zzso of zzso ends, and two are located near the zzso zzso zzso This zzso organization is the consequence of targeted zzso as 14 of 15 newly zzso zzso elements map to zzso regions on 10 different zzso Nine of these insertions are within zzso zzso and three are within zzso zzso of the autonomously replicating consensus sequence in the zzso X zzso This suggests that the X repeat plays an important role in directing zzso zzso Analysis of zzso insertions from zzso and its close relative zzso revealed that only one of 12 insertions has target site zzso indicating that zzso occurs between zzso This is further supported by the observation that zzso insertions mark boundaries of sequence zzso and zzso in these zzso These data suggest that zzso elements like zzso can shape the organization of zzso ends through both zzso and zzso
