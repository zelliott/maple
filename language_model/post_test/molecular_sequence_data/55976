zzso response factor zzso forms a zzso complex at the zzso serum response element zzso with an accessory factor, zzso We constructed zzso specificity derivatives of zzso and zzso that form a zzso complex at a zzso inactive zzso like zzso the zzso zzso only binds its target as part of a zzso complex with zzso zzso expression of these zzso and zzso derivatives restores zzso activity to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is dependent on the regulated zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso sites and requires the zzso sequences of zzso as well as zzso sequences that mediate zzso complex zzso These experiments provide direct evidence that zzso and zzso functionally cooperate in the zzso complex at the zzso to regulate zzso
