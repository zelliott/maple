beta 3 zzso expression accompanies the zzso and differentiation of the zzso zzso The genetic programs involved in these processes are largely zzso Our previous studies on the regulation of the beta 3 zzso gene have shown that upstream sequences guide the expression in the zzso musculature, while regulatory elements in the first zzso are necessary for expression in the visceral zzso To further zzso this mode of regulation, which reflects an early embryonic zzso program, we undertook a more detailed analysis of the regulatory capabilities of the zzso The results reveal not only a certain degree of zzso in the zzso zzso which act at different zzso stages in the same zzso zzso but they also demonstrate in the visceral zzso which forms a continuous zzso along the body axis of the zzso an early action of regulators guiding gene expression along the zzso axis of the zzso an zzso element in the zzso leads to expression in a zzso restricted along the zzso zzso This pattern is altered in zzso in the zzso gene zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso expression leads to activity of the zzso in the entire visceral zzso So this element is likely to be a target of zzso zzso which would define the beta 3 zzso gene as a zzso gene under the control of zzso zzso
