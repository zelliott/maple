The genetic diversity among 80 zzso materials including 62 indigenous zzso of 17 wild zzso species in China and 7 zzso hybrids, 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso and 1 zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by simple sequence repeat and zzso amplified zzso zzso A total of 10 simple sequence repeat zzso and 11 zzso amplified zzso primer combinations were zzso and 260 bands were generated, of which 252 were zzso with an average zzso rate of zzso zzso relationships among the different zzso species indicated that zzso zzso and zzso zzso could be considered a separate zzso As for the 4 major zzso regions of Chinese wild zzso species, the genetic zzso of Chinese wild zzso species from the zzso Mountain region zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso and the zzso zzso River region zzso zzso zzso I zzso zzso were higher, with results suggesting that these regions may be one of the major centers of zzso zzso An understanding of the genetic diversity of these Chinese wild zzso species could provide the theoretical foundation for further protection and reasonable zzso in grape zzso
