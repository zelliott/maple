When expressed in zzso coli, zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso zzso and a complete zzso zzso Because these zzso are zzso their zzso is significantly lower than that of a corresponding zzso zzso zzso In addition, when zzso zzso are used in zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso it would be useful to develop a system that expresses zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

Three modified zzso were zzso Each contained zzso sequences zzso a zzso linked to the C zzso of a zzso zzso zzso an zzso hinge region zzso a zzso zzso zzso or a zzso containing the zzso and zzso sequences in tandem zzso The zzso were used to express two cloned zzso recognizing human zzso M and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso proteins were expressed in zzso coli and were zzso and evaluated by zzso and zzso 

By gel zzso zzso 35, 90, and 70 percent of the zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso and zzso tails, respectively, were zzso By zzso the zzso of zzso containing the zzso or zzso tails was six to eight times higher than that of the corresponding zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso directly zzso zzso in zzso similar to those of corresponding zzso zzso zzso 

An introduction of zzso peptides allowed the isolation of zzso produced, zzso zzso This approach could be useful for obtaining zzso zzso zzso that may replace or complement conventional zzso produced by zzso tissue culture zzso
