zzso is a zzso zzso that binds to, and is activated by, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso pathway, and leads to zzso of zzso This toxic effect is reduced by deletion of zzso We studied the structural and functional basis for the role of zzso in zzso the growth arrest zzso associated with zzso of zzso zzso zzso activity is required for the effect, because zzso as well as full-length zzso is toxic with zzso but zzso versions of either protein with a zzso zzso are zzso Thus, the zzso portion of zzso is not required provided the protein is activated by removal of the zzso zzso Relief of zzso in zzso normally requires zzso by zzso and zzso contains a putative zzso zzso zzso site zzso in its zzso zzso The zzso double zzso zzso expressed from a zzso zzso did not zzso bind zzso and was functionally inactive in zzso the toxic effect of zzso equivalent to an zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso zzso from a zzso zzso restored zzso In contrast, zzso acted as a zzso zzso of zzso markedly reducing its zzso This zzso activity required the zzso zzso and the effect was largely lost when the zzso site was zzso suggesting suppression by zzso of zzso zzso We also studied the effect of replacing the predicted zzso and established zzso zzso sites in zzso by zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso zzso markedly reduced zzso zzso and toxicity was only partially rescued by zzso zzso zzso was sufficiently inactive in an zzso strain to allow some cells to survive zzso toxicity even when zzso The significance of these findings for our understanding of zzso function is zzso
