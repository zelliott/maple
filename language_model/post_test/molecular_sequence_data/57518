The introduction of human zzso 17 suppresses the zzso of a zzso cell line in the absence of any effects on in zzso growth and the zzso type 1 zzso gene may be zzso Here we report that 4 out of 10 human zzso lines express little or no zzso and that two of these lines show evidence of zzso zzso providing further proof that zzso zzso occur in zzso that are not commonly found in zzso zzso We also show that zzso deficient zzso show only moderately elevated zzso levels, in contrast to zzso zzso cells, indicating that zzso contributes differently to the negative regulation of zzso in different cell zzso
