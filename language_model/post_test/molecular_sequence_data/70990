zzso zzso has recently been discovered as a constituent of the complex zzso system in the zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso where it zzso the reduction of a zzso zzso by zzso Here we report on the full-length DNA sequence of the zzso previously isolated from zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence comprises 147 zzso and matches with all the zzso sequences of fragments obtained from zzso It shares a characteristic sequence motif zzso with some zzso proteins of unknown zzso This motif is zzso with the zzso zzso which characterizes the zzso zzso of proteins and is known to catalyze zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso and the typical zzso are restricted to the intimate environment of the zzso motif and three more remote zzso presumed to contribute to the folding pattern of the zzso zzso The zzso thus form a distinct molecular zzso within the zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso as a zzso extended and zzso zzso isolated by zzso zzso and characterized zzso The zzso product exhibited a kinetic pattern identical with, and kinetic parameters similar to those of the authentic zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso can therefore be considered a valuable tool for the screening of specific zzso as potential zzso zzso
