zzso zzso strain zzso zzso and its zzso zzso produce a complex zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso in a zzso zzso zzso The in zzso synthesis of zzso employing zzso cells as the zzso system and the respective zzso sugar zzso zzso is zzso The synthesis of the zzso zzso repeat unit, already observed in zzso cells, was confirmed, as well as the formation of other zzso not related to zzso zzso including a high molecular mass zzso The zzso formed was characterized by gel zzso specific radioactive zzso with each precursor and zzso zzso It was also shown that zzso contains zzso zzso and that using zzso zzso as zzso zzso was detected both at the zzso and at the zzso zzso zzso
