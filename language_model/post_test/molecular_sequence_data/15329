Since 1998, zzso of zzso zzso associated with zzso shellfish poisoning have been repeatedly reported for zzso zzso zzso Mediterranean zzso Based on data obtained for zzso gene zzso it has been suggested that the strains involved could be closely related to the Japanese temperate Asian zzso of the temperate Asian zzso In order to gain more insight into the origin of these organisms, we carried out a genetic analysis of 61 Mediterranean and 23 Japanese strains using both zzso and zzso zzso Whereas the zzso based on zzso markers tended to confirm the previous findings, the analysis of zzso sequences revealed an unexpected distinction between the French and Japanese zzso This analysis also highlighted great zzso diversity that was not detected with the classical zzso gene zzso The Japanese strains are divided into two differentiated zzso zzso zzso the Sea of Japan lineage and the east coast zzso which includes populations from the Inland Sea and the Pacific zzso zzso zzso strains isolated from zzso zzso belong to another zzso These findings indicate that zzso markers are probably better suited to investigations of the population zzso of this species that is distributed zzso Finally, application of the population zzso concepts available for zzso could support new zzso for zzso and migration in zzso zzso
