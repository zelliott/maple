zzso binding domain B1 of zzso protein G zzso a small zzso zzso stable, single domain zzso is one of the most extensively used model systems in the area of protein folding and zzso The recently determined zzso structure of a quadruple zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso that zzso into a partially zzso zzso species at low zzso protein zzso Here, we have characterized this zzso partially folded species by zzso and show that extensive zzso zzso for a substantial portion of the zzso chain zzso Exchange between the zzso within the zzso ensemble on the zzso to zzso zzso renders the majority of backbone zzso zzso broadened beyond zzso Despite these extensive zzso and spatial zzso the overall architecture of the zzso zzso protein resembles that of zzso zzso and not the zzso unit of the zzso zzso
