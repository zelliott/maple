zzso is one of the smallest zzso known (about 98 zzso acid zzso It is present in zzso and zzso of zzso species as two zzso sharing over zzso of sequence zzso these appear highly zzso in differing zzso The two zzso can be involved in a number of zzso zzso though their effective biological function is not still zzso The solution and crystal structures of different zzso are known, revealing a close packed protein with a fold similar to that shown by other zzso zzso The structural data, together with an extended zzso zzso investigation, led to the identification of the zzso involved in zzso zzso However, it appears unlikely that these zzso are able to perform the full zzso zzso a zzso zzso mechanism has therefore been proposed, in which the zzso zzso of the zzso could act as a zzso zzso the zzso water zzso
