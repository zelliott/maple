The zzso species of zzso zzso contains two overlapping open reading zzso Both are zzso in either zzso or zzso DNA zzso zzso cells, resulting in two different zzso from a single zzso zzso with zzso zzso expression of the downstream reading frame was increased by sequence changes that diminished the consensus around the upstream zzso zzso However, the upstream product was not decreased by the same changes, suggesting that its synthesis is zzso at zzso The results suggest a model for regulating zzso zzso translation in which the zzso in one reading frame interfere with the movement of zzso in the other frame due to different rates of zzso
