zzso favored zzso of zzso 1 were calculated using the newly developed zzso program, zzso zzso of zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso 1, which is part of the zzso zzso of zzso has been zzso 1 contains 27 zzso acid zzso from zzso to zzso and a zzso zzso zzso to zzso The zzso of the zzso and the zzso parts are shown to be mutually zzso Single zzso zzso of 1 exhibit interaction energies of up to zzso zzso with the zzso zzso Generally, only a few of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso express significant interaction energies with the zzso zzso No easy prediction is possible of zzso zzso which exhibit favorable interaction zzso However, in all of the calculated structures, the zzso zzso of the zzso branches show strong attractive forces for the zzso zzso zzso linked branches can adopt a larger number of zzso than other linkages due to their high flexibility which allows more favorable interactions with zzso We developed the zzso program in order to be able to study the preferred zzso of large zzso The program is based on the zzso zzso of zzso program and zzso the zzso zzso sphere zzso zzso force field for the zzso part and the zzso zzso zzso energy program for zzso force field zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1983) zzso zzso zzso 87, zzso for the zzso zzso The zzso program allows the simultaneous relaxation of all zzso degrees of freedom of these zzso during the energy zzso zzso Thus, mutual interactions between zzso and zzso acid zzso can be studied in zzso
