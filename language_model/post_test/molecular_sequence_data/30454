The experiments here reported demonstrate that the main zzso region of rat zzso DNA is zzso zzso We have identified stable heavy and light zzso whose pattern is rather complex, in the zzso region of rat zzso zzso Their relative zzso have been zzso We detected heavy transcripts which zzso the whole zzso and more abundant heavy zzso species which we interpreted as transcripts terminating downstream of the 3' end of the last coded gene zzso The processed heavy zzso species contain zzso suggesting a strict association between zzso and zzso The pattern of light transcripts shows a long zzso which, starting from the light strand promoter, covers the whole segment, and shorter zzso species which seems to be actively processed at the level of the zzso sequence boxes, probably acting as zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso containing region of rat zzso DNA, and in particular the presence of stable transcripts complementary to the putative zzso zzso suggest that mechanisms zzso by interaction between complementary transcripts zzso zzso might play a role in the regulation of zzso DNA replication and zzso
