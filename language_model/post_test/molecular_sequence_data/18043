Recently, we determined the complete zzso acid sequence of bovine factor zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the course of the studies, we found an unknown zzso zzso at position 52 in the first zzso growth zzso domain of factor zzso A zzso isolated from the zzso factor zzso contained zzso which could not be identified with a zzso zzso The same results were also obtained for a zzso containing zzso of factor IX and protein zzso zzso sugar analysis revealed that the zzso contained 1 zzso of zzso and 2 zzso of zzso This sugar component was also confirmed by high-resolution fast atom zzso mass zzso analysis of the zzso The zzso was released from the peptides by means of zzso reaction and its reducing end was identified as zzso These results indicate the existence of a zzso structure in factors zzso IX and protein zzso Similar results were obtained for human factors zzso IX and protein zzso This is the first report of a zzso structure in zzso to our zzso The presence of the unique zzso structure in factors zzso IX and protein Z leads us to anticipate its biological role in the tissue factor zzso
