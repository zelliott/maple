zzso mice carrying the bacterial zzso gene in a zzso shuttle zzso were used to isolate and characterize background and zzso zzso zzso in zzso Adult male mice were treated once zzso with either zzso or zzso or were left zzso Seven days later, zzso treatment had significantly increased the zzso frequency in the skin zzso zzso zzso 36 zzso 3 zzso zzso versus in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso At least 10 zzso from each of three zzso and three zzso mice were selected for DNA sequence zzso In each case, the entire zzso target gene was zzso zzso zzso predominated zzso of 96 zzso although zzso and deletion zzso were also zzso Twelve percent of the zzso carried more than one zzso In controls, the zzso were predominantly zzso transitions zzso of zzso and no zzso zzso were zzso In contrast, in the zzso mice, zzso zzso represented zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso transitions accounted for only zzso The zzso zzso occurred mostly at zzso zzso This class of zzso has been recovered frequently in zzso genes from zzso mice and probably represents an early event in zzso zzso MA et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso Our present results are consistent with the types of DNA damage induced by zzso The observation of different zzso zzso and zzso in treated and control mice demonstrates the utility of this approach in the study of zzso in zzso
