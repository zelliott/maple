Plant shoots elaborate their adult form by selective control over the growth of both their primary shoot zzso zzso and their zzso shoot zzso We describe zzso zzso at two zzso in zzso zzso and zzso that affect the selective repression of zzso zzso All the first order (but not higher zzso zzso shoots initiated by zzso plants remain active, resulting in zzso shoots than those of wild zzso In zzso plants where zzso shoots develop in a zzso to zzso zzso the zzso do not clearly alter zzso distance, from the shoot zzso at which zzso shoot zzso initiate but shorten the distance at which the first zzso leaf zzso is produced by the zzso shoot zzso A small number of zzso zzso shoot zzso is enlarged and, later in development, a low proportion of zzso lateral shoots is zzso Together, this suggests that zzso and zzso do not control the timing of zzso zzso initiation but repress zzso formation by the zzso zzso In addition to shoot zzso zzso at both zzso affect leaf zzso The zzso at zzso cause increased zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso cloning identifies zzso as a member of the zzso zzso repeat family of zzso zzso is identical to zzso a proposed regulator of leaf zzso ( zzso zzso zzso Chung, zzso zzso Park, zzso Oh, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (2001) Plant Cell 13, zzso Our results suggest that selective repression of zzso shoots involves zzso degradation of as yet unidentified proteins that activate zzso zzso
