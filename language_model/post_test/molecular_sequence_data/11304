zzso require specific patterns of zzso channel zzso expression as well as the precise zzso of channel zzso into zzso structures for proper integration and transmission of electrical zzso In zzso zzso zzso was investigated by studying the pharmacological profile, distribution, and zzso composition of zzso Shaker family zzso zzso channels in rat zzso that are labeled by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed spatial zzso expression mainly in basket cell terminals zzso of all zzso zzso and the molecular layer zzso of zzso zzso zzso indicated overlapping expression of zzso 1 and zzso in basket cell zzso whereas the molecular layer expressed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed that all zzso receptors contain at least one zzso zzso and that zzso of these receptors are zzso of zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, zzso of these zzso receptors possess either an additional zzso or zzso zzso Only a minority of the zzso receptors zzso seem to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso cells leads to the formation of a complex that combines the pharmacological profile of both parent zzso zzso the native zzso zzso zzso zzso assembly provides the structural basis for toxin binding pharmacology and can lead to the association of as many as three distinct channel zzso to form functional zzso channels in zzso
