zzso tumors arise sporadically or as part of the zzso manifestations of familial zzso zzso zzso In zzso two distinct clinical presentations of the zzso zzso are zzso 1) one or a few zzso tumors present predominantly in the abdominal wall or the zzso 2) a florid proliferation of tumors early in life, mostly near the zzso skeleton or zzso These different zzso have been associated with different sites of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso coli gene zzso zzso We present a large, zzso zzso with a florid zzso tumor zzso caused by a zzso zzso at zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso was characterized by the early onset of multiple tumors, arising near the zzso skeleton and in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso tumors was near zzso in this zzso However, the expression of the disease was variable amongst the different affected zzso Many gene carriers had zzso zzso zzso of the colon was rarely observed in the affected individuals and we did not document upper zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso did not express a stable truncated protein in zzso zzso analysis of the zzso tumor DNA revealed a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso on the tumor also demonstrated elevated levels of zzso The present study demonstrates that this extreme 3' zzso zzso is associated with a severely zzso zzso zzso and attenuated zzso zzso It also suggests the involvement of the zzso zzso in the development of zzso tumors in zzso The natural history of the disease is variable between individuals, and surgical interventions have to be timed appropriately due to the frequent zzso
