A new zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Pacific zzso zzso this isolate exhibited characteristics similar to those described for members of the order zzso This zzso was identified as a member of the zzso zzso on the basis of the presence of the typical outer zzso structure zzso its zzso zzso zzso and its ability to grow on carbohydrates zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The cells of this zzso were gram negative and rod shaped and generally occurred zzso or in pairs, rarely occurring as chains with a maximum of five zzso At the optimum temperature for growth zzso degrees zzso optimum pH zzso and optimum zzso (30 g of zzso per zzso the doubling time was 100 zzso In spite of the high percentage of similarity of its zzso zzso sequence with that of zzso zzso zzso the weak level of zzso zzso with this strain zzso and particular zzso characteristics allowed us to differentiate this new zzso from the sole species of the zzso zzso previously described zzso zzso On the basis of these zzso we propose that the new zzso should be described as a new species, zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso
