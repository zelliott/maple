zzso are a family of zzso proteins found in both zzso and zzso that exhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso Members of this family bind to zzso drugs and on this basis are divided into two zzso zzso bind to zzso and zzso while zzso bind to zzso zzso In this paper, we report on insect zzso zzso and its associated zzso The insect zzso belongs to the zzso zzso and shares many characteristic features with its zzso counterparts, but its functional role remains zzso Here, we show that zzso is zzso by a protein zzso present in the nucleus of both insect zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso This protein zzso is zzso with zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso zzso II zzso We have zzso zzso and characterized a new member of the zzso family derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso shares zzso identity to human, chicken and zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso beta zzso is zzso identical to zzso chicken and zzso Moreover, we demonstrate that the insect zzso zzso can be zzso by human and zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, we show that zzso interacts with DNA, and this interaction is not prevented by zzso
