zzso cell differentiation is tightly controlled by distinct sets of zzso factors that regulate the expression of zzso zzso We recently isolated the first zzso zzso zzso factor zzso Here we describe the characterization of zzso a second zzso zzso zzso zzso Like zzso zzso is induced during zzso zzso However, whereas zzso is expressed in the majority of zzso cell types, zzso expression is restricted to differentiated zzso and zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to zzso full-length zzso binds poorly to DNA due to the presence of a negative regulatory domain at the zzso zzso Furthermore, although zzso and the zzso deleted zzso bind with similar affinity to the zzso zzso zzso site, zzso and zzso differ zzso in their relative affinity toward binding sites in the zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, zzso and zzso drastically differ in their ability to zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso but not zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso promoter and the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso the zzso zzso promoter zzso site and the zzso zzso promoter significantly better than zzso Our results demonstrate the existence of a unique class of related zzso zzso factors with distinct functions in zzso cell gene zzso
