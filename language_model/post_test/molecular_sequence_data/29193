The viral zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso It was zzso zzso long and contained zzso terminal repeats of 230 zzso Their zzso 159 zzso formed imperfect zzso in two zzso Three large open reading frames zzso were identified on the same zzso two in the zzso half and one in the right-hand zzso Each of the five structural zzso expressed from the right-hand zzso in the zzso system, zzso into zzso The two zzso zzso overlapped and code for zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was shown to contain zzso protein and zzso zzso The zzso region in zzso zzso protein is zzso among most zzso and contained a zzso zzso zzso a novel viral zzso This domain was expressed and its zzso activity was zzso The approximate zzso sequence identity between the zzso from zzso and zzso and identical zzso organization indicated that zzso should be classified in the zzso zzso
