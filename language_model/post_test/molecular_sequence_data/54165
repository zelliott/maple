zzso zzso is a type III zzso protein of the rice blight bacterial pathogen zzso zzso zzso zzso that elicits a hypersensitive response zzso in zzso zzso zzso is predicted to contain two potential zzso zzso regions, one at the zzso with a high probability of formation, and one at the zzso with a lower probability of zzso We constructed several zzso peptides by a zzso method, and investigated the zzso of the predicted zzso zzso regions, using zzso and zzso zzso Both peptides zzso an zzso in zzso zzso versions of the zzso and zzso peptides that were predicted to disrupt or favor zzso formation were zzso The resulting altered zzso activity and zzso indicated that the zzso zzso region is essential for zzso HR, but the zzso is zzso The results also indicate that a zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso region is a minimal and independent functional element for zzso in tobacco zzso We propose that zzso requires a specific zzso of the zzso regions of zzso
