There are regions in the core gene of zzso B virus zzso where zzso zzso are zzso and zzso in that region are related to severe liver zzso However, there were some differences of the major regions for zzso zzso among ethnic zzso To explore the phenomenon of zzso zzso in Korean patients with chronic zzso infection and to zzso the correlation between zzso zzso region of the core gene and the severity of liver damage, we analyzed the zzso gene sequence of zzso in the zzso from zzso chronic zzso B zzso zzso 

We zzso the zzso zzso and core sequences in the zzso obtained from zzso patients zzso males and 1 female, mean age zzso zzso with zzso zzso The patients were divided into two groups according to the pathological severity of zzso zzso group I consisted of 8 patients with chronic persistent zzso zzso and group II included 7 patients with chronic active zzso zzso After extraction of zzso DNA from each serum by zzso K and zzso solution, the entire zzso and core region of zzso was amplified by zzso and then the zzso products were subjected to direct sequencing using zzso DNA zzso zzso exact test and zzso U test were used for statistical zzso 

A total of 181 zzso zzso were found in the zzso core gene from the 15 zzso patients, of which 23 were zzso and 158 were zzso The zzso and zzso acid substitution rates were not significantly different between the two groups zzso zzso zzso Two zzso hot spots zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were found in the deduced zzso acid alignment of the core zzso The zzso rate of zzso acid zzso in these regions were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Of 8 zzso patients, 5 showed zzso zzso only in zzso In comparison, of 7 zzso patients, 3 showed them both in zzso and zzso 1 only in zzso and 1 only in zzso thus, zzso zzso in zzso was exclusively found in patient with zzso 

There were two zzso zzso in the core region of zzso zzso of zzso from Korean zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso are more likely to be related to the severity of zzso A zzso study using sequential samples is warranted to further clarify the role of zzso in the zzso of more severe zzso
