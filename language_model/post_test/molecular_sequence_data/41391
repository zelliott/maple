The zzso module of the nuclear pore complex borders the zzso nuclear zzso domain of the nuclear zzso In evolution, a single zzso module increases in size from zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso the zzso transition proceeds through the acquisition of the zzso zzso How zzso contacts the zzso remained zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso specifically binds the zzso member of the zzso but does not bind an zzso zzso To zzso the zzso interaction at the atomic level, we carried out zzso analyses of zzso alone and in a complex with an zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso structural predictions, we determined that zzso folds into a zzso zzso Several zzso surface regions of the zzso zzso assume structure when bound to zzso The zzso domain of zzso also folds into a zzso zzso with a markedly protruding zzso insert and is followed by a contorted zzso zzso Conspicuously, this zzso insert contains an extension of 50 zzso which also is highly zzso in zzso but is absent in zzso zzso numerous contacts with the zzso zzso are located on this extension of the zzso zzso Another contact region is situated toward the end of the zzso region of zzso Our findings provide information about the evolution and the assembly of the zzso module of the nuclear pore zzso
