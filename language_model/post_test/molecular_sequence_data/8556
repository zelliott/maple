zzso require viral DNA to be zzso by reverse zzso in the zzso followed by integration of the resulting viral DNA into the host zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and integration, essential steps in the life cycle of zzso are possible targets in the development of zzso zzso One attractive target is the zzso zzso a product of the zzso pol gene which is solely responsible for the zzso integration process through cutting and joining zzso When screening for massive numbers of zzso agents, a rapid and precise zzso is zzso We report the application of zzso resonance energy transfer zzso with zzso and zzso as the energy transfer pair to characterize zzso DNA zzso zzso Past concerns with applications of zzso to DNA were due to interactions of the zzso with the DNA, resulting in zzso zzso However, in this study these concerns have been resolved with the use of a zzso analog with a zzso zzso arm, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso studies show that zzso of the zzso zzso by zzso results in enhancement of zzso donor zzso zzso The zzso zzso was confirmed by zzso analysis of the zzso reaction with zzso zzso zzso This zzso zzso will facilitate both detailed kinetic studies and the rapid screening of novel zzso zzso
