The zzso junction complex zzso is a protein complex that assembles near zzso junctions of zzso as a result of zzso zzso proteins play important roles in zzso events including zzso export, zzso zzso and zzso zzso Recent evidence suggests that zzso translation is also influenced by the zzso history of the zzso Here we identify zzso a zzso zzso zzso and a member of the zzso family of translation initiation factors, as a novel component of the zzso We show that zzso associates zzso with nuclear complexes containing the zzso proteins zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso but not the highly related zzso or zzso zzso associates with spliced zzso In zzso zzso and mapping experiments demonstrate that zzso binds zzso at the position of the zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso is found in the nucleus whereas zzso and zzso are found in the zzso Thus, zzso likely provides a zzso influence on the translation of zzso
