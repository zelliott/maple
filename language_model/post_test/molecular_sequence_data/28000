zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by simple procedures with 57% zzso The zzso resembled that from zzso zzso in the zzso size zzso molecular weight zzso zzso acid zzso the zzso acid sequence of the zzso and the secondary zzso The zzso activity was regulated by zzso of each zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses two useful zzso high zzso and resistance to zzso zzso The zzso was not zzso on exposure to 60 degrees C for 2 h or 37 degrees C for 72 zzso or after incubation with zzso zzso or zzso at 37 degrees C for 12 zzso pH zzso With zzso zzso levels, the zzso plot was zzso and zzso downward with an intersection point at 45 degrees C, and the zzso energies were calculated to be zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso The specific activity of the highly zzso zzso zzso was remarkably lower than that of the slightly zzso zzso zzso however, both zzso show similar profiles of the zzso zzso These results indicate that the zzso of the zzso does not affect its zzso zzso
