The zzso of incompletely assembled zzso zzso heavy chain in zzso zzso cells stimulates the cellular response to protein traffic that results in the increased zzso and elevated synthesis of several zzso zzso including zzso a member of the protein zzso zzso family of molecular zzso The zzso promoter contains an 82 zzso zzso protein traffic response element zzso that is sufficient to mediate this zzso Previously, it had been shown that the zzso of a putative zzso site and a zzso and zzso zzso site within the zzso significantly decreased the response of zzso promoter to zzso chain zzso We have extended these findings by demonstrating a role for zzso and a potentially novel zzso protein in the regulation of zzso from the zzso zzso The fact that zzso binding to the zzso is observed in extracts from both control cells and cells in which the response to protein traffic has been activated indicates that the binding of zzso while necessary, is not sufficient to account for the zzso Each of the two zzso sites in the zzso can bind zzso zzso but both sites must be intact for full zzso zzso A second protein can bind to the zzso independently of zzso and at a site overlapping or close to the 3' end of the reverse zzso zzso It is possible that interactions between zzso this protein and perhaps other factors are responsible for the regulation of the protein traffic zzso
