A new zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso type zzso was isolated from a brackish hot zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso that zzso zzso a and has a zzso zzso This isolate is a zzso zzso with an optimal growth temperature of 40 to 48 degrees zzso The cells are zzso zzso to short zzso An analysis of zzso zzso sequences revealed that the new strain forms a coherent cluster with members of the zzso group of the alpha zzso of the zzso which contains the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The closest relative is zzso zzso with a zzso zzso sequence similarity of zzso The in zzso zzso spectrum has zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The main zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Growth occurs with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso extract as sole energy zzso The zzso composition and nutritional profile of the new isolate are similar to the zzso composition and nutritional profile of zzso zzso Although there are marked differences in cell zzso between the new isolate and the budding zzso zzso zzso the results of zzso and genetic comparisons suggest that the new isolate is closely related to zzso zzso zzso we assign the new isolate to the zzso zzso and propose the name zzso zzso zzso zzso for it; the type strain of zzso zzso is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
