In contrast to the highly zzso zzso class zzso genes that exhibit a broad zzso tissue distribution, the restricted zzso expression of zzso to zzso and a subset of zzso zzso cells suggests tight zzso control of this zzso class zzso zzso zzso of zzso class I genes is zzso by three major regulatory zzso present in their promoter region namely zzso A, zzso and zzso The zzso promoter sequence of zzso comprises modified zzso A and zzso zzso and lacks the zzso which renders this gene unresponsive to zzso zzso and class II zzso zzso zzso A number of other zzso upstream regulatory elements have recently been zzso Using different transgenic zzso mouse models under the control of the zzso promoter, several groups have shown by in zzso zzso and/or qualitative or quantitative zzso that zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso tissue decreased with zzso zzso This suggests that once the zzso is fully formed, the functions of zzso might not be so zzso
