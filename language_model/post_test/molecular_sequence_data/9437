The aim of the present work was to assess the genetic and zzso zzso in the zzso region of type 3 zzso zzso an zzso zzso associated to meningitis, zzso diseases and type 1 diabetes in zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso among which 9 were isolated in zzso zzso were zzso zzso analyses and zzso divergence rates were studied in the complete zzso region and in a zzso zzso in the zzso part of the zzso zzso sequences were deduced in the aim to identify zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences divided into two zzso I and zzso the genetic zzso within the zzso zzso reached zzso zzso I included sequences with a relatively high genetic diversity among each other, some of them grouped in one zzso with at most zzso divergence zzso The sequences included in zzso II have a maximum of zzso divergence corresponding probably to only one zzso The two zzso have a zzso circulation and a wide geographical and zzso zzso zzso zzso that may be specific to zzso zzso and special zzso were zzso This work provides a first tentative of zzso of zzso into zzso and zzso and reports new zzso sequences from North zzso It contributes to a better understanding of the molecular epidemiology of human zzso and of zzso type 3 in particular, a zzso that remains insufficiently studied in the international zzso
