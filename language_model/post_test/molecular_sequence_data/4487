In infectious zzso zzso zzso zzso are produced which zzso with multiple normal human zzso The zzso can be inhibited with synthetic peptides representing the zzso repeat in zzso which implies that the zzso is due to zzso zzso that zzso with host proteins containing zzso like those in the zzso zzso Here we report the isolation of five gene fragments from a zzso B zzso zzso library zzso peptides zzso with zzso in an IM zzso One of these, zzso encodes a zzso rich zzso which constitutes its zzso zzso as shown zzso By Northern zzso zzso was identifiable in three B zzso lines, a T cell line, and an zzso cell zzso In a search of the zzso for proteins with sequence similarity to zzso we found a high degree of identity with the zzso and 3' terminal regions of the recently published mouse zzso zzso which encodes a protein with the structure of a zzso nuclear zzso protein zzso We confirmed by anchored zzso our presumption that the zzso sequences of zzso also have a high degree of identity with zzso including presence of zzso binding motifs characteristic of zzso There was also sequence zzso with human zzso zzso From these observations and our previous studies, we conclude that the zzso for one of the zzso zzso generated during immune responses to the Epstein zzso virus, zzso is probably an zzso
