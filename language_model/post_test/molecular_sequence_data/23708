To clone a novel gene expressed specifically in human embryonic stem cell and to analyze its zzso 

Based on an expression sequence zzso zzso which expressed specifically in human embryonic stem cell, the full-length zzso sequence of a novel gene was cloned by using zzso and molecular biological zzso Its expression profile was analyzed by reverse zzso chain zzso and zzso location was determined by enhanced green fluorescent protein zzso zzso expression zzso 

A novel gene zzso sapiens zzso embryonic stem zzso zzso was cloned zzso Its zzso zzso number was zzso Its zzso length was 1395 zzso It comprised 9 zzso and 8 zzso and its opening reading frame was zzso zzso Its zzso mapping was located in zzso and the putative protein contained 297 zzso zzso The theoretical molecular weight of the putative protein was 33 zzso and the zzso point was zzso The protein primary structure of this gene contained a zzso motif and it was zzso located in zzso zzso analysis showed that this gene was expressed specifically in human zzso cells, but not expressed in the adult human zzso the multiple zzso of zzso aborted in over 5 months' pregnancy, the differentiated cells of zzso and the human zzso stem cells zzso and human embryonic zzso zzso 

zzso was found to be a novel gene expressed specifically in human zzso cell, which might be related to zzso of human zzso cell and maintaining its zzso zzso
