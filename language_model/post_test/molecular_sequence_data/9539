In molecular biology studies of zzso zzso methods to obtain genetic material are needed as alternatives to toe zzso This work evaluates a zzso method for sampling DNA from blood zzso comparing the performance of three different extraction protocols zzso zzso zzso and zzso We collected zzso individuals of zzso zzso zzso blood via puncture of the zzso vein using zzso zzso zzso We extracted zzso zzso DNA, finding no differences between the extraction zzso We compared the quality of the resulting DNA through amplification and sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was successful for the three extraction zzso although zzso showed better performance, making it the most zzso protocol for extraction of DNA from zzso The resulting sequences corresponded to those registered in the zzso for this zzso Additionally, we found no significant differences in survival or weight change between the individuals that were manipulated and a control group zzso survival zzso treated, zzso zzso Data reveal that blood samples obtained by puncture are a convenient alternative to other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that have traditionally been used as DNA sources for zzso The technique is zzso to small and large species, covering most zzso diversity, provides enough DNA for many genetic applications and produces no noticeable effect on the survival or performance, given that it does not affect the motor parts or the zzso of the zzso
