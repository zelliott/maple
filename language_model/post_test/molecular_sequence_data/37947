The combined zzso deafness locus maps to zzso zzso between markers zzso and zzso We have determined the zzso sequence and zzso structure of a novel zzso zzso that maps to this zzso and is expressed in the zzso The mouse zzso of this gene zzso maps to the zzso zzso zzso locus on mouse zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso reveal the presence of at least one putative zzso domain in the zzso zzso To determine whether zzso in zzso cause hearing loss at the zzso zzso we screened the coding region of this gene in zzso affected families by direct zzso All DNA zzso that zzso with the deafness and changed the predicted zzso acid sequence of zzso were common zzso as demonstrated by zzso amplification of pooled control zzso Northern zzso analysis showed no difference in transcript size or expression level of zzso in zzso and control zzso The zzso zzso in zzso represent a novel zzso boundary for the zzso zzso
