The zzso sequence of the zzso c zzso gene of the white root rot fungus zzso zzso was zzso The structure of this zzso which had three zzso in the coding region, was similar to that of zzso zzso The second zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene was not present in zzso zzso or zzso zzso However, the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso was most similar to that of zzso zzso Thus, it seemed that the second zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene was inserted into its present position after zzso zzso and its closest relatives zzso zzso
