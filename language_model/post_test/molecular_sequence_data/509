zzso stress contributes to tissue injury in conditions ranging from cardiovascular disease to stroke, spinal zzso injury, zzso and perhaps even zzso Yet the efficacy of antioxidants in human disease has been mixed at zzso We need a better understanding of the mechanisms by which established antioxidants combat zzso zzso Iron zzso are well established zzso of zzso death in both neural and zzso zzso but their precise mechanism of action remains zzso The prevailing but not completely substantiated view is that iron zzso prevent zzso injury by suppressing Fenton chemistry and the formation of highly zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that iron zzso zzso rather unexpectedly, by zzso the zzso factor zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso an iron and zzso zzso zzso and its zzso 2 and 3 are best known for stabilizing zzso regulators involved in hypoxic adaptation, such as zzso and zzso response zzso protein zzso Yet we find that global zzso factor zzso zzso protects zzso even when zzso and zzso are directly zzso Moreover, two global zzso zzso continued to be zzso even in the presence of diminished zzso levels, which itself increases zzso zzso to zzso zzso Finally, zzso interference to zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso prevents zzso death, independent of zzso zzso Together, these studies suggest that iron zzso can prevent zzso zzso zzso death through selective zzso of zzso but independent of zzso and zzso and that zzso not zzso regulates zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso
