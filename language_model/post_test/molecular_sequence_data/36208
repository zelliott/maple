A zzso zzso was genetically engineered which contained the zzso signal and four zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein A zzso fused to a zzso zzso zzso derived from an zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso directed against the plant regulatory zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence was zzso in a single synthetic gene and expressed as a zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso The zzso of the fusion protein was established by its ability to bind to both zzso and zzso Growth of cultures, producing the zzso at 37 degrees C, resulted in a decrease in the zzso zzso of the fusion zzso and an increased zzso of an assumed degradation product which retained zzso zzso Growth of cultures at lower temperatures zzso the zzso of zzso fusion zzso The zzso fusion protein could be zzso to zzso by a simple, rapid zzso zzso
