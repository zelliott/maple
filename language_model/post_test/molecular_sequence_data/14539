zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso producing zzso oxygen species within zzso space of zzso zzso have shown that zzso zzso is an essential element related to the zzso zzso Since some zzso zzso are thought to have functional roles in the zzso thus, we studied the association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and the severity of zzso in coronary zzso One hundred zzso subjects undergoing coronary zzso were recruited on the base of study zzso Patients zzso had at least a zzso coronary artery zzso zzso and subdivided into three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso while controls zzso had the normal coronary arteries zzso zzso The direct zzso technique of zzso was performed using zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso tools predicted the changes of secondary structure at the zzso zzso All zzso being proposed theoretically were found in the study zzso The distribution of zzso zzso had no significant difference between patients and controls zzso Although the zzso zzso frequency was not significant between the groups zzso zzso square test and zzso zzso analysis showed an observed high risk for zzso A zzso among zzso The zzso tools predicted that the zzso secondary structure is not changed due to the substitution of zzso at the zzso zzso We concluded that the zzso have no zzso linkage on the zzso In addition, the zzso A zzso is a potential factor of zzso of coronary arteries that increases zzso for the extent of zzso
