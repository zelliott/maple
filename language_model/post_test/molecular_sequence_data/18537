zzso zzso zzso are large zzso zzso that mediate zzso and zzso zzso zzso of temperate zzso zzso They are well suited for use in zzso systems and for synthetic genetic circuits as the zzso and zzso attachment sites are small zzso zzso there are no host factor or DNA zzso requirements, and they are strongly zzso doing only zzso zzso in the presence of a zzso zzso zzso Combining different zzso that function independently and without zzso to construct complex synthetic circuits is desirable, and several different zzso zzso are zzso However, we show here that these functions are not reliably zzso and we describe a pair of zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso and zzso with unusual and unpredictable zzso The zzso share only 59% zzso acid sequence identity and the zzso sites have fewer than 50% shared zzso but they use the same zzso site and there is zzso zzso between the two zzso The DNA binding zzso do not result from differences in specific DNA contacts but from the constraints imposed by the zzso of the component zzso within each of the attachment site zzso
