We describe a new molecular approach to analyzing the genetic diversity of complex microbial zzso This technique is based on the separation of zzso chain zzso fragments of genes coding for zzso zzso all the same zzso by zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso analysis of different microbial communities demonstrated the presence of up to 10 distinguishable bands in the separation pattern, which were most likely derived from as many different species zzso these zzso and thereby generated a zzso profile of the zzso We showed that it is possible to identify constituents which represent only zzso of the total zzso With an zzso probe specific for the zzso region of zzso zzso of zzso bacteria, particular DNA fragments from some of the microbial populations could be identified by zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso DNA from a bacterial zzso grown under zzso conditions suggests that zzso bacteria, despite their zzso were present in this zzso The results we obtained demonstrate that this technique will contribute to our understanding of the genetic diversity of zzso microbial zzso
