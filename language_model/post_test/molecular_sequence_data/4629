Some zzso bacteria possess a system for the zzso of iron from zzso zzso consisting of two zzso zzso namely zzso proteins 1 and zzso Here we present the cloning and sequencing of the gene zzso the zzso protein 1 from a zzso 1 isolate of the zzso pathogen zzso zzso We have also cloned for expression the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both proteins were produced in zzso coli and further zzso We also report the deduced zzso zzso acid sequence comparison to zzso from related zzso
