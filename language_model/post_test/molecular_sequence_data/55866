Efforts have been made to reduce the disadvantages associated with the natural zzso zzso for zzso application by introducing zzso zzso linkages into the zzso A series of such zzso zzso zzso complementary to the coding region of the rabbit zzso zzso and containing different proportions and arrangements of PO and zzso bonds, were zzso and tested for their zzso properties, zzso stability in zzso zzso ability with the complementary DNA zzso ability to form zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity in zzso zzso The melting temperatures zzso of the zzso were reduced by up to 6 degrees C relative to the zzso zzso compared to 11 degrees C for the zzso compound, indicating intermediate zzso abilities of the zzso The zzso studies with human serum zzso exhibited a linear correlation with the percentage of zzso linkage present in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were also improved, but the number and position of the zzso linkages played a significant role in such zzso zzso zzso by these zzso was only found in wheat germ zzso zzso zzso but not in rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso system, suggesting the involvement of zzso H in their zzso zzso zzso they have zzso or zzso 50% zzso zzso the zzso produced almost the same increased zzso in the zzso system as that of the zzso zzso The translation arrest in zzso extract is in good agreement with the in zzso zzso found for rabbit zzso zzso in the zzso duplex by zzso H zzso It is concluded that a zzso of PO and zzso might be preferable to either zzso or zzso for zzso zzso
