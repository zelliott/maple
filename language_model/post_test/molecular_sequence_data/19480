zzso zzso is the precursor of zzso hormone zzso and zzso and is suggested to have evolved by the zzso and deletion of ancestral zzso zzso Here, the primary structure of zzso was determined with zzso cloning of brown tree snakes of zzso and American zzso of zzso to show an overview of the molecular evolution of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso are composed of zzso zzso and zzso segments and a single zzso segment as in other zzso however, the zzso segment in snake zzso has a zzso in the essential sequence from zzso to zzso in which zzso means zzso It is conceivable that the ancestry of snake zzso had weak functional constraint and lacked biological significance during zzso zzso analyses using the zzso method show that snake zzso is most diverged, and zzso zzso is most zzso in zzso zzso while it shows the highest sequence identity with ostrich zzso These relationships are comparable to those observed in zzso zzso On the other hand, analyses of the zzso with mass zzso revealed several peptides by zzso processing as predicted by the locations of processing sites consisting of basic zzso acid zzso in snake and zzso zzso zzso the zzso site at the zzso side of the snake zzso is suggested to act as a processing zzso Thus, the study shows the divergence of snake zzso such as the critical zzso of zzso and high conservation of hormone organization of zzso zzso
