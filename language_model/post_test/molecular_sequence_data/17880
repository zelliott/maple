The zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, 1, 1, 8) locus of zzso zzso is zzso with respect to the number of zzso duplicated genes in natural zzso The duplicated genes were cloned and the zzso sequences were zzso The zzso zzso both the first and second zzso and has a size of zzso zzso The fact that there is no sequence variation at the junction point of the duplicated units among strains suggests a single origin for the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequences among the zzso indicates that the frequent transfer of genetic information occurs from one to the other of the zzso on the same zzso either by gene conversion or by unequal crossing zzso Because the zzso zzso is partial and therefore a kind of zzso the observed zzso of the number of zzso duplicated zzso genes appears to have been driven mainly by random genetic zzso
