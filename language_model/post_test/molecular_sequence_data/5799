A new class of agricultural zzso derived from the group of zzso zzso acts as specific zzso zzso by binding to zzso zzso zzso The zzso b gene was cloned and zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the zzso agent of apple zzso The gene was zzso zzso in size and contained seven zzso and six zzso The zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso sequence with zzso b proteins from other zzso revealed highest zzso to the respective proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso b at positions altered in zzso of zzso zzso resistant to zzso and other zzso with reduced sensitivities to zzso were identical to zzso zzso of several zzso The cloning and characterization of the zzso zzso zzso b gene is the initial step in the assessment of resistance risks inherent to the zzso zzso
