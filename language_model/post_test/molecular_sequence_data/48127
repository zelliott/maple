zzso zzso produces the zzso zzso zzso an inhibitor of protein zzso and possesses multiple resistance mechanisms to the produced zzso Several resistance zzso have been isolated from zzso zzso and studies with one of them, zzso which zzso with zzso (the zzso gene from zzso zzso are detailed zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was determined and the mechanism by which its product zzso resistance was zzso The zzso protein is a zzso which introduces a single zzso group into zzso zzso coli zzso zzso in the large zzso thereby zzso an zzso zzso type zzso type I resistance zzso A zzso of zzso zzso in which zzso was zzso was viable and still produced zzso indicating that zzso is zzso at least in the presence of the other resistance zzso
