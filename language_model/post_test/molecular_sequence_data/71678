We have isolated a zzso zzso zzso from rice zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence consists of a zzso with 255 zzso zzso including a putative transit zzso (40 zzso in zzso zzso This sequence is similar to the known plant zzso but not classified in the group of known zzso The metal analysis and zzso zzso of the partial zzso zzso protein expressed in zzso coli showed that this zzso encodes an zzso zzso However this zzso activity was not inhibited by the treatment with hydrogen zzso which was expected to inhibit known zzso zzso zzso of rice zzso was detected in all zzso zzso zzso being especially abundant in zzso and strongly increased by light zzso These results suggested that this zzso encodes rice zzso which is apparently distinct from known plant zzso
