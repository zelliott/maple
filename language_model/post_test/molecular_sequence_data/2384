zzso proteins consist of a family of zzso zzso in size, which associate with zzso in zzso and are induced during zzso zzso In humans, zzso is one of the major components of the zzso zzso zzso in Alzheimer's disease zzso zzso of a zzso library prepared from bovine brain led to the isolation of several zzso clones zzso zzso proteins with different N zzso and differing by insertions or zzso suggesting differential zzso of the zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso and the repeated zzso domain of the zzso zzso proteins are recognized by zzso zzso to bovine zzso The bovine zzso proteins are highly zzso to zzso and human zzso especially within the repeated zzso zzso Compared with zzso and human zzso bovine zzso contains the zzso of three longer zzso one of which is an additional characteristic zzso zzso of zzso proteins generated by in zzso translation were used to show that these repeats represent zzso zzso two of which are sufficient to bind to zzso assembled from zzso zzso in the presence of zzso
