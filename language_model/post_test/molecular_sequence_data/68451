By zzso analysis it was found that a zzso zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso samples isolated from different zzso carrying zzso in the zzso zzso DNA zzso exhibited zzso patterns in zzso sodium zzso zzso gels markedly different from that of the zzso zzso Moreover, comparison of the zzso composition obtained by zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso detection of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and from zzso with zzso in the zzso zzso DNA zzso revealed a lack of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of this DNA zzso revealed four open reading frames zzso designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of these zzso showed a high degree of zzso to the deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso which have been shown to zzso a set of zzso responsible for conversion of zzso zzso to zzso
