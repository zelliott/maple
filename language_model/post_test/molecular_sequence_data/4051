zzso zzso from zzso zzso B zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and other zzso zzso of the zzso acts as a zzso to attack the zzso of zzso to form an zzso zzso which is subsequently zzso by a water zzso activated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we found that zzso is zzso zzso with zzso of zzso by incubation with zzso Mass zzso analyses revealed that the zzso of zzso is caused by zzso attack of zzso on the zzso intermediate to convert the zzso zzso zzso into an zzso zzso The results indicate that zzso reaches the active site of zzso without losing its zzso Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of the zzso by zzso modeling showed that the active site of the zzso is mainly composed of zzso and basic zzso which are considered to be essential for an zzso zzso to retain its zzso In a normal zzso reaction, the zzso environment is supposed to prevent zzso of the highly zzso zzso atom of the zzso and contribute to zzso recognition by the zzso Basic zzso probably play a role in zzso the zzso of the zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso is useful for characterizing the zzso environment as well as for identifying the zzso zzso
