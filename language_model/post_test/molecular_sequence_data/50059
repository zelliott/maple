zzso zzso zzso are a principal component of an effective human immune response to many zzso yet their role in zzso infection is zzso To gain a better understanding of this role, we examined plasma from patients with acute zzso zzso Here we report the detection of zzso zzso as early as 52 days after detection of zzso zzso The viral zzso activity of zzso resulted in complete replacement of zzso virus by successive populations of resistant zzso zzso virus contained zzso in the zzso gene that were unexpectedly zzso did not map generally to known zzso zzso and involved primarily changes in zzso zzso This pattern of escape, and the exceptional density of zzso envelope zzso generally, led us to zzso an evolving zzso zzso mechanism of zzso escape zzso selected changes in zzso packing prevent zzso binding but not zzso zzso zzso support for this model was obtained by zzso substitution showing that zzso zzso in zzso zzso escape from both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The evolving zzso shield thus represents a new mechanism contributing to zzso persistence in the face of an evolving zzso zzso
