The possibility of zzso zzso between copies of the long zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso was investigated by specific amplification of this region from 21 zzso zzso zzso Three copies of the zzso zzso B and zzso were demonstrated by zzso of the zzso to zzso DNA zzso with zzso and zzso When the zzso zzso was zzso with zzso two known zzso zzso were zzso one 4 zzso upstream from the zzso end of the zzso gene zzso zzso has the zzso site and zzso and C do zzso and the other 22 zzso downstream from the 3' end of the zzso gene zzso has the zzso zzso zzso differences at these sites were detected at the zzso level zzso zzso B and zzso and different combinations of these zzso were designated zzso zzso Using zzso to zzso bands from zzso gels, the zzso ratios of the separate zzso zzso were determined in each zzso zzso I zzso II zzso III zzso IV zzso V zzso and VI zzso zzso variation between the three copies of the zzso was confirmed by the detection of at least five other zzso zzso zzso using zzso analysis by zzso gel zzso zzso that were not detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso was capable of resolving zzso six to seven out of a possible nine zzso were obtained in some zzso In the isolate where seven zzso were obtained one or more further zzso zzso not detected by zzso zzso or zzso were zzso On the basis of zzso sequence zzso zzso were zzso into homogeneous zzso one zzso sequence zzso and zzso zzso or three zzso sequences zzso The transition between homogeneous and zzso zzso may be useful in studying evolutionary mechanisms between zzso zzso zzso
