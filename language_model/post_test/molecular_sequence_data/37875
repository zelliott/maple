The folding zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been measured by temperature jump zzso zzso and zzso free energies were determined as a function of temperature for both the zzso and the zzso domain, zzso which zzso the zzso zzso zzso The folding rate decreases at higher temperatures as a result of the increase in the zzso free energy for zzso zzso were obtained for zzso zzso allowing the primary features of the folding free energy surface to be zzso The results of this analysis indicate a significant shift from an zzso zzso 4) to a zzso zzso transition state with increasing zzso The zzso zzso analysis of the zzso WW domain and of its more stable zzso zzso cluster zzso reveals little participation of zzso 39 in the transition state at lower zzso As the temperature is raised, zzso interactions at the zzso interface gain importance in the transition state and the barrier height of the zzso which contains the larger zzso zzso increases more slowly than the barrier height of the zzso
