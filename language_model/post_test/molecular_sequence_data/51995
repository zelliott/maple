zzso zzso sites zzso have been proposed as a zzso zzso for comparing physical and genetic maps of the human zzso produced by a variety of zzso We have produced 44 zzso from 38 mapped zzso on human zzso zzso The zzso represent most of the zzso designated as genetic reference or ordered physical framework zzso along with a number of others chosen to span all regions of zzso Of the zzso 12 are from gene zzso including 4 from zzso of the zzso gene zzso the zzso beta protein zzso and 32 mark anonymous DNA zzso These zzso make each of the corresponding zzso readily accessible to the research community without the need for exchange of zzso These sites also represent multiple start points for the isolation of zzso clones that should permit overlapping the entire zzso 21 long arm as cloned zzso
