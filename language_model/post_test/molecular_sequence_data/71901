zzso a member of the zzso zzso protein zzso family, is a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso that binds specific DNA sequences in response to zzso The location of the zzso sites relative to the start sites of zzso suggested that the zzso promoters are analogous to class II zzso zzso In this study, we developed an in zzso zzso reporter system in zzso coli and an in zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli and from zzso zzso to study the zzso properties of zzso and the zzso interaction between zzso and zzso The ability of zzso to activate zzso zzso in zzso in zzso backgrounds suggested that zzso is sufficient to direct zzso to initiate zzso and that no other factors are zzso This hypothesis was confirmed in zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso Use of a zzso form of zzso coli zzso with alpha zzso lacking their zzso domain zzso dramatically decreased zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso in zzso which indicates that zzso plays an important role in this zzso zzso I zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso binding of zzso zzso but not zzso zzso to zzso This facilitated binding provides evidence for a direct contact between zzso and zzso of zzso during zzso of zzso zzso the zzso site in zzso suggests that zzso is similar but not identical to zzso in terms of its contact sites to the zzso at class II zzso
