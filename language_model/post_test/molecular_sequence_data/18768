A zzso study employing a zzso approach was performed on a novel zzso zzso isolated from natural gas zzso The zzso stained zzso and consisted of zzso zzso zzso zzso Products of zzso or starch zzso were ethanol, zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso fatty acids were zzso zzso and summed feature 3 zzso zzso and/or zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis demonstrated that the nearest zzso zzso of the novel strain were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso value between the novel zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined to be only zzso demonstrating the zzso of the two zzso Based on zzso zzso and zzso evidence that clearly distinguished strain zzso from zzso zzso and other close relatives, it is proposed that the novel isolate be classified as representing a novel species of a new zzso within the family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of the type species is zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso is proposed to be reclassified as zzso zzso zzso zzso
