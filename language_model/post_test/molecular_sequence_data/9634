Signaling through zzso receptors has been implicated in the control of cellular differentiation in animals ranging from zzso to zzso Starting from a human expressed sequence zzso sequence resembling that of zzso the gene for a zzso of zzso zzso zzso we assembled a full-length zzso now called human zzso from overlapping zzso zzso The full-length zzso encodes a zzso having extensive sequence zzso to zzso zzso identity and zzso zzso and even greater zzso to several putative zzso zzso zzso that have subsequently been zzso When in zzso zzso was performed, expression of the zzso zzso zzso was found to be highest in fetal zzso zzso zzso zzso root zzso and inner zzso In Northern zzso analysis of zzso from zzso of zzso mice, the zzso zzso transcript was most abundant in heart, zzso zzso skeletal muscle, brain, and zzso zzso revealed zzso of zzso and zzso within zzso and other fetal zzso zzso consistent with interaction of the two proteins in zzso zzso of zzso expressing human zzso with zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso accompanied by increased zzso and the appearance of a novel zzso zzso zzso Exposure of zzso cells to zzso led to increased amounts of zzso zzso as well as zzso for a second zzso zzso zzso and a second zzso zzso zzso zzso active forms of zzso in zzso cells also induced increased levels of the same set of zzso suggesting positive feedback control of these genes initiated by binding of zzso to zzso This feedback control may function in zzso to coordinate differentiation across certain groups of zzso cells adopting identical cell zzso
