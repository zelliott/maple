The zzso family consists of a least 8 different zzso zzso Six of these proteins are positive regulators for the zzso of carbon sources zzso and zzso in zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and two of them are involved in zzso in zzso coli and zzso zzso Based on protein zzso the members of this family exhibit a long stretch of zzso at the zzso zzso The regulators involved in the zzso of carbon sources stimulate zzso from their respectively regulated promoters only in the presence of zzso In two of the regulators, zzso at the zzso zzso alter affinity and specificity for zzso while zzso at the zzso zzso part decrease zzso of zzso from their corresponding regulated zzso It is thus probable that the variable zzso end in this family of regulators contains the motif involved in zzso recognition, while the zzso end is involved in zzso These proteins seem to be related by common ancestry and may act through similar mechanisms of positive regulation zzso through similar folding zzso
