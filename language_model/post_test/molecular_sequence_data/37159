Previous findings that the zzso virus zzso DNA zzso is required for virus DNA zzso coupled with an inability to isolate a zzso with an active site substitution in the zzso zzso were surprising, as such zzso function in DNA repair and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso To further study the role of the viral zzso we constructed zzso zzso viruses with single or double zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso site by using a zzso cell line that zzso expresses the viral zzso Although these zzso abolished zzso DNA zzso activity, they did not prevent viral DNA replication or propagation on a variety of zzso cell lines or human primary skin zzso In contrast, replication of a zzso DNA zzso deletion zzso occurred only in the zzso cell zzso zzso the zzso DNA zzso has an essential role in DNA replication that is independent of its zzso zzso Nevertheless, the conservation of the zzso site in all zzso zzso suggested an important role in zzso This idea was confirmed by the decreased zzso of zzso zzso when administered by the zzso route to zzso
