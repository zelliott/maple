zzso nuclear transport is a gated process that occurs through a central zzso element located within the pore zzso The purpose of this investigation was to identify the region of the zzso that functions as the zzso zzso the region that restricts passive diffusion of zzso through the zzso To accomplish this, small gold particles coated with zzso zzso zzso total particle diameter zzso zzso or large zzso zzso diameter zzso zzso were zzso into the zzso or zzso of zzso zzso Since zzso does not contain either nuclear import or export signals, it is assumed that the particles distribute by simple zzso The cells were fixed after 5 or 30 minutes and subsequently examined using zzso The distribution of the particles located adjacent to and within the pore complexes was then zzso The results obtained at both 5 and 30 minutes after zzso injections of small gold were basically the zzso The particles readily entered the zzso but, on the average, were approximately 11 times more concentrated in the zzso half of this zzso The opposite distribution was observed following nuclear injections, zzso the particles that were located in the zzso were approximately 7 times more numerous in the nuclear zzso Our data indicate that there is a single transport gate located in the central domain of the zzso that restricts passive zzso The large particles that were injected into the zzso migrated to the surface of the pore complex, but entered the zzso less frequently than small zzso Interestingly, the diffusion of large zzso to the surface of the pores following nuclear injection was greatly zzso however, this was not the case for similar size particles that were coated with protein containing nuclear export signals zzso The latter results suggest that the zzso is not only required for zzso but also for migration within the zzso
