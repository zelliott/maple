zzso is a property of all zzso zzso zzso although the factors which facilitate infection of the zzso are not zzso We previously showed that zzso zzso which lack expression of an accessory zzso zzso zzso had lost zzso indicating that this protein may be involved in promoting zzso zzso The zzso were located in the zzso consensus sequence of the initiation zzso for this zzso Here it is shown that shortly after zzso of mice with one of these zzso zzso zzso emerged which had regained expression of zzso gag and had also regained the zzso and zzso exhibited by the zzso zzso The zzso zzso retained the zzso in the zzso consensus sequence but exhibited a zzso zzso 12 zzso downstream from the zzso start site, creating a new initiation zzso and a zzso gag zzso which was truncated at its zzso Using zzso specific for zzso gag it is shown that the frequency of zzso infectious centers expressing zzso virus increased progressively during the 2 months following zzso of zzso virus until zzso or zzso 50% of the zzso cells in the zzso expressed zzso zzso In contrast, although zzso zzso were zzso at low frequency after zzso passage in zzso in zzso zzso zzso there was no evidence for zzso These results indicate that zzso gag zzso virus spread within the zzso and to zzso sites, such as the zzso and suggest that the protein may function through its interaction with the zzso
