The cabbage butterflies zzso zzso and zzso zzso have unique zzso named zzso and zzso respectively, that catalyze the zzso of zzso zzso of DNA, which has been linked with induction of zzso and zzso in zzso cell zzso In the present study, we identified zzso activity targeting DNA in six kinds of edible zzso Similar to our observations with zzso and zzso crude extracts from the clams zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso incubated with calf zzso DNA and zzso resulted in production of zzso The DNA zzso protein in the hard clam zzso zzso designated as zzso was zzso by column zzso and its zzso was zzso The zzso encodes a zzso protein with a calculated molecular mass of zzso The protein zzso in zzso from the zzso in a zzso zzso exhibited the same zzso activity as that of zzso zzso Neither the zzso nor the deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed zzso with zzso or zzso However, a zzso acid zzso zzso at the putative zzso site, zzso in all zzso was found in zzso and replacement of zzso acid for this zzso acid resulted in loss of almost all zzso zzso zzso in the culture medium showed no zzso against zzso and zzso zzso however, introduction of this protein by zzso induced zzso in these zzso The finding of clam zzso protein targeting zzso zzso in DNA could offer new insights into the biological significance of zzso of zzso
