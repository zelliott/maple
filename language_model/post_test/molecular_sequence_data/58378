The zzso zzso is an important zzso zzso transport zzso zzso studies of the effects of removal of external zzso on airway smooth muscle tone, and studies of zzso zzso zzso in membrane zzso have provided indirect evidence of an important role for zzso exchange in regulating airway smooth muscle zzso Recent molecular studies have identified seven zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene in other zzso but direct molecular characterization of the airway smooth muscle zzso zzso has not previously been zzso We have therefore used a reverse zzso chain zzso reaction method and DNA sequencing to study the zzso zzso zzso present in human airway smooth zzso The dominant zzso was found to be virtually identical to the zzso zzso originally described in rabbit kidney zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso zzso zzso B that we obtained is previously unpublished for any human zzso This study provides the first definitive molecular evidence of the existence of an zzso zzso in airway smooth zzso The molecular characterization of the human airway smooth muscle zzso zzso will facilitate future zzso studies of its zzso
