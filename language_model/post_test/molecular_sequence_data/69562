We demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso which encodes a neural small zzso zzso is a member of the most prodigious family of zzso repetitive DNA and that its product represents an example of a zzso zzso zzso zzso III zzso The zzso zzso gene is an early zzso member and one of the few zzso zzso active zzso sequences in this family of nearly half a million zzso amplified elements dispersed throughout the human zzso Furthermore, the isolation of two zzso zzso beta and zzso zzso demonstrates the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso beta zzso may have been generated by a zzso event after the zzso zzso resulting in an exchange of the left arm of a zzso zzso element with the zzso zzso coding zzso Our data on zzso features of the active zzso alpha gene suggest that its zzso product has been zzso into a function of the zzso brain and provides a selective advantage to the zzso
