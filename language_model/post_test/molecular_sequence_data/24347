zzso double zzso of zzso were produced containing a reference zzso at position 65, at the zzso termination of zzso zzso and a second zzso in the sequence of zzso zzso which includes the zzso termination of zzso zzso and nearly the entire surface zzso zzso zzso zzso interactions between the spins are analyzed to provide zzso distance zzso in both the dark and zzso states of zzso The zzso apparently resulting from the zzso flexibility of the side zzso are found to be consistent with the structural model of zzso in the dark state derived from zzso zzso of the zzso triggers an increase in distance between zzso in zzso but not those in zzso relative to the reference at position 65 in zzso The simplest interpretation of the result is a movement of the zzso portion of zzso away from zzso by 2-4 zzso
