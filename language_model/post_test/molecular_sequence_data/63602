zzso channels are zzso both in terms of their function and their molecular zzso zzso zzso were first described in zzso There are three zzso zzso which are members of the zzso zzso They are involved in zzso firing patterns as well as control of the cardiac action potential zzso 

Here, we report the zzso and pharmacological characterization of zzso which is the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso which in zzso is involved in action potential zzso and gives rise to zzso zzso zzso currents involved in zzso signal zzso 

We demonstrate that zzso has similar functional and pharmacological characteristics compared to zzso and it is similarly regulated by pharmacological agents and by the zzso accessory zzso zzso
