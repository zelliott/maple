A high affinity zzso zzso factor zzso binding site has been identified and characterized at zzso base pairs zzso in the zzso human zzso zzso zzso zzso The affinity of the zzso zzso binding site was approximately zzso greater than a consensus zzso zzso zzso present at zzso zzso in the mouse zzso zzso promoter, and approximately zzso greater than the zzso site present at zzso zzso in the human zzso zzso zzso zzso interference zzso have identified both zzso and 3' zzso zzso which flank the core zzso zzso sequence and interfere with zzso binding when chemically zzso Introduction of zzso in either zzso or 3' zzso zzso sequences lowered the affinity of zzso binding below the level observed with the zzso zzso zzso zzso A double zzso in both zzso AT regions, however, greatly reduced the affinity of this site to levels similar to that observed with the mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso An additional nuclear zzso factor, zzso has been shown to bind to a functional zzso box motif located at zzso zzso in the zzso promoter using specific zzso zzso The observation of high affinity zzso and zzso binding sites in a region of the zzso zzso promoter which is necessary for high levels of zzso zzso suggests that these sites with their associated proteins play important functional roles in the zzso zzso of the zzso promoter during zzso zzso
