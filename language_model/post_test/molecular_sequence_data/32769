The two peptides zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso G zzso were changed by zzso zzso zzso into the corresponding peptides zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 1071 zzso and the zzso and zzso of the various hybrid zzso were zzso Both zzso and, to a lesser extent, zzso were active against all the tested zzso zzso but only zzso was active against the tested zzso zzso The two zzso thus differed in their relative zzso to various target cells, despite their sequence zzso The hybrid combination zzso had low potency against all strains tested, indicating that these two peptides do not interact zzso The zzso hybrid combination zzso zzso in contrast, was highly zzso indicating that these two peptides may form a functional zzso zzso In fact, this hybrid combination zzso was more potent against zzso strains than zzso zzso was zzso zzso but it was inactive against zzso strains (in contrast to zzso but similar to zzso The observation that zzso is more active against zzso in combination with zzso and more active against zzso in combination with zzso suggests that the beta zzso is an important zzso of target cell zzso Especially the zzso zzso of the beta zzso seem to be important for zzso since zzso combined with an zzso zzso with zzso zzso at positions 1 to 4, 7, 9, and 10 was zzso less active against zzso strains but one to four times more active against zzso strains than zzso Moreover, zzso zzso zzso in the region spanning zzso 1 to 7 in zzso had a more zzso effect on the activity against zzso than on that against zzso zzso Of the zzso zzso made in the zzso region of the alpha zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso influenced zzso as zzso the zzso zzso had no effect on activity against tested zzso strains but increased the activity zzso to zzso against the tested zzso zzso and the zzso zzso reduced the activity zzso and only approximately zzso against zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the zzso peptides zzso 20 to 39 and 25 to 35 in zzso and zzso zzso to those found in the corresponding zzso peptides did not have a marked effect on the activity, but there was an approximately zzso or greater reduction in the activity upon also introducing zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 8 to 19 and 9 to 24 in zzso and zzso zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso zzso in an zzso hybrid zzso was more zzso when the altered zzso was combined with zzso zzso zzso than when it was combined with zzso ( approximately zzso zzso suggesting that zzso 19 and 20 (which are part of a zzso zzso in the beta zzso may be involved in a specific interaction with the zzso alpha zzso It is also noteworthy that the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso reduced the activity only approximately zzso suggesting that the first seven zzso in the beta peptides do not form an zzso
