The functional importance of each zzso acid zzso making up the zzso zzso of three different zzso interactions was determined using complete series of substitution zzso of the three zzso synthetic zzso zzso substitution profiles for the three different zzso zzso were obtained separately by direct and competitive zzso Competitive zzso was found to offer the advantage of being able to measure the zzso of each zzso substitution analog necessary to inhibit zzso binding to the original zzso In this manner, the relative functional contribution to zzso binding of each zzso acid zzso making up the zzso zzso was determined and termed the relative zzso importance factor zzso Each zzso zzso was found to contain one very highly specific zzso zzso highest zzso that was, on average, the least zzso with any of the natural zzso acids (the average decrease in recognition ranged 250- to zzso At the other extreme, two or three positions in each zzso zzso were found to be only zzso involved in zzso These positions were considered redundant since the average decrease in recognition of the substitution zzso for these positions was found to be zzso or zzso The remaining zzso zzso zzso exhibited the fine specificity common to zzso interactions in that only relatively conservative zzso for these zzso were recognized by their respective zzso It is of interest that the zzso arrangement of specific and zzso zzso were different for each of the three zzso zzso zzso
