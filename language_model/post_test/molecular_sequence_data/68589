The abundant zzso zzso and zzso (over zzso zzso constitute the major class of proteins in forming zzso zzso zzso These are thought to play a major role in the structural organization and zzso of developing zzso The present report describes the successful sequencing of the major human zzso zzso by use of both zzso degradation and zzso zzso When zzso degradation was used, over zzso of the primary structure of the protein was zzso This sequence was supplemented with zzso sequencing studies, which revealed the predicted sequence of this zzso Together, they provide the complete sequence of an important human zzso zzso The information zzso recent studies on bovine and human zzso zzso A comparison between the present results and the protein sequences predicted from the corresponding human zzso zzso coding regions and that of zzso sequences of other species is zzso
