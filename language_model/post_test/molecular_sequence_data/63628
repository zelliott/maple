Although the nuclear zzso zzso gene expression is critical to the induction of an efficient immune response to infection or tissue injury, excessive or prolonged zzso zzso can contribute to the development of several inflammatory zzso zzso the zzso signal zzso zzso is tightly regulated by several zzso zzso We have previously identified zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso as an zzso zzso protein in zzso that zzso regulates zzso zzso in response to zzso necrosis factor zzso and zzso Here we report that zzso expression is also zzso upon zzso treatment of zzso and other zzso cell zzso We also found a significantly enhanced expression of zzso in zzso of zzso patients, which is restored to control levels by zzso To further understand the zzso regulation of zzso zzso we isolated the human zzso promoter and investigated its zzso in response to zzso and zzso This revealed that the zzso and zzso expression of zzso is dependent on the binding of zzso to a specific B site in the zzso zzso Altogether, these data indicate an important role for zzso gene expression of zzso in the negative feedback regulation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso 4 induced zzso zzso
