The zzso zzso zzso zzso is white flowering due to a genetic block in the zzso zzso The introduction of the zzso A1 zzso under the control of the zzso zzso zzso promoter leads to the production of zzso zzso resulting in a brick red flower zzso Among the transgenic zzso plants the pigmentation of the petals exhibited different expression patterns which could be zzso into the zzso the zzso and the 'white' zzso This system proved to be especially suitable for the investigation of gene expression by simply looking at the pigmentation pattern of the zzso The uniformity of floral zzso pigmentation is zzso correlated with the number of integrated A1 zzso Furthermore, a correlation was found between the zzso status of the zzso zzso promoter and the instability of the floral zzso zzso The status of promoter zzso controlling the expression of the A1 gene seems to be influenced by the copy number and the zzso position of the transferred zzso
