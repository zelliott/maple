The zzso gene of zzso coli coding for the zzso protein zzso was inserted into the zzso zzso under the control of a zzso zzso The resulted zzso was used for zzso preparation in zzso The zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed a strong zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking zzso were inactive in the zzso initiation complex zzso addition of the free zzso restored zzso ability to bind zzso a zzso excess of the free zzso over zzso was zzso The secondary structure of the zzso zzso in the vicinity of the initiation zzso was zzso with the use of specific zzso Basing on the experimental data obtained we suggest a model for the structural zzso of the zzso zzso translation initiation zzso
