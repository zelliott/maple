zzso and zzso fatty acids are present in organisms in zzso forms that serve as cell membrane constituents and storage zzso A large number of organisms are known to accumulate zzso materials as a source of energy and zzso We found a zzso designated zzso that zzso accumulates free fatty acids zzso as zzso droplets without exhibiting zzso zzso is an obligatory zzso zzso zzso acid zzso that was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that zzso is affiliated with the family zzso in the zzso zzso but is zzso related to type species in this family (less than zzso similarity in zzso zzso gene zzso zzso fatty acids with carbon chain lengths of 14, 16, 18, and 20 were produced from zzso under stress conditions, including zzso temperatures and the presence of organic zzso that affect cell membrane zzso zzso were produced at levels corresponding to up to zzso zzso of the dry cell zzso Our data suggest that zzso zzso is a result of an imbalance between excess membrane fatty acid zzso due to zzso adaptation and limited zzso activity due to zzso growth involving zzso acid zzso zzso droplets were not further zzso as an energy and carbon source, even under conditions of zzso A naturally occurring zzso that accumulates significant amounts of zzso zzso with zzso would provide useful strategies for microbial zzso zzso
