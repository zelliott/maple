zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by means of the zzso transport system, which is zzso by zzso genes located on the zzso zzso Analysis of these genes using zzso zzso zzso revealed three zzso groups within a zzso zzso zzso The sequence of this zzso and the sites of zzso zzso were zzso Three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as the only three zzso frames in locations consistent with the zzso zzso The zzso gene is preceded by the sequence zzso which is characteristic of promoters requiring the zzso protein for zzso The zzso protein is highly zzso and contains eight potential zzso zzso indicating that it is probably the structural component of the transport system responsible for movement of zzso from the zzso across the inner zzso The zzso and zzso genes are transcribed in the opposite direction to zzso They zzso proteins with zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transport proteins regulating expression of zzso and to other proteins zzso zzso regulatory zzso The zzso protein includes a putative zzso zzso domain that senses the presence of zzso and a zzso zzso domain that activates the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso protein shows zzso to several zzso zzso indicating that it is probably the domain which binds DNA in the zzso promoter region to regulate zzso zzso All the zzso zzso zzso altered in zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by the zzso region from zzso zzso zzso zzso
