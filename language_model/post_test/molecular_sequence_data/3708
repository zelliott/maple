A wide spectrum of soil zzso nitrogen compounds are potential nutrients for zzso Here, it is shown that zzso plants are able to use zzso as sole nitrogen zzso By functional zzso of a zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), was zzso zzso belongs to a novel zzso of plant membrane proteins with five open reading frames in zzso zzso 64 to zzso UPS proteins have 10 putative zzso zzso with a large zzso central domain containing a zzso zzso zzso Transport of zzso zzso by zzso in zzso exhibited zzso zzso zzso approximately 52 zzso was dependent on zzso and a zzso zzso and was zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso besides zzso but not zzso zzso are zzso in zzso transport by zzso as demonstrated by expression in zzso zzso zzso In plants, zzso gene expression was dependent on the nitrogen zzso zzso zzso presumably is involved in the zzso of zzso and other zzso degradation products when primary sources are zzso
