The zzso alien gene is highly zzso to the human zzso zzso interacting zzso zzso which is a component of the recently identified zzso protein zzso We identified the mouse zzso of zzso alien through zzso searches of the zzso zzso We found that the mouse zzso encodes a predicted zzso zzso which zzso at approximately 50 zzso The gene for the mouse alien zzso named zzso includes 12 coding zzso spanning approximately 30 zzso of zzso DNA on the central portion of mouse zzso zzso Mouse zzso is widely expressed in zzso zzso and adult zzso beginning as early as zzso Mouse zzso zzso zzso to two zzso bands in all zzso at approximately zzso and approximately 4 zzso with an additional approximately zzso band in zzso zzso of native and zzso zzso proteins localized the mouse zzso protein in both the zzso and the nucleus, with larger amounts in the nucleus in some zzso
