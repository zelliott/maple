The zzso coli zzso gene product is required for normal export of envelope proteins out of the cell zzso In this report, we present the identification and zzso sequence of the zzso coding zzso The zzso structural gene zzso almost completely with a predicted open reading frame zzso that is zzso on the opposite zzso To establish the identity of the zzso ORF, we characterized a zzso zzso that caused total loss of zzso function, based upon its zzso This zzso resulted from a zzso change that caused an zzso zzso in one zzso (the zzso zzso and a silent (no zzso acid zzso zzso change in the opposite zzso
