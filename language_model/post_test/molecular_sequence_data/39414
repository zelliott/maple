The zzso zzso nuclear zzso is a major element of the zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso Its zzso part has weak zzso to the zzso zzso and binds to zzso DNA zzso We have investigated the zzso and dynamics of the zzso 101 zzso acid zzso of zzso in the absence and in the presence of zzso DNA by solution zzso zzso In the absence of DNA, zzso is unfolded and highly flexible throughout the entire zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso the formation of a zzso structure for zzso zzso to zzso This structure consists of four zzso forming a zzso motif that differs from zzso but has similarities to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain, and the human zzso zzso The zzso DNA recognition can be explained by specific major groove hydrogen bonds from the zzso end of zzso zzso The transition from a highly flexible, completely unfolded zzso in the absence of DNA to a zzso structure in the complex presents a very extreme case of the zzso of binding and zzso zzso
