Members of the tumor necrosis factor zzso zzso zzso are important for cell growth and zzso In addition to providing zzso signals for cell zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso can result in programmed cell death or zzso The underlying mechanism requires an intact zzso stretch present in the zzso tails of both zzso and zzso termed the death domain zzso Here we show that zzso a member of the zzso family, expressed on discrete zzso of T and B cells and known to provide zzso signals for T and B cell proliferation and B cell zzso production, can also induce zzso zzso of surface zzso receptors along with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Unlike zzso and zzso the zzso tail of zzso is relatively short and lacks the zzso Using the zzso zzso system, we have cloned a novel protein zzso that binds to the zzso zzso zzso It has a zzso zzso region, a zzso ring finger, and a zinc zzso zzso zzso of zzso in various cell lines zzso zzso suggesting an important role for zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
