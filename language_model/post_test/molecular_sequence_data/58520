zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Previous studies from our laboratory demonstrated that unlike the parental zzso zzso zzso can zzso rat brain zzso zzso cells efficiently and that it has acquired genetic changes responsible for its expanded cellular zzso To determine if zzso zzso also has expanded its host range, we tested its zzso on Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, which are generally resistant to zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso zzso but not zzso was highly infectious for zzso zzso Studies using zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso cells, as well as interference studies, suggested that zzso zzso has acquired the ability to interact with the zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells that has undergone zzso zzso Using zzso viruses between zzso zzso and zzso we were able to zzso the viral genetic element crucial for zzso cell zzso within the zzso gene of zzso zzso and show that zzso at position 116 and zzso at position 129 of the envelope zzso zzso were zzso These viral zzso also appear to zzso zzso for other zzso cells resistant to ordinary zzso zzso Further studies on the interaction between zzso zzso and the zzso on zzso cells may provide novel insights into the molecular mechanisms for zzso recognition and binding by viral envelope zzso
