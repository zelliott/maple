The protein components of highly zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso contents from rat zzso zzso were characterized by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso with zzso protein zzso zzso zzso acid sequence was obtained for a approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso present only in zzso membrane preparations where it was resistant to washing with zzso and zzso The sequence of this protein showed zzso to pancreatic zzso but was distinct from the zzso sequence of a zzso content protein presumed to be zzso zzso zzso chain reaction amplification with zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso gave partial length zzso that were used to isolate clones from a rat zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing of full-length zzso of zzso revealed the predicted zzso acid sequence for a mature protein of zzso zzso acids with a potential zzso zzso site and a zzso molecular weight of zzso The zzso sequence possesses the zzso zzso consensus sequence zzso centered around zzso and the zzso state zzso zzso characteristic of pancreatic zzso Northern zzso analysis of various rat zzso showed zzso expression solely in zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso along with pancreatic zzso of various species including zzso shows extensive zzso to both proteins and reveals an underlying diversity in the pancreatic zzso zzso Close zzso is observed between zzso and a zzso zzso previously isolated from mouse zzso T zzso
