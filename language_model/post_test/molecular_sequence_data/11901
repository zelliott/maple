zzso T cells specific for zzso basic protein zzso are implicated in the zzso of multiple zzso The mechanism by which zzso T cells are regulated in zzso remains unknown, but is thought to involve the zzso regulatory network that can be induced by zzso with attenuated T cells and zzso zzso We reported previously that zzso of multiple sclerosis patients with zzso zzso T cells zzso cell zzso induced T cell responses to the zzso zzso resulting in a zzso depletion of circulating zzso T zzso In this study, we demonstrated that in the majority of the recipients, zzso T cells remained zzso in circulation over a period of 1 to 3 zzso after zzso while they zzso in some individuals (three of zzso coinciding with clinical zzso The zzso zzso T cells were found to originate from zzso origins different from those of T cells zzso before zzso suggesting a shift of the T cell repertoire to other zzso of zzso The zzso zzso predominantly zzso regulatory T cells capable of zzso the zzso clones in a zzso zzso The T cell responses induced by zzso were restricted to the zzso clones and did not affect zzso clones not used for zzso Our data further suggest that different zzso regions of the zzso may be involved in the observed zzso zzso This study provides useful information for designing future clinical trials using T cell vaccination and other zzso therapeutic zzso
