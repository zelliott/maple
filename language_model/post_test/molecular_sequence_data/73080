zzso zzso including zzso zzso are a zzso of zzso The toxic action of zzso E1 is derived from its ability to form a zzso channel, which causes zzso of the zzso membrane of sensitive zzso coli zzso In this process, the zzso zzso E1 zzso must undergo a substantial structural transition from a soluble state, in which it binds the target cell, to a zzso zzso Details of the structural changes that accompany this conversion may be directly zzso to other zzso zzso as well as to the mechanism by which proteins insert into or cross zzso 

The structure of the zzso zzso domain of zzso E1 in its soluble form has been solved at zzso A zzso This structure contains zzso zzso arranged in three layers zzso with a central zzso zzso hairpin in layer B, which is proposed to anchor the zzso form in the zzso The extended zzso zzso I provides a connection to the rest of the zzso E1 zzso and the loop zzso may act as a hinge for zzso of the domain for membrane zzso A set of zzso positively charged zzso on layer C may provide the zzso surface on the zzso for membrane zzso A large internal cavity between layers B and C may allow these layers to zzso suggesting a mechanism for unfolding the zzso on the membrane that involves the zzso of the zzso zzso interactions in layer zzso 

On the basis of the structure of the zzso E1 zzso domain, its comparison with the structure of the zzso A domain and the known requirement for initial zzso and subsequent zzso zzso molecular details of the zzso unfolding and zzso of the zzso domain into the membrane are zzso The model for zzso and initial interaction with the membrane positions the zzso hairpin zzso approximately parallel to the membrane zzso zzso interactions in the zzso layer may then be displaced by interactions with the zzso spreading the zzso on the surface and exposing the zzso hairpin for zzso into the zzso
