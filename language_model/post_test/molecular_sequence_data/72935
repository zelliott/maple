The zzso drug zzso is thought to bind to zzso zzso receptors of zzso It is possible that resistance to this drug is associated with either a change in binding characteristics or a reduction in the number of zzso zzso zzso zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso resistance in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied by zzso and zzso zzso clones zzso a putative zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of two susceptible and one zzso resistant zzso zzso is related to zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene associated with zzso resistance in zzso zzso Although extensive sequence analyses of zzso sequences revealed zzso at zzso acid level, no association with zzso resistance could be zzso zzso zzso length zzso analyses confirmed that, although zzso was zzso no selection of a specific zzso of zzso has taken place during selection for zzso resistance in various zzso resistant zzso
