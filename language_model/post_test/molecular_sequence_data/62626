In zzso the Toll zzso establishes the embryonic zzso axis and triggers innate immune responses to zzso The zzso zzso Toll acts through three death zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the adapters zzso and zzso in signaling to downstream zzso zzso zzso Here, we delineate the critical events in the earliest stages of Toll zzso zzso studies based on structural modeling reveal that the direct interaction of the zzso zzso death domain with zzso is critical for signaling in zzso The complex of zzso and zzso forms prior to signaling and is localized to the embryonic plasma membrane by zzso Upon Toll zzso this complex is rapidly recruited to zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso complex promotes zzso zzso leading to degradation of the zzso zzso zzso Together, these experiments convert a linear picture of gene function into a dynamic zzso and structural understanding of signaling complex assembly and zzso
