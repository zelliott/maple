In the course of transient expression studies undertaken to determine the location of the mouse zzso gene promoter, two additional promoter activities were detected within 600 zzso upstream of the zzso One activity directs zzso in the same direction as zzso but fails to transcribe the zzso reporter gene due to an apparent zzso element lying between it and the zzso The second activity directs zzso opposite to that of the zzso zzso Northern zzso with a probe consisting of zzso zzso to zzso relative to the site of zzso zzso initiation revealed zzso species of 4 zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso from mouse zzso but not from any other zzso Similar zzso species were detected in zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso cells and several long-term zzso lines but not from the zzso or zzso zzso lines or the zzso zzso The zzso species were most abundant in cells of a secondary mixed zzso culture which were greater than zzso zzso Northern zzso using zzso zzso zzso indicated that these zzso represent zzso opposite to the zzso zzso The tissue and cell type distribution of this zzso gene zzso Bop for zzso zzso are consistent with zzso and possibly zzso zzso zzso The head-to-head arrangement of the Bop and zzso genes is reminiscent of the arrangement of the zzso and zzso zzso and the expression of the Bop gene in zzso cells raises the possibility that these genes are involved in the same functional zzso
