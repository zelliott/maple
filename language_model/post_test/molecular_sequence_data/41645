zzso zzso Z is involved in the maturation of the 3' ends of transfer zzso zzso in all three zzso of zzso To prevent futile cycles of zzso addition and zzso zzso zzso Z discriminates against mature zzso bearing a zzso zzso with the first zzso zzso zzso being the key zzso Here, we show that, zzso the zzso zzso does not discriminate against zzso in position 74, but rather is highly zzso by zzso in this zzso zzso with this zzso the vast majority of zzso zzso precursor zzso of zzso Z naturally contain zzso Those zzso precursors with a zzso further downstream are also zzso for zzso zzso but are matured in a zzso zzso zzso We solved the first crystal structure of zzso zzso Z bound to a zzso precursor with zzso and show that the zzso has a specific binding pocket for this zzso
