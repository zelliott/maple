Previous work established that the principal zzso factor zzso of virulent zzso zzso a member of the zzso tuberculosis complex, restores zzso to an attenuated strain containing a point zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso We used the zzso domain of zzso as bait in a zzso zzso screen of an zzso tuberculosis zzso library and identified a putative zzso factor, zzso which selectively interacts with the zzso domain of zzso in virulent strains but not with the zzso zzso zzso zzso of mice and guinea pigs with a zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso deletion zzso strain showed that zzso is not necessary for in zzso bacterial replication in either animal zzso In contrast, an zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso was completely attenuated for growth in guinea zzso However, we found that zzso mice infected with the zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso zzso strain had significantly longer mean survival times as compared with mice challenged with zzso zzso zzso zzso the bacterial organ burdens of both zzso and zzso infected mice were identical during the acute and persistent zzso of zzso Our results imply that zzso tuberculosis replication per zzso is not a sufficient condition for zzso in zzso They also indicate a different role for zzso zzso and zzso tuberculosis zzso genes in zzso generated in different animal zzso We propose that zzso tuberculosis zzso functions as a zzso factor regulating genes that influence the immune response of the zzso
