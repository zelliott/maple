zzso zinc finger proteins have various roles in zzso zzso We here zzso the functional relevance of two such proteins from zzso zzso zzso and zzso Each protein has a single zzso motif very similar to those seen in zzso proteins that regulate zzso zzso zzso is expressed in zzso form zzso at low zzso It is zzso zzso and not required for normal growth of cultured zzso zzso zzso interference targeting zzso on a zzso zzso background, also had no effect on zzso zzso growth, but zzso of zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso zzso affinity zzso of both proteins revealed various interesting potential zzso specificity was assessed against a list of proteins that were found in 24 other pull-down experiments, which is zzso The conservation of zzso in all zzso and zzso in zzso suggests that the two proteins may be required for optimal growth at some stage of the zzso zzso
