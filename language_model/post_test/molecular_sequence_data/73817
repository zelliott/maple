The zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso cells zzso a zzso protein in the cell zzso The gene zzso this protein was cloned and zzso and found to be zzso zzso to zzso and zzso and the putative protein to have a zzso sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains the zzso acid zzso sequence zzso which zzso to the consensus sequence for bacterial zzso modification and zzso zzso associated with the zzso phase when separated with zzso zzso confirming that it is a zzso When the putative site of zzso the zzso in the sequence zzso was zzso with zzso the zzso zzso associated with the zzso zzso The cloned gene was used to determine the distribution of zzso in various zzso zzso The gene was present in the zzso tuberculosis zzso complex organisms, as well as in zzso zzso In addition, Southern zzso analysis of zzso and Mt DNA indicated that the zzso and zzso genes are located close to each other on the zzso Western zzso analysis of cell zzso of various zzso species indicated that only Mt zzso and zzso produced proteins which reacted with zzso Furthermore, only two out of six of the zzso field zzso produced zzso zzso indicating that expression of the zzso gene is variable within the Mt complex zzso
