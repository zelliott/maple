zzso zzso zzso is an zzso target of high pharmaceutical interest because of its essential role in zzso zzso acid zzso from cell surface zzso and zzso release of zzso from infected zzso The present paper describes the use of structural information in the progressive design from a lead binding zzso (a zzso to a potent zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso information derived from the X-ray structure of an zzso zzso with several zzso zzso in combination with results derived from affinity zzso and molecular zzso studies, was used to guide design of potent zzso zzso zzso These zzso are structural fragments of the zzso zzso dye zzso Blue zzso and represent novel lead scaffolds for designing zzso zzso for influenza zzso
