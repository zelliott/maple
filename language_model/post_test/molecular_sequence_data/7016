zzso infection results in zzso zzso of the cellular zzso zzso genes zzso independent of the zzso action of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by virus appears to be zzso through production of viral zzso zzso zzso Previously, we identified two novel zzso factors zzso that bind to the zzso response element zzso the DNA sequence that mediates zzso zzso by zzso In this report we define sequences that flank the classical zzso to be necessary for zzso zzso More significantly, it is shown that the sequences required to bind zzso correlate with the ability to mediate zzso induction by zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is a positive regulator of zzso zzso zzso is shown to bind selectively to the promoters of those zzso which are strongly induced by viral infection, again suggesting the functional significance of this zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso and zzso share a common zzso zzso of approximately 70 zzso which is referred to as the zzso binding component zzso zzso is shown to zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso with this zzso both zzso and zzso are activated in the zzso prior to nuclear zzso
