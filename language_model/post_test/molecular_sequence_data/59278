We isolated and zzso zzso and zzso clones of the guinea pig zzso zzso zzso The sequence of zzso zzso was deduced from a combination of zzso and zzso zzso The primary structure of two coding zzso was derived from a zzso clone and zzso and 3' untranslated sequences were obtained using rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The predicted zzso of zzso zzso zzso well with the size of transcripts in Northern zzso analyses of zzso from different brain zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of guinea pig zzso shares zzso zzso and zzso identity to zzso human, and rat zzso zzso The zzso untranslated sequences of guinea pig zzso and adrenal zzso zzso are zzso both contain sequences of zzso I and, like zzso zzso lack an zzso zzso zzso present in human and rat zzso zzso solution zzso zzso protection analysis of total zzso from selected guinea pig brain regions was zzso The nucleus zzso was found to have the greatest abundance of zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso amygdala, frontal cortex, zzso bulb, and zzso
