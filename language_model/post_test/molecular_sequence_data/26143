We have adapted the zzso chain reaction zzso to a zzso zzso zzso target without possessing zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso disease virus of zzso a member of the zzso group, has a zzso zzso which is resistant to zzso and subsequent zzso zzso The only published sequence information was for a strain of virus unavailable to zzso We have used a quick primer binding zzso to select appropriate zzso and have combined a simple zzso method with reverse zzso and subsequent zzso using the zzso template to yield amplified product easily zzso by zzso zzso zzso By varying the times of zzso zzso and zzso and by reducing the total number of amplification cycles, artifacts have been eliminated when using zzso zzso as the zzso This allowed us to obtain partial sequence information for one viral zzso We have enhanced the utility of our method by zzso a rapid cell zzso and zzso zzso protocol such that no zzso steps are required from initial tissue handling through final zzso zzso Total time for all procedures involved no more than 6 zzso This technique should be zzso to all other members of the zzso family and to any other species of zzso
