A new repetitive DNA region was identified in the zzso zzso of human zzso namely a long zzso zzso sequence motif zzso zzso was present in two zzso The repeating unit composed of two zzso One of them consisted of unique zzso zzso interrupted by some simple zzso The other, about zzso zzso long one assembled only from highly repeated simple zzso The unique sequence region contained two, zzso copies of the human zzso type repetitive DNA zzso The authors suggest that the zzso elements may flank the tandem zzso of human zzso genes as terminal repeats and they might function both as the origin of zzso replication and/or site of zzso zzso
