Although very little, if any, zzso activity is detected in zzso zzso by a standard Miller zzso we found that zzso zzso zzso cells formed blue colonies on plates containing zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso databases revealed the presence of zzso sequences highly zzso to zzso coli zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a zzso zzso protein with zzso identity and zzso similarity to zzso from zzso zzso A deletion in the zzso zzso zzso gene caused the formation of white colonies on zzso plates and zzso activity was at background levels in the zzso zzso while the zzso strain expressed about 190 Miller zzso The zzso zzso zzso promoter was not regulated by zzso or zzso Finally, zzso of zzso by zzso zzso may be zzso
