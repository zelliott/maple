A novel zzso zzso strain was isolated and identified as zzso zzso zzso based on its zzso and internal transcribed zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso using a zzso zzso by gel zzso The relative molecular mass of zzso by sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso was 65 zzso and by size exclusion zzso was 66 zzso indicating that the zzso is a zzso in zzso The pH and temperature zzso for zzso were zzso and 60 zzso zzso zzso zzso had the highest zzso efficiency with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso unlike that reported for any zzso zzso highlighting the significance of the current zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso showed zzso with zzso from the zzso zzso family zzso The addition of zzso to a zzso zzso hydrolysate reaction containing a commercial zzso mixture zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed a zzso effect on reducing sugar zzso zzso is a good candidate for applications that convert zzso biomass to zzso and zzso
