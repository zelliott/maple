This study describes the nascent zzso protein of the pea zzso zzso zzso The protein has been identified by zzso zzso of the zzso active zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso DNA as zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or the isolated zzso under conditions zzso for zzso zzso nascent zzso transcripts (up to 250 zzso in zzso to a 48 zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso protein is dependent on zzso zzso is zzso after about 30 zzso of zzso and is completely dependent on zzso zzso no zzso has been observed with zzso zzso zzso is influenced by zzso and zzso in accordance with their effects on zzso The zzso is composed of protein and zzso zzso and can be zzso by several zzso However, the zzso transcript is protected from zzso until the protein is zzso zzso enhances zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and this is paralleled by an increase in total zzso activity of zzso This protein was isolated by zzso zzso gel zzso and the sequence of 15 zzso acid zzso at the zzso zzso was zzso The nascent zzso protein appears to be involved in the zzso of all three classes of zzso zzso We also found a zzso of identical molecular weight to get zzso to nascent transcripts in zzso isolated from other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
