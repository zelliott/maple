The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes at least one zzso protein involved in the expression of zzso Two open reading frames designated zzso and zzso code for zzso of 7 and 60 zzso zzso respectively, that can be zzso after expression in zzso coli zzso To determine which zzso sequences are required for zzso a strain deleted for the entire locus zzso zzso delta zzso was constructed and tested for the ability to be zzso by zzso with and without zzso zzso in the zzso zzso One zzso containing only zzso and zzso as well as upstream promoter sequences was sufficient to restore full zzso on the host plant zzso zzso However, some other zzso locus representing a host range zzso appeared to be deleted from strain zzso delta zzso since zzso and zzso were not sufficient to fully restore zzso on wounded tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso with specific zzso in either zzso or zzso were impaired for zzso of zzso delta zzso Several zzso specific for the zzso zzso locus appeared to have a polar effect on expression of the zzso zzso zzso However, zzso fusion zzso suggest that this effect is not at the level of zzso or zzso zzso these data indicate that both the 7- and the zzso zzso are zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso and suggest that the zzso protein may be less stable in the absence of the zzso zzso
