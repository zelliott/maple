zzso zzso zzso and S zzso is a cell zzso protein mainly localized in the zzso and apparently associated with the zzso zzso is able to zzso levels and activity of the zzso tumor zzso zzso it binds the zzso region of zzso and zzso its ability to induce zzso after DNA zzso Here we report that, after DNA damage, zzso becomes stabilized in a zzso way and accumulated in the zzso Further characterization of zzso zzso revealed increased nuclear zzso in zzso cells after treatment with the nuclear export inhibitor zzso B, or when a nuclear export signal zzso located in its zzso region was zzso Finally, we provide evidence that zzso zzso zzso in addition to zzso protein levels zzso is able to enhance zzso zzso of zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso accumulates in the nucleus, binds zzso but zzso its ability to enhance zzso zzso of zzso and to regulate zzso protein zzso Similarly, when wild type zzso functions on zzso were analyzed in cells lacking zzso it failed in regulating both zzso zzso and protein levels, thus indicating that zzso requires an intact zzso and functional zzso for the regulation of zzso Our results provide new insights into the mechanism of zzso function, zzso its characterized zzso shuttling ability is required to regulate zzso
