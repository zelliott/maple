The zzso zzso proteins of autonomous zzso are known to act in a host zzso manner and to play a role in viral DNA zzso efficient translation of viral zzso and/or zzso Their exact function during the zzso life cycle remains, however, still zzso We report here the characterization of the interaction with the zzso proteins from the zzso minute virus of mice zzso and rat as well as mouse zzso of the human zzso zzso a member of the zzso family recently identified as an essential nuclear export zzso Using the zzso system, we could detect the interaction between the zzso region of rat zzso and each of the three zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Y zzso zzso and L zzso zzso zzso proteins were further shown to interact with the full-length zzso by zzso experiments using extracts from both mouse and rat cell zzso Our data show that zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, we observed that the treatment of zzso cells with zzso B, a drug that specifically zzso the zzso nuclear export pathway, leads to a drastic zzso of zzso proteins in the zzso Both zzso interaction with zzso and nuclear zzso upon zzso B treatment strongly suggest that these zzso viral proteins are actively exported out of the zzso of infected cells via a zzso nuclear export zzso
