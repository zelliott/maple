Studies of zzso of known three-dimensional structure have revealed that zzso and deletion of zzso acids at the zzso zzso change the zzso structures, thus generating differences in the zzso site zzso Such differences determine the size of the zzso with which the zzso zzso Here, 59 unique zzso determined at a resolution of zzso A or below, including 19 in complex with zzso 18 with peptides and 22 with zzso were analyzed to identify and characterize differences in the zzso that are directly involved in the interaction with zzso so-called zzso zzso zzso It was found that zzso use a similar number of zzso to recognize proteins and peptides but contact zzso with five zzso zzso By using a score of zzso zzso differences in the location of the zzso depending on the type of zzso zzso were then identified with zzso An analysis of the surface generated by the zzso usage indicates that the differences found correlate well with the size of the zzso zzso zzso have the largest zzso surface, with zzso of high usage located in the edge of the zzso The zzso surface of zzso zzso is the zzso with hot spots of contacts in the interior of the binding surface and buried in the zzso zzso The zzso surface of zzso zzso has a size in between zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso of high usage located in the interior of the zzso site but do not buried as in zzso zzso These findings led to a zzso of the model zzso differences in the zzso site topography with its preference to recognize zzso of different zzso zzso it is discussed how this knowledge should help to design zzso zzso biased toward the recognition of zzso of zzso zzso
