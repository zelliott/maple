zzso O zzso is a crucial protein modification in zzso and zzso zzso In humans, a lack of zzso zzso causes zzso muscular zzso that are associated with brain zzso In zzso protein O zzso is zzso however, it is not known why impaired O zzso results in cell zzso To address this question, we analyzed the zzso lethal zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso cells lyse as zzso cells in the absence of zzso stabilization and that treatment with mating zzso causes zzso cell zzso These zzso are partially suppressed by zzso of upstream elements of the protein zzso C zzso cell integrity pathway, suggesting that the zzso zzso is defective in zzso zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso zzso does not occur in zzso zzso zzso during exposure to mating zzso or elevated zzso zzso analyses of the plasma membrane sensors of the zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso processed in zzso zzso Our data suggest that in zzso O zzso increases the activity of zzso zzso and zzso by enhancing their zzso zzso O zzso leads to incorrect zzso processing of these zzso which in turn results in impaired zzso of the zzso zzso and finally causes cell death in the absence of zzso zzso
