In order to investigate the role of zzso in bone zzso we examined the zzso and zzso medium from zzso chick zzso zzso in a zzso zzso using zzso bone cells from zzso The zzso zzso markedly inhibited pit formation, whereas the zzso medium of zzso had no zzso This zzso activity was not the result of zzso of the zzso A novel zzso protein was zzso from zzso chick zzso fragments enriched in zzso The zzso zzso of molecular mass zzso zzso showed significant zzso zzso of pit formation by zzso bone cells from mice and zzso and by human giant zzso zzso This protein also inhibited the zzso activity of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in the absence of other zzso zzso zzso of the protein into zzso caused disruption of the zzso in the zzso The zzso zzso sequence of the protein showed zzso identity to a part of zzso zzso Thus chick zzso zzso may be involved in the regulation of bone zzso by zzso
