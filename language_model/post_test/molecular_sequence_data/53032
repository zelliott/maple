Much research has been done over the past two decades on the role of zzso growth factors I and II zzso in the maintenance of normal body zzso especially in regard to various zzso functions, growth and zzso For example, zzso is a well established promoter of tissue growth and has been used in the clinics for the treatment of growth related disorders, even being abused by athletes to enhance performance in zzso In contrast, comparatively limited attention has been given to the potential significance of the zzso in the central nervous zzso Over the past few years, we have studied the zzso as well as zzso roles of the zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso are potent zzso of zzso release, zzso zzso release while zzso is a potent zzso Moreover, only the zzso of the zzso zzso complex was blocked by an inhibitor of zzso This is in accordance with the differential nature of the zzso and zzso zzso the former being a zzso zzso zzso while the later is a single zzso domain protein bearing binding sites for zzso zzso containing zzso The zzso of zzso receptors protected zzso against cell death induced by zzso derivatives likely by an zzso mechanism distinct from those involved in the regulation of zzso release and zzso zzso The stimulation of zzso receptors can activate zzso pathways implicating a zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso the production of free zzso The effects, particularly those of zzso on key markers of the Alzheimer's zzso brains namely zzso dysfunction, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso metabolism suggest the potential usefulness of this growth factor in the treatment of neurodegenerative zzso However, the poor zzso zzso stability and brain penetration of zzso hamper progress in this zzso The recent development of a small, zzso zzso of insulin able to directly activate the insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Li, zzso Zhang, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ruby, zzso Kendall, zzso zzso zzso Griffin, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Smith, zzso zzso zzso zzso Science, zzso zzso suggests that a similar strategy could be used for zzso and the zzso zzso leading to the characterization of zzso mimics of potential clinical zzso
