The protein O zzso zzso is involved in the repair of O zzso and O zzso in DNA and plays an important role in most organisms in attenuating the zzso and zzso effects of certain classes of zzso zzso A zzso clone encompassing the zzso zzso zzso gene ( zzso ) was identified on the basis of sequence zzso with corresponding genes in zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene is located at position zzso on the third zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso revealed an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso bacteria was rescued by expression of the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso activity was identified in crude extracts of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and this activity was inhibited by zzso of the extract with an zzso containing a single zzso zzso Similar to zzso zzso and zzso zzso but in contrast to the human zzso the zzso zzso is resistant to zzso by O zzso In an zzso zzso Z zzso zzso expression of zzso efficiently suppressed zzso zzso as well as zzso transition zzso in zzso These results demonstrate the presence of an zzso specific for the repair of O zzso and O zzso in zzso
