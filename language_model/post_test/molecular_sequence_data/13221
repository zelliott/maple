The inheritance of much zzso zzso disease zzso has been linked to a zzso locus on zzso zzso Recently, the gene likely responsible for this genetic linkage has been identified and termed zzso Five zzso have been found in zzso that segregate with the disease zzso in seven zzso families and are not present in unaffected zzso Here we report the existence of a gene zzso a seven zzso domain protein very similar to that zzso by zzso in structure and zzso This gene is located on zzso 1, is expressed in a variety of zzso including brain, and is predicted to harbor zzso causing zzso 14 familial zzso The presence of several zzso DNA binding motifs in both the zzso protein and the zzso protein zzso protein suggests a possible role in zzso signaling and gene expression or in linking zzso to the nuclear zzso Ways in which zzso in either gene could lead to zzso are zzso
