The zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso II zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso with precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso depend on the zzso Moreover, specific processing factors are known to associate with this zzso The zzso is therefore thought to act as a platform that zzso the assembly of complexes required for the processing of nascent zzso The zzso zzso contains 52 zzso repeated zzso with the consensus sequence zzso The zzso half of the zzso zzso contains mostly repeats that diverge from this consensus zzso whereas the zzso half contains mostly repeats that match the consensus zzso Here, we demonstrate that 22 tandem repeats, from either the zzso or divergent halves of the zzso are sufficient for approximate zzso levels of transcription, zzso and zzso zzso of two different zzso one containing a zzso spliced zzso and the other containing an zzso that depends on an zzso zzso for efficient zzso In contrast, each block of 22 repeats is not sufficient for efficient inclusion of an alternatively spliced zzso in another zzso In this case, a longer zzso is important for zzso the negative effect of a zzso zzso element located within the alternative zzso Our results indicate that the zzso rather than the composition of zzso repeats, can be the major zzso in efficient processing of different zzso zzso However, the extent of this length requirement depends on specific sequence features within the zzso zzso
