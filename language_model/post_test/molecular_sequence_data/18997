Designed zzso zzso molecules are used to direct the synthesis and assembly of gold zzso into complex zzso zzso zzso with various zzso Four zzso zzso each based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso ), are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The affect that zzso zzso F zzso have on both the zzso of the zzso zzso and the resulting assembly of gold zzso zzso is zzso It is shown that the addition of two zzso F zzso zzso leads to thick, zzso zzso gold zzso zzso whereas the addition of three zzso F zzso zzso leads to bundling of thin zzso zzso zzso
