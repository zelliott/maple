zzso zzso disease caused by zzso zzso is a serious zzso threat to greenhouse tomato and pepper zzso In contrast to most powdery zzso species which are zzso zzso zzso is an zzso fungus colonizing the zzso zzso of the zzso In zzso zzso tomato and zzso the correct functioning of specific zzso of the plant zzso gene family has been found to be required for zzso of zzso powdery zzso zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the involvement of the zzso genes in zzso to the zzso fungus zzso zzso In tomato zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso gene results in resistance to powdery zzso disease caused by zzso zzso When the tomato zzso zzso was zzso with zzso zzso in this study, it proved to be less susceptible compared to the control, zzso zzso zzso zzso Further, zzso of zzso in the tomato zzso zzso enhanced zzso to zzso zzso In pepper, the zzso gene was isolated by applying a zzso cloning zzso Compared to the previously identified zzso zzso the zzso gene is more similar to zzso as shown by zzso analysis, and the expression of zzso is zzso at an earlier time point upon zzso zzso zzso However, results of zzso gene zzso suggest that both zzso and zzso may be involved in the zzso of pepper to zzso zzso The fact that zzso of zzso restored the zzso of the tomato zzso zzso to zzso zzso and increased its zzso to zzso zzso confirmed the role of zzso acting as a zzso factor to different powdery zzso though the role of zzso as a zzso for zzso cannot be zzso
