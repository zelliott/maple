zzso of mice treated with the zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso designated zzso zzso with short zzso abnormal zzso and zzso growth plates, features consistent with zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was inherited as an zzso dominant zzso zzso mice were viable and fertile and zzso mice died zzso zzso was mapped to zzso 15 and zzso analysis of likely candidates from the zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso demonstrated abnormal processing and zzso zzso retention of the zzso zzso zzso revealed growth plate disorganization in zzso zzso mice and embryonic cartilage from zzso and zzso mice had reduced zzso and zzso collagen zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso had vertical columns of zzso zzso whereas those in zzso mice were perpendicular to the direction of bone zzso zzso zzso of cartilage from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed fewer and less elaborate collagen zzso in the zzso with enlarged zzso in the zzso zzso that contained zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scans of zzso zzso mice revealed them to have decreased bone mineral density, and total bone volume, with zzso and zzso at the zzso Thus, an zzso mouse model with a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso domain that results in abnormal collagen processing and zzso features consistent with zzso and secondary zzso has been zzso
