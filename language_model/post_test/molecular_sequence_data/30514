zzso zzso clones were derived by limiting dilution following zzso to zzso cells bearing zzso zzso zzso zzso were determined by extensive testing on a panel of zzso zzso cell lines and by blocking studies with zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso and zzso class II zzso Out of nine zzso cell lines, three failed to stimulate a subset of the zzso clones in conventional proliferation zzso zzso by all of the clones was blocked by zzso zzso not by zzso or zzso which was consistent with the conclusion that the zzso zzso was zzso This zzso zzso has been identified as zzso by the zzso International zzso zzso The molecular basis for this altered recognition of the zzso zzso was determined by zzso zzso zzso and by DNA sequencing zzso The first, second, and third zzso regions of all nine zzso cell lines were zzso zzso and zzso were found at positions 85 and 86 of the zzso beta 1 chain in zzso molecules from six of the nine zzso cell lines, whereas zzso and zzso were found in the three zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso with class I structure, zzso 85 and 86 would be located at the extreme zzso end of the zzso alpha zzso Together or zzso these zzso acid differences may define a zzso recognition element on the zzso zzso serving to contact zzso zzso zzso zzso if zzso involves recognition of a self zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso then it is possible that the differences T cells recognize on zzso class II proteins arise from zzso interactions with zzso 85 and zzso
