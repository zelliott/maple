zzso from zzso zzso zzso was found to zzso zzso zzso and zzso linkages during an zzso zzso transfer zzso Normally, new zzso zzso are added at zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso blocked at zzso also can serve as good zzso The zzso and zzso products formed when zzso zzso was used as zzso were isolated and zzso Both were found to contain only zzso zzso zzso This supports the hypothesis that when zzso is blocked the zzso binds to the zzso in a flipped orientation, resulting in an approximate exchange in space of the zzso and zzso thereby putting zzso adjacent to the active zzso The second zzso links in the zzso are formed by a zzso mechanism without release of the intermediate zzso With zzso as zzso new zzso zzso are added at zzso However, if that position is blocked with a zzso zzso the resulting compound, zzso can still serve as an zzso The product in this case was isolated and zzso The new zzso link was found to be zzso
