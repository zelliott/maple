zzso Following the recent demonstration of a zzso zzso activity localized in zzso zzso zzso an zzso was developed to isolate and characterize zzso modified peptides from this tissue which contain zzso This zzso consisted of zzso identification of peptides before and after zzso removal of zzso zzso zzso Using this zzso a zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso and was shown to be a significant component of zzso zzso zzso zzso A computer search through the zzso protein sequence database revealed a zzso identity of zzso and a zzso of human zzso B zzso
