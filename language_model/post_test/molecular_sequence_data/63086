zzso of human zzso gene 1 zzso channels, such as zzso acid zzso reverse the effect of zzso zzso and shorten the duration of cardiac action zzso zzso zzso slows the rate of zzso and shifts the zzso dependence of channel zzso to more positive zzso We recently mapped the binding site for zzso to several zzso located near the zzso ends of the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These zzso are zzso in the highly zzso zzso gene 3 zzso zzso however, zzso blocks zzso zzso Here, we compare zzso and rat zzso zzso channels to explore the molecular basis for differential channel sensitivity to zzso zzso were zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso and currents were recorded using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to swap the two zzso within the putative binding domain that differed between zzso and zzso The differential sensitivity of zzso and zzso channels to the zzso effect of zzso could be accounted for by a single zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso in zzso A zzso in this position favors zzso activity, whereas an zzso reveals a secondary blocking effect of zzso
