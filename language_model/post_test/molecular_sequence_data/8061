zzso is an essential component of the zzso zzso dosage compensation machinery that reduces X zzso transcript levels in zzso zzso zzso is required for the zzso association of zzso (a zzso zzso protein zzso with the zzso X zzso Loss of zzso activity results in zzso zzso We demonstrate that zzso encodes a novel nuclear protein of 123 zzso acids that is present in both zzso and males zzso throughout zzso zzso itself is not associated with the X zzso nor is its pattern of expression zzso by zzso in the gene hierarchy that controls dosage zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous factor that is likely to promote the zzso association of zzso with X by affecting the activity of a zzso dosage compensation zzso In zzso animals, zzso is required for zzso processes other than dosage zzso coordinated movement, normal body size, correct tail zzso and mating zzso We demonstrate that rescue of both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso defects caused by zzso zzso can be achieved by inducing zzso transcripts either in the mother or in the zzso through the end of zzso zzso appears to be zzso in an zzso with a novel zzso zzso
