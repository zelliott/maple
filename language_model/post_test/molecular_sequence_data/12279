A system for generating zzso insertions in zzso is zzso It is based on the conditional replication of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso alpha and the multiple cloning site of zzso zzso zzso fragments of zzso zzso were cloned in zzso in zzso helper strain zzso coli zzso The frequency of zzso zzso following introduction of this zzso bank into zzso zzso zzso was increased by combining the system with zzso zzso zzso zzso Transformation of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso bank of zzso zzso fragments at the zzso temperature allowed replication of several copies of a zzso zzso from the bank within a cell because of the provision in trans of zzso from zzso A temperature shift to 37 degrees C resulted in loss of zzso and integration of the zzso derivatives at high zzso A bank of zzso zzso was made in this way and successfully screened for the presence of two zzso one in the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and one in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso into the zzso zzso at 30 degrees C resulted in zzso of the integrated zzso and restoration of the ability of zzso zzso The integration zzso zzso was rescued by using the isolated zzso content of a restored zzso colony to transform zzso coli zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso revealed an internal part of an open reading frame of which the translated product showed significant zzso with zzso proteins zzso of zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso This combined use of two types of conditional replicating zzso zzso represents a novel, powerful tool for zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and sequencing of the zzso zzso
