zzso the chick counterpart of mouse zzso was zzso zzso was expressed in the developing chick peripheral nervous system, zzso sensory zzso nerves of zzso zzso origin, sympathetic zzso zzso root zzso and enteric zzso as well as a limited regions of the spinal zzso In zzso derivatives of the neural zzso zzso was expressed in the zzso cells and not in the zzso neural crest zzso Furthermore, intense signals of zzso zzso were detected also in the spinal zzso and the zzso roots of 10-day zzso No transcripts were detected in the spinal zzso of the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso might play a role in zzso differentiation during chick nervous system zzso
