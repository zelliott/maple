In order to investigate the zzso of zzso in zzso skeletal muscle, we determined the coding and zzso promoter sequences of the zzso type II zzso gene in thoroughbred zzso zzso zebra and zzso mountain zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of thoroughbred horse zzso showed 100, 100, zzso zzso and zzso identities with zzso zzso zzso mountain zzso human, mouse and rat zzso zzso In zzso zzso specific zzso acid zzso zzso 159 and zzso zzso were found in the potential binding site for zzso In addition, the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso promoter has a number of zzso putative binding sites for zzso zzso
