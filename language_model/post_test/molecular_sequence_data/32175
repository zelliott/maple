zzso zzso are generally resistant to all conventional zzso zzso exceptions are zzso zzso with loss of zzso on zzso zzso zzso Patients with zzso zzso zzso frequently respond to zzso zzso and zzso Because the underlying zzso basis for this clinical finding is zzso we evaluated zzso expressed zzso proteins in zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell lines and then examined whether their expression was associated with outcome of patients with zzso zzso 

We used a comparative zzso screen of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso cell lines to identify zzso expressed zzso zzso including zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso specimens from 24 patients were assessed for zzso expression by zzso The relationship between zzso expression and clinical outcome was assessed with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso experiments tested effects of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, on the in zzso and in zzso resistance of zzso zzso cells to treatment with zzso For in zzso resistance studies, 36 mice with zzso and 16 mice with subcutaneous zzso tumor implants were used (one tumor per zzso zzso zzso was used for cell cycle zzso zzso was used to assess protein zzso All statistical tests were zzso 

zzso zzso expression in tumors was statistically significantly associated with loss of zzso in zzso zzso and increased recurrence-free survival zzso The median recurrence-free survival times for patients with tumors expressing low, zzso or high zzso levels were 45 months zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso 0 to 90 zzso 17 months zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and 6 months zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso associated with overall survival of zzso mice carrying zzso zzso Median survival of mice with zzso tumors was 95 days zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso and that of mice with zzso tumors was 64 days zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso 31 days, zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced zzso arrest in zzso zzso cells, and this effect was greater in cells with decreased zzso zzso 

Loss of zzso for the zzso gene may be associated with improved outcomes of patients with zzso zzso zzso zzso
