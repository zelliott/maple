In this study a zzso zzso zzso was designed to site specifically cleave the zzso of the activated zzso gene expressed in human zzso zzso zzso zzso The optimal conditions for zzso zzso by the zzso were demonstrated in zzso A synthetic DNA zzso the zzso was cloned into a zzso expression zzso zzso beta zzso and zzso into zzso zzso The expressed zzso significantly altered the zzso and suppressed the growth of zzso cells in zzso These cell lines were examined for their zzso potential in zzso zzso mice by an zzso zzso zzso model, which zzso the invasive potential of various zzso zzso zzso tumors expressing the zzso zzso were characterized by a marked reduction in tumor take and invasion compared to those formed by control zzso zzso These differences resulted in almost a twofold increase in survival of mice implanted with zzso zzso zzso These results further zzso the role of zzso genes in zzso and invasion, as well as introduce zzso as a new class of zzso zzso
