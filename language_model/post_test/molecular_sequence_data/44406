A new approach for inserting a zzso at a selected position within the long zzso zzso molecules has been zzso The zzso coli zzso zzso was zzso at a single zzso bond, zzso with zzso H in the presence of a complementary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso to the zzso of the zzso at the zzso site with T4 zzso zzso The zzso zzso fragments containing this added zzso zzso were assembled together with total zzso zzso proteins into small zzso zzso The ability of such zzso particles containing fragmented zzso to form zzso zzso has been demonstrated zzso zzso were induced within the zzso zzso by mild zzso zzso The sites of zzso within the zzso zzso were then analyzed using zzso H zzso and reverse zzso Two zzso from the zzso attached to zzso zzso of zzso zzso were observed, namely to zzso zzso and zzso These results are in agreement with the established proximity of zzso 39 and 41 in the zzso structure of the zzso zzso zzso as shown by other zzso zzso zzso zzso These data zzso allow us to refine the structural arrangement of zzso 41 and 39 relative to one zzso
