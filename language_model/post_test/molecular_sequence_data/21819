Recent studies indicate that the DNA recognition domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso can be combined with the zzso domain of zzso restriction zzso to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso that, in pairs, bind adjacent DNA target sites and produce zzso breaks between the target zzso stimulating zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we exploit the four prevalent zzso repeats and their DNA recognition zzso to develop a zzso zzso method for rapid production of designer zzso zzso that recognize unique DNA sequence up to 23 bases in any zzso We have used this approach to engineer 10 zzso to target specific zzso in native zzso zzso zzso All zzso produced high rates of zzso gene disruptions and created strains with expected zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso high rates (up to zzso of gene replacement by zzso zzso Finally, zzso caused no zzso zzso and minimal levels of zzso genetic zzso in the treated zzso zzso These studies expand the realm of verified zzso activity from cultured human cells to an intact zzso zzso and suggest that low-cost, highly dependable zzso can assume a significant role for gene modifications of value in human and animal health, agriculture and zzso
