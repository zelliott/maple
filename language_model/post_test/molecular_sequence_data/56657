Previously, we described a zzso zzso that encodes seven zzso peptides from two alternatively spliced transcripts in the zzso zzso zzso To determine whether all or a subset of the predicted peptides coded for by zzso are produced in zzso we undertook the isolation of zzso peptides from zzso zzso Six zzso zzso all contained within the putative translation products of the zzso zzso were isolated from extracts of mixed stage zzso By quantitative zzso analysis of zzso from mixed stage animals, we found that the shorter transcript of zzso has a higher level of expression than the longer zzso
