We report here the isolation and characterization of a novel human zzso zzso beta zzso zzso gene by zzso selection from zzso mapping on zzso zzso This gene is specifically transcribed in fetal brain and in skeletal muscle and is characterized by a complete sequence zzso with previously described zzso beta zzso We also assigned the zzso for three other zzso beta zzso to human zzso 2, 15 and zzso The multiple zzso assignments of zzso beta zzso demonstrates the genetic zzso of human zzso beta zzso
