Proper growth and development of zzso organisms requires precise regulation of zzso zzso One aspect of this regulation is at the level of zzso from the gene zzso As an initial approach to understanding the regulation of the zzso zzso which plays an important role in eye development and perhaps in other zzso zzso we characterized a promoter region of the quail zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso region revealed a zzso box and a zzso box as well as several putative zzso zzso A zzso pair fragment, containing zzso base pairs of zzso zzso zzso the first zzso and a portion of the first zzso was able to efficiently promote expression of the bacterial zzso gene in quail zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter with a zzso expressing the 46 zzso zzso protein resulted in an increase in zzso promoter zzso By zzso migration shift zzso and zzso experiments, we showed that the zzso protein can interact directly with the zzso zzso By zzso experiments, we identified the binding sites for the zzso protein within the promoter zzso These results show that zzso encodes a zzso zzso and that it potentially zzso its own zzso
