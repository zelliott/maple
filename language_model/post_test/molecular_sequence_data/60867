Small zzso proteins provide examples of simple and stable scaffolds for design zzso The zzso zzso zzso motif is one such elementary structural motif and is found in many protein families with no evolutionary zzso In this paper, we present zzso structural studies and stability zzso of two short peptides of 21 and 23 zzso that zzso to the isolated zzso motif taken from a zzso squash zzso zzso The two peptides contain two zzso bridges instead of three for the parent zzso but were shown to fold in a zzso fashion, indicating that the zzso motif can be considered an autonomous folding zzso The zzso zzso was truncated at the zzso It has a zzso zzso close to that of the parent squash zzso and although less stable than the native zzso it still exhibits a high zzso of about 100 degrees zzso We suggest that this zzso is a very good starting building block for engineering new zzso molecules by zzso different active or recognition sites onto zzso The zzso zzso was further shortened by removing two zzso in the loop connecting the second and third zzso This zzso exhibited a less zzso zzso and is less stable by about 1 zzso zzso but it might be useful if a higher flexibility is zzso The lower stability of the zzso zzso is supposed to result from inadequate lengths of segments connecting the first three zzso thus providing new insights into the structural zzso of the zzso zzso
