The presence of zzso zzso for the mouse zzso of the zzso kidney disease 1 gene zzso was demonstrated by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso methods in mouse zzso zzso zzso A single locus for the zzso gene was detected on mouse zzso 17 by fluorescent in zzso zzso zzso of proteins from zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso revealed high molecular weight bands, the highest being zzso 400 zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso with zzso revealed expression of zzso as early as day 8 zzso The expression was seen in zzso cells of the zzso zzso in condensing zzso cells of the developing zzso and, zzso in cells of the nascent zzso In addition, zzso zzso was seen in zzso and zzso zzso cardiac and skeletal muscle, neural zzso gut, and zzso zzso In zzso and adult mouse kidney and liver persistent slight to moderate zzso was zzso zzso studies of cultured zzso mouse zzso revealed zzso expression in zzso bud zzso early zzso structures zzso is, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data indicate that the mouse has a single gene zzso to human zzso on zzso 17, and zzso is expressed in a variety of zzso during embryonic zzso
