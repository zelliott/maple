Two zzso zzso zzso and four zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso were characterized from zzso sequence data, zzso zzso and zzso zzso For one zzso and one zzso sequence alignments and prediction programs suggested the presence of an zzso zzso targeting zzso zzso expression of these putative targeting sequences joined to zzso green fluorescent protein zzso demonstrated that both zzso can efficiently zzso zzso to zzso and zzso The other zzso and zzso lack targeting sequences and presumably zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that the four zzso evolved by repeated zzso of a gene transferred from an ancestral zzso and that the zzso also arose by zzso of a transferred zzso gene zzso zzso These case histories are the best examples to date of capture of zzso zzso zzso by the zzso protein synthesis zzso
