zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso and contains zzso zzso that mediate zzso interactions important for the establishment and maintenance of zzso and zzso cell zzso The importance of zzso in zzso development is demonstrated by the fact that zzso in zzso or zzso another zzso zzso lead to zzso zzso in zzso We recently identified a new zzso interaction domain, called the zzso domain, which is present twice in zzso In this report, we further define the binding of the zzso domain of zzso to the zzso domain of zzso and identify the binding partner for zzso of zzso zzso analysis reveals that this zzso domain binds to the N zzso of zzso a region that was previously reported to be essential for the lateral membrane recruitment of zzso in zzso Our zzso studies, using zzso zzso show that the association with zzso is crucial for lateral zzso of zzso in zzso zzso We also report the identification of a novel zzso of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso which contains a region highly related to the zzso N zzso and which binds zzso a zzso zzso of zzso Our data identify zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso that link zzso to zzso and account for their common zzso when zzso in zzso
