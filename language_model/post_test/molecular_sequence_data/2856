We report the cloning of zzso a gene coding for fertility zzso of the F zzso from the zzso R factor zzso The zzso gene was mapped precisely within a zzso zzso region by zzso + zzso zzso and its product, zzso identified as a single zzso by means of zzso gel zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso region allowed zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequence and determination of its precise molecular weight as zzso zzso Analysis of the predicted zzso acid sequence indicated that zzso is a positively charged protein possessing a zzso DNA binding zzso We propose a possible model for the mechanism by which zzso zzso zzso within the F zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso established that all zzso R factors examined have an zzso zzso zzso
