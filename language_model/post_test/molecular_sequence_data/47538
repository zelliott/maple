The gene zzso the zzso protein of zzso des petits zzso virus zzso has been cloned and its zzso sequence zzso This gene is zzso zzso long and contains an open reading frame zzso capable of zzso a basic protein of 335 zzso acid zzso with a predicted molecular weight of zzso zzso This zzso starts at position zzso and ends with the zzso zzso at position zzso thus leaving a long untranslated region zzso zzso at the 3' end of the zzso zzso This zzso is very zzso rich zzso and in contrast to the zzso region appears to be least zzso in the M gene sequence of the zzso A comparison of the zzso M protein with those of other viruses in the group confirms the previously noted high degree of conservation for this protein zzso The percent of identity within the group ranges from zzso to zzso the highest being with the zzso zzso zzso zzso
