We previously raised an zzso zzso by an zzso approach which was designed to be directed against an zzso binding domain on the zzso zzso channel zzso This zzso zzso zzso in that it inhibited zzso zzso transport across A6 cell zzso zzso recognized a zzso zzso in A6 zzso treated with zzso consistent with the size of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically recognized an zzso binding domain within the zzso of mouse and bovine zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso was used to generate a three-dimensional model structure of the zzso The combining site of zzso was zzso mapped using a novel computer-based zzso Organic zzso that potentially interact with the zzso combining site were identified by data base screening using the program zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso in a manner corresponding to the ordered linear array of zzso acid zzso within an zzso binding domain on the zzso of zzso A synthetic zzso spanning this domain inhibited the binding of zzso to zzso This analysis provided a novel approach to develop models of zzso interaction as well as a molecular perspective of zzso binding to an zzso binding domain within zzso
