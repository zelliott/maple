The zzso zzso gene is expressed normally in zzso zzso and in a restricted population of cells in the central and peripheral nerve zzso To define the zzso within the zzso DNA of the human CT gene which mediate this zzso zzso we used DNA transfer techniques and a transient zzso zzso We found that a DNA sequence located between zzso and zzso of the CT zzso DNA functioned as an zzso of zzso zzso in zzso (from zzso zzso zzso but not in rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso cells zzso and zzso Further mapping revealed the presence of at least two elements within the zzso zzso an upstream element zzso located between zzso and zzso which could not function independently but its removal caused zzso loss of zzso activity and a downstream element zzso located at zzso to zzso which functioned independently as a zzso zzso but with reduced zzso The binding pattern of nuclear proteins from zzso to the zzso elements was studied by an zzso mobility shift zzso A zzso complex was formed with the zzso which could be zzso specifically, by an zzso containing the zzso motif of the zzso gene zzso A similar complex was formed with the zzso zzso Nuclear proteins from zzso cells failed to form complexes with zzso Moreover, the binding pattern of proteins derived from zzso cells to zzso was different from that of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
