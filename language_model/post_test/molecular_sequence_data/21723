zzso zzso are water channel proteins zzso movement of water across the cell zzso Recent insect studies clearly demonstrate that zzso are indispensable for cellular water management under normal conditions as well as under stress conditions including zzso and zzso In the present study we cloned an zzso zzso from the Antarctic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and investigated water transport activity of the zzso protein and zzso regulation of the gene in response to zzso and zzso The zzso sequence and deduced zzso acid sequence of the zzso showed high similarity to zzso in other insects and also showed characteristic features of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso of another zzso zzso zzso A swelling zzso using a zzso zzso expression system verified that zzso zzso is capable of transporting water, but not zzso or zzso The zzso zzso was detected in various zzso under zzso conditions, suggesting that this zzso plays a fundamental role in cell zzso In contrast to our zzso zzso zzso expression was not affected by either zzso or zzso
