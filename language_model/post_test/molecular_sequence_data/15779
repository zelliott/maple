zzso zzso and zzso syndrome are the two major zzso highly associated with human zzso zzso zzso zzso Although the development of zzso is zzso it has been hypothesized that zzso may zzso to zzso via the phenomenon of molecular zzso A computer search for zzso between zzso and microbes revealed a sequence of six consecutive zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso shared by zzso zzso 72 to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 188 to zzso zzso raised against a zzso derived from zzso containing this zzso sequence zzso with the zzso derived from zzso that contained these six zzso zzso and zzso These zzso also reacted with zzso zzso from zzso patients with zzso zzso zzso from 53 percent of zzso patients and 27 percent of patients with zzso zzso showed binding to these same zzso These results suggest that molecular mimicry may have a role in disease zzso
