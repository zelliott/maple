Previously we showed that the expression of a zzso zzso zzso C gene zzso is activated by promoter upstream phased zzso in a low zzso zzso In this paper we characterize the interaction between the alpha zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the phased zzso zzso radical zzso and zzso polarization zzso revealed that the alpha zzso binds to the minor grooves of the phased zzso through its zzso domain with increased affinity at low zzso The result provides a molecular mechanism underlying the zzso of the zzso promoter by the phased zzso
