zzso zzso zzso is expressed specifically in the central nervous system zzso by zzso zzso cells, the zzso The external location of zzso on zzso zzso and its late expression during zzso argue for a role of zzso in the completion of zzso and maintenance of its zzso zzso is a target zzso in zzso diseases, such as experimental zzso zzso zzso in animals and multiple sclerosis zzso in zzso We previously located the gene zzso zzso to the major zzso complex zzso both in human, by zzso and in zzso by analysis of zzso To refine the position, we have now selected zzso artificial zzso clones zzso which contain the zzso zzso Physical mapping of the human zzso and the mouse zzso genes by characterization of these zzso clones indicated that the gene is located at the zzso end of the major zzso complex zzso class zzso region in both zzso The human zzso gene lies 60 zzso zzso zzso to zzso in a head-to-head zzso the mouse zzso gene lies 25 zzso zzso to zzso in a zzso zzso These zzso genes provide markers for comparative analysis of the evolution of the zzso in the two zzso The physical mapping of zzso should facilitate analysis of its role in zzso neurological diseases, and the zzso clones identified here will permit the identification of new genes in the zzso
