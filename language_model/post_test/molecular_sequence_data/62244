zzso zzso caused by the zzso pathogen zzso zzso is a devastating zzso disease of zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that the wild melon line zzso zzso zzso is highly resistant to all zzso of zzso zzso That resistance was controlled genetically by two partially dominant, complementary zzso Here, we show that unlike other plant disease resistance zzso which zzso an ability to resist infection by pathogens expressing corresponding zzso zzso the resistance of zzso to zzso zzso is controlled by enhanced expression of the zzso resistance zzso genes zzso and zzso These zzso expressed genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso The low expression of zzso and zzso in susceptible melon lines is regulated mainly at the zzso zzso This regulation is independent of infection with the zzso zzso melon plants zzso either of these zzso genes displayed enhanced activity of zzso zzso and remarkable resistance against zzso zzso The cloned zzso genes provide a new resource for developing zzso zzso melon zzso
