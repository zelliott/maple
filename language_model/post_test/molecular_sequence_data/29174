To identify target zzso for prostate cancer therapy, we have combined computer-based screening of the human expressed sequence tag database and experimental expression analysis to identify genes that are expressed in normal prostate and prostate cancer but not in essential human zzso Using this approach, we identified a gene that is expressed specifically in prostate cancer, normal zzso and zzso The gene has a zzso transcript that encodes a protein of 14 zzso We named this gene zzso zzso in prostate and zzso In zzso zzso shows that zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso cells of prostate zzso and in normal zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso tag into zzso zzso cells and subsequent cell zzso analysis shows that the zzso protein is localized in the membrane fraction of the zzso Analysis of the zzso acid sequence of zzso shows that it has structural similarities to a group of proteins known as zzso zzso which includes the zzso domain of the type beta transforming growth factor zzso zzso expression of zzso makes it a potential candidate for the zzso of prostate zzso
