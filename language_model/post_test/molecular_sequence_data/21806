zzso X zzso zzso belongs to an ancient zzso of nuclear hormone zzso and plays an important role in reproduction of zzso However, the zzso role of zzso has not been clarified in zzso In this investigation, we first report the cloning of two alternative zzso zzso of zzso zzso from green crab zzso zzso zzso zzso levels were zzso in different zzso stages of the crab zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso was significantly increased in the zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The relative levels of zzso zzso in the zzso were significantly lower in zzso stage III zzso than in zzso in the other three zzso These data indicate that the zzso and zzso of the crab are capable of expressing zzso which may zzso in part, zzso in the zzso We also examined the effects of zzso zzso zzso and zzso treatments on zzso and zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso zzso levels in zzso and zzso fragments incubated in zzso were significantly zzso higher than in control tissue fragments prepared from the same zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso significantly zzso reduced zzso levels for zzso and for zzso as well as zzso levels in zzso These results indicate that, zzso and zzso form a complex zzso directly and together stimulate zzso development in these green zzso This interaction of zzso zzso and zzso development axis is a novel finding and is the first report to the best of our zzso
