zzso of the mouse cardiac zzso gene depends on a zzso zzso zzso zzso which has been zzso in transgenic mice, to direct expression to embryonic skeletal zzso The presence of this zzso sequence is also associated with zzso expression of cardiac zzso zzso In differentiated skeletal muscle cells, activity of the zzso is driven by an E box, binding zzso family members, and by a 3' zzso sequence which is in the location of a zzso zzso zzso This sequence does not bind zzso zzso or other known muscle zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso a class VI zzso domain zzso bind to consensus sites on the DNA, and it is the binding of zzso which is important for zzso zzso binds as a major complex with zzso and the zzso zzso zzso The form of zzso present in this complex and as a major form in muscle cell extracts is longer zzso zzso than that previously zzso These results demonstrate the importance of this novel complex in the zzso regulation of the cardiac zzso gene and suggest a potential role in zzso zzso associated with muscle gene zzso
