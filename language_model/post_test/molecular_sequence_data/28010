When zzso bind certain specific zzso they are induced to zzso the contents of their zzso zzso and to zzso Studies of the molecular events accompanying this vital zzso response have led to a greater understanding of cell zzso in general since the pathways involved are common to a number of cell zzso By contrast most of the information about the cell surface molecules that initiate signal zzso has emerged from work on T zzso zzso a process essential to the initiation of the immune zzso We have described an zzso zzso on T zzso that is involved in the differentiation of these zzso In the present report it is demonstrated that the zzso is expressed on the zzso membrane with about 1,200 zzso A zzso zzso detecting this zzso stimulates zzso zzso and zzso with a zzso response at approximately zzso zzso zzso of the zzso termed zzso reveals a zzso of Mr 67,000 showing extensive zzso zzso much of which appears to be heavily zzso The zzso sequence of zzso zzso indicates that the protein has not previously been zzso zzso investigation of the mechanism by which zzso mediates zzso zzso suggests involvement of protein zzso C and the zzso protein of zzso is rapidly zzso upon zzso zzso During this process zzso is also zzso as it is following zzso zzso by the other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results provide the first example of a cell surface zzso that is directly involved in both zzso and T zzso zzso
