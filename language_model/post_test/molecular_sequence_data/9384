The zzso zzso zzso family of zzso includes zzso which zzso a broad range of zzso including zzso and zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso and several other zzso with specific zzso such as zzso zzso or zzso The zzso of zzso zzso a species of zzso encodes five putative zzso zzso Of these five, only zzso has known zzso and zzso zzso it is a highly zzso zzso that functions in zzso pigmentation and zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso is a zzso gene that is expressed predominantly in adult zzso and zzso zzso To determine its zzso function, we zzso zzso zzso and analyzed its zzso zzso oxidized zzso (a zzso the five zzso tested, zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso The zzso efficiencies of zzso were similar to those of zzso zzso zzso zzso except that zzso oxidized all of the zzso zzso with similar efficiencies whereas the zzso zzso were less efficient at zzso zzso or zzso These results demonstrate that zzso can be classified as a zzso and suggest that zzso has a somewhat broader zzso specificity than zzso zzso In addition, we observed zzso zzso in the zzso zzso which functions as a selective barrier between the blood meal and zzso zzso cells, protecting the zzso from mechanical damage, zzso and toxic zzso We propose that zzso may zzso toxic molecules in the blood meal leading to zzso or to zzso of the molecules to the zzso zzso thus targeting them for zzso
