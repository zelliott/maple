The processing of zzso zzso in zzso requires the zzso small zzso complexes zzso zzso U2, zzso zzso and zzso each of which contains a core of seven zzso zzso Recently we reported the first evidence for a core variation in zzso zzso specifically, in the zzso U2 zzso two of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are replaced by two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we identify the zzso zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso interacts with a second U2 zzso zzso zzso zzso which in turn contacts the zzso zzso zzso Together they form a zzso zzso binding zzso This zzso assembly differs from the zzso system and provides a functional role for the zzso core variation found in the zzso U2 zzso
