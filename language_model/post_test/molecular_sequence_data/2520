zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso fatty zzso We have previously characterized five zzso zzso zzso species that differ in their zzso untranslated regions but not in the coding zzso We have now characterized the zzso structure of the zzso DNA that encodes the zzso untranslated region of the zzso Generation of different forms of the zzso is the result of the selective use of two promoters and differential zzso of five different zzso These five zzso contain a total of 645 zzso and they are scattered over a zzso zzso DNA region that we have zzso
