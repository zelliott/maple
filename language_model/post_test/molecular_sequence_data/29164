The most impressive property of outer hair cells zzso is their ability to change their length at high acoustic zzso thus providing the exquisite sensitivity and zzso capacity of the zzso hearing zzso zzso a protein related to a zzso transport zzso recently has been identified and proposed as the zzso motor zzso zzso searches of zzso zzso of zzso DNA zzso of the coding region of the zzso gene allowed the identification of a zzso hormone zzso response element zzso in the first zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso bound zzso receptors as a zzso or zzso zzso and zzso a zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in response to zzso receptors alpha and zzso zzso X zzso had an additive zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso protein was reduced strongly in the absence of zzso Although zzso protein typically was redistributed to the lateral membrane before the onset of hearing, an immature pattern of zzso protein distribution across the entire zzso membrane was noted in zzso zzso The data suggest zzso as a first zzso regulator of the motor protein zzso and as a direct or indirect zzso of zzso zzso zzso
