zzso zzso are being reported with increasing frequency zzso The aim of this study was to investigate the prevalence of zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso zzso among a collection of zzso zzso strains isolated from patients at different hospitals in Tehran and to trace the zzso clones at these hospitals by zzso field gel zzso zzso zzso of 610 P zzso to 14 different antibiotics was determined using disc diffusion zzso zzso showing resistance to zzso and zzso were subjected to zzso broth dilution zzso to determine their zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were amplified by zzso zzso containing zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso were resistant to zzso zzso zzso or zzso 4 zzso of which 16 zzso carried zzso gene using zzso zzso No other zzso genes were detected in this zzso Three different unrelated patterns were found for zzso containing zzso gene by zzso of which pattern A was zzso All zzso were susceptible to zzso and zzso zzso zzso was the main gene zzso zzso among the zzso of P zzso in our zzso zzso spread of zzso containing zzso had occurred at Tehran zzso However, zzso clones also were involved in the zzso
