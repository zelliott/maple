Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from chicken brain zzso by ammonium zzso zzso followed by column zzso on zzso D and zzso zzso and separated on zzso zzso Each was zzso to zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gel zzso On sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso appeared to be a zzso with a molecular mass of 105 zzso and zzso to be composed of two zzso of 25 zzso and 100 zzso The zzso maps of 100 zzso and 105 zzso protein in zzso are different in peak frequency, zzso and zzso The internal zzso sequence of zzso has a considerable zzso to zzso Both zzso have repeated copies of common zzso segments and have no significant sequence zzso to other zzso and zzso These zzso and zzso zzso have a neutral pH optimum and are inhibited by zzso and zzso zzso is more sensitive to zzso and heat treatment, has a lower zzso to zzso and is more active on zzso zzso and Pro zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso derive from translation of two zzso of a new gene family related to the zzso zzso zzso
