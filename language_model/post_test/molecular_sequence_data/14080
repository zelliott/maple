The tumor zzso gene zzso was isolated by zzso deletion analysis of patients with zzso tumor zzso This gene encodes for a zinc finger zzso protein with zzso zzso During normal zzso it is expressed in a zzso and zzso manner mainly in the zzso and zzso Recently, the expression of zzso in acute zzso zzso was zzso Here we investigated the zzso potential of zzso zzso expression during the course of the disease using the zzso zzso 

zzso cells from 83 patients with newly diagnosed zzso and 20 zzso patients during follow-up in complete zzso were analyzed for zzso zzso zzso zzso blood zzso cells zzso and bone zzso zzso from healthy persons zzso zzso zzso and sorted zzso cells from normal donors zzso zzso 4) were used as negative zzso 

zzso zzso was zzso in zzso zzso patients with zzso zzso donors did not express zzso zzso but in 1/4 sorted zzso cell samples a weak amplified product was zzso After achieving zzso zzso zzso studied patients lost zzso zzso In zzso patients in zzso zzso the reappearance of zzso expression preceded zzso of the disease, in zzso patients zzso remained positive in zzso Response to therapy, zzso survival, overall survival and zzso did not correlate with zzso zzso expression in newly diagnosed zzso before zzso 

In the majority of acute zzso zzso is expressed and probably blast zzso at least in levels zzso by zzso zzso zzso was zzso in bone zzso cells of zzso patients in clinical zzso The results strongly suggest that the persistence or reappearance of zzso predicts zzso of the disease prior to zzso zzso
