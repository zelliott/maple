The zzso active sites of the zzso zzso are zzso within the central chamber of its zzso zzso core zzso Access to this chamber is through a narrow channel defined by the outer alpha zzso Free zzso zzso core particles are found in an zzso state in which the zzso of neighboring alpha zzso are anchored by an intricate lattice of interactions blocking access to the zzso zzso of zzso into zzso can be enhanced by attachment of zzso or regulatory zzso An important part of this zzso is channel zzso regulatory particles rearrange the blocking zzso to form an open pore and promote zzso entry into the zzso zzso Interestingly, some zzso can open the entrance themselves and thus facilitate their own zzso In this review, we will discuss the mechanisms proposed for channel gating and the interactions required to maintain stable closed and open zzso
