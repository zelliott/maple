Recent data have identified zzso as a key zzso in determining zzso to zzso These data are supported by the finding that zzso zzso mice exhibit many features that are characteristic of human asthma zzso zzso elevated serum zzso and zzso zzso as compared to the background zzso A striking feature of these animals is a robust zzso and zzso zzso after zzso challenge, suggesting that zzso is a potent factor in regulating this zzso In an attempt to gain insights into the molecular mechanism governing zzso zzso of lung zzso we investigated the ability of this zzso to induce the expression of zzso zzso in the lung because of their effect on stimulating zzso zzso Here we show that zzso mice in contrast to their zzso controls exhibit baseline lung zzso that is associated with the zzso of zzso expression in the zzso This effect appears to be through a direct action of zzso because the addition of zzso zzso to primary zzso cultures and cell lines induced the expression of these zzso in zzso These data support a mechanism for zzso in regulating the expression of zzso zzso factors in lung zzso zzso
