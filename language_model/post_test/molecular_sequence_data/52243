zzso are zzso as large precursor proteins that undergo zzso zzso and modifications to produce zzso zzso Here, we have cloned two closely related precursor proteins for the sea zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The first precursor zzso zzso acids zzso contains 13 copies of immature zzso zzso and nine other, zzso zzso sequences that are in the zzso part of the zzso The second precursor zzso zzso acid zzso harbors 14 copies of immature zzso and eight other related zzso zzso Each copy of zzso or zzso zzso is followed, at its zzso side, by a single zzso zzso which is an established signal for zzso zzso At the N zzso of each zzso zzso however, basic zzso are zzso and instead one or more zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso are the zzso sites for a new type of processing zzso occurring in zzso This zzso could either be an zzso or zzso zzso at the zzso side of zzso or zzso zzso The zzso regions of the two precursor proteins harbor eight copies of the putative zzso sequence zzso and three zzso closely related zzso The total number of all established and putative zzso that may be zzso from the precursors is zzso Thus, the zzso precursors zzso to the most complex zzso precursor proteins known so zzso
