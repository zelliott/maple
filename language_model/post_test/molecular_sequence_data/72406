The zzso zzso is produced by a number of marine bacteria and zzso It is zzso from zzso by the addition of two zzso groups to zzso C4 and zzso and two zzso groups to zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso which converts zzso to zzso was cloned from the green zzso zzso zzso We transferred zzso to the zzso zzso zzso which contains a zzso zzso gene and normally accumulates zzso and zzso The genetically engineered zzso produced zzso as well as other zzso The results confirm that zzso can function in zzso in conjunction with the intrinsic zzso zzso to produce zzso Specifically, this finding indicates that zzso zzso which normally converts zzso to zzso can also function in the zzso of zzso These results provide the first evidence of genetic manipulation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso toward the production of novel zzso
