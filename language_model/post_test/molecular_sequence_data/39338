The zzso zzso frame is located within the zzso central core region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains genes required for essential cellular zzso zzso protein zzso expressed by zzso zzso is a copper zzso catalyzing the zzso of simple alcohols to zzso and reduction of zzso to hydrogen zzso zzso optical zzso zzso are observed for oxidized and zzso reduced zzso and a free radical zzso signal is present in the oxidized zzso characteristic of the zzso zzso zzso previously reported for zzso zzso radical copper zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with which it shares weak sequence zzso zzso was detected in the growth medium of both zzso zzso and a zzso expression host zzso zzso zzso by Western zzso with the expression level dependent on the nature of the carbon zzso This represents the first characterized example of a zzso radical copper zzso
