Six cases of zzso zzso with zzso zzso T cell zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and Southern zzso zzso Five cases out of six showed gene zzso of the T cell zzso beta chain, indicating the existence of a zzso T cell zzso zzso virus zzso DNA was detected in all six zzso type cases by zzso amplifying the sequence located in the internal repeat I, and confirmed by Southern zzso zzso using a zzso zzso as a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso occurred more frequently as compared with other types of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso determined nuclear zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso positive cells by zzso These results suggest that a significant number of zzso type cases are T cell origin zzso and zzso infection may be relevant to the biological features of this type of zzso
