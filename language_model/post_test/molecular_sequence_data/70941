Cloning has led to the discovery of more zzso channels than predicted by functional studies, yet there remain channels that have not been zzso We report the cloning of a novel protein that contains the four domain structure found in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso relationships suggested that the protein might have zzso from an ancestral four repeat channel before the divergence of zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso transcripts zzso the protein are expressed predominantly in the brain, moderately in the heart, and zzso in the zzso Despite extensive expression attempts, currents from the putative channel were not zzso Based on its zzso we propose that the novel protein might be a zzso zzso channel with unique gating zzso
