zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso bond has been shown to improve the zzso of some zzso zzso Recently, we developed a zzso zzso zzso method targeted at the zzso bond of salmon zzso zzso The zzso zzso had comparable zzso activity to zzso after subcutaneous injection in rats, despite possessing significantly different zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to conduct a comparative evaluation of the zzso properties of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its corresponding zzso zzso compound zzso with a view to correlate these properties to the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso were successfully zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso showed comparable retention times in a zzso zzso column, as well as robust zzso structures and zzso behavior in water, although zzso was shown by dynamic light scattering experiments to form larger zzso than zzso in zzso The larger particle size of zzso correlated with its stronger resistance to degradation by zzso zzso Unlike zzso zzso was rapidly converted to zzso in liver zzso however, the zzso zzso appeared to degrade at a slower rate than unmodified zzso in the liver zzso Compared with zzso zzso after subcutaneous injection as an zzso solution at a dose of zzso zzso produced a prolonged zzso activity that lasted at least 24 h in the zzso Using a novel zzso method that was developed for this study, we were able to show zzso increases in zzso and zzso plasma zzso with time, the latter prevailing at zzso the zzso concentration of the zzso In contrast, zzso was not present in the plasma following the subcutaneous injection of zzso although a comparable zzso activity with shorter duration was zzso zzso administration of zzso and zzso as zzso solutions at zzso equivalent dose of zzso zzso did not produce significant zzso zzso This study is the first thorough examination of the zzso characteristics of the corresponding zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The results obtained should be useful for the development of the oral zzso of zzso and protein zzso
