zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a negative impact on the zzso activity of its host, zzso zzso zzso zzso The host zzso is induced by the zzso zzso and is reproduced by the injection of zzso zzso highly enriched with two zzso of 18 zzso and 36 zzso zzso in size, zzso Here we demonstrate that these zzso proteins trigger zzso of the cells in the zzso and zzso sheath of the host zzso Both zzso and zzso were internally zzso and the gathered information was matched against the deduced zzso acid sequence of the putative proteins zzso by zzso zzso randomly selected from a zzso library, which was raised using zzso extracted from zzso zzso zzso zzso The identified zzso clones contained an insert corresponding to the zzso product of an interrupted zzso made of six zzso and five zzso which was found to be transcribed at higher levels in adult females of zzso zzso than in zzso This gene codes for a putative protein composed of zzso zzso zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso which contained the zzso acid sequences zzso determined for both zzso and zzso This putative protein showed a significant level of sequence identity with zzso zzso zzso and it was named zzso The zzso are zzso which play a key role in the metabolism of zzso zzso and, as observed in most organisms, they are zzso zzso formed by a large and a small zzso which originate by zzso processing of a zzso zzso The expression in insect cells of zzso confirmed the occurrence of the expected zzso processing, and demonstrated that, unlike other zzso this protein is zzso in the zzso zzso A measurable zzso activity was detected in the zzso of zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso containing zzso Thus, we suggest that this zzso protein may induce zzso in the host zzso by generating an zzso of the zzso metabolism and a zzso zzso zzso
