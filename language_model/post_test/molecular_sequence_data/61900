We isolated and zzso both zzso DNA and zzso zzso which zzso a putative zzso protein with 385 zzso zzso from cultivated rice zzso zzso zzso zzso This protein shows significant zzso acid sequence similarities with zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors that were identified in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that the transcript of the rice zzso factor in zzso was zzso by the rice blast fungus zzso zzso zzso by various continuous light conditions and expressed rhythmically in zzso zzso This zzso factor gene was therefore designated as zzso zzso gene regulated by zzso zzso and zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso by this single copy zzso is thus identified as a new member of the zzso zzso family of zzso factors in zzso
