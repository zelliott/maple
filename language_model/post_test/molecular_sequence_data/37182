We identified a new class of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso in which further zzso occurred between two established circulating zzso forms zzso These two zzso were found among 57 zzso samples from a cohort of injecting drug users in eastern Yunnan Province of zzso zzso analysis in conjunction with zzso plots and exploratory tree analysis revealed that these two strains were closely related mosaics comprised of zzso and zzso which are found in zzso The zzso screening based on zzso zzso sequences of 57 samples from eastern Yunnan identified 47 zzso specimens zzso 5 zzso specimens zzso and 3 additional specimens with the novel zzso zzso These new zzso zzso thus constitute a substantial proportion (5 of zzso zzso of zzso strains in this population and may belong to a new but zzso class of zzso This might be the first example of zzso zzso with each other, leading to the evolution of second-generation zzso zzso
