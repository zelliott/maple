For zzso by bacterial type B zzso zzso the importance of a specific interaction with zzso zzso zzso is yet zzso We show that zzso of one of the two G zzso assumed to interact with zzso in type B zzso P zzso zzso cell growth, but cell viability is at least partially restored at increased zzso P levels due to zzso P protein zzso The in zzso defects of the zzso zzso correlated with an zzso zzso at low zzso in zzso For zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso fully and a zzso zzso slightly rescued zzso zzso demonstrating zzso base pairing to zzso zzso but also emphasizing the importance of the base identity of the zzso G zzso zzso We zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso to primarily lie in the recruitment of zzso relevant zzso with a possible contribution from altered zzso zzso Although with reduced efficiency, zzso zzso zzso P is able to cleave zzso zzso in zzso and in zzso We conclude that the observed in zzso defects upon disruption of the zzso interaction are either due to a global zzso in zzso maturation or severe zzso of zzso for a zzso zzso
