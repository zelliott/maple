zzso membrane proteins in sufficient quantity for zzso study and zzso applications has been a difficult zzso Use of the zzso binding zzso dual tag system with zzso as an expression host is emerging as a high zzso method to enhance membrane protein yield, zzso and zzso but fails to be effective for certain zzso zzso the variables in this system to fine-tune for efficiency can ultimately be a daunting zzso To identify factors critical to success in this expression system, we have selected to study zzso a novel membrane protein from Human zzso zzso with potent zzso ability and a possible role in the zzso of the disease multiple zzso 

We expressed full-length zzso as a zzso fusion to a zzso binding zzso tag and examined the effects of temperature, growth medium type, cell strain type, zzso zzso reducing conditions and zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso appeared to have the greatest effect on zzso at zzso full-length protein was either poorly expressed zzso or zzso zzso whereas at zzso expression was improved especially in the zzso of zzso cells and in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 and zzso zzso of the fusion protein in these strains were estimated to be zzso zzso and zzso times greater, respectively, compared to zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso is isolated with an zzso zzso bond under these conditions, and we zzso whether this zzso bond was critical to high yield expression of full-length zzso zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that this zzso was not critical for full-length protein zzso but it is more likely that strained zzso conditions zzso factors which promote protein zzso This hypothesis is supported by the fact that use of minimal media could enhance protein production compared to zzso LB zzso 

We have found optimal conditions for zzso expression of zzso from Human zzso zzso in zzso and have demonstrated that zzso quantities of pure protein can be zzso zzso zzso conditions such as low temperature, minimal media and an zzso environment appeared essential for zzso full-length protein production and this information may be useful for expressing other membrane proteins of zzso
