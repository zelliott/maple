The crystal structure of zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A resolution and that of its complexes with the zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso and the zzso DNA zzso zzso at zzso A zzso Two zzso duplexes of the zzso DNA, stacked zzso are bound to the zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso interactions of this complex are zzso for zzso DNA zzso In contrast, only one zzso zzso duplex is bound and deviates considerably from zzso zzso zzso Most notably, a zzso of approximately 50 degrees is observed at the central zzso step with a zzso zzso of the major zzso zzso hydrogen bonds between the zzso and the recognition base pairs occur exclusively in the major zzso These interactions appear highly zzso as they are all made through one short surface loop zzso zzso zzso Numerous contacts with the sugar zzso backbone extending beyond the recognition sequence are observed in both types of zzso However, the total surface area buried on complex formation is zzso zzso zzso larger in the case of zzso DNA zzso Two zzso side zzso zzso and zzso are close to the zzso zzso group in the zzso complex and most probably provide oxygen zzso for binding the essential zzso zzso An important role is also indicated for zzso which together with the two zzso functions appears to be zzso in the otherwise unrelated structure of zzso zzso The structural results give new insight into the physical basis of the remarkable sequence specificity of this zzso
