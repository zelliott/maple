zzso zzso virus zzso leader zzso and a synthetic zzso of the same sequence were found to inhibit the replication of zzso DNA in zzso In contrast, the small zzso transcribed by the zzso defective interfering particle zzso did not prevent zzso DNA zzso The zzso produced by leader zzso was at the level of zzso protein zzso complex formation, the initiation step of zzso DNA zzso zzso requires the zzso zzso DNA zzso complex zzso the zzso zzso zzso and nuclear factor zzso zzso replication in the presence of leader zzso was restored when the concentration of zzso or zzso nuclear extract was increased or by the addition of zzso zzso or zzso cell DNA zzso zzso to inhibited replication zzso Furthermore, the activities of both zzso DNA zzso could be inhibited by the leader zzso These results suggest that zzso leader zzso is the viral agent responsible for zzso of zzso and possibly cellular DNA replication during zzso zzso
