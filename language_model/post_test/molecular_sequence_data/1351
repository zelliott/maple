An open reading frame zzso zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso extending from zzso zzso with similarity to the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso specifying type II zzso zzso zzso was expressed in a zzso zzso coli zzso The zzso protein with a zzso mass of 39 zzso was zzso to apparent zzso by column zzso The protein was shown to zzso the conversion of zzso zzso into zzso zzso and vice versa at rates of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, as diagnosed by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are required for zzso zzso the highest rates were found with zzso zzso is required under zzso but not under zzso zzso zzso The zzso is related to a widespread family of zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso and was shown to zzso the formation of zzso from zzso albeit at a low rate of 1 zzso zzso genes specifying type II zzso zzso zzso were found in the zzso of zzso and of certain zzso but not in the zzso of zzso animals and zzso The analysis of the occurrence of zzso and zzso genes in conjunction with the zzso and zzso zzso in 283 completed and unfinished zzso zzso revealed 10 different zzso Type II zzso is essential in some important human pathogens including zzso zzso and zzso zzso where it may represent a novel target for zzso zzso
