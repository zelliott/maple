Previous zzso mapping studies showed that zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of small zzso resistance plasmids which replicate by a zzso zzso zzso in each case is initiated at the zzso origin zzso by a zzso zzso zzso which makes a zzso zzso zzso to form a zzso zzso replication zzso A comparison of sequencing results for the zzso gene of zzso with data for the products of five other zzso rep genes allows a prediction to be made of the segments of the primary structure of zzso which are likely to be responsible for zzso recognition of the zzso region by each zzso zzso
