zzso zzso associated protein of 25 zzso is a neural specific protein that has been implicated in the synaptic zzso zzso and fusion zzso It is tightly associated with zzso and it is one of the major zzso proteins found in zzso The functional role of zzso for zzso is zzso In this report, we show that the zzso of zzso is rapidly turned over in zzso cells, with a zzso of approximately 3 zzso and the zzso for the protein is 8 zzso zzso of zzso to zzso at positions 85, 88, 90, and 92 reduced the zzso to 9, 21, 42, and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Additional zzso of either zzso or zzso nearly abolished zzso of the zzso A similar effect on membrane binding for the zzso zzso was observed, which correlated with the degree of zzso These results suggest that all four zzso zzso are involved in zzso and that membrane association of zzso may be regulated through dynamic zzso
