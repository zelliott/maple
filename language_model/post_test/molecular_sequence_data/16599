To screen the genes of zzso zzso cells zzso related to the property of zzso growth, and clone the full-length zzso of differential zzso gene for functional zzso 

zzso were collected from the hair of an individual aged 18 approximately 30 6 hours after the zzso The complete zzso of hair were isolated and then zzso The total DNA was zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was employed to screen out the genes zzso expressed in the zzso under the state of zzso growth pattern in zzso Then, rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso technique was used to amplify the full-length zzso of zzso in the zzso and zzso methods were used to analyze their possible zzso 

A zzso library of human zzso was set up, and some zzso and zzso genes in the zzso were screened out zzso zzso was identified to be a gene of 400 zzso zzso zzso analyses and databases searching on the Internet indicated that this gene was mapped on zzso 3 zzso and included an open reading frame with 195 zzso coding for an expected zzso soluble zzso The putative protein belonged to zzso family and was zzso to zzso gene in zzso 

The establishment of zzso library of zzso provides a solid foundation for further screening the genes related to zzso growth and analyzing their regulatory mechanisms in zzso Further more, zzso in zzso may act as a zzso of a functional complex and play a role on zzso regulation within zzso
