Four strains of zzso zzso bacteria, which had very similar zzso properties, were isolated from the Baltic zzso The results of zzso zzso experiments, indicated that three of the new zzso were closely zzso while the fourth was only moderately related to the other zzso zzso signature and zzso structural detail analyses of the zzso zzso of strain zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso indicated that this isolate is related to the alpha zzso of the class zzso Although our zzso resemble members of the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso assignment to either of these zzso was excluded on the basis of their markedly lower DNA zzso zzso We propose that these organisms should be placed in a new zzso zzso zzso is the type species of this zzso and the type strain of zzso zzso is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
