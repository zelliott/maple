The zzso class I zzso zzso zzso is a zzso highly zzso zzso zzso zzso interacting with the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso T zzso We have previously reported the presence of a zzso zzso zzso repeat harboring a peculiar zzso zzso characterized by a frame shift zzso leading to a premature zzso stop zzso thus denying the zzso of its zzso zzso zzso Given that this is the most common zzso zzso zzso found, we set out to analyze the functional consequences of zzso tail zzso Here, we show native expression of zzso at the zzso surface of human zzso zzso the site of putative interaction with zzso T and zzso zzso We then zzso in polarized zzso cells, that although the full-length zzso protein is sorted to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso construct as well as the naturally occurring zzso zzso are zzso transported to the zzso zzso zzso zzso identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso tandem as the zzso sorting zzso zzso the zzso location of zzso within zzso cells is governed by its zzso tail, zzso impairment in zzso zzso individuals, perhaps relevant to the zzso surveillance exerted by zzso and T zzso on zzso zzso
