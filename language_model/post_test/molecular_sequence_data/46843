Of the six major zzso of zzso C virus zzso infectious zzso clones of only zzso 1 have been zzso Here, we report the construction of an infectious zzso clone representing a second major zzso zzso zzso zzso This infectious clone zzso encodes the consensus zzso of strain zzso zzso zzso Its zzso zzso differs from those of the infectious clones of zzso zzso and zzso by approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso clones constructed from infectious clones of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso were not zzso zzso transcripts of four zzso containing the zzso structural genes zzso zzso and zzso in the backbone of an infectious zzso zzso clone zzso were not viable in a zzso regardless of whether zzso was from the zzso or zzso zzso However, the zzso was subsequently infected with zzso transcripts of each of the two infectious parent zzso indicating that the inability of the zzso to replicate was intrinsic to the clones and not the result of zzso protective immune zzso
