The zzso zzso zzso against zzso toxin zzso 3 zzso zzso was zzso and investigated by two-dimensional transferred zzso difference zzso and molecular zzso The zzso sequence of zzso which does not bind zzso zzso shares remarkable zzso to that of zzso and zzso which are both zzso zzso that bind the zzso However, due to a shortened heavy chain zzso zzso assumes a radically different combining site zzso The assignment of the combining site interactions to specific zzso zzso was completed by use of zzso a truncated zzso analogue in which zzso was zzso by zzso specific zzso of individual zzso chains of the zzso and a computer model for the zzso zzso of zzso zzso distance restraints were then applied to the calculated model of the zzso to generate a three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso The combining site was found to be a very zzso cavity composed of seven aromatic zzso Charged zzso are found in the periphery of the combining zzso The zzso zzso zzso form a zzso inside the combining zzso The contact area between the zzso and the zzso zzso is 388 zzso about half of the contact area observed in zzso zzso
