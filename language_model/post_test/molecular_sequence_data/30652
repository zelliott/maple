We have identified a novel integrated form of the zzso zzso Ty consisting of multiple elements joined into large zzso These zzso were first identified among zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells of zzso zzso which contain Ty insertions at zzso alpha that result in the expression of that normally silent zzso These insertions are zzso zzso of both the induced genetically marked Ty element and unmarked Ty zzso zzso analysis of the zzso indicated that the zzso include tandem direct repeats of Ty elements separated by only a single long terminal zzso The zzso junction fragments of one zzso were cloned and shown to contain a zzso zzso of the target sequence that is characteristic of a Ty zzso zzso In addition, the zzso include rearranged Ty elements that do not have normal long terminal repeat zzso We have also identified zzso Ty insertions at other zzso sites and as insertions that allow expression of a zzso zzso gene on a zzso The results suggest that Ty zzso includes an intermediate that can undergo zzso to produce zzso
