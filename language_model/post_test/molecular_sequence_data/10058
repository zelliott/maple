We previously isolated the zzso upstream sequences of the mouse zzso zzso in which putative binding sites for several zzso factors were identified between zzso and zzso In the study reported here, the promoter activity of the zzso zzso zzso sequences of the zzso promoter, and the activity of the zzso zzso promoter were investigated in several zzso zzso cell lines showing different levels of zzso and zzso expression as well as different zzso and zzso zzso zzso specificity and optimal activity of zzso expression in zzso zzso was zzso by zzso sequences located between zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso region zzso zzso to zzso and a zzso box element zzso zzso had a major regulatory zzso The zzso specificity of the zzso promoter, on the other hand, was zzso by a combination of positive regulatory zzso a zzso region zzso zzso to zzso and a zzso box zzso zzso and zzso elements inside the zzso zzso Interestingly, the maximum zzso effect of the zzso element was observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso binding studies indicated that the zzso region of the zzso promoter was mainly recognized by zzso nuclear factors, whereas both zzso and zzso factors were involved in the interaction of the zzso region of the zzso zzso Common factors (probably related to the zzso zzso seemed also to be involved in the recognition of the zzso element of both the zzso and zzso zzso but additional specific factors participated in the interaction with the zzso box of the zzso zzso Our studies also support the hypothesis that loss or modification of some of the regulatory factors occurs during mouse skin tumor zzso
