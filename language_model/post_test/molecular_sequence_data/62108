The complete sequences of nuclear zzso DNA zzso internal transcribed zzso regions zzso were determined for species belonging to six zzso from the zzso zzso as well as for the anomalous zzso zzso and zzso zzso trees constructed by distance zzso maximum zzso and maximum likelihood methods showed that zzso and zzso were outside the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This finding supports previous zzso zzso and molecular evidence that zzso and zzso do not belong to the zzso zzso Within the true zzso zzso the zzso of zzso and species were zzso with zzso zzso suggesting that zzso sequences can provide enough zzso sites to allow resolution below the zzso zzso This is the first evidence of the zzso of zzso zzso based on nuclear DNA zzso
