zzso is a small protein in zzso zzso which zzso the activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso step of de zzso zzso zzso zzso is a downstream zzso of the zzso cell cycle checkpoint zzso The zzso by zzso zzso during S phase or in response to DNA damage leads to diminished levels of zzso zzso of zzso increases the population of active zzso which raises cellular zzso zzso In this study using mass zzso and zzso zzso we have identified the region of zzso zzso to be between zzso 52 and 64 containing the sequence zzso This is the first identification of a zzso sequence of a zzso biological zzso This sequence is quite different from the consensus zzso zzso sequence reported previously from zzso library zzso The specific zzso were identified to be zzso zzso and zzso by chemical modification of these zzso to zzso followed by collision activated zzso To investigate further zzso zzso we constructed the single zzso zzso zzso zzso and the triple zzso zzso and compared their degrees of zzso with that of wild type zzso We observed a zzso decrease in the relative zzso of zzso compared with that of wild type, a zzso decrease in zzso and little or no decrease in the zzso zzso There was no observed zzso incorporation in the triple zzso suggesting that zzso zzso and zzso in zzso are the sites of zzso Further zzso studies reveal that zzso zzso requires an zzso zzso at the zzso position, and there is zzso between the zzso zzso These results show that zzso has a unique zzso zzso
