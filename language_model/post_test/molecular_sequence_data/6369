zzso are efficient gene transfer zzso for a variety of cell zzso To date, the most widely used methods to construct zzso zzso involve either in zzso zzso or zzso between one-half of the virus zzso previously cloned in a zzso zzso and engineered to contain the desired expression zzso and the other half of the virus zzso prepared from zzso Although quite effective, these approaches produce viral progeny containing a mixture of zzso and parental background zzso Thus the recovery of the zzso virus can be difficult, especially when it grows more slowly than the parental zzso To improve selection and recovery of zzso zzso we have constructed an zzso zzso zzso in which the E1 region has been replaced by the zzso zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso virus type zzso We show that infection of cells with zzso in the presence of the zzso analog zzso zzso prevents viral zzso The conditional lethal zzso introduced in zzso makes it a valuable tool to zzso parental background virus in the presence of zzso and isolate zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso expression cassette has been replaced by a new zzso
