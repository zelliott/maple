Plant genes usually have multiple potential zzso addition signals, and different sites are used for 3' processing of transcripts from a single zzso In contrast, we show here that four barley genes that also have multiple zzso addition signals zzso to the plant consensus use only one zzso In each of these zzso the region of zzso for zzso addition is centered on a zzso zzso This zzso is followed by a zzso sequence zzso to sequences involved in zzso of plant zzso zzso zzso immediately following, in turn, are four or five zzso complementary to the zzso immediately preceding zzso in each zzso The presence of these zzso sequences and their association with a single region for zzso addition in three different gene types zzso and zzso zzso genes and a zzso zzso that otherwise are not zzso in their 3' zzso sequences suggest that they might participate in some common regulatory mechanism shared by these zzso
