zzso zzso zzso viruses zzso belong to the zzso family and are divided into two groups, typified by strain zzso virus and members of the TO zzso zzso zzso The highly virulent zzso group causes acute encephalitis in mice, while the TO group is less virulent and causes a chronic zzso disease which is associated with viral persistence in zzso This persistent central nervous system infection with zzso resembles multiple sclerosis zzso in humans and has thus become an important model for studying zzso It has been shown that some of the zzso associated with viral persistence are located on the zzso proteins of the TO zzso zzso comparisons of two persistent strains zzso and zzso and a highly virulent strain zzso showed that the most significant structural variations between these two groups of viruses are located on the sites that may influence virus binding to cellular zzso Most animal viruses attach to specific cellular receptors that, in part, determine host range and tissue zzso In this study, atomic models of zzso zzso were built with the known structures of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Comparisons among the known zzso zzso and zzso structures as well as the predicted models for the zzso zzso suggested that a gap on the zzso surface next to the putative zzso binding site, composed of zzso from zzso and zzso may be important in determining viral persistence by influencing virus attachment to cellular zzso such as zzso Our results showed that zzso the first three sugar molecules of common zzso on the surface of zzso cells, zzso virus binding to the host cell and infection with the persistent zzso virus but not the zzso zzso and zzso 39 zzso
