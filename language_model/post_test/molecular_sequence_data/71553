A novel zzso zzso zzso the cell surface zzso zzso beta is expressed in mouse zzso cells and in a variety of cultured human cancer zzso In both mouse and human cells, the cancer zzso zzso zzso referred to as zzso has an extended zzso zzso as compared to the zzso beta zzso zzso expressed in normal kidney and zzso zzso The work zzso aimed to determine the molecular mechanisms for the expression of zzso beta and zzso in normal and cancer cells, zzso Analysis of the zzso end of the mouse zzso beta gene revealed that the unique sequences in the beta and zzso zzso zzso are zzso by separate zzso that are alternately zzso and transcribed from independent zzso By contrast, the human zzso beta and zzso zzso have identical sequences except for 87 additional bases in the zzso zzso sequence of zzso indicating that a single, mixed usage promoter directs expression of the zzso The region upstream of the human zzso zzso zzso start site contained elements with zzso to the promoters of zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso the latter were essential to zzso zzso promoter activity in cancer zzso zzso zzso zzso increased zzso zzso zzso levels in cultured human colon cancer cells, providing further evidence that zzso sites are actively involved in zzso zzso zzso
