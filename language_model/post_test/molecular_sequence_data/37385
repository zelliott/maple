All zzso zzso zzso strains carry the zzso zzso zzso the zzso type III zzso zzso system, which operates at 37 degrees zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso strains possess a second, zzso zzso zzso system called zzso which operates, at least in zzso under zzso and zzso zzso zzso Six open reading zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso neighbor the zzso genes zzso the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso system under zzso zzso zzso is a zzso for zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso share some similarity with zzso zzso and the zzso zzso by the zzso locus of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso In addition, zzso also zzso the zzso zzso under zzso conditions, indicating that zzso is a potential zzso of both zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could also be zzso by zzso zzso but no functional zzso of zzso was observed, which indicates that despite their similarity the zzso and the zzso systems are not zzso When expressed from the zzso promoter, zzso and zzso could also be zzso via the zzso zzso However, they could not form zzso pores in zzso target cells and could not substitute for zzso and zzso for zzso of zzso zzso
