The aim of this study was to determine whether the zzso element of the zzso zzso zzso gene can be activated by zzso a recently identified member of the nuclear factor 1 family of zzso zzso zzso zzso confirmed that zzso is mainly expressed in rat zzso zzso A full-length zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso library of rat zzso zzso and was used for preparation of a construct zzso a fusion protein of zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the fusion protein in zzso was detected with an zzso to zzso The fusion protein activated the expression of a zzso reporter gene in zzso zzso zzso with a reporter construct containing the zzso element, but not with other zzso lacking the zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso may be involved in the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso
