zzso of rice seed zzso genes is dramatically regulated over a short period of seed zzso To characterize the expression mechanism of the rice seed storage protein zzso their expression of major storage protein genes (16 zzso zzso 13 zzso zzso and type II zzso were compared by zzso zzso zzso Their coordinate expression suggests that the zzso regulatory machinery is shared among the zzso zzso and zzso We isolated two novel zzso genes for zzso zzso and zzso and obtained the promoter region of the zzso gene by zzso The zzso regions of these three rice seed storage protein genes were found to contain some similar zzso zzso Nuclear extract partially zzso from maturing rice seeds was used for the gel shift zzso of the zzso region of the zzso zzso We identified two DNA sequences of zzso gene which were recognized by independent zzso zzso The complexes of these DNA sequences and zzso proteins were inhibited by the fragments containing the zzso regions of the zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that these three genes share zzso zzso
