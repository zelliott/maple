zzso computer modeling is used to further investigate the hypothesis forwarded in the accompanying paper of an evolutionary relationship between four related families of zzso zzso proteins and the zzso of zzso channel zzso zzso models are developed for the zzso regions of one member from each of the three more distinct zzso families, zzso a zzso protein from zzso coli, a zzso protein from zzso zzso and a zzso protein from zzso zzso The portions of the four consecutive zzso motifs in the zzso that can be aligned with zzso channel sequences are modeled directly from the recently determined crystal structure of the zzso zzso channel from zzso zzso The remaining portions are developed using our previously accumulated theoretical modeling criteria and zzso zzso the use of these criteria and principles is further supported by the now verified predictions of our previous zzso channel modeling efforts and the degree to which they are satisfied by the known structure of the zzso zzso Thus the observed ability of the portions of the zzso models derived from the zzso crystal structure to also satisfy the theoretical modeling criteria provides additional support for an evolutionary link with zzso channel zzso Efforts to further satisfy the criteria and principles suggest that the zzso proteins from zzso and plants zzso zzso and zzso form zzso and/or zzso complexes in the zzso Furthermore, analysis of the zzso models in relation to the sequence conservation within and between the protein families suggests structural details for previously proposed mechanisms for the linked zzso of zzso with zzso and zzso Suggestions are also given for experiments to test these structures and zzso
