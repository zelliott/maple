The blue light receptors termed zzso mediate zzso responses in seed zzso However, the mechanisms by which zzso signals regulate plant development remain zzso In this study, zzso functions were analyzed using the moss zzso zzso This moss has recently become known as the only plant species in which gene replacement occurs at a high frequency by zzso zzso Two zzso genes were identified in zzso and single and double zzso of these genes were zzso Using these zzso it was revealed that zzso signals regulate many steps in moss development, including induction of side branching on zzso and zzso induction and zzso In addition, the disruption of zzso altered zzso responses, including the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso were more sensitive to external zzso than wild type in a blue zzso manner, suggesting that zzso light signals repress zzso signals to control plant zzso
