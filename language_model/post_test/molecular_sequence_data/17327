zzso are organized at the outer aspect of zzso and host the process of zzso central to the visual zzso We have isolated a novel human zzso zzso which is predominantly expressed in the zzso of human zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein that has three widely spaced zzso zinc finger zzso There are three potential nuclear zzso signals and clusters of charged zzso acids in the zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso of the zzso gene are also expressed in zzso of mouse and bovine zzso The zzso fusion protein zzso to zzso and zzso when expressed in zzso zzso zzso shift zzso suggests that zzso may not be a zzso acid binding zzso unlike most other zzso zzso Taken together, these observations suggest that zzso is a shuttling regulatory protein expressed in zzso of the human zzso that may be involved in zzso or protein regulation of zzso genes and therefore have role in retinal disease zzso
