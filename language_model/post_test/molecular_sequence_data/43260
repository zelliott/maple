zzso zzso zzso regulates zzso by carrying out the zzso zzso 15 zzso of zzso zzso inducing zzso zzso zzso zzso is a large zzso consisting of a zzso zzso domain of approximately 350 zzso acids preceded by a zzso domain of approximately 550 zzso The functional properties of the zzso zzso domain were investigated by expressing truncated forms of zzso in zzso zzso Both positive and negative regulatory zzso were zzso zzso important for zzso function were mapped to a central region zzso zzso This region is not required for zzso activity or nuclear zzso suggesting it may be involved in zzso zzso The negative regulatory domain resides in the zzso third of zzso zzso zzso lacking this domain are more effective at delaying zzso than zzso zzso The negative regulatory domain contains clusters of potential zzso zzso zzso zzso to monitor the abundance of zzso zzso and protein during the cell cycle were also carried zzso
