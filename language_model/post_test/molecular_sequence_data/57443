We have isolated a novel zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso as a zzso A zzso which we propose to call zzso was zzso from the culture zzso by zzso out, repeated zzso zzso and affinity zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed a single band having an apparent molecular weight of 19,000 on sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso When synthetic peptides were used as zzso zzso showed high specificity for zzso zzso with zzso of zzso acid and zzso acid as zzso revealed that the zzso was about zzso higher for a zzso bond than an zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso the zzso of two zzso bonds in the oxidized insulin zzso within the initial reaction time until the starting material was completely zzso zzso and zzso zzso completely inhibited zzso while zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso did not inhibit the zzso The findings indicate that zzso can be classified as a zzso zzso and is highly specific for a zzso bond in comparison with an zzso zzso To zzso the complete primary structure and precursor of zzso its gene was cloned from zzso DNA of the producing strain, and the zzso sequence was zzso Consideration of the zzso and zzso zzso sequences of the mature protein of zzso indicates that it consists of zzso zzso zzso which follows a zzso of 170 zzso In comparison with the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Jensen, zzso and zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso in the zzso acid zzso The processing site for maturation of zzso was a unique sequence zzso so that the zzso could be released by zzso of the zzso bond between zzso and zzso
