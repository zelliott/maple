The complement system comprises a complex array of zzso and zzso proteins that is essential for the operation of the innate as well as the zzso immune zzso The complement system can be activated in three ways: by the classical zzso which is initiated by zzso complexes, by the alternative zzso initiated by certain structures on microbial surfaces, and by an zzso zzso that is initiated by the binding of zzso zzso zzso first described as zzso zzso to zzso zzso is structurally related to the complement C1 zzso zzso and seems to activate the complement system through an associated zzso zzso known as zzso zzso 4) or zzso zzso zzso which is similar to zzso and zzso of the classical zzso zzso binds to specific zzso structures found on the surface of a range of zzso including bacteria, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and exhibits zzso activity through killing zzso by the zzso zzso complement components or by promoting zzso The level of zzso in plasma is genetically determined, and zzso is associated with frequent infections in childhood, and possibly also in adults (for review, see zzso zzso We have now identified a new zzso zzso zzso zzso which shows a striking zzso with the previously reported zzso zzso and the two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Thus complement zzso through zzso like the classical pathway, involves two zzso zzso and may zzso the development of the specific immune system of zzso
