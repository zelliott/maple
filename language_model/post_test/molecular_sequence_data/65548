zzso and zzso of zzso bound to zzso are believed to be involved in Parkinson's and other neurodegenerative zzso On zzso zzso the zzso of zzso forms two curved zzso linked by a short zzso However, its structure on zzso zzso has not been zzso zzso Using MD simulations with an implicit membrane model we show here that, on a zzso mixed zzso the truncated zzso zzso zzso forms a bent zzso zzso of the zzso is not due to the protein sequence or membrane zzso but to collective motions of the long zzso The backbone of the zzso is approximately zzso A above the membrane surface, with some zzso partially inserted in the membrane zzso The zzso zzso is zzso (11 zzso complete three full zzso as opposed to zzso zzso of an ideal zzso with zzso zzso towards the zzso zzso charged zzso towards the zzso and zzso on the zzso zzso A series of zzso which are characteristic for zzso and perhaps a zzso site, is also located at the zzso interface with their side chain often hydrogen bonded to the zzso zzso The calculations show that the energy penalty for change in zzso from the zzso to zzso on the zzso membrane is overcome by favorable zzso zzso The binding of truncated zzso to zzso is zzso It prefers zzso zzso but it also binds marginally to a neutral zzso via its zzso zzso of zzso zzso on the mixed membrane is energetically zzso However, it slightly interferes with membrane zzso This might promote lateral diffusion of the protein on the membrane surface and facilitate assembly of zzso that zzso zzso
