Several zzso appear to have independently evolved mechanisms by which they undergo retrograde transport from the cell membrane to the zzso zzso zzso Recent insights into zzso protein degradation zzso now provide clues as to why these toxins have selected the zzso as the site of cell zzso We propose that they disguise themselves as zzso proteins to enter the zzso zzso We further link the observation that these toxins have few, if any, zzso zzso to the need to escape zzso protein degradation, the ultimate destination of the zzso zzso The actual membrane zzso step remains zzso but studies on viral immune evasion mechanisms indicate that zzso across the zzso zzso zzso may involve zzso zzso the zzso process of these toxins opens new avenues for preventing their entry into zzso In addition, this knowledge can be exploited to create zzso pharmaceuticals that act on zzso zzso
