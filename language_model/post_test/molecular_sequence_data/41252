Here we report the isolation of 6 temperate zzso zzso that are prevented from replicating within the laboratory strain zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso system of this zzso These zzso are only the second identified group of naturally occurring zzso demonstrated to be blocked for replication by a zzso zzso system, and our results provide the first evidence that the zzso zzso type zzso zzso system can function in zzso zzso Previous studies have highlighted the importance of the zzso adjacent motif zzso and a zzso zzso seed sequence in zzso zzso zzso Through engineering of a zzso region of zzso zzso to make it a target of resistance by the zzso system and screening for zzso that escape zzso resistance, we show that zzso within the zzso and seed sequence and across the zzso regions are critical for the functioning of this zzso zzso We also demonstrate that zzso zzso can acquire zzso content in response to zzso zzso challenge, illustrating the zzso nature of this zzso zzso Finally, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso system mediates a zzso of resistance to a zzso based on the level of zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso This work introduces a new in zzso system to study zzso resistance and an additional set of tools for the zzso of zzso zzso
