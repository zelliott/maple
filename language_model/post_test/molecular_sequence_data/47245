The zzso zzso belong to the family of zzso zzso that catalyze the zzso zzso of their zzso to a corresponding zzso zzso They play a major role in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso distribution of zzso zzso and related zzso has previously been considered to be zzso Here we show that human zzso zzso zzso is present in the zzso A highly specific, affinity zzso zzso zzso against zzso was used to analyze the zzso zzso of native zzso in a variety of zzso cells by in zzso zzso Native zzso was found to be present in the nucleus as well as the zzso in several cell zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated a predominantly nuclear zzso of zzso zzso zzso in these zzso We have identified an zzso zzso nuclear zzso signal that is both necessary and sufficient to direct zzso and a zzso reporter protein to the zzso We also show zzso binding to the nuclear import zzso zzso zzso Similar putative zzso nuclear zzso sequences are found in other zzso zzso The results presented here suggest that the zzso zzso salvage zzso may operate in the zzso This zzso may have implications in the regulation of zzso and zzso metabolism and zzso acid zzso
