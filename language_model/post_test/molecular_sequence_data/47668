In normal zzso the zzso of shed zzso outer segments is zzso in part through a zzso zzso protein located in the zzso retinal zzso zzso zzso As zzso rats of the Royal College of Surgeons have a zzso in which the retinal zzso zzso zzso is unable to zzso the shed outer zzso it is hypothesized that zzso zzso expression will be lost with the progression of zzso zzso zzso and molecular techniques have been used to study the zzso expression of the zzso zzso in normal and zzso retinal zzso zzso By zzso the zzso zzso is localized to the retinal zzso zzso zzso membrane region, beginning around 5 days zzso in both normal and zzso zzso In zzso bands at 175 zzso are zzso by an zzso zzso zzso in zzso membrane samples from both normal and zzso zzso at all zzso times zzso zzso analysis reveals that zzso zzso message is present in normal and zzso zzso samples at all zzso time points zzso The present study demonstrates that the expression of the zzso zzso begins prior to outer segment differentiation and the initiation of zzso in both normal and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso continues to be unchanged during the progression of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
