We have characterized the side chain zzso for a single zzso analogue within a zzso protein containing 21 zzso and 1678 carbon atoms at natural isotope zzso To do this, the single zzso zzso of a zzso zzso of zzso (the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was modified to zzso zzso using freshly prepared zzso at room zzso zzso was accompanied by the rescue of zzso function at high specific zzso After the fastidious removal of the zzso zzso zzso zzso using a novel zzso dialysis zzso signals were monitored by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified in the zzso zzso corresponding to detection of the two zzso attached zzso zzso The identification was strengthened by comparison with the positions and pH shifts of spectral zzso for zzso controls, a small zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso control zzso pH zzso of the modified protein indicated an apparent zzso of zzso consistent with a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and a model in which the surrounding charged groups direct the zzso zzso zzso via both local zzso environment and zzso zzso
