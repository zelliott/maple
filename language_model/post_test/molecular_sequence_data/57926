zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor that is active against zzso zzso zzso and factor zzso Recently, it has been shown that it also has zzso activity against zzso We have investigated this activity of normal human zzso normal rabbit zzso and zzso zzso to His zzso human zzso and find that all are able to inhibit zzso and form stable sodium zzso zzso zzso The zzso values show that the zzso His zzso is a slightly better inhibitor of zzso than normal human zzso zzso zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of normal human zzso derived from the zzso zzso complex, shows zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso as with alpha zzso zzso possesses two overlapping zzso zzso one for zzso and the other for zzso zzso In contrast, with the zzso His zzso the zzso generated from the zzso of its complex with zzso demonstrated zzso between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso unlike alpha zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso as its zzso site in normal zzso but zzso the zzso zzso as its zzso site in the zzso His zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso center loop allows a degree of induced fit and therefore must be relatively zzso
