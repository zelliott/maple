zzso markers were developed and characterized to investigate genetic diversity and gene flow and to help in conservation efforts for the endangered zzso species zzso zzso zzso 

Eleven zzso zzso were characterized using 60 adult trees of two populations of zzso zzso from the Atlantic Forest of southern zzso zzso Of these, nine zzso were zzso with an average of zzso zzso per zzso The average expected zzso per population ranged from zzso to zzso The combined exclusion probability was zzso zzso 

Our results reveal that the zzso markers developed in this study are an effective tool for zzso and genetic structure analysis that may be useful for conservation zzso
