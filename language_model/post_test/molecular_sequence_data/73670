Recent zzso of zzso at the molecular level indicate that at least eight zzso genes are expressed by zzso of zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to determine whether these cloned zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed by zzso of the female zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis, in zzso zzso and zzso were performed using zzso and tissue from surgically removed human zzso tract specimens including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA to the tandem repeat regions of zzso 1, 2, 3, zzso zzso and 6; zzso to the tandem repeat regions of zzso 4, 6, and 7; and zzso that recognize unique zzso tandem repeats were zzso The data demonstrate that the zzso zzso expresses five zzso zzso zzso 1, 4, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso and zzso zzso express zzso 1 and 4, although zzso expression of zzso appears zzso zzso zzso expresses zzso and low amounts of zzso zzso zzso was detected only is scattered zzso zzso located in the zzso region in specimens from zzso and zzso zzso The only zzso detected in the zzso tube was zzso These data indicate that the zzso zzso expresses multiple zzso genes and that the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso also produce zzso that may function in zzso processes and protection of the zzso tract zzso
