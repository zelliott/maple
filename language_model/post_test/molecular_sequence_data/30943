The purpose of this study was to generate an zzso against the binding site of the zzso zzso Recently it has been demonstrated that complementary zzso sequences may zzso interacting zzso We determined whether or not an zzso directed against a zzso zzso specified by zzso complementary to the zzso of rat zzso zzso zzso would recognize the zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso over a protein A and then a zzso affinity zzso A specific zzso zzso affinity column also was zzso The specific zzso zzso recognized two proteins with molecular weights of 76 and 70 zzso in zzso from kidney and brain tissue containing the zzso This zzso also blocked binding of zzso to primary cultured zzso cells, whereas the zzso zzso did zzso Furthermore, the blocking efficiency of the zzso increased when more of the specific zzso zzso was zzso We also determined whether or not the zzso contained any biological activity by observing urine volume and urine zzso in the presence or absence of zzso or immune zzso Only the immune serum was able to reverse the zzso and zzso effects of zzso suggesting that the zzso antagonized the effects of zzso on the zzso Taken together with the observation that this zzso did not bind to zzso these data strongly indicate that an zzso to the zzso zzso binding site has been made and add further support to the molecular recognition zzso
