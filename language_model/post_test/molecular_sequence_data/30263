Chicken zzso proteins belong to the zzso zzso family of zzso nuclear zzso which share an identical DNA binding zzso They are involved in viral and cellular aspects of zzso regulation and they are capable of stimulating zzso initiation of zzso Using zzso data from peptides of isolated proteins and zzso supported zzso we have derived four zzso for zzso zzso which are zzso by three separate chicken zzso zzso alignments of zzso proteins from chicken and various zzso species provide evidence for a common genetic equipment among higher zzso in which several related zzso employing each differential zzso zzso generate an unexpectedly large family of diverse zzso zzso The extensive similarity of the zzso acid sequence throughout the complete coding regions between products of the same gene type in different species indicates a uniform selection pressure on all protein parts, also on those outside the zzso zzso
