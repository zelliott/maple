We report here the identification of zzso clusters with the genes required for the zzso of the core zzso zzso of two zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso zzso clusters shared all of the genes besides the ones zzso zzso In both zzso all of the genes were found in the zzso gene zzso although one common core zzso gene zzso was found in a different zzso location outside the zzso Since zzso zzso and zzso zzso share a core zzso zzso backbone extending up at least to the second zzso zzso the functions of the common zzso zzso genes were zzso by genetic zzso studies using zzso zzso zzso zzso The function of zzso zzso or zzso genes was identified by using as a surrogate zzso zzso from three zzso zzso zzso core zzso zzso Using this strategy, we were able to assign a zzso function to all of the zzso zzso zzso genes identified in the two strains zzso six new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrated an important variety of core zzso structures, despite being a single species of the zzso as well as high zzso zzso in zzso zzso
