The nuclear inclusion protein a zzso of zzso mosaic zzso is a zzso processing the viral zzso into functional zzso It has been shown that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso itself between zzso and zzso to generate a zzso protein lacking the zzso 20 zzso zzso We have found a second internal zzso near the zzso resulting in the degradation of the zzso protein into a zzso zzso zzso of the active site zzso or zzso with zzso or zzso respectively, prevented the second zzso suggesting that the internal zzso is also due to the zzso activity of the zzso zzso This second internal zzso was found to occur between zzso and zzso eliminating the zzso 36 zzso acids from the zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso protein was not detected at all when it was measured using a zzso containing the zzso site between zzso and zzso as a zzso suggesting that the zzso region between zzso 208 and 223 contains essential zzso acids for the processing of zzso zzso The deletion analyses of the zzso region revealed that at least 217 zzso acids from the zzso are required for the zzso activity of the zzso zzso The point zzso of zzso to zzso zzso to zzso or zzso to zzso drastically abolished the zzso activity, demonstrating that zzso zzso and zzso are important for the processing of zzso zzso
