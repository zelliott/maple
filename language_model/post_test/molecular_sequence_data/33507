The structure of zzso T was determined by solution zzso zzso under strong zzso conditions: zzso zzso zzso solution at 5 degrees zzso Under these conditions it was possible to detect zzso zzso for the first time for this zzso This allowed a much zzso structure to be determined for zzso T in comparison with earlier zzso and zzso zzso zzso structures consistent with the experimental restraints were generated using a restrained MD simulation with a full empirical force zzso zzso zzso of zzso T take on a zzso structure with a heavy atom zzso of zzso zzso The structure is stabilized by hydrogen bonding to zzso oxygen atoms of zzso 4 and zzso 8, as well as backbone hydrogen bonding between zzso 5 and 7 that forms this region into a classic zzso
