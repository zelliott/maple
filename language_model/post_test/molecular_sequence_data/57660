Although cells from both zzso and zzso have been shown to produce a variety of soluble zzso in zzso it is not clear whether this reflects the in zzso zzso To study in zzso zzso zzso whole skin as well as zzso zzso and zzso from normal adult mice were prepared and zzso zzso zzso was then extracted and analyzed both by conventional and by competitive quantitative zzso chain zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso skin in zzso zzso expresses several zzso genes at moderate zzso zzso zzso or low zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso A striking, rapid zzso was observed for some of these zzso in the process of tissue zzso Of interest, the zzso and zzso compartments exhibited different induction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, and tumor necrosis zzso expression were detected zzso in the zzso whereas zzso of zzso was found to be most prominent in the zzso This pattern of zzso expression was also reflected in zzso generated from the respective zzso zzso Thus, this study determines the baseline in zzso zzso expression in the skin and the occurrence of immediate, zzso zzso on zzso These data should contribute to our understanding of both skin zzso and the zzso mechanisms initiated following injury to this zzso
