zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso coli zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso zzso to apparent zzso by a combination of ammonium zzso zzso and column zzso of zzso blue zzso dye zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 200 zzso zzso zzso zzso The molecular mass of the zzso determined on a zzso column was zzso zzso while the zzso molecular mass determined on zzso gel zzso was zzso zzso This implies that the zzso most probably exists as zzso The zzso acid sequence from the N zzso was determined zzso Based on this zzso the gene zzso the zzso was cloned using a simple zzso chain reaction zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the cloned gene revealed the presence of an open reading frame containing 120 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The zzso gene located in a zzso zzso zzso from zzso clone zzso was zzso zzso which was confirmed by the prominent increase in the zzso protein band on zzso zzso zzso It showed no zzso with the sequences of zzso or other zzso in zzso data zzso
