zzso zzso factors zzso constitute a group of three peptides zzso zzso and zzso widely distributed in the gastrointestinal zzso Although a zzso zzso effect of these peptides is well documented the mechanism of action is still zzso A zzso membrane extract was prepared from zzso stomach scrapings and incubated with a gel containing immobilized zzso zzso The affinity gel material was specifically zzso with a neutral buffer containing a high concentration of the zzso zzso zzso A subsequent zzso zzso showed one protein with a zzso of approximately 220 zzso and three proteins with zzso around 140 zzso The proteins were analyzed by zzso zzso followed by mass zzso sequencing of zzso zzso In this way a zzso beta zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso gene product were zzso The zzso gene product (also named zzso which is expressed in the zzso zzso is characterized by being a membrane protein with a short zzso region, a zzso domain and a large zzso zzso This protein thus zzso some of the criteria for being a zzso zzso or a zzso binding zzso
