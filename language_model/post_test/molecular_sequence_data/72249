We have analyzed the gene that encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso from the marine sponge zzso zzso which belongs to the most ancient and simple zzso groups, the zzso zzso are zzso found only in zzso The sponge gene contains two zzso in the zzso part of the zzso However, the rest of the protein zzso and zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso is zzso by a single zzso In contrast, all zzso zzso so far known only from higher animals zzso contain several zzso especially in the zzso The zzso of zzso zzso shows similarity with numerous members of zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso analysis of the sponge zzso indicates that this zzso zzso off first from the common tree of zzso zzso zzso zzso we assume that zzso found in the zzso of genes from higher animals, were inserted into these genes after splitting off the sponge zzso from other zzso organisms (over 600 million years zzso Our results support the view that ancient genes were not zzso zzso
