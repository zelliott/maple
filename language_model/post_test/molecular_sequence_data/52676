Nearly all intermediate filament proteins exhibit a highly zzso zzso acid motif zzso at the zzso end of their central zzso rod zzso We have analyzed its contribution to the various stages of assembly by using truncated forms of zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso and zzso which terminate exactly before this zzso by comparing them with the zzso and zzso zzso It is surprising that in buffers of low zzso strength and high pH where the full-length proteins form zzso both zzso and zzso associated into various high molecular weight zzso After initiation of zzso both zzso and zzso zzso into zzso zzso which rapidly zzso zzso to yield filaments of around 20 zzso in zzso Mass zzso by scanning transmission electron zzso revealed that both zzso and zzso filaments contained considerably more zzso per zzso than standard intermediate zzso This indicated that the zzso is crucial for the formation of authentic zzso complexes and also for the control of filament zzso rather than zzso during zzso To determine the structure of the zzso domain, we grew zzso of peptides containing the last 28 zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso fused at its zzso end to the 31 zzso zzso zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso factor zzso to facilitate appropriate zzso zzso The atomic structure shows that starting from zzso the two zzso gradually separate and that the coiled zzso zzso with zzso zzso while the downstream zzso fold away from the zzso zzso
