The zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family of gene regulatory zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso reveals that it consists of two structural zzso Both zzso are required for zzso operator zzso The N domain zzso zzso is zzso and binds zzso but specifically to operator zzso The C domain zzso zzso forms an independent zzso zzso domain and, by itself, has no zzso zzso In intact zzso the N and C zzso help to stabilize each other against zzso but appear to be linked rather zzso zzso of the zzso affinities of zzso and the isolated N domain indicate that binding to adjacent zzso in the whole operator is stabilized by zzso contacts between N zzso in addition to zzso contacts between C zzso
