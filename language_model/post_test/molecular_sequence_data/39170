We analyzed the mechanism of human zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso by tumor necrosis factor zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the expression of zzso zzso was enhanced by zzso zzso This zzso was completely inhibited by zzso zzso or protein synthesis zzso suggesting that the regulation of zzso gene expression depends on de zzso zzso and protein zzso Furthermore, the stimulation of zzso zzso by zzso was decreased by zzso and zzso zzso which are known nuclear factor zzso zzso For further analysis of gene regulation, we cloned and zzso the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso In the upstream region, we found two zzso motifs (named zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso An zzso mobility shift zzso indicated that two components of the zzso family, zzso and zzso bound with higher affinity to the zzso element than to the zzso zzso We also analyzed zzso gene expression using reporter plasmids expressing the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso significantly activated the zzso gene promoter, as a zzso upstream region of the zzso gene increased zzso gene expression in cells treated with zzso The zzso of promoter activity by zzso was abolished when a zzso was inserted into zzso or zzso These data indicated that zzso gene expression induced by zzso is zzso regulated via zzso of zzso In addition, there is a possibility that another factor may act in concert with zzso
