We have developed an array of seven zzso molecular logic gates that behaves as a full zzso in a single solution, with three zzso as zzso and two independent zzso zzso reactions as carry and sum zzso The sum output consisted of four new zzso logic zzso an zzso gate and three zzso zzso These gates required the design of a generic zzso zzso logic gate that can use any three-way combination of zzso or zzso zzso This generic gate design zzso an additional zzso element that zzso to convert zzso logic into NOT logic and vice zzso The system represents the first zzso single test tube, zzso full zzso and shows the complexity of control over molecular scale events that can be achieved with zzso logic zzso Similar systems could be applied to control autonomous therapeutic and diagnostic zzso
