The zinc finger, one of the major structural motifs used for sequence specific DNA zzso has been identified in many regulatory zzso By zzso involvement in zzso acid recognition has been implied for proteins that contain two zzso and two zzso spaced in accordance with the zinc finger zzso In this study we identify sequence dependent characteristics that are zzso in the zzso zinc fingers and are probably required for a functional zzso zinc zzso zzso of the zzso properties in view of the solved three zzso structure of a zinc finger, confirms the importance of most of these zzso The absence of the identified zzso characteristics from zzso containing sequences of zzso binding proteins suggest that they can be used to distinguish between zzso and actual DNA binding zinc zzso
