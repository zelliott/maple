The zzso zzso factor 1) zzso is a zzso acid binding protein involved in the synthesis of many zzso zzso particularly affects the translation and the stability of several zzso In an earlier study, the use of fold recognition methods allowed us to detect a relationship between zzso coli zzso and the zzso zzso This zzso was further validated by a series of zzso studies and the zzso structure was zzso on an zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso zzso zzso As our previous study predicted a large number of alternative zzso for the zzso region, we have determined whether the last 19 zzso zzso are necessary for protein zzso We find that the zzso truncated protein is fully capable of binding a zzso zzso zzso of 120 pm zzso 50 pm for full-length zzso This result shows that the functional core of zzso coli zzso resides in zzso zzso and confirms previous genetic zzso Using equilibrium unfolding studies, however, we find that full-length zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso more stable than its truncated zzso zzso zzso analysis of both truncated and full-length proteins indicates a structural zzso between the zzso upon zzso This zzso change is coupled to a reduction in zzso content, as determined by zzso transform zzso On the basis of these results, we propose that the zzso domain could protect the interface between the zzso and stabilize the zzso zzso zzso The origin of this zzso domain is also zzso
