In bacteria, zzso A is zzso in five steps from zzso The zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of the zzso A precursor zzso from zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso and zzso zzso via the zzso compound zzso The synthesis of zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso domain of zzso and occurs via the zzso intermediate zzso in two half zzso In this new study, the molecular characterization of the zzso domain is zzso In addition to the recently described zzso zzso two more zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified and shown to be involved in the second half reaction of the zzso zzso The proposed intermediate of the zzso zzso reaction, zzso was characterized by zzso zzso and it was shown that the intermediate is zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso will be of interest to zzso the crystal structure of zzso zzso with the reaction zzso zzso zzso is not absolutely specific for zzso and can couple derivatives of zzso to zzso However, no zzso structure is formed with zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso revealed that the zzso adjacent to zzso zzso of the strictly zzso zzso zzso is exchanged for zzso
