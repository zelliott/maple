zzso isolated from zzso libraries typically interact with, and thus help to zzso biologically relevant binding zzso of target zzso To characterize the binding zzso of the focal zzso protein zzso zzso peptides were isolated from two zzso random zzso zzso Altogether, five zzso zzso peptides were zzso Despite the lack of obvious sequence similarity between the zzso binding and competition studies indicated that all five interact with the zzso domain of zzso and do not disrupt the binding of zzso or zzso to zzso The identified peptides and zzso bind to zzso in a comparable manner; both bind to immobilized zzso but neither binds to soluble zzso unless the zzso of zzso has been zzso An analysis of zzso acid zzso of one of the peptides has revealed three zzso motifs that also occur in the region of zzso previously demonstrated to bind zzso zzso acid zzso within a zzso segment of zzso capable of binding zzso confirmed the importance of two of the motifs and suggest that zzso critical for binding are within a zzso zzso This study demonstrates that the zzso peptides interact with zzso in a biologically relevant manner and represent an excellent tool for further study of the zzso of zzso
