The zzso d terminal zzso complex is one of two terminal zzso which are components of the zzso respiratory chain of zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso reduction of oxygen to zzso zzso turnover generates zzso and zzso zzso across the zzso The zzso is a zzso containing 2 zzso of zzso IX and 1 or 2 zzso of zzso d per zzso of zzso To explain the functional properties of the zzso a simple model has been proposed in which it is speculated that the zzso prosthetic groups define two separate active sites on opposite sides of the membrane at which the zzso of zzso and the reduction of water, respectively, are zzso This paper represents an initial effort to define the zzso zzso of each of the three or four zzso within the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso Each of the 10 zzso zzso has been altered by zzso zzso with the expectation that zzso zzso are likely candidates for zzso zzso Eight of the 10 zzso zzso are not essential for zzso activity, and 2 appear to function as zzso zzso zzso zzso 186 in zzso I is required for the zzso zzso component of the zzso This zzso is likely to be located near the zzso surface of the zzso zzso 19, near the zzso zzso of zzso I also appears to be a zzso zzso It is concluded that two of the four or five expected zzso zzso zzso have been tentatively identified, although further work is required to confirm these zzso A minimum of two additional zzso zzso must be zzso other than zzso
