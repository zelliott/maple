zzso heavy chain variable region zzso genes expressed by human diffuse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were identified and analyzed with respect to zzso gene zzso In 67 cases of FL, zzso region genes were expressed in a pattern similar to that of normal B cells, with a predominance of the large zzso gene family being zzso In contrast, of the 17 cases of zzso there was an extremely biased use of zzso zzso Of these zzso tumors, zzso expressed genes from the small zzso gene family; and even among these tumors, there was a limited use of zzso with 11 cases producing zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso Although most of the zzso genes expressed by zzso tumor cells contained zzso with respect to their zzso counterparts, almost all of these zzso occurred before the zzso expansion of the zzso This contrasts with our previous findings of ongoing zzso in FL and represents a fundamental difference between these two zzso This preferential gene use implies an important role for the zzso gene family, and specifically for zzso in the genesis of zzso
