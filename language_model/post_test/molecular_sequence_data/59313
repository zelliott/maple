To determine the potential role of the Cystic Fibrosis zzso zzso zzso zzso gene in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso we analyzed this gene in two zzso zzso zzso analysis was zzso followed by direct sequencing of DNA samples showing zzso by zzso A new zzso not yet detected in connection with zzso was detected in one zzso zzso The zzso is in zzso 7 and causes an zzso acid change from zzso to zzso at position zzso zzso zzso zzso with the disease within the zzso We discovered another novel zzso zzso in an zzso patient of the second zzso These results indicate that zzso gene zzso may be involved in the zzso of zzso and represent a challenge for further study of the role of zzso in other zzso zzso
