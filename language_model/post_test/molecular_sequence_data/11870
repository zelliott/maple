zzso isolated zzso zzso type II zzso is an zzso dominant disorder that has been previously shown in some patients to be caused by zzso zzso gene defects that affect zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We report here our finding of multiple zzso transitions of the first base of the donor zzso site of zzso 3 zzso zzso in zzso II subjects from three zzso zzso from Sweden, North America, and South zzso This + zzso substitution creates an zzso site that was used to demonstrate that all affected individuals in all three families were zzso for the zzso To determine the effect of this zzso on zzso zzso processing, zzso cells were zzso with expression plasmids containing normal or zzso + zzso zzso and complementary zzso from the resulting zzso zzso were zzso The zzso was found to destroy the zzso zzso 3 donor zzso site, causing skipping of zzso 3 and loss of the zzso for zzso acids zzso of the mature zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso Our finding of zzso 3 skipping in transcripts of the + zzso zzso zzso is identical to our previous report of a different sixth base transition zzso zzso of the zzso 3 donor zzso site that also causes zzso zzso zzso analysis of an affected subjects' DNA from each of the three zzso zzso indicates that the + zzso zzso arose independently in each zzso Finding that neither zzso has the zzso in the first family suggests that it arose de zzso in that zzso Our data indicate that 1) + zzso zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and cause zzso zzso and 2) these zzso can present as de zzso zzso zzso
