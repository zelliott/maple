Recent evidence shows that zzso proteins zzso form a very large zzso zzso A recent study using the zzso chain reaction zzso identified six new candidate zzso in zzso making the total number of members of this family in zzso at least 11 zzso et zzso 1991, zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 88, zzso The functional basis of this diversity is not zzso Different zzso could have cell zzso functions, or they could perform different functions within the same cell type, or a mixture of zzso To investigate the degree to which different zzso are expressed in the same cell, we chose the zzso zzso During zzso zzso and in the egg, different types of zzso zzso zzso all are important to the normal development of the zzso after zzso Using zzso we identified and partially zzso four novel zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence comparison suggests that one of them, zzso may be the zzso counterpart of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is closely related to zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis reveals that the zzso zzso have different patterns of expression during zzso These data show that at least four zzso can exist in the same cell and that they can be zzso regulated during early development, and suggest their differential function in zzso and early zzso
