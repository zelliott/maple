Human zzso zzso zzso without the signal zzso was obtained using synthetic zzso and DNA zzso techniques and was successfully expressed in zzso zzso The zzso zzso which contained zzso zzso (including both the entire coding sequence and the sequence for signal zzso was zzso with zzso III and zzso so that the zzso zzso zzso could be zzso A zzso zzso was collected from the zzso zzso after partial zzso with zzso in order to remove the signal zzso zzso An intermediate zzso was formed after this zzso zzso and the synthetic zzso was zzso with zzso zzso of the zzso was confirmed by zzso zzso and zzso By joining the zzso zzso of zzso to the zzso we obtained the final zzso which contained the entire coding sequence of zzso without the signal zzso The coding sequence with correct orientation was inserted into zzso under the control of the zzso promoter zzso and mature zzso was expressed in zzso coli at 42 degrees zzso Both zzso zzso and inclusion bodies of the bacterial host zzso showed positive results by zzso and zzso zzso After zzso the biological activity of the expressed product was increased from zzso to about zzso The bacterial zzso showed a molecular weight of about zzso zzso by Western zzso zzso It can be completely inhibited by UK zzso but not by zzso zzso nor by normal rabbit zzso
