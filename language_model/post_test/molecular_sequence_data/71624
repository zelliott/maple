We have explored in detail the zzso of specificity for the zzso by human tissue zzso zzso of zzso containing the zzso zzso acid pair, after which zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a specific zzso for this zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides were zzso with the general structure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the natural zzso loop sequence of zzso from zzso to zzso and the kinetic parameters of their zzso by zzso were zzso All these peptides were zzso after the zzso zzso For comparison, we have also examined peptides containing the zzso loop sequences of human zzso inhibitor zzso and rat zzso zzso which were zzso after zzso and zzso bonds, zzso zzso peptides containing zzso sequences showed that the efficiency of zzso activity on the peptides containing zzso and zzso sequences depended on both the nature of the zzso zzso acid as well as on zzso at the zzso and zzso Moreover, we have made systematic modifications on the zzso pair zzso and on zzso and zzso at the zzso and zzso positions according to the zzso zzso zzso All together, we concluded that tissue zzso was very effective on short zzso that are zzso after the zzso zzso however, zzso after zzso or other zzso pairs of zzso acids was more restrictive, requiring additional zzso interaction and/or particular zzso zzso
