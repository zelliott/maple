The crystal structure of the alternating zzso zzso zzso has been determined to a resolution of zzso using zzso film zzso The zzso belong to space group zzso 22, a zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso with one strand in the zzso unit, and are zzso with a previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso gave a final R factor of zzso for zzso zzso The zzso adopts the zzso zzso The interchange of the terminal base pairs in the two zzso results in differences in the zzso contacts and may account for the differences in the zzso This zzso shows an zzso zzso of 30 degrees, in the direction of the major groove compared to 20 degrees in zzso and may be a consequence of additional contacts generated in zzso by the interchange of end base zzso The high zzso axis zzso appreciably influences the local zzso zzso The zzso exhibits relatively high inclination angles, and has a narrow major zzso The zzso parameters when described relative to the zzso zzso halves of the zzso give more reasonable zzso The crystal zzso local zzso zzso zzso angles, and zzso are described and also compared with the zzso zzso zzso
