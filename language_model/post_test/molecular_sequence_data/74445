The repeated zzso or zzso sequence and structural zzso elements in the zzso zzso region zzso of the zzso virus X zzso zzso play vital roles in the zzso life cycle by controlling translation, zzso zzso movement, and zzso It has already been shown that the repeated zzso or zzso sequence affect both zzso and zzso zzso while not affecting zzso zzso zzso and are also required for host protein zzso The functional significance of the repeated zzso sequence elements in the zzso zzso region was investigated by analyzing the effects of deletion and zzso zzso on zzso replication in zzso zzso plants and zzso zzso zzso zzso into zzso or zzso zzso introduced in the first zzso zzso element in the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso significantly affected viral zzso while zzso introduced in the second zzso zzso and third zzso zzso elements did zzso The fourth zzso zzso zzso element zzso affected virus zzso whereas zzso in the fifth zzso zzso significantly reduced virus replication due to the structure disruption of zzso by zzso and/or zzso zzso Further characterization of the first zzso element indicated that zzso of zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso caused severe symptom development as compared to that of wild type, while deletion of the single element zzso zzso zzso or tripling of this element caused reduced symptom zzso zzso and zzso zzso introduced into the first zzso element revealed the importance of zzso located at zzso positions 11 and zzso Altogether, these results indicate that the first zzso element is important for zzso zzso
