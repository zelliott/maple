zzso transitions between different modes of development in marine zzso are thought to be biased toward the loss of feeding zzso Because the zzso of feeding larvae is complex and zzso larvae or zzso zzso with zzso development often have simplified zzso it is presumed to be easier to lose a zzso stage than to zzso zzso Some authors have gone so far as to suggest that feeding larvae, zzso similar to the ancestral feeding larvae, cannot be zzso However, the zzso structures of some groups, most notably zzso are often retained in the zzso zzso of species that hatch as zzso zzso Therefore the zzso of feeding larvae using the same structures may be possible in these zzso Here we present the first zzso case for the recent zzso of feeding larvae within a zzso of zzso DNA sequence data show that zzso zzso a species of zzso zzso with zzso development, is zzso within a zzso of species with direct development, and that zzso zzso a species with direct development, appears to be zzso with respect to zzso zzso Observation of the zzso of zzso zzso shows that the features necessary for zzso feeding and swimming are retained in the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso shifts in zzso time and changes in zzso zzso could have resulted in the zzso of feeding larvae in this zzso
