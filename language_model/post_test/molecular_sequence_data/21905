In the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the second zzso involved in several signal zzso zzso The zzso for its production and degradation are well established for these cells, whereas less is known about the potential zzso zzso On the basis of a current zzso zzso project, we have identified a zzso family with at least 35 members, all of which zzso zzso protein zzso zzso They can be classified into 16 zzso with several members zzso Two of the zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed in more detail after molecular zzso They zzso zzso zzso of 770 and 819 zzso zzso respectively, whose overall domain organization resembles that in higher zzso The zzso contain a regulatory domain of two tandem zzso zzso sites flanked by an zzso region for zzso zzso and a zzso domain with highly zzso regions for zzso binding and zzso However, some zzso zzso show a different zzso In Western zzso zzso are detected both as zzso and as zzso zzso zzso labeling shows enrichment in the cell cortex, notably around the zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso electron zzso analysis reveals consistent labeling of zzso zzso of the membrane complex composed of cell membrane and cortical zzso stores, and of regions adjacent to zzso zzso bodies, zzso and trafficking zzso Since zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso upon zzso the role of zzso during zzso zzso is discussed, in addition to a role in zzso beat zzso
