As part of the zzso sorting complex required for transport zzso machinery, zzso is essential for zzso zzso membrane zzso degradation and the final stages of zzso zzso or overproduction of the protein can cause disruption of these vital processes and results in severe consequences for the zzso zzso expression is thus controlled zzso within a narrow range and this zzso has been mapped to the zzso of the zzso Here we zzso further the mechanisms of this regulation and describe a novel function of zzso zzso zzso in zzso this zzso We show that Tal zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso However, accessibility to these zzso is prevented by the presence of the other zzso zzso We show that zzso is a limiting factor, and consequently zzso expression surplus to zzso function is vulnerable to zzso The role of Tal in the regulation of zzso zzso control is highlighted when zzso is zzso however, our data also suggest that additional zzso regulate zzso expression under normal zzso Lastly, we demonstrate that while the zzso zzso are targets for zzso they are not required for any additional function necessary for zzso zzso
