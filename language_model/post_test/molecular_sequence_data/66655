zzso are critical for modification and zzso of zzso zzso membrane zzso and microbial zzso Among the many different classes of zzso zzso zzso B zzso proteins show the broadest range of zzso specificity and zzso activity, zzso zzso zzso bonds in zzso and zzso and further catalyzing zzso zzso The zzso of the opportunistic zzso pathogen zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso family with five putative members; we present the first characterization of this group of potential zzso zzso zzso the third member of this zzso family characterized zzso is a putative zzso protein with a predicted zzso attachment zzso zzso zzso gene expression analysis of zzso and the additional zzso gene family members revealed that zzso growth and zzso relevant environmental conditions are associated with increased zzso gene zzso The zzso expressed by zzso zzso and zzso strains of zzso indicate that this zzso zzso plays an important role for zzso zzso zzso activity and in zzso organ zzso
