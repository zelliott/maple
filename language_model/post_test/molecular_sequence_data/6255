The gene zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso DNA of zzso coli zzso strain using the zzso chain zzso The cloned structural gene with a synthetic zzso sequence was placed under the control of either zzso zzso or a tandem of two strong zzso promoters zzso and A3 from early region of zzso zzso Both constructions were shown to provide high levels of zzso of zzso zzso
