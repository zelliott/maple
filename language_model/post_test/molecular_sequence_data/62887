zzso tract binding protein zzso is a regulator of alternative zzso zzso 3' end formation, zzso stability and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso can influence alternative zzso sometimes resulting in zzso zzso zzso Here, we show that alternative skipping of zzso zzso 11 leads to an zzso that is removed by zzso and that this zzso zzso at least zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso We also show that zzso 11 skipping is itself promoted by zzso in a negative feedback zzso This zzso may serve both to prevent zzso high levels of zzso expression and to restore nuclear levels when zzso is mobilized to the zzso Our findings suggest that alternative zzso can act not only to generate protein zzso diversity but also to zzso control gene expression and complement recent zzso zzso indicating a high prevalence of human alternative zzso leading to zzso
