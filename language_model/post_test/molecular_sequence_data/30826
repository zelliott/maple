A full theory of the zzso of zzso requires a method for treating the effects of zzso on the induced zzso This is especially critical in zzso zzso where zzso and zzso shielding play major roles in determining the relative stability of zzso zzso of zzso zzso on a free energy surface are contrasted with the traditional sort of calculations which employs a simple potential energy function (in zzso The method employs a zzso zzso free energy surface determined by approximate zzso statistical mechanical zzso zzso are presented for zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso This method, with zzso free energy functions, takes the same amount of time and effort as traditional molecular mechanics in zzso
