zzso active zzso zzso were formed on metallic zzso stable zzso zzso zzso embedded in garden zzso and polarized at zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso gene libraries revealed that zzso were heavily enriched in zzso in comparison to control zzso formed on zzso electrodes, which were zzso composed of zzso and zzso Among zzso sequences affiliated with zzso and zzso zzso were zzso A bacterial consortium was zzso in which 25 zzso were identified as zzso zzso zzso cultures of 4 different zzso zzso zzso gave higher current zzso zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso on zzso than the original zzso zzso (in average 300 zzso on zzso and the zzso zzso zzso type strain zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso on zzso FISH analysis confirmed that zzso zzso represented a minor fraction in the original zzso zzso in which species related to zzso zzso were zzso The zzso type strain did not show zzso capacity, which can explain the lower performance of the zzso zzso These results stressed the great interest of zzso and zzso pure zzso strains from wild zzso zzso to improve the current density provided by microbial zzso
