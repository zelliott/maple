Although zzso and oysters in the ocean are known to act as zzso for zzso such as heavy metals, their ability to survive in heavily zzso water is relatively zzso The Asian zzso zzso zzso is one species that can accumulate a variety of environmental heavy metals, and the expression of its metal binding protein zzso is induced by zzso To better characterize this protein and its zzso mechanism against cadmium, the present work examined the induction of a cadmium binding protein zzso in zzso zzso exposed to 400 zzso zzso for 30 zzso The induced zzso was zzso by zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso This zzso was found to consist of 103 zzso zzso was rich in zzso (21 zzso and partial zzso sequence obtained by zzso zzso analysis revealed a zzso zzso which resembles a typical feature of zzso zzso zzso The zzso molecular weight of zzso zzso is a little larger than that of other zzso
