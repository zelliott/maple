Alpha zzso zzso are zzso by at least four genes designated zzso to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso We describe here, molecular cloning of the zzso zzso zzso located on zzso I, that encodes a protein of 449 zzso acids that has high zzso to human, mouse and zzso alpha zzso but relatively lower zzso to the zzso alpha zzso The zzso zzso gene is zzso to the zzso leader zzso Northern analysis shows that the gene is increasingly transcribed during the early zzso zzso stages but has a lower level of zzso in zzso zzso larvae, adults, and zzso Using an zzso fusion gene expression in transgenic animals, we show that the gene is expressed in a zzso manner in the zzso zzso muscle cells, and a subset of zzso which include a class of DB and zzso motor zzso in the zzso nerve cord, zzso touch zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso in the zzso Our results support the notion that zzso structure may contribute to the functional specialization of zzso
