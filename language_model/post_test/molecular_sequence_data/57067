A nuclear zzso signal binding protein in nuclear envelope was studied as the first step to determine the mechanism of nuclear protein recognition by nuclear zzso The rat liver nuclear envelope extract was resolved by zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso bearing a strong nuclear zzso zzso A nuclear zzso signal binding protein with molecular mass of 60 zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso could be extracted with zzso zzso zzso M zzso but not with 1 M zzso 2 M zzso or zzso zzso zzso The protein was zzso to the lower layer in a two phase system using zzso zzso These results suggested that the protein is an intrinsic membrane protein and has a zzso zzso This protein was bound to not only zzso but also the nuclear zzso signal zzso of zzso 40 large zzso zzso zzso to human serum zzso The binding of zzso to zzso was inhibited by 50% in the presence of zzso zzso zzso However, a high concentration of zzso zzso was necessary, when zzso zzso in which the essential zzso acid zzso was zzso with zzso was zzso These results suggested that zzso binds specifically to nuclear zzso zzso zzso extracted from the nuclear envelope was zzso by zzso affinity zzso following zzso high performance liquid zzso
