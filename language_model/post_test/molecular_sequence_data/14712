The zzso protein family is regarded as a family of zzso proteins that is highly zzso and widely distributed within the zzso zzso family members are typically small basic zzso proteins that bind to DNA with zzso and no sequence specificity and are capable of constraining DNA negative zzso protecting DNA from zzso I zzso and do not compact DNA zzso However, a detailed understanding of the structural basis of the interaction of zzso family proteins with DNA is still zzso Here, we determined the crystal structure of zzso an zzso member of the zzso family from zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso Unlike typical zzso family zzso zzso is an zzso protein and binds to neither DNA nor zzso The overall structure of zzso displays high similarity to its zzso but three pairs of zzso positively charged zzso located at the presumed zzso surface are zzso by zzso zzso in zzso Through zzso acids zzso the zzso ability of zzso was restored zzso whereas the zzso ability of zzso a typical zzso family member, was weakened zzso Based on these results, we propose a model describing the molecular mechanism underlying the interactions of typical zzso family proteins with DNA that explains all the characteristics of the interactions between typical zzso family members and zzso
