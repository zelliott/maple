zzso of immune cells causes depletion of zzso from zzso zzso zzso stores, thereby triggering sustained zzso entry through zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels, an essential signal for zzso zzso and zzso Recent evidence indicates that zzso of zzso current is initiated by zzso zzso which sense zzso zzso levels through an zzso located in the zzso zzso and zzso upon store depletion into zzso closely associated with the plasma zzso We and others recently identified zzso zzso and human zzso (also called zzso as critical components of zzso zzso entry downstream of zzso Combined zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso cells, or zzso and zzso in zzso cells, leads to a marked increase in zzso zzso However, these experiments did not establish whether zzso is an essential zzso link between zzso and the zzso channel, an accessory protein in the plasma zzso or an actual pore zzso Here we show that zzso is a plasma membrane zzso and that zzso channel function is sensitive to zzso of two zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso 1 and 3, respectively, diminish zzso influx, increase current carried by zzso zzso and render the channel permeable to zzso These changes in zzso selectivity provide strong evidence that zzso is a pore zzso of the zzso zzso
