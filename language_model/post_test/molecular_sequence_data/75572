To determine the translation initiation potential of the zzso zzso four zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso virus, we have developed an efficient system for zzso zzso zzso utilizing a zzso zzso which contains the replication origin of the zzso DNA zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso DNA templates of the zzso zzso carrying the zzso gene we introduced point zzso in all four of the putative zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Based on the analysis of in zzso translation products from the zzso zzso transcripts of the zzso the first and second zzso zzso were assigned to the P and C zzso zzso zzso detected in zzso zzso and zzso initiated from the third and fourth zzso zzso respectively, and originated within the C reading zzso Since the zzso protein is zzso in the same reading frame as the C protein but did not initiate from any of the zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of the zzso protein may start from a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
