The zzso zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso has been fully zzso The sequence contains one partial and 62 complete zzso one partial and three complete zzso genes and a cluster of six zzso zzso The direction of the zzso and translation of 61 zzso is the same as that of the movement of the replication zzso A zzso search of 40 zzso in newly determined sequence revealed that 27 of them had significant similarity to known proteins such as zzso factor G, zzso factor zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso Two adjacent zzso zzso and zzso appeared to zzso proteins belonging to the zzso cassette (ABC) zzso
