The occurrence and zzso solution structure of a class of zzso zzso containing the sequence zzso are zzso These zzso which are variations on a sequence found in the reverse transcript of the human zzso leukemia virus 2 zzso show elevated melting points and high chemical stability toward zzso by zzso zzso with the zzso zzso have melting points zzso degrees higher than zzso with zzso or zzso zzso The identities of the looping zzso X and Y above, play a negligible role in determining the stability of this DNA hairpin zzso This is very different from zzso based zzso in zzso where the third base must be a zzso for high stability zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Jr (1991) zzso zzso zzso 19, zzso We show that these properties are associated with a four base zzso unit that contains both a sheared zzso base pair and a zzso zzso base pair upon which it is zzso As an understanding of the significance of AG base pairs has become increasingly important in the structural biology of zzso zzso we zzso an zzso A precision ensemble of zzso solution structures using zzso relaxation zzso zzso zzso performed on zzso structures indicate that neither zzso zzso zzso nor zzso zzso zzso are significant factors in determining the observed differences in hairpin zzso Thus the stability of the zzso zzso would appear to derive from favorable zzso zzso der zzso zzso
