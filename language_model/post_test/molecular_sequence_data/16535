We have developed a method for separating the zzso zzso zzso of the small zzso zzso from the larger classical zzso zzso zzso are an important class of plant zzso implicated in plant growth and zzso zzso of zzso enabled us to identify eight of 12 zzso from zzso zzso predicted from zzso zzso Of the remaining four, two have low abundance based on expressed sequence tag databases and the other two are only present in zzso zzso or flowers zzso and therefore would not be detected in our zzso zzso of zzso was performed using zzso laser zzso zzso of flight mass zzso and tandem mass zzso protein zzso These data provide zzso experimental evidence that zzso are processed in zzso for the addition of a zzso zzso anchor, zzso zzso site information for both the zzso zzso zzso signal and the zzso signal for eight of the 12 zzso and zzso experimental evidence that the zzso motif is zzso in zzso Furthermore, we show that zzso is zzso despite its unusually long zzso zzso zzso zzso Prior to this work, the zzso zzso site for only two plant zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso had been determined zzso zzso of the zzso modifications of zzso contributes toward obtaining the complete primary structure of this class of biologically important plant zzso and provides a greater understanding of zzso modifications of plant zzso
