zzso zzso zzso the synthesis of zzso from zzso and zzso and is zzso by zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso has been zzso in the absence of zzso zzso and its three-dimensional structure has been determined at zzso resolution with zzso zzso It is a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in which two zzso zzso associate mainly via the zzso zzso The small zzso zzso zzso zzso has the known zzso zzso zzso zzso The large zzso zzso (421 zzso has a novel zzso It displays a zzso between two zzso the tips of which contact the zzso zzso across its active zzso zzso of zzso essential zzso are located inside the zzso zzso separated from clustered zzso involved in feedback zzso The structure suggests a model in which zzso binding triggers a relative movement of the two domain tips of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and creating a channel for passage of zzso toward the active site of the zzso zzso zzso presumably blocks this zzso thus stabilizing the inactive states of both zzso The structure of the zzso zzso is a likely zzso for the related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso
