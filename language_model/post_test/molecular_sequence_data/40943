The aim of this review is to give a general account on the zzso microbial degradation of zzso Since now 50 years, various research groups have zzso the way zzso zzso deal with this important class of zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso are abundantly found in vegetal zzso and zzso and it was thus patent that various zzso will bear the zzso machinery necessary to cope with these vegetal secondary zzso After initial studies zzso on the general zzso capacity of various zzso towards zzso the so called zzso zzso zzso was rapidly established in zzso zzso of the path as well as zzso and products were known at the beginning of the zzso Then during 30 years, only sporadic studies were focused on this pathway, before a new burst of interest at the beginning of the new century arose with zzso zzso and theoretical studies mainly conducted towards zzso This is the goal of this work to relate this 50 years journey at the crossroads of zzso zzso genetic and zzso Some mention of the potential usefulness of the zzso of the path as well as zzso bearing the whole zzso zzso zzso is also zzso
