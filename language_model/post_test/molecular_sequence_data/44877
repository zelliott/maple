The human zzso virus zzso zzso is clearly associated with African zzso zzso and the zzso form of zzso zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in other types of lymphoma, as well as in some human breast zzso However, its route of entry into zzso cells is incompletely zzso We report here evidence that there is no gene zzso in the zzso 1 and 2 zzso of zzso in human embryonic zzso zzso zzso cells and zzso cells and that zzso 1 and 2 zzso could be detected in zzso cells, different differentiated zzso cell lines and zzso zzso zzso None of 15 cases of poorly differentiated zzso zzso has zzso 1 and 2 zzso We also provide evidence that transformation of zzso cells results from exposure to infectious zzso and that transformation is dependent on the presence of zzso zzso These data suggest that expression of zzso 1 and 2 of zzso may be associated with replication of zzso and support the notion of direct infection and transformation of human zzso zzso cells destined to evolve into the zzso by zzso through zzso
