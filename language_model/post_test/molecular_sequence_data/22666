We tested whether genetic zzso affect activity of the zzso zzso zzso which mediates zzso of zzso zzso All 23 zzso and adjoining zzso sections of zzso zzso were zzso in 247 individuals of various ethnic origins zzso zzso Of 38 single zzso zzso zzso 21 occurred in zzso and zzso regions and 17 in zzso coding region, of which nine were zzso Eight zzso zzso were cloned into expression zzso and functionally characterized after transient zzso into zzso and Chinese zzso zzso zzso None of the zzso had altered transport activity for various zzso supporting previous results, except for the new, zzso zzso This zzso displayed significantly reduced zzso zzso attributable to increased zzso zzso pH dependence of zzso transport suggested a role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed significant differences among ethnic zzso To search for zzso zzso affecting zzso and zzso processing, we measured zzso zzso zzso expression in human zzso biopsy samples using a zzso zzso in zzso zzso Of 24 zzso samples, significant differences in zzso zzso levels of 20 to zzso were observed in seven zzso However, the small difference suggests that zzso regulatory factors have only limited effects on zzso zzso We also measured the relative formation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels ranged from 2 to zzso of total zzso zzso with potential consequences for drug zzso Together with previous results, this study reveals a relatively low level of genetic zzso in zzso affecting both protein function and gene zzso
