We have determined the complete sequence of the translation zzso factor zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso sequence of zzso alpha zzso of zzso The zzso leader sequence of the zzso alpha zzso starts with a zzso zzso This feature is shared with the zzso for zzso zzso where it affects the zzso of zzso by zzso However, the secondary structures of these leader sequences may zzso zzso tracts of zzso zzso alpha zzso participate in the formation of stable zzso structures, whereas those of 15 randomly chosen zzso for zzso proteins do zzso This difference may provide a basis for differential control of translation for the two classes of zzso The zzso sequences of zzso zzso alpha zzso have zzso little during zzso zzso of sequence and putative secondary structures suggest that both zzso interactions and secondary structures may have contributed to sequence zzso
