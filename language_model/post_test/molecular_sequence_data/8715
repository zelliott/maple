The zzso zzso represented by zzso zzso zzso bacteria, is well known for its clinical importance and considerable zzso zzso Recently, evidence for a functional role of the zzso factors zzso A, zzso zzso zzso G, and zzso K in this zzso was provided by cloning and sequencing these genes from zzso zzso In zzso zzso a partially zzso open reading frame was found to zzso the N zzso of the putative zzso factor L with significant similarity to members of the zzso 54 zzso The identification of sequences with high similarity to the zzso zzso F zzso zzso zzso H (several zzso zzso and zzso D zzso zzso consensus promoters renders the existence of these zzso factors in zzso very zzso These data are in agreement with information obtained by zzso transcript mapping zzso A, zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso D, zzso zzso and zzso characterization of zzso proteins zzso zzso from various zzso zzso Thus, the picture emerges that a fundamental similarity exists at the genetic level between the regulation of various cellular responses, in particular zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso The different induction patterns of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and many zzso species zzso of growth or exposure to oxygen in the presence of excess zzso are most interestingly not reflected in the general regulatory features of this zzso zzso
