zzso are short zzso DNA or zzso zzso that are selected in zzso by their affinity and specificity for the zzso zzso is a consequence of the particular zzso structure that they are able to zzso depending on their zzso zzso of the zzso zzso belongs to the lower zzso order zzso that causes zzso in man and zzso zzso genes in zzso are of considerable interest because these zzso do not zzso their zzso during zzso Thus, the study of the structural features of zzso has been considered of particular interest and, as a result, in recent years a great number of zzso genes have been characterized in zzso zzso are extremely zzso zzso reflecting their apparent zzso of zzso zzso similarity of zzso core zzso those of higher zzso is found predominantly in the zzso region with high sequence zzso in the zzso and in the zzso zzso These zzso indicate that they may be potential diagnostic and/or zzso zzso We have successfully isolated a pool of DNA zzso named zzso which specifically binds to zzso zzso zzso When tested in an zzso zzso zzso slot zzso and Western zzso analysis, the zzso pool exhibited specificity in its ability to bind only to zzso zzso but not to other proteins from zzso zzso including other zzso Thus, it appears that this novel zzso zzso population may be of potential application as a diagnostic system for zzso
