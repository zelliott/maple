In view of the high structural and pharmacological similarities between the zzso of humans and other zzso species, it has been concluded, in particular, from experiments in rabbits that the zzso is the exclusive site of action of central zzso drugs, although the zzso acid sequence of the zzso of just this species was zzso zzso the aim of the present investigation was to determine the complete zzso sequence of the coding region of the rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to regions of the zzso zzso between rat and man were used in a zzso chain reaction with zzso DNA prepared from zzso A zzso pair product with an open reading frame of zzso base pairs was obtained that encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids which is similar to the zzso of other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso guinea-pig and zzso but not to their zzso and zzso zzso suggesting its zzso as an zzso However, the degree of zzso acid sequence identity is, at best, only zzso and, thus, about zzso less than between the other zzso zzso Compared with the human sequence there are 81 substantial changes of zzso zzso In conclusion, rabbit and human zzso substantially differ in their zzso acid sequence which may explain the opposite zzso properties of the central zzso drug zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso reported in the zzso zzso the present study supports the view that experiments with central zzso drugs in rabbits are not reliably zzso for the site of action of such drugs in zzso
