This work provides a zzso method for the simultaneous, direct zzso of intact human insulin and five insulin zzso in human zzso This investigation zzso both the selectivity and sensitivity problems encountered for accurate zzso of zzso in plasma since the former is not possible with conventional zzso and the latter with conventional zzso The method uses a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso method including a zzso particle column containing an zzso exchange stationary zzso zzso factors for all zzso were calculated in 6 sources of human plasma and zzso of the zzso factors were zzso in all cases supporting the selectivity of the method, while achieving zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso for each insulin from 250 zzso of human zzso The average accuracy for the standard curve points in extracted human plasma was zzso Average zzso and zzso zzso for zzso samples were zzso and zzso zzso Average zzso and zzso zzso for zzso samples were zzso and zzso zzso Patient samples were analyzed in a blind study and results concurred with their diabetes zzso zzso The study also demonstrated that the presence of high levels of human insulin and bovine insulin does not interfere with zzso of any of the analyzed zzso We propose this method for the accurate zzso monitoring of diabetic patients, for sport zzso and forensic zzso zzso
