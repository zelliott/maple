The zzso composition and types of functioning of zzso complexes, as well as their zzso constants, were studied for calf brain zzso The zzso zzso alpha 3 within the native zzso complex was found to exhibit an increased sensitivity to zzso zzso The site of specific zzso was localized in the region of the zzso chain that is unique for all alpha 3 type zzso zzso decreases zzso zzso to the zzso of human alpha zzso It was shown for the first time that in all zzso preparations containing the alpha 2 and alpha 3 zzso isolated by both zzso and zzso method two other proteins were present: the beta 5 chain of zzso and zzso zzso the biological meaning of their association is still zzso
