zzso sodium channels zzso are critically important in the regulation of zzso and fluid balance in both zzso and respiratory zzso zzso functional zzso may contribute to zzso in blood pressure in the general zzso We previously reported that the zzso zzso in the C zzso of the zzso altered zzso functional and surface expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Rubenstein zzso Yan W, zzso M, Levy zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso J zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We examined whether sites in the vicinity of zzso influenced channel activity by performing scanning Ala zzso Interestingly, only zzso channels exhibited increased currents compared with zzso This increase in channel activity reflected an increase in channel open probability and not an increase in channel surface zzso In contrast, decreases in channel activity were observed with both zzso and zzso zzso The decrease in functional expression of zzso channels correlated with decreased surface zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso altered the zzso trafficking of the zzso While zzso zzso zzso may be modified by the addition of zzso we did not observe zzso of zzso Our results suggest that multiple zzso in the zzso part of the zzso C zzso have roles in modulating channel zzso
