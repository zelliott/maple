zzso dominant zzso muscular zzso zzso is associated with partial deletion of the zzso zzso repeat array on zzso zzso This zzso zzso may result in regional zzso relaxation and zzso deregulation of genes zzso 

Here we describe the isolation and zzso of zzso a member of a zzso dispersed gene family, mapping only 37 zzso zzso to the zzso repeat zzso zzso and motif searches yielded no clues to the function of the predicted zzso zzso expression is zzso in all zzso tested except for zzso zzso of zzso patients, which display low, yet distinct levels of zzso zzso partly from zzso 4 but predominantly originating from its zzso on zzso zzso However, in zzso zzso patients only zzso related zzso zzso are zzso while zzso zzso from healthy controls fail to express any member of this gene zzso Moreover, zzso of zzso patients and control individuals undergoing forced zzso zzso zzso show expression of zzso mainly originating from zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso show that the zzso promoter region can direct high levels of expression but is inhibited by increasing numbers of zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso zzso reveal nuclear zzso and apparently zzso zzso causes a wide range of zzso zzso 

The zzso of zzso genes close to the zzso repeats on zzso 4 and 10, their zzso zzso specifically in zzso zzso cultures, potential involvement in zzso and promoter properties qualify zzso as an attractive candidate for zzso zzso
