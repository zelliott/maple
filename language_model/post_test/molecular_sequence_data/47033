zzso internal zzso entry site zzso elements direct zzso internal initiation of protein synthesis within zzso zzso These zzso elements (about 450 zzso contain extensive secondary structure including a hairpin loop with a zzso zzso zzso Such zzso are important in zzso and zzso zzso zzso that express zzso zzso of the structure zzso have been zzso The zzso sequence encodes a zzso protein zzso the translation of this open reading frame within zzso cells from these zzso zzso requires a functional zzso zzso zzso that express the zzso can be selected from zzso zzso A pool of up to 256 zzso zzso virus zzso elements was generated by converting the zzso hairpin loop sequence zzso to zzso Following zzso of this pool of zzso into zzso cells, plasmids were recovered from selected zzso zzso These zzso were amplified in zzso coli and zzso again into zzso cells for further cycles to enrich for plasmids zzso functional zzso zzso The sequence of individual selected zzso elements was zzso All functional zzso elements had a zzso with a 3' terminal A zzso zzso zzso activity, zzso in zzso and within cells, was obtained from plasmids zzso an zzso with the hairpin loop sequence fitting a zzso zzso In contrast, zzso elements containing zzso zzso were severely zzso
