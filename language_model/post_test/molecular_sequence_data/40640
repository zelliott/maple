zzso zzso zzso genetic systems have evolved independently of the more uniform nuclear system and often employ modified genetic zzso The organization and genetic system of zzso zzso zzso are particularly unusual and remain an evolutionary zzso We determined the sequence of full-length zzso c zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso of the earliest zzso zzso zzso and show that this gene resides in the zzso zzso Apparently, this zzso is not translated in a single reading frame with standard zzso zzso Our examination of the zzso sequence and zzso translation of the zzso suggest that the reading frame must be shifted 10 times, at every zzso and CCC zzso to yield a consensus zzso zzso We suggest two possible mechanisms for these zzso zzso a zzso zzso in which stalled zzso skip the first bases of these zzso or specialized zzso recognizing zzso zzso zzso and zzso Regardless of the zzso active and efficient machinery would be required to tolerate the zzso predicted in zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first evidence of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and, by far, is the most extensive case in zzso
