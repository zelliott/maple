zzso is zzso at zzso and zzso by zzso in response to stalled replication and zzso zzso This zzso zzso is thought to play critical roles in the prevention of premature zzso However, the behavior of zzso in zzso remains largely zzso Here we reported that zzso was zzso in zzso The reduction of this zzso was observed at the zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping revealed that zzso zzso sites in zzso were completely overlapped with the in zzso sites by zzso protein zzso zzso 1 or by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as novel zzso sites on zzso Treatment with zzso inhibitor zzso I induced the reduction of zzso zzso although treatment with zzso inhibitor zzso or zzso did zzso In addition, zzso radiation zzso or ultraviolet zzso light did not induce zzso zzso at zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso These observations imply the regulation of zzso zzso function through zzso zzso at novel sites by zzso
