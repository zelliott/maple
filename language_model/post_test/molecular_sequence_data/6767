zzso pancreatic zzso A zzso zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso bond of zzso after zzso bound in the zzso B1 zzso This zzso binds to zzso zzso more tightly than to zzso and zzso zzso more tightly than to zzso zzso studies had suggested that the zzso group of zzso can interact directly with the base of a bound zzso In contrast, the zzso group of zzso cannot interact directly with bound zzso but can accept a hydrogen bond from the zzso group of zzso To assess the role of the zzso hydrogen bond in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A were prepared and their abilities to catalyze the zzso of various zzso were zzso The results indicate that the zzso of zzso enhances zzso of reactions in which zzso is bound in the B1 zzso but that this enhancement relies on the zzso of zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso does not contribute to zzso of reactions with zzso in the B1 zzso zzso cycles derived from kinetic parameters for the zzso of zzso indicate that the zzso interaction contributes zzso zzso to transition state stabilization, which is zzso zzso greater than its contribution to ground state zzso Thus, like many zzso zzso this zzso to zzso interaction enhances zzso by becoming stronger as the reaction approaches the transition zzso
