zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the zzso zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso zzso by two zzso differing solely in their zzso end, are zzso one is found in all cells and the other is present only in zzso zzso We have previously shown that the human zzso is zzso by a single gene and have now cloned and characterized this zzso which is split into 15 zzso spread over 10 zzso of zzso We demonstrate that the two zzso arise from two overlapping zzso zzso The first one zzso is active in all zzso and its promoter has some of the structural features of a zzso zzso the second, located 3 zzso zzso is active only in zzso cells and its promoter displays structural zzso with the zzso gene zzso
