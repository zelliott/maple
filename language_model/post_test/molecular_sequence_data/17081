A zzso satellite DNA has been isolated and zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso a zzso species endemic to the rock fields of the zzso Range in zzso The zzso sequences are slightly A + T rich zzso and there is a significant variation of repetition length zzso zzso The length zzso is mainly due to a 22 zzso zzso in some repeats and the presence of a highly variable region zzso by several DNA zzso including zzso zzso and zzso of small sequence zzso The retarded mobility of zzso observed after gel zzso suggests DNA zzso Thirty zzso repeats were zzso in samples from five populations which cover zzso zzso geographical zzso Previous studies showed that these populations present low levels of zzso divergence in contrast to high levels of zzso zzso The zzso among the 30 repeats is pretty low, on average zzso The results showed that the zzso sequences are rather homogeneous on both zzso and zzso levels, presenting no specific zzso that could discriminate a particular population or groups of geographically close zzso zzso factors responsible for such zzso are zzso
