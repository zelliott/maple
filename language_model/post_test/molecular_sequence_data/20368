The zzso zzso zzso the agent of zzso is remarkably well adapted to its definitive zzso However, the molecular mechanisms underlying the successful establishment of zzso worms zzso in the dog zzso are zzso With the aim of identifying molecules participating in the zzso zzso zzso we surveyed the zzso of zzso and zzso treated with zzso at pH zzso This analysis identified a zzso family of zzso zzso zzso proteins associated mostly with zzso zzso suggesting that they play a role at the onset of zzso We present the relevant molecular features of eight members of the zzso zzso zzso family zzso - zzso Although diverse, the family includes three pairs of close zzso zzso zzso zzso which would be the products of recent gene zzso In addition, we describe the zzso of zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and provide data indicating that some members of the family zzso zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso zzso kinetic studies with native zzso and zzso highlighted their functional zzso Like most zzso zzso zzso zzso behaved as a slow, zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso with global zzso zzso zzso zzso versus zzso in the zzso zzso In sharp contrast, zzso did not inhibit any of the zzso zzso Interestingly, molecular modeling revealed structural elements associated with activity in zzso zzso zzso We propose that this family of zzso has the potential to act at the zzso zzso interface and interfere with host zzso processes at the initial stages of zzso
