This study investigates the generation of primary melanoma zzso zzso T zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso cells from zzso healthy donors was assessed using 2 recently described zzso zzso from the melanoma tumor zzso zzso The need for help from zzso T zzso for the long-lasting induction of zzso and the capacity of the zzso zzso lines to recognize many melanoma cells were zzso zzso lines were obtained zzso when zzso zzso help was provided during the primary stimulation either in an zzso way, in the case of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso donors, or with zzso zzso zzso cells, separated by an insert well, in the case of zzso zzso zzso zzso We also investigated helper zzso factors that are produced by zzso zzso Our results strongly suggest that a complex network of zzso like zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exerts zzso effects for the initiation process of zzso In contrast, zzso zzso might inhibit generation of zzso activity if provided by zzso T cells at early stages of zzso Our approach can be used to generate zzso of a desired specificity for clinical use in adoptive zzso zzso
