We have used suppression zzso zzso zzso zzso cloning and reverse Northern dot zzso analysis to identify significant zzso of zzso zzso in a human zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses using the zzso system demonstrated that zzso zzso levels were elevated in zzso zzso zzso There was no significant difference in 17 matched normal and zzso pairs and reduced levels in zzso Since zzso specifies a key member of nuclear transport receptors responsible for the nuclear import of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we investigated whether this zzso might be zzso zzso zzso copy numbers were significantly correlated with those of zzso cell nuclear zzso in both normal and cancer zzso Interestingly, the zzso pattern of the zzso zzso showed a similar correlation with zzso zzso Our results highlight the need for the careful interpretation of quantitative data that compare zzso levels in normal and cancer zzso
