Five zzso have been identified from the central nervous system of the pond zzso zzso zzso The sequences are zzso zzso where zzso is either zzso or zzso and zzso either zzso zzso or zzso The peptides are named zzso to acknowledge identity with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso They were detected by an zzso that recognizes the biologically active zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso had no effect on trout zzso which responds equally to zzso and zzso We propose that the zzso belong to an zzso zzso which includes zzso and zzso and suggest that the widespread zzso zzso in zzso is due to peptides belonging to such a zzso
