To detect zzso in the zzso gene in zzso disease patients, we used the recently described technique of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis in combination with selective zzso We analyzed zzso 8, 9, 10 and 11 of the zzso zzso these zzso were zzso amplified using the selectively amplified products as zzso We found zzso zzso patterns corresponding to the presence or absence of the zzso zzso which was detected by zzso zzso analysis, in zzso zzso Furthermore, we detected four zzso zzso patterns in zzso 8, 10 and zzso zzso analysis consistently revealed four zzso zzso in the corresponding zzso three novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one silent zzso zzso These zzso were found only in one zzso therefore, these findings have confirmed the marked genetic zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis in combination with selective amplification is a rapid and sensitive procedure for the screening of the zzso in the zzso gene of patients with zzso zzso
