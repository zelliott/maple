zzso analysis of zzso zzso of proteins is a challenging part of zzso zzso Multiple enrichment steps are typically required in the zzso zzso to achieve adequate characterization of the zzso zzso In spite of recent advances, quantitative zzso need further zzso Here, we report a selective and sensitive zzso followed by further fragmentation in the linear zzso zzso zzso multiple reaction monitoring zzso mass zzso method for direct analysis of zzso in difficult zzso such as zzso zzso zzso was performed using two serum zzso zzso zzso and sex hormone binding zzso With the zzso zzso zzso we were able to analyze major zzso of zzso directly in human zzso zzso of the minor zzso of zzso and zzso of sex hormone binding zzso required enrichment of the protein because these zzso were below the sensitivity of the zzso zzso zzso trap hybrid mass zzso in the complex serum zzso In conclusion, we present a quantitative method for zzso analysis of zzso with general zzso to zzso zzso Our results document reliable application of the zzso zzso multiple reaction monitoring zzso to the relative zzso of zzso zzso of zzso in human zzso Introduction of zzso labeled standards would be desirable to achieve absolute zzso of the zzso The possibility to analyze serum samples directly represents a significant improvement of the quantitative zzso zzso with the potential for use in clinical zzso
