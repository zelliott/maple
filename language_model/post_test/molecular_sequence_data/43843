A novel zzso zzso was isolated from king zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by successive zzso zzso column zzso and zzso zzso The complete sequence of zzso was determined by zzso degradation of zzso fragments generated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This novel toxin comprises 72 zzso acid zzso with 10 zzso The sequence shows zzso sequence zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso a and b from the same zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were modified with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso did not affect the lethal toxicity at all, while the zzso and 23 zzso zzso retained about 50% of the zzso of native zzso Selective zzso of zzso or 69 resulted in a decrease in zzso by zzso and 50% zzso was retained after modification of zzso 51, and zzso A drastic decrease in zzso to zzso was observed when both zzso and 37 were zzso The zzso was further decreased when zzso was additionally zzso These results suggest that the aromatic zzso zzso and zzso are not crucial for the zzso whereas the zzso zzso are involved in zzso contact between the toxin zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso and 37 in the central loop of zzso seem to contribute greatly to the zzso
