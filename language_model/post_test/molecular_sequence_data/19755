West Nile zzso zzso collected from 179 human blood donors in 25 US states and three Canadian provinces during the 2003 and 2004 epidemic seasons were genetically zzso The evolution of zzso during its Western spread was examined by envelope zzso gene sequencing of all 179 cases and full open reading frame sequencing of a subset of 20 zzso to determine if geographic and zzso segregation of distinct viral zzso had zzso Median joining network analysis was used to examine the genetic relationship between E gene zzso and identified four large genetic clusters showing the gradual zzso of zzso during the zzso western zzso Two related zzso zzso and their zzso zzso in prior years, expanded in zzso zzso founder effects were observed in some regional outbreaks possibly due to local zzso colonization by a limited number of zzso zzso acid zzso associated with newly expanding genetic zzso reflect either selectively neutral zzso drift and/or zzso providing zzso advantages over the previously dominant forms of zzso
