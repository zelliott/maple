For the sake of better understanding the molecular mechanism of zzso we have used the zzso differential display technique to analyze two human lung zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso zzso was isolated from zzso but zzso much higher zzso potential than the parent zzso We found that a significant differential zzso zzso in zzso was zzso then zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso It showed that the zzso zzso in zzso was zzso zzso And the zzso zzso sequence was corresponding between the two zzso To determine whether zzso may be zzso expressed in the two human lung zzso cells at protein level, we further detected zzso protein in the two cells by using zzso zzso zzso protein was zzso in highly zzso zzso We also detected the difference in zzso gene expression at zzso level in human zzso cell lung zzso by zzso Using zzso zzso we also examined zzso change at protein level in 45 cases human zzso cell lung zzso zzso zzso The results proved the evidence of zzso of zzso in zzso zzso indicated zzso of zzso gene was correlated with the zzso degree and zzso potential of lung zzso test, p zzso zzso The zzso gene is a member of zzso zzso which can transcribe zzso protein that plays an important role in signal zzso of protein trafficking at the cell surface and zzso cycle in the regulation of zzso membrane zzso Thus our results indicated that zzso of the zzso gene was involved in the process of transformation from zzso to the higher zzso cell line zzso The result may be a powerful experimental evidence that zzso of zzso gene associated with zzso zzso
