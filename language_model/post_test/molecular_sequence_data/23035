In bacteria, zzso zzso are responsible for resistance to zzso and zzso toxic heavy metals by taking them out of the zzso These zzso have a zzso N zzso zzso metal binding zzso defined by a zzso fold and a zzso metal binding zzso To check how the structural properties of the metal binding site in the N zzso can influence the metal specificity of the zzso the first structure of a zzso N zzso was determined by zzso and its coordination sphere was investigated by X-ray zzso zzso A novel metal binding environment was found, zzso the two zzso zzso zzso of the metal binding motif and a zzso in loop zzso A zzso search identifies an ensemble of highly zzso sequences presumably with the same zzso Another group of highly zzso sequences is found which can be referred to as zzso zzso zzso with the metal binding pattern zzso in the N zzso Because no zzso groups participate in zzso or zzso binding sites, we suggest that the zzso zzso plays a key role in the coordination properties of zzso zzso hence zzso a function to the N zzso in the metal specificity of the zzso
