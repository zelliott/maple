Previous studies suggest that zzso zzso zzso plays a role in zzso dependence and subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso also appears to play a role in zzso tolerance since third zzso injection of zzso from zzso zzso selectively restores zzso sensitivity in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has previously antagonized behavioral effects of zzso and has attenuated zzso zzso The present study assessed whether zzso could similarly zzso zzso zzso Third zzso zzso injection of zzso restored the zzso response to zzso zzso in zzso rats zzso heat tail zzso zzso zzso injection failed to produce this zzso In zzso rats, however, the same treatment with zzso did not affect the zzso response to zzso zzso Thus, zzso appears to selectively restore zzso sensitivity in zzso zzso These results further support the hypothesis that zzso zzso contributes to zzso zzso
