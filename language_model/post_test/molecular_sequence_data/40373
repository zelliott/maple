A zzso zzso and zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso Its zzso affiliation was determined by using zzso zzso gene sequence zzso It was found that strain zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso with the three nearest zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Comparative sequencing of additional zzso marker genes zzso and zzso confirmed the zzso zzso gene sequence tree zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso do not exceed zzso revealing that the novel isolate represents a separate zzso zzso The strain can be distinguished from other related species of the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso and zzso data, it is proposed that the new isolate be classified as a novel species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
