The objective of this work is to identify proteins of the human and zzso zzso zzso zzso which may be exploited for control of the zzso Through screening a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso we have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso protein that may play an important role in membrane zzso The zzso sequence is a single copy zzso zzso a putative zzso of 320 zzso acids and zzso zzso zzso zzso Secondary zzso acid structural analysis suggested that the zzso protein might contain two distinct structural zzso an zzso zzso rich domain and a mixed zzso zzso zone, showing zzso with the zzso zzso domain found in a great number of proteins that bind zzso as the regulators of membrane trafficking between zzso membrane zzso zzso therefore, in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein specifically zzso with important zzso regulators of membrane trafficking, with a preference for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso protein was localized in the zzso apparatus of zzso cells and in the spiral canal region of zzso zzso zzso zzso As zzso protein may play an important role in membrane trafficking, its demonstrated zzso in the intact zzso zzso suggests its involvement in the function of the zzso and thus perhaps interaction with the zzso
