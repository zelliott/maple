To successfully colonize their zzso zzso many bacteria produce multiple zzso factors that play essential roles in disease processes and zzso Some of these molecules are zzso that allow efficient attachment to host cells, a prerequisite for successful host zzso zzso zzso express a number of proteins which either play a direct role in attachment to the respiratory zzso or exhibit similarity to known bacterial zzso One such recently identified protein is zzso Despite the similarity of zzso to zzso and zzso deletion of this protein from zzso zzso did not result in any significant zzso in respiratory tract zzso In this study, we identified an open reading frame in zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso colonization factor zzso that is similar to zzso In contrast to the zzso expression of zzso in the zzso intermediate zzso phase, zzso is expressed at high levels in both the zzso and zzso zzso We show here that zzso and zzso zzso bind zzso to the zzso promoter zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that zzso is localized to the outer membrane and that it is expressed during animal zzso While deletion of either zzso or zzso did not significantly affect respiratory tract zzso zzso deletion of both genes resulted in a zzso in colonization of the rat zzso Our results indicate that the two zzso proteins have a zzso role in zzso efficient respiratory tract zzso
