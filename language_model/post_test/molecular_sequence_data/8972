The folding of the sequence zzso from zzso zzso into a zzso zzso by the turn region zzso is known to be an early folding zzso With zzso being the shortest sequence for a zzso model and in view of its importance to the folding of zzso zzso we investigated the thermodynamics of turn formation at a range of temperatures from 280 to 380 K, with a regular zzso of 10 zzso Eleven independent molecular dynamics simulations (under zzso zzso were performed using the zzso package of programs and the zzso zzso force field, each for a time period of 1 zzso Turn formation is supported by zzso at lower temperatures, while zzso supports it at higher zzso There are modest free energy barriers between turn and extended zzso zzso The turn propensity persists even at elevated zzso The role of zzso in driving the turn formation has been zzso and it is zzso that the absence of zzso does not affect turn zzso
