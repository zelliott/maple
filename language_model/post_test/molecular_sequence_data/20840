A key issue in stem cell biology is the differentiation of homogeneous stem cells towards different fates which are also organized into desired zzso Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the process of periodic zzso zzso zzso offer a fundamental and testable model in which zzso cells are organized into zzso arranged zzso and the spacing between zzso Previous work explored roles of a Turing zzso mechanism in establishing chemical zzso Here we show that a zzso of feather patterns, ranging from stripes to spots, can be obtained when the level of zzso activity is adjusted with chemical zzso The patterns are zzso tissue zzso and zzso zzso show that zzso zzso zzso cell zzso is essential for converting zzso centers into stable feather zzso A mathematical model based on short-range zzso long-range zzso and cell zzso is developed and shown to simulate observed experimental zzso This generic cell behavior model can be applied to model stem cell patterning behavior at zzso
