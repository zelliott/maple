zzso are frequently isolated from food products and it is essential to have methods for correct identification for both food hygiene and epidemiology zzso zzso methods are not always sufficient and have to be supplemented by DNA based zzso In the present study, 70 strains of zzso derived from milk, fish and meat that had previously been identified by zzso zzso zzso were zzso classified together with 15 representative type strains of species of zzso The field strains were dominated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All strains were subjected to zzso temperature gel zzso zzso analysis using zzso encompassing the zzso zzso and zzso variable regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were zzso by zzso and partial zzso zzso zzso The type strains were differentiated into 10 different zzso zzso Two of the groups contained two type zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were not distinguished due to their identical sequences and zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed the same migration zzso The 70 food strains could be differentiated into 14 zzso groups where 33 strains zzso could be assigned to zzso groups including type or reference zzso zzso strains were dispersed into three zzso groups of which one group corresponded to zzso zzso 1 and one to zzso zzso The grouping of zzso strains was supported by zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be a useful additional tool for identification on the species level of food related zzso
