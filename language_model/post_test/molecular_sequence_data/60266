We previously suggested that the degree of zzso stimulation of zzso protein zzso synthesis is dependent on the secondary structure and position of the zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso To study the structural change of zzso zzso induced by zzso and zzso stimulation of initiation complex formation, four different zzso zzso zzso containing the initiation region were zzso in zzso The structural change of these zzso induced by zzso was examined by measuring their sensitivity to zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso and zzso zzso which recognizes zzso or stacked zzso In zzso the effect of zzso on zzso zzso binding to zzso was zzso Our results indicate that the secondary structure of the zzso sequence and initiation zzso zzso is important for the efficiency of initiation complex formation and that zzso zzso the structure of the zzso sequence and the initiation zzso zzso The existence of a zzso zzso region close to the zzso sequence is important for zzso stimulation of zzso binding to zzso zzso apparently binds to this zzso stem and causes a structural change of the zzso sequence and the initiation zzso zzso an interaction with 30 S zzso zzso
