In zzso zzso studies have suggested that the zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso gene is expressed in fetal and newborn rat kidney but is zzso in the adult zzso In the present study, we investigated the expression of zzso zzso protein in the fetal zzso 14 and 19 of fetal zzso newborn zzso 1 zzso and adult zzso and zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso was raised against the zzso zzso of the native zzso zzso The selectivity of the zzso was validated by recognition of the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso cell line by Western zzso and zzso zzso As a positive control, the zzso zzso signal was detected strongly in the adrenal zzso Positive zzso zzso was observed in the zzso cells and zzso buds of the zzso fetal kidney and in the zzso zzso and vessels in the zzso fetal and newborn zzso zzso expressing the zzso zzso were localized mainly in the outer layer of the zzso zzso In the young zzso and mature zzso adult rat on normal sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was present in zzso but substantially diminished compared with that of newborn zzso In both young and mature adult rats, dietary sodium depletion increased the zzso zzso zzso zzso mainly in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso controls were zzso Western zzso analysis detected a single zzso band in the fetal and newborn rat kidney and in the young and mature adult rat zzso zzso sodium depletion increased the density of the zzso zzso band in mature adult rat zzso These data provide evidence that the zzso zzso protein is expressed in the fetal and newborn rat zzso diminishes in adult life, and is zzso in the adult in response to sodium zzso
