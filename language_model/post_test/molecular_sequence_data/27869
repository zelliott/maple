In cardiac muscle, where zzso influx across the zzso is essential for contraction, the zzso zzso zzso calcium channel represents the major entry zzso of zzso zzso We have previously zzso the primary structure of the rabbit skeletal muscle zzso zzso by cloning and sequencing the complementary zzso An expression zzso carrying this zzso zzso into cultured skeletal muscle cells from mice with muscular zzso has been shown to restore both zzso zzso and slow calcium current missing from these cells, so that a dual role for the zzso zzso in skeletal muscle zzso zzso is zzso We report here the complete zzso sequence of the rabbit cardiac zzso zzso deduced from the zzso zzso We also show that zzso zzso derived from the cardiac zzso zzso zzso is sufficient to direct the formation of a functional zzso calcium channel in zzso zzso Furthermore, higher zzso activity is observed when zzso specific for the zzso of relative molecular mass approximately 140,000 zzso zzso associated with skeletal muscle zzso zzso is zzso
