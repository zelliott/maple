Plant resistance to many types of pathogens and zzso can be achieved by the presence of disease resistance zzso zzso The zzso binding zzso rich repeat zzso class of zzso is the most commonly isolated class of zzso and makes up a zzso which is often arranged in the zzso as large zzso zzso The zzso domain of these genes can be targeted by zzso chain reaction zzso amplification using zzso zzso Previous studies have used zzso derived zzso sequences to investigate both ancient zzso evolution and recent evolution within specific plant zzso However, comparative studies with the zzso family have largely been zzso In this study, we address recent evolution of zzso sequences within the zzso and extend the comparison to the zzso zzso zzso Using multiple sets of zzso zzso fragments were amplified from zzso DNA of three species from the family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Analysis suggests that zzso species share distinct families of zzso composed of genes related to both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso domain containing zzso zzso Between the most closely related species, zzso and zzso a striking similarity of zzso zzso composition was identified, while sunflower showed less similarity in zzso These sequences were also compared to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso appear to be distinct from zzso gene zzso These data suggest that zzso families in the zzso family are zzso but also that gene zzso and gene loss events occur and change the composition of these gene zzso over zzso
