The citrus disease zzso zzso is highly destructive in many zzso regions of the zzso The putative zzso agent of this disease, zzso zzso zzso is difficult to culture, and Koch's zzso have not yet been zzso As a result, efforts have focused on obtaining the zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso in order to give insight on the physiology of this zzso In this work, three next-generation zzso sequencing platforms, zzso zzso and zzso were used to obtain zzso DNA sequences from zzso tissue of Florida citrus trees infected with zzso A zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso sequences showed that the only zzso present within the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso No viral or zzso sequences were identified within the zzso By reference zzso the zzso zzso contained sequences that provided zzso coverage of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso By the same approach, zzso zzso data yielded less than zzso coverage of five other zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso DNA provided a zzso means of zzso the presence of zzso zzso zzso in infected tissue and strongly suggests that no other disease agent was present in zzso Analysis of these zzso data suggest that this approach has a detection limit of one zzso zzso cell for every 52 zzso zzso The zzso sample zzso here is estimated to have contained zzso zzso zzso cells per zzso zzso
