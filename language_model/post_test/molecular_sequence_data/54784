In higher plants, zzso zzso factors play an important role in tolerance to low temperatures, drought, and zzso zzso These zzso factors bind to zzso elements in promoter regions of target zzso regulating their zzso In this study, we cloned and characterized a novel gene zzso a zzso zzso factor from dwarf apple, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was induced by cold, drought, and salt stress, and also in response to zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso in the zzso A zzso activity zzso demonstrated that the zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso which specifically binds to zzso zzso Compared with zzso plants, transgenic zzso zzso zzso showed increased tolerance to low temperature, drought, and salt zzso Analysis of the zzso promoter revealed an zzso element zzso an zzso of zzso zzso zzso binding site, two zzso recognition sites, and three zzso zzso zzso zzso activities driven by the zzso promoter in transgenic zzso increased in response to zzso cold temperature, drought, and salt zzso Interestingly, the expression of both zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso was activated under normal growth conditions in zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso functions as a zzso factor and increases plant tolerance to low temperature, drought, and salt stress via both zzso and zzso zzso
