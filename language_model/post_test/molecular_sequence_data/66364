Gene synthesis is very important in life science research, and it becomes a technique in common zzso It is difficult for long gene zzso because the zzso and zzso of DNA sequence in zzso fragments zzso This study established a new method for long gene zzso which was referred to as zzso zzso zzso zzso With this method, a omega-3 fatty acid zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was successfully assembled from 27 zzso zzso fragments zzso zzso 68 zzso for each zzso ) following 3 rounds of zzso (7 zzso and 2 rounds of restrict zzso zzso (3 zzso This shows that the zzso zzso zzso method is an effective method for long gene zzso
