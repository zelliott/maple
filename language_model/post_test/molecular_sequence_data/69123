Severe combined zzso zzso zzso mice are deficient in variable zzso joining region zzso the process of assembling the zzso and zzso zzso genes from gene zzso thereby creating much of the enormous diversity of zzso capacity, zzso mice are also sensitive to zzso radiation, as a result of their zzso in zzso break zzso Here we report the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso by transferring human zzso 8 into zzso zzso zzso cell hybrids were generated by fusing zzso cells with human zzso cells, resulting in zzso hybrids with several human zzso One of the identified human zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso which retains only two human zzso is a rearranged zzso zzso Proof that zzso 8 zzso the zzso was achieved by transferring only human zzso 8 into zzso cells by zzso zzso transfer zzso cell zzso The presence of zzso 8 in our zzso cell line was monitored by zzso in zzso zzso and zzso chain zzso We demonstrated the zzso of this hybrid not only to high dose rate but also to low dose rate zzso We also showed that zzso of human zzso 8 to zzso cells fully zzso the DNA zzso break repair zzso and the high sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene to human zzso 8 is an important first step in cloning the zzso zzso which will enhance our understanding of zzso break repair pathways in zzso
