zzso zzso zzso control of the zzso zzso zzso gene requires the integration of regulatory signals at the vitamin zzso element zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso D3 zzso zzso is a member of the nuclear zzso zzso and forms a zzso complex with the zzso for zzso zzso acid zzso that binds to the zzso zzso We have demonstrated previously that changes in zzso structure at the zzso region of the rat OC gene promoter accompany zzso enhancement in zzso suggesting a requirement for zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso in the zzso region of the OC gene promoter is zzso to binding of the zzso complex when organized in a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso D3 or the presence of other zzso factors, such as zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso which also bind to sequences partially overlapping or near the zzso is not sufficient to render the zzso zzso Thus the zzso unlike other steroid zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is unable to bind its target sequence within a zzso zzso Taken together these results demonstrate that zzso zzso is required for in zzso occupancy of binding sites in the zzso region of the OC gene promoter by the regulatory factors responsible for zzso zzso enhancement of zzso
