zzso zzso are very helpful tools to investigate the zzso and sometimes even the function of specific proteins in cells and zzso By generating zzso zzso against zzso zzso a zzso truncated zzso of zzso zzso as a result of alternative zzso of the zzso zzso we zzso that screening multiple zzso zzso would allow the identification of zzso as well as zzso Both proteins share the first 178 zzso zzso but have different zzso All three zzso zzso zzso and zzso recognize zzso zzso and the specificity to also recognize zzso was demonstrated in brain extracts of different species and human zzso cells, which express zzso All zzso zzso did not zzso with the closely related protein zzso zzso zzso binding was depending on the zzso status of both forms of zzso Generally, the zzso form was better recognized than the zzso zzso zzso and zzso truncated zzso proteins were expressed in zzso coli in order to characterize the zzso recognized by the three zzso Additionally, zzso and zzso zzso fragments were produced to further narrow down the sequences recognized by the three zzso zzso recognizes an zzso consisting of the zzso region between zzso zzso I and II and the zzso part of zzso II, while the others zzso zzso bind to a region including the zzso between zzso zzso III and zzso These zzso are valuable tools to further investigate the distribution and eventually the specific function of these two proteins in the nervous tissue and under pathological conditions, zzso in colon zzso and zzso
