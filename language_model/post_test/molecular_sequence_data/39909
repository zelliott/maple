zzso based on zzso zzso or zzso zzso sequences minimize the genetic distance between vaccine strains and contemporary viruses and should thus elicit immune responses that recognize a broader spectrum of viral zzso However, the zzso zzso and zzso properties of such zzso gene products have to be validated zzso Here, we report the construction and characterization of the first full-length ancestral zzso and consensus zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes expressed high levels of envelope zzso that were incorporated into zzso zzso zzso infection via the zzso zzso and retained zzso zzso as recognized by plasma from patients with chronic zzso zzso C zzso zzso pigs zzso with zzso and zzso zzso DNA developed high zzso zzso but no appreciable zzso or zzso zzso zzso When tested by zzso analysis, zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso guinea pigs recognized a greater number of primary zzso C envelope zzso than zzso from guinea pigs zzso with a contemporary zzso C zzso zzso Mice zzso with zzso and zzso zzso DNA developed gamma zzso T cell responses that recognized overlapping peptides from the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso C zzso zzso Thus, both zzso and zzso zzso genes expressed functional envelope zzso that were zzso in laboratory animals and zzso zzso and cellular immune responses of comparable breadth and zzso These results establish the utility of zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso and warrant their continued evaluation as potential components of future AIDS zzso
