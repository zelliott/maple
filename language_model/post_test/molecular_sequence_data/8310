We have developed a simple and rapid procedure for the zzso of large amounts of Rev protein zzso in zzso zzso The zzso method, which does not require zzso of the zzso takes advantage of the positively charged nature of Rev and the ability of Rev to interact with zzso zzso The zzso protein was used to develop three novel zzso zzso zzso against zzso Using fusion proteins between zzso zzso zzso and various fragments of the Rev zzso we mapped the specificity of these zzso to different regions of the Rev zzso One zzso zzso is directed against the zzso zzso domain of Rev between zzso acids 38 and zzso Another zzso zzso recognizes an zzso between zzso acids 90 and 116 of zzso A third zzso zzso does not recognize any of the fusion zzso and may be directed against a zzso zzso All three zzso are able to detect Rev on Western blots and to zzso Rev under native zzso However, only zzso and zzso zzso Rev under zzso conditions and are able to detect Rev expressed in zzso cells by indirect zzso These zzso should prove useful in further studies of Rev zzso
