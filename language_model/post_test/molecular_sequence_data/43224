zzso zzso is a zzso surface zzso of the influenza zzso In infection, it zzso membrane fusion between viral and zzso zzso at low zzso Each zzso consists of the zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso zzso It has been known that the zzso region of the zzso domain, the so-called zzso zzso zzso into the target membrane and plays a crucial role in triggering fusion between the viral and zzso zzso A major portion of the zzso domain zzso zzso 1 to zzso of influenza virus zzso including the zzso fusion zzso region, was expressed in zzso zzso Through zzso zzso eight zzso zzso zzso in the fusion zzso region of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were generated and modified with a zzso spin zzso Using zzso electron zzso resonance zzso techniques, we investigated the zzso membrane zzso and the local zzso state of the fusion zzso region in the zzso zzso zzso showed that this region is likely to exist as a flexible zzso in the membrane at both neutral and zzso pH zzso In addition, zzso power zzso methods allowed us to measure the depth in the membrane of the spin label at each zzso zzso The resulting depth profile is consistent with an zzso zzso approximately 25 degrees from the horizontal plane of the membrane with a maximum depth of 15 A from the zzso zzso The tilt and zzso orientation zzso well with a calculated zzso of this zzso
