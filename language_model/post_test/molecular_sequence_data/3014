The flow of genes among zzso plays a fundamental role in shaping bacterial evolution, and zzso systems can zzso this zzso However, relatively little is known about the distribution and movement of zzso systems zzso We have isolated and characterized the genes for zzso systems from two species of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A and zzso zzso zzso zzso Both systems are closely related to the zzso zzso system and share its target zzso In the case of zzso zzso zzso zzso A, the restriction zzso is zzso apparently due to a zzso in the zzso interface zzso Unlike the zzso located zzso systems, the zzso system is zzso zzso We have completed the sequence characterization of the zzso zzso zzso originally from zzso zzso making this the first completely zzso zzso from the zzso zzso Despite the pronounced similarity of the three zzso systems, the zzso sequences in zzso and zzso are completely zzso The zzso and zzso genes lie between an equivalent pair of zzso zzso open reading zzso one of which is a putative zzso zzso while the zzso genes are adjacent to a mob zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso
