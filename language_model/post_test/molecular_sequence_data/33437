Rice zzso soil has been shown to have strong zzso zzso However, the microbial populations responsible for nitrate zzso and zzso have not been well zzso In this study, we performed a clone library analysis of zzso clones of the nearly full-length zzso zzso gene to characterize bacterial community structure in rice zzso zzso We also identified potential key players in nitrate zzso and zzso by comparing the community structures of zzso with strong zzso activity to those of zzso without zzso zzso zzso library analysis showed that bacteria belonging to the zzso zzso including a unique zzso zzso dominated the clones obtained in this zzso Using the template match method, several operational zzso units zzso most belonging to the orders zzso and zzso were identified as zzso that were specifically enriched in the sample with strong zzso zzso Almost one-half of these zzso were classified in the zzso zzso and appeared zzso more frequently in the zzso with strong zzso activity than in the zzso without zzso zzso zzso zzso related to zzso are potential key players in nitrate zzso and zzso under the conditions zzso
