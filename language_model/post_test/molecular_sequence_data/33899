zzso syndrome zzso is defined by the combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso and terminal zzso limb defects zzso It is usually inherited as an zzso zzso but zzso inheritance has also been zzso In an individual with zzso zzso we combined zzso analysis with zzso sequencing to identify a zzso zzso zzso in zzso of zzso 6 gene zzso which encodes an zzso zzso exchange factor zzso known to activate two members of the zzso zzso family: zzso and zzso Another zzso zzso zzso was identified upon targeted sequencing of zzso in an unrelated individual with zzso zzso with the established role of zzso and zzso in the organization of the zzso zzso we demonstrate a cellular zzso typical of a defective zzso zzso in patient zzso These findings, combined with a zzso expression profile that is consistent with an zzso zzso as well as the very recent demonstration of dominant zzso of zzso in zzso establish zzso and zzso as key molecules in the zzso of zzso and suggest that other regulators of these zzso zzso proteins might be good candidates in the quest to define the genetic spectrum of this genetically zzso zzso
