It was recently shown that the zzso zzso of heart zzso zzso binds to zzso on the outer half of the inner membrane zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso has now been extracted and zzso to zzso from rat heart zzso and zzso with zzso The fragments have been separated on an zzso system using a zzso Q zzso zzso zzso Only one of these binds to zzso zzso and has thus been identified as the zzso domain of the zzso Its zzso acid sequence has been zzso The zzso contains 25 zzso acids and zzso to the zzso region of the zzso The binding of the zzso of zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso Another and larger zzso zzso could be specifically zzso with zzso zzso zzso and has thus been identified as the zzso zzso Chemical modification of the basic zzso acids zzso and zzso of the zzso abolished its binding to zzso
