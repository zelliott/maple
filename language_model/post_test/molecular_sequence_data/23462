Here, we introduce a method for the fast and accurate analysis of DNA zzso based on zzso zzso The target region is zzso amplified using a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A subsequent in zzso zzso leads to a transcript which contains zzso zzso only at sites that contained zzso zzso before zzso zzso In a single tube reaction using zzso zzso by zzso zzso a specific pattern of zzso fragments is zzso This pattern directly represents the zzso state of the sample DNA and is analyzed using zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso This method was successfully applied to the analysis of artificially zzso and zzso DNA, zzso zzso and colon DNA zzso The zzso for the analysis of both zzso products and cloned zzso products is zzso The observed zzso patterns were confirmed by zzso zzso
