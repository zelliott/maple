zzso tandem repeats zzso have been shown to be a powerful tool in the determination of evolutionary relationships and population zzso of zzso The sequencing of a number of zzso zzso zzso has allowed the identification of novel zzso sequences in zzso zzso which are similar to those used in the study of the evolution of zzso tuberculosis zzso Seven zzso termed zzso zzso repeat units zzso distributed around the zzso are zzso occurring in both unique and multiple sites, and varying in length from 48 to 159 zzso Variations in copy numbers were observed in all zzso within both the zzso zzso and the UK epidemic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso related UK zzso zzso were clustered using zzso which provided a greater degree of discrimination than zzso sequence zzso indicating that zzso may be a more appropriate evolutionary marker for studying transmission events and the geographical spread of zzso zzso zzso
