Previously, we developed a transgenic tobacco zzso cell line zzso in which zzso was modified by expressing human zzso zzso In this study, we produced a mouse zzso zzso in zzso cells, and determined the sugar chain structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso comprised zzso and zzso and zzso zzso comprised zzso and zzso of the total number of zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso comprised zzso The introduction of human zzso into suspension cultured tobacco cells resulted in the production of zzso proteins with zzso zzso and decreased contents of zzso and zzso
