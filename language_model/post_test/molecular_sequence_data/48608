The single cell zzso zzso zzso is capable of importing zzso as nitrogen zzso An analysis of the zzso zzso zzso reveals at least three distinct gene families zzso for known zzso zzso In this study the zzso transport and binding properties for the lone zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso are determined through zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso acts as a zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso sharing similar - but not identical - zzso recognition specificity with the evolutionary distant zzso from zzso zzso The results suggest that the zzso specificity for plant zzso occurred early in plant evolution and are distinct from zzso transport zzso of single cell zzso zzso zzso
