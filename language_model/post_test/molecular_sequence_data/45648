The zinc finger zzso factor zzso zzso regulates bone formation and zzso differentiation in zzso and in zzso We investigated the zzso mechanisms underlying the mouse zzso expression by zzso and characterizing its zzso upstream zzso We performed zzso zzso on zzso isolated from zzso zzso cells and determined a cap site of zzso approximately zzso zzso upstream of the initiation zzso zzso analysis of this zzso promoter shows several putative response elements for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso promoter driving the zzso reporter gene into zzso and zzso cells shows a strong zzso promoter activity between zzso zzso and 2 zzso zzso zzso analyses show that the most zzso 852 zzso of the zzso promoter contains the highest zzso zzso while strong repressive zzso were identified between zzso and 2 zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso significantly zzso the zzso promoter by at least 2 fold indicating that zzso is downstream of zzso in zzso zzso This zzso was zzso when the zzso responsive element on the zzso promoter was zzso Finally, we show that zzso specifically binds to this DNA element in the zzso zzso Thus our results show for the first time zzso zzso regulation through the bone and cartilage related zzso factor zzso
