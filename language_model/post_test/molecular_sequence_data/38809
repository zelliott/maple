We zzso a novel protein with a molecular mass of 34 zzso from the zzso zzso fat zzso This zzso named zzso zzso fat body zzso was restricted almost exclusively to the anterior fat zzso The zzso content decreased after zzso on disintegration of the fat body zzso zzso analysis revealed that this protein consists of zzso zzso acid zzso and exhibits significant structural similarity with zzso zzso zzso marker zzso a zzso liver zzso However, zzso did not seem to exhibit strong affinity with zzso These results suggested that a seemingly uniform fat body tissue exhibits a regional difference in its function along the zzso zzso
