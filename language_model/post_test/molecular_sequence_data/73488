A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso to zzso from zzso of the zzso purple zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is composed of a single zzso with an apparent molecular mass of about 55 zzso exhibiting zzso and zzso zzso typical for a zzso and similar to the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso From zzso and zzso zzso sequences of the pure protein a zzso DNA clone was obtained by zzso chain reaction zzso Its sequence contains an open reading frame of zzso base pairs zzso zzso sequence data base, zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso The deduced zzso consists of 425 zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of 47 zzso and a net charge of zzso The high similarity zzso zzso between the N zzso of the zzso and the bacterial zzso was confirmed and zzso Both zzso exhibit the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The complete sequence of the zzso from zzso zzso shows further similarity to zzso in particular zzso zzso and zzso zzso The cloned zzso was expressed in zzso coli in a functional zzso
