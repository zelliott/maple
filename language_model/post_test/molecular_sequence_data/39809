Until about 1990 there was general consent about the assumption that only protein and zzso zzso have the capacity of zzso or zzso zzso zzso Since about ten years evidence is now accumulating that zzso zzso do play a role in classical zzso immune zzso This holds true for zzso where the zzso chain is short and not located at an zzso zzso needed for zzso zzso zzso recognition of zzso peptides is potentially of high biomedical significance, because it can mediate the immune protection against zzso the vaccination in zzso therapies, but also some aspects of zzso The zzso type 1 zzso zzso zzso is established as a marker for monitoring recurrence of breast cancer and is a promising target for zzso strategies to treat cancer by active specific zzso Natural human immune responses to the zzso zzso of the zzso indicate that zzso zzso are more directed to zzso than to zzso zzso zzso To overcome the weak zzso of the natural target, heavily zzso zzso the question was addressed whether zzso zzso remain intact during processing in the zzso class II zzso and interfere with zzso processing and zzso zzso Attempts were made to define on a zzso level the structural requirements for an efficient zzso zzso zzso by zzso L in zzso zzso Evidence based on work with zzso zzso confirms that zzso can be effectively presented to zzso and that zzso can form integral parts of the zzso defined zzso Similar approaches are currently followed in the zzso class I zzso which aim at the identification of zzso zzso generated by zzso
