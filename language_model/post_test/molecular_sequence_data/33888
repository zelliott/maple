The in zzso association of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso immune zzso activates a zzso signaling zzso that zzso pathogen zzso To define the molecular events specifying zzso recognition by zzso we determined the crystal structure of zzso and zzso in zzso the effects of surface zzso that are critical to zzso plant zzso zzso adopts an zzso zzso zzso zzso structure with an overall architecture unlike any previously described zzso zzso comparisons highlight a zzso zzso zzso motif in the zzso domain that creates a structural framework for rapid zzso Identification and mapping of critical recognition sites suggest that zzso detection by the zzso resistance protein is zzso by several distinct protein surfaces that allow the zzso to escape recognition through diverse surface zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that multiple zzso acid zzso are necessary for recognition and that surface zzso exert additive zzso These results suggest that zzso is a modular repeat protein belonging to an ancient family of zzso zzso that rapidly zzso to escape host detection and adopt diverse zzso zzso
