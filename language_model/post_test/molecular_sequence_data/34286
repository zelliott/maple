zzso is zzso in the zzso syndrome critical region on human zzso 21, and plays an important role in the functional and zzso regulation of many types of cells, including zzso zzso Here we have identified zzso an zzso zzso protein with zzso zzso as a cellular binding partner of zzso zzso was originally identified in zzso as zzso that controls the pigmentation of flowers by stimulating the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso interference showed that zzso was indispensable for the optimal proliferation and survival of zzso cultured cell, and zzso depletion induced cell zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso bound to zzso and expressed zzso The zzso domain, but not the zzso zzso domain or the zzso domain of zzso was responsible for the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso or zzso region outside of the central zzso of zzso abolished its binding to zzso suggesting that zzso repeats are not sufficient for the association with zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso was distributed throughout the zzso zzso nuclear zzso of zzso was observed upon zzso of the wild type and a zzso zzso of zzso Taken together, these results suggest that zzso binds specifically to zzso in cells, and that the zzso but not the zzso event, zzso the nuclear zzso of zzso
