A zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso factor zzso was successfully cloned and zzso from the small zzso of zzso mouse by using the combination of reverse zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The gene was, similar to rat and human zzso mainly expressed in the small and large zzso The zzso expression was zzso during the recovery phase after depletion of zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the expression in the zzso was not altered, while zzso cell zzso was induced by zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso expression did not simply correlate with the number of zzso zzso The zzso may play an important role in the maintenance and repair of zzso function of the zzso Additionally, the zzso in the zzso may play a role in zzso of the zzso nature of zzso cell zzso thereby affecting the establishment of zzso zzso
