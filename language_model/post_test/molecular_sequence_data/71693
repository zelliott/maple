Before the structure of zzso protein zzso had been zzso sequence alignments had already suggested that several highly zzso zzso motifs described as zzso zzso I through zzso might play some functional role in zzso Crystal structures of several members of the protein zzso zzso have suggested that the nearly zzso zzso zzso within zzso IX contributes to the zzso stability of the zzso loop by forming hydrogen bonds with backbone zzso within zzso zzso However, substitution of this zzso with zzso or zzso in some protein zzso have indicated that these interactions are not essential for zzso In contrast, we show here that conversion of this zzso to zzso abolished the zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso when expressed either in zzso cells or in zzso zzso modeling predicted that the zzso loop of the zzso zzso was disrupted by van der zzso zzso between the side chains of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso IX and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso model predicted a shift in the zzso backbone of the zzso loop, and an outward rotation of zzso and zzso side zzso However, the position and orientation of the zzso zzso base, zzso was not substantially zzso The proposed model explains how zzso of some, but not all zzso could be tolerated at this nearly zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso
