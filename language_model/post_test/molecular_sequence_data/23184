zzso containing proteins are involved in cell cycle regulation by interactions with zzso Through an in zzso zzso screen for mouse genes zzso expressed in newborn zzso we identified a gene that would zzso a novel zzso zzso zzso protein termed zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and Northern zzso analysis have demonstrated a zzso zzso transcript that is expressed exclusively in germ cells in both male and female mouse zzso zzso expression can be detected zzso in male, and zzso in female zzso but shows a sexually zzso expression in adult zzso The zzso transcript is abundant in the adult zzso but limited in the adult zzso The mouse zzso gene is comprised of 15 zzso and maps to zzso zzso A human zzso was also zzso The expression pattern of zzso suggests that it may be a critical regulatory protein in germ cell zzso
