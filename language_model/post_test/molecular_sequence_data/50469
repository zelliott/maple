The zzso zzso zzso chain is a member of a family of related proteins that play a critical role in zzso zzso receptors to zzso signaling zzso To study the role of zzso chain in zzso zzso we generated targeted zzso of the zzso gene in zzso embryonic stem zzso The zzso zzso are predicted to result either in a zzso zzso or in the synthesis of a truncated protein capable of supporting zzso surface expression but deficient in zzso zzso Both of these targeting events were recovered in a single zzso experiment with either zzso or a combination zzso zzso Our results suggest that similar approaches could be used to generate multiple single zzso modifications of more than one site within a zzso or subtle zzso that rely upon zzso with the zzso marker zzso
