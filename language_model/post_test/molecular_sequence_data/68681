zzso zzso and zzso zzso serve as second zzso in a variety of neural cells, modulating their zzso and electrical zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso an zzso whose zzso activity is zzso regulated by zzso zzso in peripheral zzso could play an important role in the regulation of zzso zzso levels in the zzso To study the presence and distribution of zzso zzso zzso in the rat brain, we cloned a portion of rat liver zzso zzso zzso complementary DNA by zzso chain reaction, using zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of rat zzso reveals abundant expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Northern zzso analysis of brain zzso shows especially strong expression in zzso and cortex, modest expression in the remainder of the zzso and in the zzso and little expression in zzso and zzso In zzso zzso studies with zzso zzso zzso zzso confirm these northern zzso results, and delineate cell groups with high levels of zzso zzso zzso nucleus is intensely labeled, as is zzso in the vicinity of zzso and zzso cell bodies in areas zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Other elements of the zzso system also contain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Additional cortical regions show more diffuse expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as do the zzso zzso zzso thalamus, and zzso do not show appreciable specific zzso These studies demonstrate the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in specific regions of the rat brain, and suggest that the zzso zzso zzso might zzso zzso activity by regulating zzso zzso zzso levels in response to changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso
