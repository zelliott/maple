We have measured zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Dam zzso using as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso target sequence in one or the other strand and modifications in the zzso target sequence of the complementary zzso zzso included substitution of zzso by zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso parameters were obtained from the concentration dependence of the melting temperature zzso of the zzso Large differences in DNA zzso of duplexes containing single zzso for zzso substitution of the Dam recognition site were observed compared with the zzso zzso if the substitution involved the top strand (on the zzso rich zzso zzso in either strand by zzso zzso or zzso zzso resulted in small zzso of the zzso zzso When zzso zzso replaced the zzso to be zzso small, but significant zzso was zzso The kinetic parameters of the zzso reaction were compared with the zzso free energies and significant correlation was zzso
