We have recently reported that the human zzso zzso has zzso zzso 4 zzso zzso recognition mechanisms that induce the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and vascular cell zzso zzso zzso Although zzso engagement with zzso enables zzso of the zzso zzso similarly to zzso whether zzso zzso such as zzso acid zzso trigger the zzso of zzso zzso remains zzso This study has been designed to investigate the expression dynamics of zzso zzso zzso molecules and zzso in cultured human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso and real-time quantitative zzso analyses have shown that zzso usually expresses zzso and increases zzso gene expression on zzso zzso Indeed, zzso zzso increases the expression of zzso zzso and zzso but does not alter the gene expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso is suppressed by zzso but not by zzso and is also suppressed by zzso short interfering zzso zzso but not by zzso for zzso The expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso motif zzso and of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso motif zzso was induced in zzso with zzso These data suggest that the human zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso mechanisms, resulting in increased expression of inflammatory zzso zzso molecules and zzso zzso The human zzso zzso may thus function to collect zzso from zzso into zzso vessels by means of zzso functional zzso
