The utility of zzso zzso zzso was evaluated as a visual marker for the generation and breeding of transgenic zzso In an evaluation of 39 transgenic founder animals and 44 transgenic lines five zzso patterns of pigmentation were consistently observed, including zzso dark, light, zzso and zzso In these studies zzso of the zzso zzso along with the zzso of interest zzso resulted in zzso integration of the two zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso occurred in zzso of doubly transgenic mice in the F1 generation, without zzso in subsequent zzso All pigmented zzso proved useful for distinguishing zzso from zzso zzso animals via zzso trials, while the light, zzso and zzso zzso proved useful in visually discriminating between zzso and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the light, zzso and zzso zzso proved useful in determining segregation patterns of zzso in the progeny of crosses between separate transgenic zzso Moreover, there appears to be a correlation between intensity of pigmentation and degree of expression of the zzso zzso These studies confirm that zzso zzso is a useful adjunct in transgenic mouse studies and can serve to reduce routine genetic validation of transgenic zzso
