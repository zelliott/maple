We have isolated a zzso gene that is expressed in a zzso and spatial pattern during zzso strongly suggesting an important role for this gene in the early development of zzso This zzso which we have named zzso zzso encodes basic and zzso zzso that display striking sequence similarity to those of the zzso zzso regulatory gene zzso zzso transcripts are initially localized to zzso repeated clusters of zzso cells, a pattern that is reminiscent of the expression of the zzso genes in the zzso peripheral nervous zzso These early zzso cells are detected just prior to the first zzso evidence of muscle cell fusion and occupy similar positions as the zzso muscle zzso zzso zzso transcripts are present in at least a subset of growing muscle precursors and mature muscle fibers that exhibit distinct zzso zzso These observations establish zzso as the earliest known marker of zzso in zzso and indicate that this gene may be a key zzso of pattern formation in the embryonic zzso
