Previously, we showed that an apparent cell zzso membrane interaction in zzso ray zzso differed between cold zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For the present study, a calcium zzso extraction method was used to identify zzso zzso proteins that accumulated during periods of cold zzso A zzso protein represented the zzso protein in both total protein and zzso extracts during cold zzso of zzso zzso zzso gel zzso separated the zzso protein into four basic zzso The most abundant and basic zzso had a high zzso zzso zzso zzso of this basic zzso zzso generated three partial zzso fragments, of which one exhibited zzso to the zzso protein zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso providing further evidence that this protein is related to zzso The zzso protein began to accumulate in late August, reached a maximum in zzso declined during the spring months and was absent in early zzso
