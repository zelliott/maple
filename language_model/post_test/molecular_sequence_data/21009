zzso coronavirus zzso is endemic in feral cat populations and cat zzso frequently preceding outbreaks of fatal zzso infectious zzso zzso zzso exhibits 2 zzso the zzso disease and a benign infection with zzso enteric coronavirus zzso zzso remains regarding whether genetically distinctive zzso and virulent forms coexist or whether an zzso form zzso in zzso causing zzso To resolve these alternative zzso we isolated viral sequences from zzso clinically healthy and sick cats (8 zzso cases and 48 zzso zzso 735 sequences from 4 gene segments were generated and subjected to zzso zzso zzso sequences from healthy cats were distinct from sick cats on the basis of genetic distances observed in the membrane and zzso protein zzso zzso These data demonstrate distinctive circulating virulent and zzso strains in natural zzso In addition, 5 membrane protein zzso acid zzso with functional potential differentiated healthy cats from cats with zzso These findings may have potential as diagnostic markers for virulent zzso zzso
