We report the completion of the zzso of zzso growth factors zzso described previously by this laboratory zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso During isolation, the zzso activity was monitored by using the human zzso breast cancer cells in zzso zzso zzso and zzso modified zzso medium zzso zzso containing 15 zzso zzso acid zzso zzso 200 zzso bovine serum zzso and 10 zzso human zzso This medium sustained growth for several days in response to a single addition of growth zzso The isolation of zzso began with zzso acid extraction followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso molecular sieve zzso and a series of zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso X zzso of three zzso zzso zzso each) were zzso The zzso were shown by protein zzso to be zzso zzso to zzso zzso forms of zzso growth factor I zzso zzso An Mr estimated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and zzso was consistent with a zzso zzso N alpha zzso zzso and zzso confirmed zzso properties equivalent to zzso zzso zzso showed truncated zzso was functionally equivalent to zzso zzso The zzso values of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso cell growth were zzso and zzso zzso zzso With zzso zzso mouse zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso was 100 times lower than that of zzso We conclude that the major zzso zzso zzso activities isolated from zzso are very potent forms of truncated zzso capable of stimulating growth of zzso and zzso zzso
