The zzso isolate of zzso zzso virus from zzso zzso monkeys zzso is the most acutely zzso zzso zzso so far zzso always causing fatal disease in zzso zzso zzso zzso within 8 days of zzso As a first step in identifying viral genes and gene products that influence zzso the zzso zzso was amplified by the zzso chain reaction as zzso and 3' zzso halves of zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed a high degree of conservation with other zzso except for a zzso zzso in the zzso region of the viral long terminal repeat which included a second binding site for the zzso factor zzso zzso Of six zzso halves zzso four contributed to the formation of infectious virus that induced acute disease and death in zzso zzso as early as 6 days zzso with pathology, disease syndromes and zzso indistinguishable from those induced by the zzso zzso To our knowledge this is the first example of acute zzso disease induced by a zzso defined zzso Furthermore, the zzso cloned zzso viruses share with the zzso virus zzso for zzso zzso cells, a property that may correlate with their observed zzso in zzso
