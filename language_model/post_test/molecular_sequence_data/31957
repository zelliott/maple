A large number of methods are available to zzso zzso zzso reads from zzso zzso sequencing zzso Such methods are critical for sequencing zzso small zzso between 20 and 30 zzso because size selection is not typically sufficient to exclude the highly abundant class of 30 zzso zzso zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso complimentary to zzso zzso zzso prior to zzso adapter zzso and reverse zzso efficiently zzso zzso zzso sequences from the sequencing reaction in a simple and inexpensive zzso This depletion is highly specific and is achieved with minimal zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
