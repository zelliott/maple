A molecular zzso has been demonstrated between sequences of the heavy chain variable regions of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from zzso mice with induced systemic lupus zzso and sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso originating in the zzso zzso zzso It was of interest to determine whether these zzso sequences function also as zzso zzso zzso in order to establish a connection between spontaneous and induced experimental zzso zzso three peptides were designed and zzso based on the zzso determining region zzso zzso and zzso of the heavy chain of the zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we compare these peptides with the zzso and zzso peptides of another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The comparison was carried out by analyzing the ability of the peptides to induce zzso zzso in zzso zzso mice and in mouse strains susceptible to induction of experimental systemic lupus zzso zzso of zzso mice with the zzso zzso or with its zzso zzso as well as zzso with the zzso zzso zzso induced significant zzso zzso proliferation to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso to the same zzso It is also shown that zzso class II molecules of zzso zzso bind zzso the zzso zzso It is proposed that the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of experimental lupus is also a dominant and relevant zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
