Members of the zzso family of zzso factors are involved in gene zzso in various zzso systems ranging from zzso zzso through regulation of cell cycle, to learning and zzso Two members of this family, zzso element binding protein zzso and zzso element zzso zzso are active during zzso zzso and are required for this process, as has been shown by knockout and dominant negative zzso In an effort to identify mouse proteins that interact with the zzso protein zzso a mouse zzso expression library was screened via the zzso system, using the zzso portion of this protein as zzso A clone containing two overlapping open reading zzso related by a zzso of one zzso was subsequently zzso The zzso that zzso with zzso does not initiate from a consensus zzso zzso and it is not clear whether it exists zzso However, the other reading frame, initiating from an zzso zzso encodes a zzso acid zzso with significant sequence zzso to a zzso of the zzso genes whose zzso is the mouse zzso zzso This novel zzso zzso designated zzso is specifically expressed in the zzso A zzso study using Northern zzso and in zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso transcripts begin to accumulate in zzso of mice 24 d after birth, reflecting expression in zzso round zzso Interestingly, zzso revealed that in zzso translated zzso binds specifically to a nuclear zzso element rather then to a zzso zzso Potential roles for zzso are zzso
