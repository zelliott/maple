The activity, zzso and mode of action of zzso zzso against zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso and type 2 zzso and zzso virus zzso were zzso Compared to zzso zzso zzso has superior activity against zzso zzso zzso concentration of zzso zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso concentration of zzso zzso comparable activity against zzso and weaker activity against zzso The zzso effect on zzso showed persistence after removal of zzso zzso was zzso to its zzso zzso and zzso derivatives in zzso cells, with zzso being the zzso zzso Only small amounts of zzso were detected in zzso cells (1 to 10 zzso zzso whereas the level in zzso cells reached 1,900 zzso zzso zzso was a zzso for all three viral zzso zzso and could also be zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso varied in zzso zzso zzso and infected zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso cells but was always longer than the zzso of zzso (1 to 2 zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso and zzso DNA zzso competitively with zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso but could not replace zzso as a zzso in a zzso zzso zzso was not an zzso chain zzso but would only support limited DNA chain zzso Only very small amounts of zzso which were too low to be identified by zzso liquid zzso analysis of the zzso DNA, could be detected in zzso DNA from zzso cells incubated with zzso Thus, zzso acts as an zzso agent, particularly potent against zzso by formation of high zzso of relatively stable zzso which is a potent inhibitor of the viral DNA zzso
