Many zzso zzso zzso carry cryptic plasmids of extremely variable zzso In this study we analyzed two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso 15 putative open reading frames zzso whereas zzso consists of zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso The findings that both plasmids zzso a zzso zzso protein and that both have an origin of replication containing an zzso place them in the group of zzso zzso In zzso the products of the overlapping zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequences are zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso suggesting that zzso might be zzso A further putative zzso consists of zzso and zzso the products of which are zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso carries putative genes zzso proteins with zzso to an zzso and gene products of an zzso zzso zzso plasticity zzso Both plasmids contain repeat zzso such as the previously identified zzso zzso which are considered preferred zzso zzso In zzso a new repeat sequence zzso zzso which seems to act as a hot spot for zzso zzso was zzso All zzso zzso plasmids characterized so far have a modular zzso We suggest a model that explains the existing plasmids by insertions and deletions of genetic elements at the repeat zzso A genetic exchange between plasmids and the bacterial zzso combined with zzso zzso might add a novel mechanism to explain the high genetic zzso within the zzso zzso zzso
