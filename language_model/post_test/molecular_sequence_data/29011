zzso and high zzso induce the expression of many plant zzso To understand the signal zzso mechanisms underlying the zzso of these zzso we carried out a genetic screen to isolate zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso gene zzso Here we report the isolation, zzso and cloning of a zzso zzso which diminished zzso stress zzso of a reporter zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that under zzso stress the transcript levels for zzso genes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are lower in zzso plants than in wild type zzso zzso plants were found to have reduced zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and to be zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso that functions in zzso zzso Its expression is enhanced by zzso zzso Furthermore, we found that there exists a positive feedback regulation by zzso on the expression of zzso which may underscore a quick adaptation strategy for plants under zzso zzso Similar positive regulation by zzso also exists for other zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso and in certain genetic backgrounds, zzso This feedback regulation by zzso is impaired in the zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso stress is reduced substantially in zzso zzso zzso plants zzso zzso showed an increased zzso expression under zzso zzso These results suggest that the level of gene induction by zzso stress is dependent on the dosage of the zzso zzso zzso
