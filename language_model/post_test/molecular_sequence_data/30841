A zzso zzso zzso zzso was studied to understand the organization of autonomous zzso from zzso Two zzso could be zzso First, the replication region consisted of a sequence coding for a replication protein zzso and its corresponding target site, similar to those from plasmids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated the possible synthesis of an zzso zzso that might regulate zzso zzso The results also suggested that zzso replicates via a zzso DNA zzso and a putative zzso initiation site was found that had similarities to those of alpha 3, zzso and zzso zzso zzso The second cassette of zzso consisted of a sequence coding for a putative zzso protein zzso and its corresponding zzso zzso This cassette was similar to those found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and it was found to be zzso among different zzso zzso zzso The origin and evolution of these functional zzso are also zzso
