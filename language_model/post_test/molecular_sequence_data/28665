The expression of the previously zzso gene zzso (for zzso dependent zzso responsive zzso was increased by zzso to zzso in tissue of the oral cavity or in zzso and liver of mice treated orally or zzso with zzso and in mouse cells treated in zzso with zzso or zzso The level of zzso zzso was also increased zzso to zzso in the brains of animals infected with zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso in mouse zzso as zzso zzso and zzso zzso transcripts zzso a zzso protein with a zzso zzso binding domain containing typical zzso and zzso binding zzso We also characterized the human zzso zzso which is located on zzso zzso and contains six zzso zzso a zzso protein with zzso zzso to the mouse zzso A single zzso zzso was detected in all human zzso zzso except for zzso which also contained a zzso zzso transcript generated by alternative zzso and zzso a putative zzso zzso Although zzso exhibits low zzso to zzso and zzso the deduced zzso protein sequences are highly zzso to zzso A and zzso B and more zzso related to members of the zzso family of zzso suggesting that zzso like zzso is related to the AAA zzso family of zzso An zzso fusion protein expressed in zzso cells was shown to be associated with the zzso zzso
