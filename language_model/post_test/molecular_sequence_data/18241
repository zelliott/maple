The zzso structure of zzso proteins was analyzed zzso zzso mimicking fragments of the main structural zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso were selected and zzso with account taken of the level of conservation of various zzso zzso zzso The zzso peptides were then subjected to zzso study with human zzso in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from two regions were found to be particularly zzso with zzso from zzso infected zzso the zzso end of zzso and a sequence approximately sixty to zzso zzso acids in from the zzso of zzso In fact, more than zzso of zzso positive zzso reacted with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Additionally, twelve out of twelve serum samples from zzso infected with zzso reacted with both zzso (from zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso suggesting that these zzso sites are useful zzso irrespective of the infecting zzso zzso peptides were also zzso and zzso and zzso zzso Only two peptides zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso reacted with all of the six zzso positive zzso zzso These peptides did not react with zzso positive zzso or control zzso from healthy blood zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
