A zzso library of zzso zzso DNA was constructed in the zzso zzso and screened by zzso for expression of the zzso zzso zzso After zzso on plasmids the entire sequence of the zzso zzso was zzso The genes zzso zzso gamma zzso alpha zzso and beta zzso of the zzso are clustered on the zzso in that zzso A typical consensus sequence of a promoter is not found upstream of the zzso zzso but putative zzso binding regions can be identified before each zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences are highly zzso to those of zzso zzso from zzso zzso with zzso identity between the zzso zzso identity between the zzso and zzso identity between the zzso The zzso between the corresponding zzso appeared to exist only between the 312 zzso zzso acid zzso It was shown that a cloning artifact has occurred during DNA sequence determination of the zzso from zzso zzso and has led to erroneous zzso The sequence of this zzso is corrected in the zzso to this zzso A zzso zzso the three zzso genes and that for the zzso zzso carrier zzso was cloned from the zzso DNA and used for sequence zzso
