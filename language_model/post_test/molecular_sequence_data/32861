zzso carrier protein 2 zzso has been investigated by nearly native zzso zzso mass zzso in the presence of long chain fatty zzso zzso zzso and zzso derivatives of equivalent fatty acid chain length zzso Four zzso zzso were compared to examine the influence of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso targeting signal on zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso zzso did not influence zzso zzso The observation that zzso are high affinity zzso for zzso was confirmed, while zzso were demonstrated for the first time not to interact with zzso zzso formed zzso complexes with zzso of zzso and zzso zzso which could be zzso by zzso the energy of the zzso upon entrance to the mass zzso A zzso zzso using Nile Red zzso acid confirmed the mass zzso observations in zzso The zzso significance of the lack of zzso binding by zzso is zzso
