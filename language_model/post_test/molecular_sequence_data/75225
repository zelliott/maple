The biological requirement of the trace element zzso was recognized 40 years zzso zzso is incorporated into several zzso and transfer zzso species of both zzso and zzso zzso In zzso which contain a zzso zzso is present as zzso bound zzso which zzso in the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the genes coding for two zzso zzso zzso H from zzso coli and zzso zzso from mouse and man, demonstrated that an zzso zzso zzso nonsense zzso directs the incorporation of zzso In the case of zzso zzso incorporation occurs zzso Recently, we identified four genes whose products are required for zzso incorporation in zzso zzso We report here that one of these genes codes for a zzso species with unique zzso It possesses an zzso complementary to zzso and deviates in several positions from zzso until now, considered zzso in all zzso zzso This zzso is zzso with zzso by the zzso zzso which also charges zzso zzso zzso therefore, is zzso from a zzso zzso bound to a natural zzso zzso which recognizes zzso
