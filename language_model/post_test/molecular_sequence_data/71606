We have used zzso sample zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso mass zzso zzso to characterize and determine the presence of zzso bonds in zzso full-length rat brain zzso zzso and two deletion zzso of the zzso one lacking zzso 2 zzso delta 2) and the other lacking zzso 2 and 6 zzso delta zzso The molecular weights of the expressed proteins dissolved in biological buffers were determined with high accuracy using a zzso zzso chamber infusion system, that allows zzso protein zzso by removing zzso incompatible with zzso The molecular weight zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso had been zzso during the expression and isolation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the protein sequences were confirmed by zzso zzso analysis of peptides generated by a zzso zzso C zzso Comparisons of zzso zzso of native and reduced zzso zzso and delta 2 show that the full zzso and delta 2 zzso contain one zzso zzso zzso mass zzso of zzso delta zzso showed that this protein contains a highly active zzso zzso that zzso binds a zzso group, or forms a zzso via a zzso zzso The results show surprising differences amongst the deletion zzso of zzso zzso with respect to the formation of zzso zzso These differences are not readily detected by other techniques and show that zzso is a powerful, rapid method by which to detect zzso linkages for intact zzso
