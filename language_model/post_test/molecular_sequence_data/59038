Short zzso zzso of zzso zzso are crucial for zzso of signals generated by zzso of cells to the zzso zzso Here, we describe the use of peptides mimicking the zzso tails of zzso zzso to zzso in zzso associations with zzso zzso Our results suggest that the focal zzso zzso zzso may interact directly with the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to form stable complexes with several signaling zzso including focal zzso zzso Physical interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso domain suggests a model in which zzso may function as a key zzso in zzso signal zzso
