The gene zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso has been expressed as a zzso fusion zzso and the protein was zzso in a single step using immobilized metal affinity zzso The zzso protein was fully functional in in zzso and in zzso zzso production zzso Analysis of all the published zzso sequences identified a number of zzso zzso Single point zzso to either zzso or zzso were carried out on the four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso proteins were tested both for ability to zzso the zzso clusters of the native zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso The zzso and four of the zzso proteins were characterized by zzso zzso metal and zzso analysis, and both in zzso and in zzso zzso production zzso The molecular masses of all proteins were verified using zzso mass zzso The results indicate that the zzso tag and the zzso zzso have no effect on the activity of zzso zzso when compared with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso both as prepared and zzso were unable to covert zzso to zzso in zzso and in zzso We conclude that three of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which lie in the highly zzso zzso zzso zzso are crucial for zzso cluster zzso whereas zzso plays a zzso unknown structural role in zzso zzso
