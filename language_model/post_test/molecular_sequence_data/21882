Using a zzso approach, a zzso study was performed on seven strains of an unknown zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso isolated from a zzso storage zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequencing confirmed that all seven zzso were highly related to each other and formed a zzso unknown lineage within the zzso zzso zzso cluster of zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the novel zzso was most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso gene sequence similarities of zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso type of the cell wall was determined to be zzso zzso and zzso zzso and traces of zzso were detected as the zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso and zzso evidence the unknown zzso represents a new species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
