Currently circulating influenza B viruses can be divided into two zzso and genetically distinct lineages referred to by their respective zzso zzso zzso and zzso based on zzso acid differences in the zzso surface zzso During May and July 2005, clinical specimens from two early season influenza B outbreaks in Arizona and zzso Nepal were subjected to zzso zzso zzso and zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso All zzso exhibited little zzso with the zzso zzso vaccine strain and significantly reduced zzso with the previous zzso zzso zzso zzso vaccine zzso The majority of zzso were zzso similar to zzso a zzso reference zzso zzso analysis indicated that 33 of 34 zzso contained zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, these outbreak zzso are both zzso and genetically distinct from the current Northern Hemisphere vaccine virus strain as well as the previous zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso vaccine virus strain but are genetically similar to zzso the vaccine strain proposed for the coming seasons in the Northern and Southern zzso Since these influenza B outbreaks occurred in two very distant geographical locations, these viruses may continue to circulate during the 2006 season, zzso the importance of rapid molecular monitoring of zzso zzso and zzso for drift and zzso
