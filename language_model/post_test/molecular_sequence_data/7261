We have determined the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso gene and its zzso regions, and have isolated and analyzed zzso clones for this zzso We have identified two closely linked genes transcribed in the same zzso The zzso gene is the downstream zzso an open reading frame zzso derived from five zzso encodes a zzso zzso The deduced protein lacks similarity to other characterized zzso However, it exhibits a strong similarity to the product of an zzso of unknown function on zzso zzso zzso zzso This sequence similarity suggests functional zzso and should facilitate identification of the function of zzso using gene disruptions in zzso zzso
