To map zzso on zzso defined by human zzso and to examine the zzso activity of these zzso 

zzso from zzso individuals was used to screen a random zzso expression library representing zzso from the zzso clone zzso The library was based on the zzso expression zzso zzso was tested for in zzso zzso activity using zzso cells and the zzso zzso 

Four different zzso defined by human zzso were mapped on zzso Two of these have not previously been reported and are located within zzso acids zzso zzso in the C1 region and zzso zzso in the zzso region between zzso and zzso The other two are located within zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso are situated in regions that have been shown to zzso human zzso Three serum samples with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso were zzso None of the zzso zzso zzso defining the mapped zzso on zzso had any zzso capacity against zzso 

This study is the first demonstration of the zzso of random zzso expression libraries for the direct screening of human serum in order to map zzso on zzso Two new zzso and two previously identified zzso were mapped in this zzso However, none of the linear zzso was defined by zzso zzso zzso zzso and it was not possible to map zzso defined by zzso zzso in the serum samples capable of zzso zzso infection of zzso zzso Thus, it appears that the zzso activity of serum in this study was not due to zzso zzso defining linear zzso
