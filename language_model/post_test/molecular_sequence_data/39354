zzso zzso receptors represent new and expanding targets for drug zzso zzso B zzso and W zzso have recently been identified as the zzso zzso zzso for the orphan zzso zzso now designated as zzso zzso and zzso also bound to a second related orphan zzso zzso now designated as zzso that is present in humans but not rats or zzso In humans, high levels of zzso zzso have been zzso in the zzso zzso whereas moderate expression levels have been detected in the zzso and zzso In peripheral zzso expression of zzso zzso has been confirmed in the zzso system, zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and also in stomach zzso zzso molecular biological and zzso techniques have revealed a discrete zzso distribution for zzso in human, mouse and zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso and protein was identified in the zzso and zzso zzso known to regulate feeding zzso zzso bound with a single high affinity to rat amygdala, zzso zzso and 150 zzso zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrate that zzso infusion of zzso zzso zzso feeding zzso regulates the release of zzso zzso and growth hormone while also manipulating pain zzso Mouse knockout models of the gene zzso either zzso or zzso have a zzso zzso with moderate obesity evident in males but not zzso Further investigation is required to zzso the precise zzso role of zzso and zzso as zzso
