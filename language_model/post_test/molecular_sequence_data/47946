1 The metabolism of zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso The zzso sequence zzso a putative human zzso named zzso was reported zzso However, the biological activity of this protein has not been zzso 2 Based on the sequence of zzso we isolated from zzso from human zzso cells a sequence zzso a zzso zzso acid protein that is identical to zzso with the exception that this sequence contains a 23 zzso acid stretch in the putative zzso loop that is missing in zzso zzso sequence of a zzso DNA clone indicates that the zzso gene zzso to an alternative spliced form of the human zzso 3 zzso expression of isolated sequence in zzso mouse zzso zzso a marked zzso zzso activity consistent with the activity of an zzso 4 The human zzso zzso all naturally occurring zzso zzso in a zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso at a rate approximately zzso of that of the corresponding zzso The apparent zzso and zzso values were: zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of zzso zzso 5 In conclusion, we report here the cloning and functional expression of a human zzso The study of the zzso properties and the regulatory mechanisms of zzso of defined sequence will be valuable in the definition of their role in zzso zzso
