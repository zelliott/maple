A new zzso designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso rape zzso zzso by SMART Rapid zzso of zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso is zzso zzso long and contains a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso which encodes a 354 zzso acid zzso zzso with a 31 zzso zzso signal zzso and a 15 zzso zzso zzso The putative protein has a molecular weight of zzso zzso and a calculated zzso of zzso zzso shares high identity with zzso zzso zzso possesses all active zzso and two zzso sites present in zzso zzso zzso C zzso as well as six zzso zzso The predicted 3-D structure of zzso is very similar to that of zzso Assisted by zzso walking technology, the zzso DNA of zzso was also zzso consisting of 3 zzso and 4 zzso zzso zzso boxes, 18 zzso boxes and many zzso such as zzso zzso were found in its promoter zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that zzso belonged to a small gene zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso was zzso expressed in all tested zzso including roots, stems and leaves, with the high expression in leaves and zzso The expression of zzso could be induced by zzso zzso zzso salicylic acid zzso cold and zzso The cloning and characterizing of zzso might not only help us understand the zzso function and molecular evolution of the large zzso gene family more zzso but also provide an alternative way of seeking a more effective and economical substitute for zzso
