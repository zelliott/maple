An analog of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso articulated with a zzso inhibitor zzso at its zzso and two zzso at the zzso was expressed in zzso coli by cloning the zzso zzso zzso in zzso This gene zzso zzso zzso 154 base pairs in total, was designed to contain an equivalent of the zzso zzso capping the zzso inhibitor zzso at its zzso end with a zzso acid zzso zzso to facilitate zzso zzso of the expressed end product by zzso zzso zzso in two zzso zzso zzso & zzso before the double terminal zzso zzso zzso at the 3' end to zzso zzso of the expressed product by zzso and adding 3 restriction sites to both zzso zzso of the zzso gene was zzso zzso by joining in predicted order the ten segments of zzso which had been chemically zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The synthetic gene was cloned into zzso zzso zzso bearing the gene analog was identified by dot zzso and restriction zzso zzso zzso sequence of the gene was determined by the zzso chain termination zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
