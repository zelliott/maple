Three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso library constructed from feeding females of zzso zzso The library was screened with three separate zzso zzso gene fragments amplified from zzso of zzso zzso using consensus zzso zzso Each predicted protein contains a zzso signal zzso a zzso and a mature protein of zzso zzso zzso One of the predicted zzso zzso has zzso identity to a zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and analysis of key zzso involved in zzso binding also suggests a zzso zzso zzso and zzso show greatest zzso to zzso but sequence analysis does not allow prediction of their zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis suggests that zzso and zzso are zzso by zzso genes in contrast to zzso which may have two or more zzso The regions zzso the mature zzso were cloned into an expression zzso and zzso protein produced in zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso were zzso after zzso to cleave the synthetic zzso zzso and this activity could be inhibited by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no activity against the synthetic zzso zzso The information gained from these studies indicates that zzso zzso are an important group of zzso in zzso zzso and further characterization will aid the development of a zzso zzso approach for transgenic plant resistance to plant zzso zzso
