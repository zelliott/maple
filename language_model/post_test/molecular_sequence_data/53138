In an attempt to zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso formation in the developing brain, we analyzed 130 zzso zzso peptides of membrane proteins zzso from newborn mouse zzso We describe here the characterization of a membrane protein with an apparent molecular mass of 46 zzso a member of the zzso zzso of which the zzso sequence was recently reported, zzso the mouse zzso of the human zzso and zzso zzso zzso Western and Northern zzso analyses demonstrated the abundant expression of zzso in the mouse brain, the highest level being observed in the newborn mouse brain, and its expression was detected in zzso as early as at zzso 5 days zzso zzso but decreased rapidly after zzso On in zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was observed throughout the newborn mouse zzso In primary zzso from the zzso of mouse zzso the expression of zzso was observed throughout the cells including those in growth cones on zzso In order to determine whether or not zzso is involved in cell zzso zzso zzso were carried zzso zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso which was inhibited by specific zzso against the zzso domain of zzso In addition to its action as a virus zzso zzso may function naturally as an zzso zzso involved in zzso formation in the developing nervous zzso
