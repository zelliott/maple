The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was generated by random zzso zzso in the effective strain zzso The zzso did not produce fluorescent zzso in zzso light on the LB medium containing zzso white, which suggests that modification occurred in the production of zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso zzso both on minimal and zzso zzso media, and this was most likely connected with the absence of the second zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso was defective in zzso with alfalfa and formed on roots of host plants zzso zzso and zzso zzso white round zzso zzso or zzso of irregular zzso These zzso possessed the structure usually described for zzso of zzso zzso According to the data of sequencing a DNA zzso of the zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso contained a zzso zzso in gene zzso located on the zzso zzso zzso This gene encodes the protein sharing zzso with the zzso zzso a component of a type I zzso system responsible for the export of protein toxins and zzso in zzso zzso The presence of proteins zzso zzso of zzso and protein zzso zzso for zzso of zzso which are known to be exported by the type I zzso system, was tested in cultural zzso of zzso zzso and the parental strain by zzso zzso zzso It was zzso that zzso proteins zzso and zzso are absent in the culture medium of zzso zzso The zzso protein of zzso zzso is assumed to be involved in the zzso of proteins zzso and zzso
