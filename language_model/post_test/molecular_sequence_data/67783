zzso from Asian swamp zzso zzso zzso was zzso from fish muscle using salt zzso followed by column zzso and molecular zzso The zzso zzso of zzso wet weight of muscle was determined for its molecular mass by zzso to be zzso Using zzso focusing technique, the zzso zzso showed two derivatives with zzso of zzso and zzso Six zzso fragments of this protein identified by zzso were zzso to zzso of sea raven zzso zzso zzso tuna zzso zzso blue zzso zzso zzso common carp zzso zzso and goldfish zzso zzso According to the zzso zzso the swamp zzso zzso had zzso stability higher than walking zzso zzso zzso zzso and striped zzso zzso zzso zzso between 30 and zzso For the zzso stability of zzso the swamp zzso zzso showed a zzso behavior due to the zzso zzso and the zzso orientation disorder, with the lowest increase in both zzso and zzso The zzso sensitivity of swamp zzso zzso was lower than those of the other zzso for both of fast and slow reaction zzso These results suggest that the swamp zzso zzso zzso structure is zzso stable, which is consistent with zzso behavior of the swamp zzso particularly in drought zzso
