zzso zzso zzso experiments that achieve zzso zzso decoupling in both the indirectly detected F1 and directly detected zzso dimensions were used to assign the highly overlapped zzso zzso spectrum of the zzso zzso both free in solution and bound to zzso zzso zzso decoupling during the evolution period was achieved using a double zzso field zzso zzso zzso with zzso shaped zzso zzso zzso decoupling during the acquisition period was achieved by zzso zzso shaped pulse zzso Regular zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso measured with zzso zzso decoupling in the evolution zzso dimension zzso zzso and zzso zzso and with zzso zzso decoupling in both the F1 and zzso dimensions zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are reported and compared for the zzso and its zzso zzso Complete assignment of the zzso zzso of the free and zzso zzso was achieved with the high resolution of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is of interest because of the ability of the zzso to neutralize the zzso activity of zzso
