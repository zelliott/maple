zzso regulates the B zzso expression of the zzso gene together with members of the zzso family of zzso zzso The zzso proteins on their own bind poorly to the zzso binding site, but can be recruited to the site by cooperative interactions with zzso The structure of the zzso domain of zzso and the paired domain of zzso bound to DNA reveals the molecular details of the selective recruitment of different zzso proteins by zzso zzso with structures of zzso alone bound to both zzso and zzso DNA sites reveals that zzso alters the zzso contacts with zzso The ability of one protein to alter the DNA zzso contacts of another provides a general mechanism for zzso regulation of zzso
