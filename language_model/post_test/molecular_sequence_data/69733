The three-dimensional structure of a zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso zzso The structure was solved using molecular replacement techniques and refined by simulated zzso to an zzso of zzso Bond lengths and angles in the zzso have root mean square zzso from ideal values of zzso A and zzso degrees, zzso zzso is an zzso protein with four zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso is located in a zzso between two zzso zzso with the recently determined structure of a different plant zzso suggests that class I zzso zzso are highly zzso in their three-dimensional zzso Except for two extra zzso at the zzso and the zzso of the plant zzso the C alpha atoms of the two zzso can be superimposed with a root mean square zzso of only zzso zzso Greater variations are found between the surfaces of the two zzso as most of the identical zzso between the two zzso are either buried or clustered on the surface that lies adjacent to the zzso zzso We suggest that this zzso surface functions in zzso binding during zzso zzso zzso zzso
