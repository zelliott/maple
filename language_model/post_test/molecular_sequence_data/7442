zzso is an zzso gene that encodes a synthetic element required to initiate zzso zzso zzso anchor zzso In this study we characterized zzso sequence zzso the previously identified zzso end of the zzso zzso gene and analyzed zzso levels of zzso gene expression in zzso in different zzso We found that the zzso sequence contains 1) alternative zzso start sites at zzso and zzso relative to previously known zzso 1 zzso 2) an zzso and multiple zzso zzso and zzso zzso and 3) a zzso zzso segment bounded by zzso zzso Our survey of zzso zzso levels in zzso unexpectedly revealed that zzso expression levels are 2-4 fold higher in the brain than in other zzso
