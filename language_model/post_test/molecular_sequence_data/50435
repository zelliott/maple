zzso zzso 29 DNA replication is initiated when a zzso of zzso is zzso linked to a free zzso of the terminal zzso in a reaction zzso by the viral DNA zzso We demonstrate that zzso DNA molecules are active templates for the zzso initiation reaction and can be zzso by zzso 29 DNA zzso Using synthetic zzso we carried out a zzso analysis of the zzso 29 DNA right end to evaluate the effect of zzso changes at the replication origin and to determine the precise initiation zzso The results indicate that zzso there are no strict sequence requirements for zzso initiation on zzso zzso zzso initiation of replication occurs opposite the second zzso at the 3' end of the zzso zzso a terminal repetition of at least two zzso is required to efficiently zzso the initiation complex; and zzso all the zzso of the template, including the 3' terminal one, are zzso A zzso model is proposed in which a special transition step from initiation to zzso can account for these zzso The possible implication of this mechanism for the zzso of the initiation reaction is zzso Since all the terminal zzso zzso have some sequence zzso at the DNA ends, this proposed zzso model could be zzso to other systems that use proteins as zzso
