Recent studies have showed that zzso zzso factors regulate early zzso zzso is a zzso of zzso zzso factor, which zzso and positively regulates zzso zzso Here, we report that the positive function of zzso is required for zzso expression during zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso has led to a reduction in the expression of zzso and the zzso target genes zzso and zzso and inhibited proper zzso zzso By contrast, expression of zzso stem cell and zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and expression of zzso whose product directs zzso expression via its direct binding to the zzso promoter, were zzso suggesting that zzso is a functionally important target gene of zzso The zzso zzso repression was relieved by forced expression of zzso zzso but not by a zzso lacking the positive zzso zzso this study provides evidence that zzso plays an important role in zzso gene expression and zzso through its zzso zzso zzso
