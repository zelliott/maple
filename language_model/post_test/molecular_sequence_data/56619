zzso in the zzso gene of zzso zzso were isolated as zzso of delta zzso zzso that interfere with adjacent gene zzso Recent genetic evidence indicates that the zzso protein functions with two other zzso zzso and zzso in some aspect of zzso zzso In this work we have characterized the zzso gene and we demonstrate that zzso zzso like zzso and zzso zzso cause changes in zzso Using the cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in contrast to zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are zzso zzso zzso zzso are viable and have an zzso zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso gene predicts a protein product of 102 zzso acids that contains four zzso zzso positioned similarly to those of zinc binding zzso zzso analysis suggests that at least some of these zzso are essential for zzso zzso zzso mapping showed that zzso is a previously unidentified gene that maps to zzso zzso between zzso and zzso
