zzso zzso zzso represent the major class of detoxifying zzso from zzso zzso As a result, they are candidates for zzso and vaccine zzso Indeed, zzso from zzso zzso have been found to be effective for zzso sheep and cattle against zzso This zzso contains at least seven zzso zzso of which four have been zzso The cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso all belong to the zzso class of zzso share greater than zzso sequence identity, yet display distinct zzso zzso zzso of zzso were obtained using the hanging drop zzso diffusion zzso The zzso belong to space group zzso with one zzso in the zzso unit, which zzso to a very high zzso content of approximately zzso The zzso zzso is generated via a zzso zzso zzso The three-dimensional structure of zzso was solved by molecular replacement using the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso crystal structure as a search zzso The structure adopts the zzso zzso fold zzso two zzso an zzso zzso domain, consisting of a zzso zzso and three zzso whilst the zzso domain is entirely zzso The presence of zzso in zzso results in a 6 degrees zzso rotation in comparison to zzso where the equivalent zzso is a zzso zzso models of zzso zzso and zzso based on the zzso crystal structure, reveal critical differences in the zzso lining the zzso binding site, particularly at zzso positions 9, 106 and zzso In addition, differences amongst the zzso in the zzso binding site were noted, which may explain the observed differential binding of large zzso The major zzso zzso of zzso were surprisingly found not to reside on the most zzso regions of the zzso
