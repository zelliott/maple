The zzso protein II zzso et zzso 1996, zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso The full length protein was strictly bound to the zzso coli zzso and could only be removed by zzso treatment indicating the presence of a membrane zzso The iron sulfur cluster was correctly inserted into a fraction of the full length protein and much more effectively into a soluble form created by the deletion of the 45 zzso zzso zzso The soluble form of the protein displayed the typical zzso properties of a respiratory zzso zzso The zzso potential was zzso zzso determined by CD zzso zzso The presented data demonstrate that the structure of the zzso protein is very similar or identical to the authentic protein making this a powerful model system for the studies of zzso proteins by site directed zzso
