zzso zzso zzso are the major component of zzso bodies, the pathological hallmark of Parkinson's disease zzso Here, we use results from an extensive investigation employing solid-state zzso to present a detailed structural characterization and zzso dynamics zzso of full-length AS zzso Our results show that the core extends with a repeated structural zzso This result disagrees with the previously proposed fold of AS zzso obtained with limited solid-state zzso zzso Additionally, our results demonstrate that the three single point zzso associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso located in structured zzso We find that zzso and zzso zzso located in rigid zzso of the zzso zzso are associated with major and minor structural zzso zzso
