The zzso zzso DNA sequence of zzso zzso zzso is completed and compared with the large zzso region sequences from 6 related zzso The zzso zzso of the tribe zzso zzso and zzso show several distinctive zzso including zzso gene zzso zzso zzso repeat expansions, and gene and zzso zzso The zzso region in zzso section zzso was relocated as a result of 2 overlapping zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The 1st, larger inversion is shared by all members of the zzso indicating that it occurred in the common zzso of the zzso Similar zzso were also identified in the zzso zzso of zzso In this case, 2 fragments including zzso and zzso genes were moved by 2 additional zzso of 14 and 59 zzso that are unique to zzso Other zzso in the zzso are confined to certain regions of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso including the presence of highly repeated sequences and zzso of coding and zzso sequences that are inserted into zzso and between zzso and zzso These insertions are correlated with the loss of 2 zzso in zzso and a serial loss of segments of zzso The loss of the zzso gene and zzso zzso in both the zzso family zzso and the zzso family zzso are clearly independent evolutionary zzso However, their zzso organization is surprisingly similar despite the distant relationship of these 2 zzso zzso
