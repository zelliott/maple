zzso are zzso zzso zzso pathogens that replicate within a zzso compartment termed an zzso Throughout their development, they actively modify the zzso zzso The type III zzso zzso system is the main process by which the bacteria zzso zzso proteins into the inclusion membrane and the host cell zzso Here we describe a family of type III zzso zzso that are present in all zzso zzso and absent in the zzso zzso It is defined by a common domain of unknown function, zzso that is present in four or five proteins in each zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso of zzso proteins functions as a zzso zzso zzso proteins from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are expressed at the middle and late zzso of the infectious zzso zzso further revealed that zzso and zzso are zzso into the host cell zzso as well as within the zzso of the zzso where they do not associate with bacterial zzso Finally, we show that zzso proteins are present in zzso of infected cells, suggesting that members of the zzso family of zzso proteins may target nuclear cell zzso The expansion of this family of proteins in zzso zzso and their conservation among the different species suggest that they play important roles in the infectious zzso
