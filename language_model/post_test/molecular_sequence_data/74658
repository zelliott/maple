In zzso zzso zzso are widely expressed in various zzso but their functions are zzso The molecular mechanisms of zzso factors, initiators of zzso healing and being greatly involved in zzso have remained zzso zzso is the first example of a naturally existing zzso protein complex of a zzso zzso and a zzso factor from zzso zzso zzso skin zzso Here we report the investigation of its in zzso toxic effects on mice and zzso The zzso values of zzso on mice were determined to be zzso zzso and 20 zzso under zzso zzso and intravenous zzso injection, zzso The mice zzso injected with zzso (6 zzso body zzso showed strong zzso of subcutaneous zzso vessel, but no zzso spots were zzso zzso injection of zzso in rabbits zzso zzso body zzso caused a rapidly zzso effect and followed with cardiovascular zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly decreased zzso zzso and mean zzso volume zzso of the rabbits in 5 zzso At the same time, the counts of zzso and white blood cells were significantly decreased zzso while the blood levels of zzso zzso zzso and serum zzso zzso were significantly increased zzso Furthermore, serials of zzso zzso and damages were also zzso These results indicate that zzso rapidly caused several in zzso toxic effects on zzso and its lethal toxic potency was mainly contributed by zzso and cardiovascular collapse, providing new clues for the understanding of the zzso roles of zzso zzso and zzso zzso
