zzso tuberculosis resistance to zzso results from zzso changes in the gene zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We developed a reverse zzso line probe zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso carrying one zzso probe for the detection of zzso tuberculosis complex strains and nine zzso designed to detect zzso changes in the relevant part of zzso This zzso was evaluated with 107 zzso tuberculosis zzso with known zzso zzso 52 zzso tuberculosis complex zzso and 61 and zzso clinical zzso found to be sensitive and zzso respectively, by in zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso the zzso tuberculosis complex probe was zzso specific, zzso when compared to the results of zzso sequencing, no discrepancies with the results of zzso zzso zzso were observed, zzso all strains sensitive by in zzso zzso testing were correctly identified, and zzso among the strains resistant by in zzso zzso testing, only 4 zzso yielded conflicting zzso The zzso zzso zzso is therefore a reliable and widely zzso zzso and a valuable tool for routine diagnostic use, given its simplicity and rapid zzso
