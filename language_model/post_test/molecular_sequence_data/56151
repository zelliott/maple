A genetically defined zzso designated zzso results in altered zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produce a zzso zzso that contains zzso A and a single sugar zzso zzso acid, in the zzso core zzso Such zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso structures were previously designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit increased zzso to a number of zzso and zzso zzso By restriction analyses and zzso studies, we clearly defined the zzso gene on a zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene and the zzso zzso locus regions were completely zzso Additionally, the location of the zzso gene on the physical map of the zzso coli zzso was zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso in an in zzso expression zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene product confirmed the first 24 zzso acid zzso as deduced from the zzso sequence of the zzso gene coding zzso By zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is transformed with the zzso coli zzso zzso and the zzso is characterized by zzso sensitivity to zzso zzso zzso growth at 600 zzso of zzso per zzso and restoration of the ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the identity and significant similarity of the zzso gene sequence and its product to the recently defined zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso gene sequence and its product zzso 1), the zzso coli K-12 zzso locus will be designated zzso
