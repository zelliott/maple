The zzso zzso of methane zzso is an important methane sink in marine zzso zzso by still zzso zzso We established an experimental system to grow zzso communities in different zzso zzso zzso to show growth of the zzso zzso zzso have been either via zzso acids zzso zzso or required long-term zzso Previous long-term experiments with zzso methane led to an unspecific distribution of the zzso Although quantitative zzso is a sensitive technique to detect small changes in community zzso it does not determine growth zzso zzso we tested an alternative method to detect a biomass increase of zzso zzso with zzso ammonium as zzso After only 3 weeks, significant zzso became apparent in zzso acids as major structural units of microbial zzso This was especially evident in zzso zzso showing the zzso zzso of the zzso ammonium by zzso Cell counts demonstrated a two- and fourfold increase at ambient or elevated methane zzso With zzso zzso gel zzso over 6 months incubation no changes in community composition of zzso bacteria and zzso were zzso These data indicate doubling times for zzso zzso between 2 and zzso zzso In conclusion, the zzso approach proved to be a sensitive and fast way to show growth of extremely zzso zzso
