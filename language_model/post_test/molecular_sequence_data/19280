The zzso zzso carrier zzso has 6 zzso regions and 3 zzso zzso Our previous zzso study on the zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso bovine type 1 zzso zzso in which the zzso 11 zzso acids of bovine type 1 zzso are zzso with the corresponding 26 zzso acids of zzso type 2 zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso expression system suggested the possibility of a different structural feature between their zzso In the present study, we compared the effects of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso and zzso in order to study the difference between these zzso of the 2 zzso zzso is known to zzso 2 zzso molecules in a functional zzso via a zzso zzso in each first zzso loop zzso zzso exhibited zzso and zzso zzso in agreement with the results of a previous study on the native bovine carrier and suggesting that zzso had the same structure as the native zzso zzso also showed zzso and zzso zzso However, the speed of formation of the zzso zzso of zzso was faster than that of zzso suggesting that the zzso state of the zzso was different between the 2 zzso In addition, we also studied the effects of zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso on the zzso
