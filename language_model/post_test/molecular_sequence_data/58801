zzso zzso zzso protein zzso can be zzso with zzso in zzso solution to yield stable zzso zzso zzso zzso complex zzso This zzso is not significantly affected when up to ten zzso acids are deleted on the zzso of zzso or when a zzso which is 11 positions from the C zzso zzso is exchanged with other zzso acids zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 57, zzso Here we show that the exchange of zzso with zzso or zzso completely zzso the ability of the protein to assemble into zzso zzso either upon zzso of zzso complexes in zzso solution or upon zzso into isolated zzso It is concluded that part of the zzso domain on the zzso of zzso although not essential for the formation of stable zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso The different degree to which various zzso acids in place of zzso affect trainer formation suggests that a zzso zzso acid is needed in this zzso
