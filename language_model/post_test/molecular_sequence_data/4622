The zzso B virus zzso zzso zzso was investigated as a carrier zzso for zzso protein zzso repeat B cell zzso of the zzso malaria agent zzso zzso A zzso expressing a hybrid gene coding for the dominant zzso repeat zzso zzso was constructed and transformed into zzso zzso zzso The resulting hybrid zzso zzso were zzso from zzso zzso zzso They zzso as particles and displayed zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate zzso and protective zzso zzso mice were zzso with the hybrid zzso zzso zzso resulted in high zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso zzso zzso mice zzso with hybrid zzso particles were between zzso protected against subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso immunity persisted for a minimum of three zzso These data confirm the previous suggestion zzso et zzso zzso that hybrid zzso particles could become a useful component of future human malaria zzso
