We determined several internal zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso zzso (one of the zzso zzso of rabbit skeletal zzso All the sequences of zzso determined were found in the zzso region of zzso which is the region assumed to be the zzso domain of zzso zzso et zzso (1992) Nature zzso zzso zzso zzso is identical with zzso We raised an zzso zzso against a synthetic zzso equivalent to one of the internal zzso acid sequences of zzso The zzso specifically reacted with zzso of rabbit skeletal zzso zzso however, did not react with zzso the other zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso are different proteins from each zzso When the human control muscles were zzso zzso zzso stained the cell surface zzso and exclusively reacted with a single protein similar to zzso in the zzso zzso The protein was also detected in the zzso extract of the zzso muscular zzso zzso muscle devoid of zzso When the muscle specimens from 30 zzso patients were zzso examined with the zzso the cell surface zzso were consistently zzso zzso we conclude that the zzso zzso zzso is retained in zzso zzso
