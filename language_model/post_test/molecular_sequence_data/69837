zzso zzso receptors zzso form a family of zzso zzso channels that are concentrated at zzso zzso on zzso zzso and muscle zzso At the zzso zzso muscle zzso bind zzso released by the zzso motor zzso The receptors then undergo a zzso change that opens their zzso zzso zzso move passively through the zzso pores down their zzso zzso completing synaptic transmission by zzso the zzso zzso The channel only zzso discriminates among zzso zzso which include all zzso and zzso zzso that are small enough to fit through the zzso cross zzso The zzso region of the pore is lined by zzso zzso that are bracketed by zzso with net negative zzso The pore has large entrance zzso especially facing zzso The zzso zzso is located near the zzso end of the zzso region, and this short narrow region probably provides the main zzso binding site that is directly in the zzso zzso zzso zzso share many of the properties of muscle zzso but the zzso zzso zzso are more zzso zzso zzso and zzso There are especially important functional differences between muscle and zzso zzso For example, zzso zzso are more highly permeable to zzso and zzso levels of zzso very zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This variety of zzso suggests that these zzso serve many roles in the excitable zzso of zzso
