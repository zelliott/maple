We have zzso zzso and characterized a 216 zzso acid zzso sequence zzso a putative idealized zzso zzso The design was elaborated in two zzso First, the idealized backbone was defined with geometric parameters representing our target zzso a central eight zzso zzso surrounded by eight parallel zzso connected together with short structural turns on both sides of the zzso An automated sequence selection algorithm, based on the dead-end elimination zzso was used to find the optimal zzso acid sequence fitting the target zzso A synthetic gene coding for the designed sequence was constructed and the zzso artificial protein was expressed in bacteria, zzso and zzso zzso CD zzso with prominent bands at zzso and zzso revealed the presence of zzso secondary structures zzso in fairly good agreement with the zzso A pronounced zzso band in the zzso CD region, arising from immobilized aromatic zzso showed that the artificial protein is folded in zzso Chemical unfolding monitored by zzso zzso revealed a zzso stability zzso of zzso zzso unfolding monitored by zzso CD revealed a cooperative transition with an apparent zzso of 65 degrees zzso Moreover, the artificial protein did not exhibit any affinity for the zzso fluorescent probe zzso acid zzso providing additional evidence that the artificial barrel is not in the molten zzso state, contrary to previously designed artificial zzso Finally, zzso zzso zzso of the folded and unfolded proteins provided evidence for specific interactions in the folded zzso Taken together, the results indicate that the de zzso designed zzso protein adopts a stable three-dimensional structure in zzso These encouraging results show that de zzso design of an idealized protein structure of more than 200 zzso acid zzso is now possible, from construction of a particular backbone zzso to determination of an zzso acid sequence with an automated sequence selection zzso
