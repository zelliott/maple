Recently, two sets of single, zzso and quadruple zzso changes within the zzso zzso binding pocket of zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to exhibit zzso zzso effects zzso zzso Wagner, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 33, zzso In particular, the analysis of data for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed zzso changes in the free energy associated with the zzso and zzso zzso hydride transfer, and product release zzso Construction of a related set of zzso proteins including zzso and zzso permits a comparison of similar energy changes and provides a means for assessing differences in the interactions of zzso and zzso with both the zzso and the side chains at zzso zzso We find a single functional group change, from zzso zzso to zzso zzso can influence the zzso of zzso effects and serve as a probe to monitor the appearance of differing zzso zzso along the reaction zzso through changes in the interaction energy zzso zzso The comparison of zzso in free energy changes for three interrelated double zzso cycles zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrates that the side chains of positions 28 and 54 interact zzso to facilitate hydride transfer by zzso influencing the zzso zzso zzso The delta zzso data for individual steps also provide evidence for multiple zzso of the zzso operating during the zzso zzso The fact that there are no published examples of the synergistic enhancement of favorable zzso effects is consistent with the expectation that the zzso site surface of zzso zzso zzso has been zzso
