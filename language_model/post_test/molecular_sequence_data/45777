zzso zzso c are difficult to produce in zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso contains more than a hundred genes coding for zzso zzso Among those are two zzso zzso c representing a new class of zzso zzso whose putative structure is a one-dimensional array of small highly zzso zzso that contain three zzso and are zzso bound by short zzso They are likely to form zzso that are part of the electron transfer zzso We cloned the genes coding for the two zzso into a zzso we developed for zzso cloning of proteins targeted to the zzso coli zzso zzso We expressed the proteins in zzso coli zzso with a zzso harboring the zzso c maturation zzso zzso levels were zzso by varying zzso zzso used for zzso Although both proteins appeared zzso or strongly associated with cell zzso they were zzso using zzso M sodium zzso which was more selective than conventional zzso agents, such as zzso or zzso The zzso proteins were zzso and zzso by zzso exchange zzso followed by gel zzso zzso analysis confirmed that both zzso proteins contained the complete set of zzso attached zzso 12 per zzso Their visible zzso were typical of zzso zzso Both proteins were successfully zzso
