zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso disorder characterized by severe zzso zzso leading to blindness, with an zzso of 1 in 300,000 in zzso Our previous genetic linkage study localized the gene responsible to a zzso zzso on zzso zzso Clinical manifestations, which appear in the first decade of life, include blurred vision, zzso and zzso zzso By the third decade, raised, zzso zzso masses severely impair visual zzso and zzso zzso is required for most zzso Here we report DNA sequencing, zzso cloning and zzso analyses of four deleterious zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso (formerly zzso and zzso zzso a gastrointestinal zzso zzso The zzso zzso was the most common zzso in the zzso patients zzso accounting for 33 of 40 zzso disease zzso in our panel of zzso zzso expression analysis revealed zzso of the zzso truncated protein in the zzso region, whereas the normal protein was distributed zzso in the zzso with a zzso or fine zzso zzso Our successful identification of the gene that is defective in zzso should facilitate genetic diagnosis and potentially treatment of the disease, and enhance general understanding of the mechanisms of zzso
