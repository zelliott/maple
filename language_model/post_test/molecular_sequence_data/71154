Although cell zzso regulation of the zzso genes in zzso zzso is a model for zzso sensing in zzso bacteria, relatively little is known about the promoter of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is activated by the zzso zzso which requires a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso box, a 20 zzso zzso zzso is located in the zzso promoter region and is required for zzso induction of the zzso zzso Using primer extension, we mapped the zzso zzso start site of the zzso zzso to 19 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso This indicates that the zzso box is zzso at zzso zzso from the start of zzso To gain evidence about the location of the zzso zzso we placed a consensus zzso zzso at different locations relative to the zzso zzso start site and measured zzso levels of zzso in zzso zzso zzso The strongest zzso promoter contained a zzso zzso 17 zzso from the zzso consensus sequence and 6 zzso from the zzso start zzso We propose that this is the zzso zzso Also in zzso zzso coli, both zzso of the zzso box were required for zzso gene zzso and for zzso by an zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso of zzso was eliminated when the zzso box was zzso at zzso zzso and zzso with respect to the zzso zzso start zzso Our evidence, taken together with other information, points to a model in which a zzso zzso zzso the zzso region of the zzso promoter and functions as an zzso zzso with each zzso zzso interacting with a different region of zzso zzso
