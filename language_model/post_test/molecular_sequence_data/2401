To define the zzso elements important for rat insulin II gene zzso we analyzed the effects of zzso deletions and zzso zzso on the expression of a rat insulin II reporter gene in an zzso cell line zzso The reporter gene contained zzso base pairs of zzso sequence joined to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso deletion zzso indicated that the minimal sequence requirement for efficient expression was 218 base pairs of zzso zzso and at least three regions downstream from - 218 were important for zzso A more precise zzso of these elements and the zzso sequences in the promoter was achieved by analysis of the expression of 18 zzso zzso In these studies at least four other regions important for expression of the rat insulin II gene were zzso These findings suggest that the sequences important for rat insulin II and rat insulin I expression may differ significantly despite the high degree of sequence similarity in their zzso zzso
