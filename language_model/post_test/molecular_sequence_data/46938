We have identified two zzso zzso zzso zzso complexes from zzso zzso the zzso zzso complex and the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso complex contains several zzso which also function as part of other protein complexes, including a subset of zzso box binding zzso factors zzso and zzso These observations raise the question of whether the zzso zzso complex is a zzso of zzso or whether it is a distinct zzso complex that also shares zzso with zzso To address this issue, we sought to determine if the zzso complex contained zzso that are not present in the zzso zzso In this study, we report the zzso of the zzso complex over 10 zzso zzso By a combination of mass zzso analysis and zzso we demonstrate that the adapter proteins zzso zzso and zzso are indeed integral components of zzso Furthermore, we identify the product of the zzso zzso gene zzso as a novel zzso of the zzso complex and name it zzso for zzso zzso complex component zzso zzso functions of zzso have not been zzso However, zzso in high copy numbers suppresses the cold sensitivity caused by particular zzso in zzso zzso Pinto and zzso Winston, personal zzso which encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso disrupted the integrity of the zzso complex but did not affect zzso or give rise to classic zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso and zzso function as part of a unique zzso complex zzso and represent shared zzso between this complex and zzso
