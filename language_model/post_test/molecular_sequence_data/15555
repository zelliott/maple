zzso proteins zzso the main targets of zzso zzso are zzso zzso that catalyze the two last steps in the zzso of zzso In zzso pneumoniae, a major human zzso the surge in resistance to such antibiotics is a direct consequence of the proliferation of mosaic zzso zzso which give rise to proteins containing tens of zzso zzso is a major drug resistance target, and its modification is essential for the development of high levels of resistance to zzso In this work, we have solved the crystal structures of zzso from a zzso zzso strain, as well as from a highly drug-resistant clinical isolate displaying 58 zzso Although zzso are present throughout the entire zzso structure, those surrounding the active site influence the total charge and the polar character of the region, while those in close proximity to the zzso zzso impart flexibility onto the zzso loop area, which encapsulates the zzso The wealth of structural data on zzso zzso now zzso the importance of high zzso in active site regions of drug-resistant zzso suggesting that active site zzso could be a common mechanism employed by this pathogen to prevent targeting by zzso
