Most spontaneously occurring zzso that cause extensive zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso cell fusion are single zzso acid changes within zzso K zzso Despite the strong genetic association of zzso with zzso cell fusion, its direct involvement in cellular membrane fusion has been controversial, largely due to previously unsuccessful efforts to detect zzso expression on zzso and cellular zzso Recently, we showed that zzso is expressed on zzso zzso and functioned in virus entry zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To determine whether zzso is expressed on cellular surfaces, as well as its membrane zzso we generated the zzso viruses zzso zzso zzso and zzso insertions of the zzso zzso zzso within each of four zzso of zzso predicted to zzso either in the zzso side or in the zzso side of cellular zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses of infected cells showed that both zzso and zzso forms of zzso were expressed on cell zzso Analysis of the zzso of the zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso I and IV were located zzso whereas zzso II and III were localized zzso zzso expressed zzso failed to zzso in cellular plasma zzso In contrast, infection of zzso cells with the zzso virus zzso enabled expression of zzso on cell surfaces, as well as zzso membrane zzso zzso experiments revealed that the zzso protein enabled cell surface expression of zzso but not zzso zzso fusion, indicating that additional viral proteins are required for expression of the zzso zzso zzso
