zzso toxin must undergo a specific zzso reaction and subsequent reduction to express the zzso zzso activity that is responsible for its zzso In an effort to identify potential cellular zzso that might be involved in this process we have found that a human urinary zzso zzso zzso is capable of specifically zzso diphtheria toxin to yield an zzso active A zzso (more homogeneous than that produced by zzso zzso and a B zzso (with an identical zzso sequence to that produced by zzso zzso The results raise the possibility that zzso or zzso zzso play a role in diphtheria zzso zzso
