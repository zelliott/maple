We have demonstrated that calf liver protein zzso (Mr zzso is a zzso for calf zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso insulin zzso zzso This reaction can be used as a simple zzso for protein zzso during zzso in place of the classical method of zzso of incorrectly oxidized zzso zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso which were reduced by zzso and calf zzso zzso zzso approximately 35 zzso The zzso was a poor zzso for zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso but the addition of zzso coli zzso resulted in rapid reduction of two zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to monitor the zzso state of protein zzso Fluorescence zzso demonstrated that zzso reduced the zzso of the zzso and allowed the zzso of the reaction to be zzso the reaction was also zzso by calf zzso zzso zzso zzso showed that the apparent zzso potential of the active site zzso of the zzso zzso of protein zzso was about 30 zzso higher than the zzso of zzso coli zzso zzso with this, experiments using zzso or zzso and zzso zzso reduction and zzso of insulin demonstrated differences between protein zzso and zzso zzso being a better zzso zzso but less efficient zzso zzso zzso is thus a high molecular weight member of the zzso system, able to interact with both zzso zzso zzso and reduced zzso This may be important for nascent protein zzso formation and other zzso zzso reactions in zzso
