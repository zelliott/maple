zzso is a small protein that appears to be involved in the mechanism of zzso metal zzso tolerance in zzso Here we report the crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso with and without zzso and its zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that zzso forms a stable zzso structure with intertwined zzso zzso The crystal structure of the zzso complex shows that the zzso is located at a zzso interface and is recognized by the side chains of one zzso from each zzso In an in zzso experiment, zzso bound to several heavy metals, most of which led to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso could be completely zzso by addition of zzso zzso acid zzso or dialysis against metal free zzso zzso of zzso with Ala led to a decrease in the amount of zzso suggesting the significant contribution of zzso to the zzso zzso To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report which provides the structural evidence for heavy zzso zzso of a zzso
