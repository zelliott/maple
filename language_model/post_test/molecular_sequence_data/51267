The expression of zzso zzso zzso in the developing chicken lens was examined and compared with that in the zzso of the chicken zzso zzso expression was measured by zzso and zzso during development, and zzso zzso was zzso by Northern zzso and zzso scanning and localized by in zzso zzso A functional promoter of the chicken zzso gene was identified by zzso of primary embryonic chicken lens zzso cells and analyzed in deletion zzso The results establish that zzso makes up about zzso of the total soluble protein of the embryonic chicken zzso an amount insufficient to make it a candidate for an zzso zzso in this zzso Lens fiber differentiation coincided with a loss of zzso zzso and zzso by contrast, zzso persisted in the zzso cells of the embryonic and mature zzso This and previous studies showed that zzso amounts to as much as zzso of the protein of the embryonic chicken zzso and follows a different zzso time course of zzso like the zzso zzso decreases until day 10 in the embryonic zzso but, unlike the zzso it increases thereafter and zzso at zzso Progressive deletions of the zzso zzso regions (from position zzso to zzso of the zzso gene fused to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso reporter gene resulted in a gradual loss of promoter activity, consistent with an additive effect of putative zzso elements found in many zzso zzso These experiments provide the foundation for a molecular analysis of the zzso and differential regulation of the zzso gene in lens and zzso
