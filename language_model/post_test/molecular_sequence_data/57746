The zzso zzso zzso often responds to drug pressure by amplifying part of its zzso At least two zzso derived from the same 800 zzso zzso were amplified either as zzso circles or linear fragments after sodium zzso zzso A 50 zzso linear zzso was detected in six independent zzso zzso and zzso grown in absence of zzso rapidly lost the zzso and part of their zzso The circular zzso zzso all derived from the H locus of zzso were characterized more zzso In all cases, direct repeated sequences appeared to be involved in the formation of circular zzso Most zzso were generated after zzso zzso between two linked zzso zzso This zzso event was, in two cases, associated with the loss of one zzso of the zzso zzso A novel zzso point was found in a zzso where the zzso was created by zzso between two zzso zzso direct repeats surrounding the zzso gene present at the H zzso It is also at one of these repeats that an H circle with large zzso zzso was zzso We propose that the presence of repeated sequences in the H locus zzso the amplification of the drug resistance genes concentrated in this zzso
