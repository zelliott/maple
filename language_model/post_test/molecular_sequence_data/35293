zzso dietary fat zzso is essential for newborns who consume more dietary fat per body weight than at any other time of zzso In many zzso zzso pancreatic zzso related protein 2 zzso is the zzso zzso zzso Pigs may be an exception since zzso expression has been documented in the zzso but not in the zzso Because of the differences in zzso zzso we hypothesized that the kinetic properties of zzso zzso would differ from those of other zzso To characterize its properties, zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso cells and zzso to zzso zzso zzso had activity against zzso zzso and zzso The activity was not inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso which is required for the activity of pancreatic zzso zzso zzso minimally zzso zzso zzso Similar to zzso from other species, zzso from pigs had activity against zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a variety of dietary zzso including pasteurized human mother's milk and infant formula and its activity was comparable to that of zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso has broad zzso specificity and has high zzso zzso activity even in the absence of zzso The data suggest that zzso zzso would be a suitable zzso for inclusion in zzso preparations for pancreatic zzso replacement zzso
