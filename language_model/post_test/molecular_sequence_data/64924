We isolated 872 strains of zzso virus from zzso zzso in seven different districts of Japan from January 2000 to July zzso Among them, 57 strains were zzso by zzso sequencing in part of the zzso zzso and small zzso zzso protein zzso Four different zzso zzso G, K, and zzso of zzso virus were zzso in Japan and the distribution of zzso varied in geographically different zzso Two new clusters designated as zzso K and L had more than zzso zzso variation in the zzso zzso Among the 57 zzso 11 were classified as B, 35 as G, three as K, and eight as zzso which was mainly isolated in zzso We also examined 104 zzso isolated in a clinic in zzso zzso from 1993 to zzso zzso B was the indigenous strain and zzso K was introduced in zzso zzso B and K zzso in the 1990s and were replaced by zzso G in zzso There was no significant change in zzso test zzso zzso against zzso B, G, K, and L using seven zzso zzso with zzso strain zzso zzso and these four zzso had a different zzso from zzso zzso We should continue to watch on zzso virus molecular zzso
