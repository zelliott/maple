Within South Africa, zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso infection have been observed and these strains were prevalent in some zzso To examine the zzso phenomenon of zzso zzso zzso historical stool collections from South Africa spanning 15 years were screened for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso and P zzso were performed on 43 zzso strains to investigate the associated zzso zzso zzso zzso variation of the gene zzso the major zzso zzso zzso was also investigated using zzso zzso zzso In addition, the zzso gene of 14 zzso zzso strains was zzso to examine genetic zzso zzso zzso strains from South Africa displayed a 10 year zzso pattern with major zzso occurring in 1987 and zzso zzso zzso strains were also found zzso with zzso strains in 1984, 1990, and zzso The zzso strains from the major zzso appeared to have emerged from community strains in a manner similar to that suggested for zzso strains The zzso zzso strains displayed zzso I specificity and short zzso characteristic of zzso zzso zzso strains but appeared to differ in the zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed three major zzso zzso zzso zzso strains isolated prior to 1987, strains isolated between 1988 and 1994, and strains isolated from zzso The use of zzso zzso and zzso zzso designed against older zzso strains has resulted in the failure to zzso zzso strains circulating zzso
