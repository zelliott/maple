zzso p 7 is an important house dust zzso zzso However, zzso zzso of zzso p 7 are largely zzso The purpose of this study is to analyze the zzso of zzso p 7 and determine the structural basis of interactions between zzso p 7 and zzso an zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was identified by zzso using zzso zzso A 3-D zzso complex structure of zzso p 7 and zzso was simulated with zzso modeling and zzso zzso Our results obtained showed that among the five zzso p 7 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso serum zzso zzso with zzso against zzso p 7 exhibited a reduced zzso zzso zzso against zzso p 7 zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed reduced zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the observation was confirmed by zzso zzso The zzso zzso on zzso p 7 containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso assumes a zzso zzso The structural model of the zzso p zzso complex suggests zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso p 7 contribute to zzso binding via potential hydrogen bonds, zzso and zzso zzso In conclusion, zzso zzso interacts with critical zzso zzso and zzso of zzso p 7 and zzso zzso to zzso p zzso zzso obtained advance our understanding on molecular and structural bases of the zzso of zzso p 7, its interactions with zzso zzso and facilitate the design of safer zzso of human zzso zzso
