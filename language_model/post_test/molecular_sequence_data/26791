A recent study implicated a role for zzso zzso zzso in the systemic depletion of zzso levels, which in turn has been associated with human cerebral malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso by means of a zzso zzso zzso cluster in the active zzso A previous report indicated that zzso zzso zzso has a strong dependency between zzso formation, zzso activity and metal zzso zzso that abolished zzso binding also caused zzso of the zzso conversely, zzso that abolished zzso formation resulted in inactive zzso By contrast, the zzso of zzso (and therefore zzso zzso are also zzso zzso zzso zzso thus appears to be an zzso zzso and interfering with zzso formation may therefore serve as an alternative route to zzso zzso In the present study, the mechanism of the metal dependency was explored by means of zzso zzso and molecular zzso When the active site metals are removed, loss of structural integrity is zzso This is reflected by a larger zzso zzso for the protein when the active site metal is removed and some loss of secondary zzso Furthermore, zzso revealed the existence of a novel zzso zzso between zzso and zzso which was shown to be associated with the metal zzso zzso studies not only confirmed the importance of this zzso in zzso formation, but also provided evidence for the independence of zzso zzso zzso activity on zzso zzso
