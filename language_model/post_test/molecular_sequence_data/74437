We carried out a parallel zzso and zzso comparison of seeds from a transformed bread wheat line that zzso a transgenic low molecular weight zzso zzso gene relative to the corresponding zzso zzso zzso analyses showed that, during seed development, several classes of zzso proteins were zzso accumulated in the transformed zzso As a result of the strong increase in the amount of the transgenic zzso the zzso zzso zzso all zzso of zzso and zzso as well as zzso soluble proteins were diminished in the transgenic zzso The differential zzso detected by zzso zzso both in mature and developing seeds, was paralleled by the corresponding changes in transcript levels detected by zzso zzso Our results suggest that the most evident effect of the strong zzso of the transgenic zzso gene consists in a global zzso response involving a significant decrease in the amounts of zzso belonging to the zzso zzso It is likely that such compensation is a consequence of the diversion of zzso acid reserves and translation machinery to the synthesis of the transgenic zzso zzso
