zzso zzso have been mapped on the zzso zzso genetic zzso By comparison with the previously published zzso zzso the maps of zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso zzso zzso were extended and new markers were mapped on the zzso zzso of zzso 7 and on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso New orders are proposed for markers on zzso 3 and zzso Six zzso isolated from zzso were also localized on the zzso map by fluorescent in zzso zzso We tested the zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso method for zzso zzso from zzso zzso is more effective when the zzso zzso several zzso whereas zzso is more straightforward when the zzso contains a single zzso Fifteen anonymous zzso were regionally assigned by using a hybrid cell zzso For map integration, the determination of a regional assignment of anonymous zzso by using a hybrid cell panel offers an alternative to zzso isolation from zzso and their zzso by in zzso zzso
