zzso is the most active zzso zzso zzso toxin against Aedes aegypti zzso zzso aegypti alkaline zzso zzso was previously identified as a zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the cloning and functional characterization of this zzso aegypti zzso zzso Of three zzso zzso zzso the zzso produced zzso zzso was shown to bind zzso and zzso zzso zzso that specifically binds the zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso inhibited binding to brush border membrane zzso and toxicity of zzso in isolated cultured zzso Two zzso zzso binding regions zzso and zzso were mapped by characterizing binding of zzso to nine zzso overlapping peptides covering the zzso zzso Finally, by using a zzso spot array of zzso domain III and zzso zzso we show that the zzso zzso region binds zzso through domain II loop zzso while zzso zzso interacts with zzso through domain III zzso located in zzso Our results show that zzso domain II and domain III are involved in the binding with two distinct binding sites in the zzso zzso
