We present a general strategy for designing proteins to recognize DNA sequences and illustrate this with an example based on the zzso scissors zzso model for zzso zzso zzso The designed protein is formed from two copies, in tandem, of the basic zzso zzso region of zzso These copies are coupled through a zzso to yield a zzso expected to recognize the sequence zzso (the zzso zzso recognizes zzso We zzso the protein and zzso containing the proposed binding sites and used zzso zzso and zzso I zzso to establish that the zzso binds specifically to the DNA sequence zzso but does not bind to the zzso DNA zzso nor to zzso in which the recognition zzso is modified by zzso zzso These results also provide strong support for the zzso scissors grip model for binding of zzso zzso
