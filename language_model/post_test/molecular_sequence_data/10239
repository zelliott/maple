The human zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a charged zzso zzso in its zzso that is the only sequence absent from the zzso alternatively spliced zzso zzso exits the zzso zzso zzso even when zzso zzso whereas zzso gives rise to a zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso molecules are completely retained and zzso in the zzso We have inserted the zzso zzso into the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso which caused complete zzso retention but, unexpectedly, no zzso This suggests that the zzso is a zzso for zzso retention not zzso in zzso with the zzso for zzso The state of sugar chain processing and the zzso zzso of zzso which was unchanged at 15 degrees C or after treatment with zzso indicate zzso retention and not retrieval from the zzso or the intermediate zzso zzso folded similarly to zzso and both associated to zzso However, whereas zzso zzso with a half time of 45 zzso zzso remained bound to the zzso for prolonged zzso The correct global folding of zzso and zzso and of other normal precursors and zzso proteins and the true zzso zzso and not exit and zzso suggest a difference in their quality control mechanism compared with that of zzso zzso which does involve zzso However, both pathways may involve zzso
