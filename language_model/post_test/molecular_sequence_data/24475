The zzso region is indispensable for zzso zzso (K zzso synthesis in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso produces a K zzso of zzso structure, designated as the zzso zzso The data in this report show that the zzso gene region comprises 10 open reading frames involved in bacterial zzso synthesis and zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences for the zzso gene products are zzso to zzso involved in the production of specific sugar zzso while the putative products of the zzso genes show a high degree of similarity to proteins required for transporting zzso to the cell zzso Southern analysis experiments using zzso zzso suggest that genes involved in the synthesis of the precursor zzso are unique in strain zzso whereas sequences coding for export proteins are widely distributed among zzso zzso zzso in the zzso genes result in a modified K zzso pattern and impaired symbiotic zzso On this basis, we suggest that these genes are required for the production of the zzso zzso that is necessary for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
