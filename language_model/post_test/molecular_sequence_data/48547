The zzso zzso zzso model, based on the partial structure of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso reveals an zzso zzso channel with five portals framed by adjacent zzso zzso zzso stretches within the zzso loop between the zzso and zzso zzso zzso The positive charge of zzso located within the zzso stretch, is a zzso zzso of single channel zzso zzso Further analysis reveals that positive charge and volume of zzso zzso are zzso of zzso zzso inward zzso exposing an additional role for zzso A structurally unresolved stretch of 85 zzso constitutes the bulk of the zzso loop, leaving a zzso gap in the model between zzso and the zzso zzso There are no additional structural data for this loop, which is vestigial in bacterial zzso zzso zzso channels and was largely removed for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We created zzso zzso loop zzso zzso in which sequences framing the putative portals were zzso to determine the minimum number of zzso required to maintain their functional zzso zzso to between 90 and 75 zzso acids produced zzso receptors with zzso zzso zzso to 70 zzso abolished zzso and increased zzso These findings reveal a critical zzso loop length required for functions attributable to zzso zzso zzso of all 44 zzso of the human zzso zzso receptors reveals that, despite considerable zzso in their sequences and zzso all zzso zzso exceed 70 zzso suggesting a fundamental requirement for portal zzso
