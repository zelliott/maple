The surface of the zzso zzso zzso is covered by a dense coat of zzso zzso which make a pivotal contribution to zzso protection and host immune zzso Their importance is further underscored by the presence of zzso zzso genes in the zzso zzso In the present study we demonstrate that one such group of zzso termed zzso zzso codes for previously zzso zzso zzso anchored to and zzso from the surface of zzso zzso These features are supported by the in zzso tracing and characterization of zzso zzso L products and zzso zzso molecules expressed by zzso zzso Besides displaying substantial zzso to zzso S products, which provide the scaffold for the major zzso zzso also present in zzso stages of the zzso zzso zzso zzso L products display unique structural and functional features, including being completely zzso to zzso by zzso zzso Although quantitative real zzso and gene sequencing analyses indicate a high degree of zzso conservation across the zzso zzso species, zzso L product expression and processing is quite variable among different zzso zzso
