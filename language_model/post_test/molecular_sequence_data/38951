The presence of a single resistance zzso gene zzso can determine plant disease zzso The protein products of such genes may act as receptors that specifically interact with zzso zzso Most functionally defined zzso are of the zzso binding zzso rich repeat zzso zzso family and are present as large zzso zzso The specificity of zzso interactions together with the zzso of zzso interactions raises the question of their gene number and diversity in the zzso zzso sequences from tomato showing significant zzso to genes zzso zzso resistance to pathogens were identified by systematically zzso the zzso using a variety of primer pairs based on ubiquitous zzso zzso Over 70 sequences were isolated and zzso are putative zzso zzso of the amplified sequences on the tomato genetic map revealed their organization as mixed clusters of zzso zzso that showed in many cases linkage to genetically characterized tomato resistance zzso zzso examination within zzso showed the existence of a zzso zzso Consideration of the tomato and potato comparative genetic maps unveiled zzso zzso positions of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso within tomato and other zzso family members was observed but not with zzso zzso from zzso zzso Our data indicate remarkably rapid evolution of zzso zzso during diversification of plant zzso
