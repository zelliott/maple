The zzso zzso channels zzso are partially responsible for the zzso of blood vessels in response to changes in the zzso zzso The present study determined the expression of zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the pulmonary artery zzso in zzso zzso immediately after zzso We cloned three zzso transcript zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso Three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso predicted proteins of zzso zzso 202, zzso zzso and zzso zzso These zzso showed a high degree of sequence conservation with the corresponding zzso in zzso Northern and quantitative real-time zzso zzso analyses showed that zzso expression was high in the zzso and zzso but low in the zzso zzso expression was high in the zzso and PA but low in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was low in these blood zzso The zzso property of zzso against zzso was confirmed using zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that the molecular basis for the differential zzso characteristics including opposing response to oxygen in the zzso and the PA are partially due to diversity in expression of zzso and zzso zzso The high expression of zzso and relatively low expression of zzso in the zzso might be partially responsible for the zzso closure after zzso
