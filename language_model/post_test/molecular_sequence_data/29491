The zzso locus on mouse zzso 2 represents a unique cluster of overlapping imprinted zzso Three of these in the order zzso are transcribed in the sense direction with zzso having zzso zzso zzso having paternal zzso and zzso as being zzso expressed in most zzso A fourth imprinted zzso zzso is zzso zzso lies zzso to zzso and expresses an zzso zzso Large zzso zzso transcripts are emerging as a feature of imprinted gene zzso and such zzso zzso may have a zzso zzso Here we show that, in addition to an zzso form of zzso we can detect five alternatively spliced forms of zzso up to zzso zzso in length that are zzso The zzso zzso are zzso zzso they start approximately 2 zzso upstream of zzso in a region of maternal zzso and end zzso zzso beyond the zzso of zzso These zzso do not zzso to zzso of the human zzso transcript although they start in the same zzso the zzso transcript, like its human counterpart, is spliced in various alternative zzso The identification of a set of small spliced imprinted transcripts in the human and now in the mouse suggests that these zzso transcripts are functionally zzso
