In zzso coli, the zzso complex is employed to mediate correct folding of the outer membrane zzso proteins into zzso and their zzso into the zzso zzso which is an essential component of the complex, consists of a zzso zzso region and five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Although deletion studies have shown that each of the zzso zzso plays an important role in the process of zzso complex formation, only zzso is essential for cell zzso Here, the crystal structure of zzso has been determined to zzso resolution with an R factor of zzso and an zzso of zzso
