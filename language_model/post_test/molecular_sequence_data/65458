zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso a terminal zzso zzso for the conversion of zzso zzso (up to at least zzso to corresponding primary alcohols in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the first structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and its complex with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is characterized as a new member of the zzso zzso of the bacterial zzso family via a surprising structural zzso The zzso zzso complex structure and a zzso model reveal a zzso cavity that has dual roles: to provide a zzso donor zzso for zzso and to create a zzso environment in which to stabilize the zzso zzso zzso zzso should catalyze the conversion of zzso zzso via the acknowledged zzso zzso zzso This finding suggests that the ability of zzso to catalyze the degradation of zzso zzso is determined by the binding mode of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure opens a rational perspective to explore and alter the zzso binding site of zzso with potential zzso applications in areas such as petroleum exploration and treatment of environmental oil zzso
