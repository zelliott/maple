zzso major surface protein 2 zzso zzso are expressed by zzso zzso within the tick zzso zzso and, following transmission, are expressed during acute zzso In previous work, we have shown that a restricted pattern of zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso ticks infected with the South Idaho strain of zzso zzso Now we demonstrate that the identical restriction does not apply to two other strains of zzso zzso and that different zzso are also expressed when the same strain is transmitted by different zzso zzso This indicates that zzso diversity among strains is maintained in tick transmission and may be a significant constraint to zzso vaccine zzso
