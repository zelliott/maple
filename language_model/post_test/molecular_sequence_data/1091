A total of 30 field zzso of zzso disease virus zzso zzso zzso belonging to two different lineages and five zzso belonging to a divergent group as delineated earlier in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso in the structural protein zzso coding zzso zzso comparison of these zzso along with some of the published exotic sequences revealed the presence of five different lineages around the zzso Similar grouping pattern was observed for the zzso region and zzso zzso zzso where the Indian zzso were clustered in two genetic zzso The recently identified divergent group of virus falls into a separate zzso Similar grouping was also observed in L zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid sequences identified zzso signature zzso in all the structural zzso zzso of zzso field zzso at the identified key zzso of other zzso viruses involved in the formation of the zzso zzso zzso confirmed many of them to be zzso and the presence of zzso zzso suggested their cell culture zzso Although a considerable genetic variation was observed among the zzso of present study, all of them tested in zzso test were zzso related to the vaccine zzso
