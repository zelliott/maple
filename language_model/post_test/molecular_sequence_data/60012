zzso unfolding zzso studies reveal that the zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso and T4 gene 32 zzso exhibit significant stabilization by increasing zzso of zzso metal zzso in zzso In this report, the apparent affinities of exchange zzso zzso zzso have been determined, relative to zzso zzso for the zzso partially folded zzso and fully unfolded zzso zzso of these zzso A general zzso zzso zzso binding model was developed and applied to the analysis of the metal zzso concentration dependence of individual two-state unfolding zzso zzso zzso was found to associate with the fully folded and partially unfolded zzso forms of these zzso with a zzso of 5-8 zzso zzso zzso in a background of zzso M zzso or 3- to zzso larger than the zzso obtained for two model zzso zzso and hairpin unfolding zzso and approximately zzso larger than zzso for zzso The magnitude of zzso was found to be strongly dependent on the zzso salt concentration in a manner zzso consistent with zzso theory, with zzso reaching zzso zzso zzso zzso in 50 zzso zzso Two zzso zzso were found to have affinities for zzso and zzso of 1-2 zzso zzso or approximately zzso larger than the zzso of approximately 1000 zzso observed for zzso Additionally, the zzso of zzso zzso for the zzso zzso is approximately zzso larger than the zzso of 600 zzso observed for zzso These findings suggest that the zzso and T4 gene 32 zzso zzso possess a zzso for zzso and zzso binding of significantly higher affinity than a zzso zzso zzso binding site that is strongly linked to the zzso stability of these zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests that this zzso lies near the base of the zzso stem zzso near a patch of high negative zzso potential associated with the region where the single loop zzso zzso crosses the major groove of stem zzso
