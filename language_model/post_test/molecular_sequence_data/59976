Using zzso chain reaction zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso zzso specific zzso were based on the zzso and 3' untranslated regions of the human and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso is zzso base pairs in length and contains an open reading frame of 402 zzso coding an zzso precursor of 133 zzso zzso with the putative signal zzso of 24 zzso zzso Analysis of the mature zzso acid sequence shows three potential zzso zzso sites and three zzso zzso zzso of the predicted zzso acid sequence shows that zzso zzso shares 77, 74, 58 and zzso identity with the zzso zzso human and mouse zzso zzso
