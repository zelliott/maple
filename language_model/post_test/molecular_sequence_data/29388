zzso of the zzso growth factor zzso 1 zzso gene in skeletal muscle is positively regulated in zzso zzso and declines during zzso We have characterized the zzso elements in the zzso region of the zzso promoter which render positive zzso zzso Multiple elements between zzso and zzso activate the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that potential zzso zzso factor binding sites are required for promoter zzso zzso shift zzso indicated that zzso nuclear proteins specifically bind to these zzso and that differentiated zzso nuclear extracts do not form these same zzso In addition, zzso zzso analysis detected binding of the most zzso zzso motif to a zzso protein present in zzso nuclear extracts but not in zzso In zzso zzso and zzso proteins were detected only in zzso and not in differentiated zzso Finally, zzso of zzso zzso cells showed that zzso is a positive regulator of zzso promoter activity and that zzso is a zzso via the zzso zzso binding zzso These studies demonstrate that the zzso promoter is activated by zzso zzso factors in zzso zzso and demonstrate at least part of the mechanism by which zzso gene expression is zzso in differentiated muscle zzso
