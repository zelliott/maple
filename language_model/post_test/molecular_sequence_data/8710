zzso zzso zzso zzso can be detected in the environment in a viable but zzso form, whereas zzso zzso zzso cells can be readily cultured during zzso periods in geographical regions where zzso is zzso In the present study, pure cultures of zzso zzso zzso cells contained zzso cells when examined by zzso zzso Laboratory zzso were used to examine the outgrowth of the zzso cells in cultures of zzso zzso zzso One zzso cell per zzso zzso cells could be detected by direct zzso zzso zzso but only after incubation of the zzso culture for 48 zzso Individual zzso cells were not detected in cultures incubated less than 48 zzso zzso study, using a zzso chain reaction zzso amplified zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso as a probe, revealed the existence of a zzso gene in a microcosm sample of zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso The mechanism by which zzso cells can occur in cultures of zzso zzso zzso most likely resulted from spontaneous zzso of zzso zzso the zzso properties and zzso chemical, physical, or biological changes in the environment inducing expression or repression of the controlling zzso These findings have important implications for the epidemiology of zzso and the environmental zzso of toxin producing zzso zzso zzso
