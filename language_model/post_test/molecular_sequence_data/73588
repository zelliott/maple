The interaction of zzso zzso with its DNA targets is unusual in that specific recognition in this system does not rely exclusively on direct hydrogen bonds to the DNA bases that are crucial for zzso zzso It has been suggested that zzso operators are mainly recognized by zzso interactions and by structural recognition of DNA zzso Here we study the effect of the central zzso on the mode of interaction of the zzso zzso with its binding zzso The study was carried out on two consensus zzso zzso zzso the consensus of naturally occurring zzso binding sites, containing a zzso step between the two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a consensus sequence derived from a functional selection study, containing a central zzso zzso We show that the identity of the central zzso does not affect the interaction of the first zzso zzso zzso with the primary DNA target site, however, it influences the assembly of additional zzso molecules at adjacent zzso Central zzso steps stabilize tandem zzso whereas zzso steps destabilize zzso It has been previously suggested that in zzso regulation of zzso operators is due to their differential ability to bind multiple zzso zzso The observations presented here support this zzso We ascribe this ability to two zzso factors which act zzso the identity and number of zzso zzso recognized by zzso hydrogen bonds, and the ability of the intervening zzso to form direct zzso hydrogen bonds to the zzso Furthermore, we measured the intrinsic and the induced zzso of zzso operators by the zzso We find that the operators are straight in their free form, bent by 23 degrees when bound by a single zzso zzso zzso and bent by 30 degrees when bound by two zzso zzso
