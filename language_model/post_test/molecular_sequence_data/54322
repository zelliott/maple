zzso zzso is one of the most common zzso to cause various human skin diseases including zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso revealed four putative zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report the zzso and characterization of zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was expressed zzso in zzso coli, followed by zzso zzso zzso showed a typical reduced zzso spectrum of zzso with a maximum zzso at zzso zzso zzso exhibited tight binding to zzso zzso agents such as zzso zzso zzso or zzso with zzso values around zzso which suggests that zzso is an zzso target for zzso agents in the zzso zzso In addition, three zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso were identified in one of the zzso zzso zzso modeling of zzso zzso zzso suggested that the zzso zzso may influence the resistance to zzso by blocking zzso access zzso Taken together, functional expression and characterization of the zzso zzso can provide a fundamental basis for a specific zzso drug design for zzso caused by zzso zzso
