We investigated the sequence requirements for zzso complex formation by the zzso factor zzso and its zzso domain accessory factors zzso and zzso zzso complex formation is specified by an zzso consensus site zzso and a zzso zzso motif zzso which is contacted by zzso Both the spacing of these sequences and their relative orientation can be substantially altered with little effect on the efficiency of zzso complex zzso zzso zzso complex formation by zzso is zzso by the B box, a zzso 21 zzso acid region located 50 zzso zzso to the zzso domain, which also acts to inhibit autonomous DNA zzso zzso studies with the isolated zzso zzso indicate that zzso complex formation compensates for low affinity zzso zzso zzso Several naturally occurring zzso containing zzso motifs at different locations to that in the human zzso zzso allow zzso and zzso recruitment in zzso We discuss the mechanism of zzso complex zzso
