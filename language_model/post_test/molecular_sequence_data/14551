zzso of individual hosts by multiple zzso zzso zzso may be one reason why this infection is persistent and difficult to zzso 

In order to study the diversity of zzso zzso in individuals, a modified randomly amplified zzso DNA zzso method was applied using primary culture zzso instead of zzso zzso 

The results showed that variations in zzso zzso were prevalent among individuals in the Chinese population, and the zzso of multiple colonization was zzso zzso significantly higher than in other zzso Moreover, the number of zzso zzso was found to be significantly associated with the process of disease development zzso Indeed, a trend for a higher number of zzso zzso within a single host (up to five zzso was observed as the disease developed or became more zzso After zzso for three generations in our experiment, some zzso present in the primary cultures were zzso The different zzso in one patient may have originated from a single ancestral strain, as determined by analysis of six zzso zzso zzso gene zzso most of which were shown to be zzso 

These results suggest that investigating zzso of the primary culture will better reflect the zzso zzso diversity in zzso Also, they indicate that continuous variation of one strain in the gastric zzso may be the main cause of zzso zzso diversity in individuals in the Chinese zzso
