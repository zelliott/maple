zzso zzso syndrome is an zzso disorder characterized by zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso producing associated dry eyes zzso zzso dry mouth, and zzso swollen zzso zzso A high proportion of the zzso B zzso express surface and zzso zzso bearing a zzso zzso zzso defined by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso To determine the structural basis for zzso expression in this disease, we generated zzso zzso cell lines and a zzso library from zzso extracted from zzso syndrome patients' zzso zzso biopsy zzso zzso acid sequence analyses of the zzso of one such zzso zzso cell line zzso reveals the expressed zzso light chain variable region gene zzso zzso zzso to be zzso to zzso a zzso V zzso gene used at relatively high frequency in certain B cell zzso In addition, synthetic zzso corresponding to the first and third zzso and the second zzso determining region of the zzso zzso were used to identify and isolate clones from a zzso library generated from SS zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically with one or more of these zzso zzso contained zzso light chain zzso The sequences corresponding to the variable region of two clones zzso and zzso were zzso to zzso The V zzso genes of four other zzso clones zzso zzso zzso and zzso most likely were generated zzso from the rearranged zzso gene through a limited number of zzso acid base zzso Our results suggest that the high frequency of zzso expression in zzso syndrome patients results from a zzso expansion of B cells using zzso and that the expressed zzso may undergo zzso diversification in an apparent zzso zzso
