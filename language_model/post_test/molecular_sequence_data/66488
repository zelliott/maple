Metal zzso zzso is critical to the survival of all zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso coli is zzso by the zzso zzso via zzso zzso repression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we report two crystal structures of zzso zzso coli zzso the isolated zzso at zzso A resolution and in a complex with its operator DNA sequence from the zzso promoter at zzso A zzso Along with the previously published structure of zzso these structures allow us to evaluate functional proposals for how metal zzso activate zzso delineate the drastic zzso changes required for operator recognition, and describe the formation of a second zzso site in the presence of zzso They also provide a rare set of structural views of a zzso zzso factor in the zzso zzso and zzso states, establishing a model system for the study of zzso effects on zzso factor zzso
