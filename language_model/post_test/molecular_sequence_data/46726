zzso zzso complex plays a critical role in sister zzso zzso but its complete protein composition as well as its precise dynamic function during zzso has not yet been clearly zzso Here we report the isolation of a novel mouse zzso zzso zzso The zzso with an apparent molecular mass of 33 zzso was found to contain a zzso structure and a nuclear zzso zzso The zzso transcripts were relatively scarce but were zzso in most zzso and zzso at various stages of zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso cells with zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso is specifically and zzso localized in zzso throughout the cell zzso this was also confirmed by zzso with zzso zzso Thus the newly isolated zzso may play a role in zzso organization and function throughout the cell zzso
