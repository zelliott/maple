Factor H zzso is an important regulator of the alternative complement zzso Several human pathogens have been shown to bind zzso to their surface, a process that zzso immune evasion or cell to cell zzso Among the pathogens that bind zzso are some zzso species associated with zzso disease and zzso zzso The zzso proteins of the zzso zzso form two classes (I and zzso In zzso zzso zzso class I includes the outer surface protein E zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whereas the class II group includes zzso and additional proteins that have not yet been zzso To identify the zzso zzso involved in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso random, and zzso zzso of zzso were zzso zzso in several different regions of zzso abolished zzso and or zzso zzso indicating that zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are required for zzso zzso Some of the zzso that lost the ability to bind zzso zzso or both had only a single zzso acid zzso zzso zzso of three putative coiled zzso motifs of zzso revealed that these higher order structures are required for zzso binding but not for zzso zzso The data presented within demonstrate that the binding of zzso and zzso to the zzso protein is zzso by higher order structures and protein zzso These studies advance our understanding of zzso binding as a zzso mechanism and facilitate ongoing efforts to use zzso proteins in the development of microbial zzso
