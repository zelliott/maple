Four naturally occurring zzso with single zzso acid zzso in human zzso zzso zzso were zzso and characterized in zzso The corresponding DNA zzso were found in patients with zzso and zzso neurotransmitter zzso due to lack of the zzso zzso zzso zzso To predict the structure of the zzso zzso computer modeling was performed based on the solved three-dimensional structure of the zzso rat zzso One zzso zzso zzso is incorrectly folded and thus unstable in zzso and in zzso while a second zzso zzso has substantial activity but enhanced sensitivity to local zzso Two other zzso zzso and zzso form stable zzso and exhibit significant activity in zzso but no activity in zzso zzso In zzso zzso labeling showed that zzso zzso zzso and zzso are zzso while zzso is not zzso This strongly suggests that the zzso 19 within the consensus sequence for various zzso zzso is the site of zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso protein zzso and requires zzso not yet identified zzso zzso for its in zzso zzso
