The zzso chain reaction zzso was used in an attempt to detect zzso zzso by amplifying a segment of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reference strains representing 45 species and 113 clinical zzso were zzso Only zzso zzso was zzso positive, except for zzso zzso zzso zzso which gave a band by zzso zzso zzso that showed no signal by Southern zzso Using a protocol that employed DNA extraction by zzso Gene kit and a highly sensitive zzso detection system, detection of zzso zzso by zzso was in complete agreement with culture results for 44 clinical specimens from which a wide range of zzso and zzso organisms and zzso were zzso
