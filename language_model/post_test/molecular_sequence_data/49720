zzso genetic diversity among circulating strains presents a major challenge for zzso vaccine development, particularly for developing countries where less sequence information is zzso To identify representative viruses for inclusion in candidate vaccines targeted for South Africa, we applied an efficient sequence survey strategy to samples from recently and chronically infected persons residing in potential vaccine trial zzso All 111 sequences were zzso C, including 30 partial zzso 26 partial zzso 27 zzso zzso and 28 zzso zzso zzso Of the 10 viruses cultured from recently infected individuals, 9 were zzso and 1 was zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso collected within 2 months of infection, were selected as vaccine strains on the basis of their zzso acid similarity to a derived South African consensus sequence The selection of recently transmitted zzso zzso for vaccine design may provide an advantage in a zzso C zzso zzso The full-length zzso gag and zzso pol and zzso genes were cloned into the Venezuelan zzso encephalitis zzso zzso particle zzso expression zzso zzso zzso protein expressed from the zzso accumulated to a high level and was zzso as demonstrated by zzso T zzso responses in mice vaccinated with zzso zzso of zzso use for zzso expression in human cells did not enhance expression of the gag zzso The cloned zzso zzso gene zzso a functional protein as demonstrated by fusion of zzso cells with cells expressing zzso and zzso Genes identified in this study have been incorporated into the zzso zzso candidate vaccines targeted for clinical trial in South zzso
