zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso across species highlights the functional zzso zzso procedures combined with zzso prediction of zzso factor binding sites zzso can narrow down key regulatory zzso Repeat masking processes are often performed before alignment to mask zzso sequences such as zzso elements zzso However, recently such zzso have been reported to influence the gene regulatory network zzso zzso an alignment approach that is robust to TE insertions is meaningful for finding novel zzso zzso in zzso 

We constructed a web server zzso for complex alignment of zzso zzso zzso returns zzso zzso alignments that integrate predicted zzso and the location of zzso It also provides zzso alignments in which the predicted zzso sites and their names are shown alongside each zzso Furthermore, we evaluated false positive aligned sites by focusing on the zzso zzso zzso and found that zzso has a higher specificity and zzso to insertions for sequences having more than zzso TE content, compared to zzso zzso zzso and zzso 

zzso can be applied successfully to zzso sequences without prior repeat zzso and this increases the chances of finding regulatory sequences hidden in zzso which are important sources of the regulatory network zzso zzso can be zzso through and downloaded from zzso
