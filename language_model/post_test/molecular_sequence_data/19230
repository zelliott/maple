Ten genes from two zzso families zzso barley zzso To gain insight into the occurrence and fate of individual zzso during seed zzso the zzso repertoire was mapped by using a zzso approach consisting of zzso gel zzso western zzso and mass zzso Mass zzso analysis confirmed that the 29 zzso positive zzso gel spots contained products of one zzso zzso zzso and two zzso and zzso genes zzso zzso 1 and 2, respectively, but lacked products from seven other zzso Eleven spots were identified only by zzso Mass zzso identified 12 full-length forms and 12 fragments from the zzso zzso Products of both zzso 2 entries zzso in five full-length and one zzso zzso The zzso abundance and the number of fragments increased during zzso Assessing the zzso minimum chain length by zzso mass zzso suggested that zzso 2 zzso initially was zzso just prior to domain B that zzso from the zzso between zzso 3 and zzso 3, followed by zzso on the zzso side of domain B and near the zzso Only two shorter fragments were identified of the other zzso 2 zzso The zzso gels of dissected zzso showed zzso degradation to be confined to zzso In contrast, the zzso layer contained essentially only full-length zzso zzso While only products of the above three genes appeared by zzso also of 15 other barley zzso the zzso had distinct zzso of charge and molecular mass zzso zzso These patterns appeared not to be correlated with zzso zzso
