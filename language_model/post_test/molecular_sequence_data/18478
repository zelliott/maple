In this study, a novel zzso gene from zzso zzso was cloned and zzso in zzso zzso The open reading frame of the zzso gene includes zzso base pairs, which encodes a putative zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso The molecular weight of the zzso native zzso was about zzso determined by size exclusion zzso This zzso showed one single band on zzso with a molecular weight of zzso This suggested that the native zzso consisted of 14 zzso with identical zzso The optimal pH and temperature of the zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The kinetic parameters V max and K m toward zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The zzso can easily convert zzso zzso and aromatic zzso to their corresponding zzso Furthermore, this zzso demonstrated zzso in zzso of zzso zzso This specific characteristic makes this zzso have a great potential for commercial production of various zzso acids by zzso readily available zzso
