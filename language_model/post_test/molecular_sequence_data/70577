Two major zzso have been isolated from the milk of the common zzso zzso zzso zzso These have been identified as zzso and zzso on the basis of the similarity of their zzso sequences to those of the zzso of another zzso zzso zzso Both proteins appear to exist in multiple zzso zzso zzso is zzso mainly in the form of zzso acid zzso and was shown by zzso mass zzso to have multiply zzso forms of three families with molecular masses zzso and zzso Da that may represent genetic zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso exists as a complex of five or six proteins of identical zzso sequence but differing zzso zzso mass zzso indicated that the zzso also are multiply zzso with masses between zzso and zzso zzso A zzso with mass values zzso greater was also zzso The patterns were not affected by stage of zzso and quantitative analysis of two-dimensional gels of whole milk shows that zzso and zzso are present at a constant ratio throughout zzso zzso clones for the zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated from an early zzso zzso zzso library and zzso
