zzso of zzso zzso acids in small zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso significantly contributes to their biological zzso In these zzso conversion of zzso acids to the corresponding zzso is zzso by specialized zzso zzso that zzso an zzso zzso zzso To understand the basis for the specific interaction of E zzso with zzso zzso zzso carrier zzso also described as T zzso and to investigate their zzso zzso we constructed a set of eight fusion zzso The gene fragments zzso E and zzso zzso of zzso zzso the one module zzso zzso A, were fused to different gene fragments zzso A and zzso zzso resulting in zzso and zzso types of fusion proteins zzso indicates site of zzso We were able to show that the E domain of zzso usually zzso zzso does also accept the alternate zzso zzso zzso and zzso although with reduced zzso Interestingly, however, an zzso activity was only observed in the case of fusion proteins where the zzso domain originates from zzso containing an E zzso zzso comparison revealed that such zzso possess significant differences in the signature zzso binding motif zzso zzso when compared to those carrier zzso originating from ordinary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By means of zzso analysis, we could show that zzso activity is influenced by the nature of zzso acid zzso in proximity to the zzso zzso binding zzso The zzso zzso in front of the zzso zzso zzso binding zzso especially seems to play an important role for the proper interaction between zzso and the E domain, as well as the presentation of the zzso zzso in the course of zzso zzso In conclusion, specialized zzso zzso are needed for a productive interaction with E zzso when constructing hybrid zzso
