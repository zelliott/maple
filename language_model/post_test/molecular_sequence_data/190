The activity of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso membrane of blowfly zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso via protein zzso A, the zzso of zzso zzso C and the assembly of zzso zzso The protein zzso responsible for the zzso of zzso C and zzso zzso is not as yet zzso We show here that zzso of protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso A, zzso do not prevent zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso A decrease in the zzso zzso level caused by loading zzso cells with zzso leads to the zzso of zzso pumping in the absence of zzso zzso the zzso response in zzso zzso and zzso the zzso of zzso zzso Thus, the zzso of zzso is most probably zzso by a protein zzso that is insensitive to zzso acid and that requires zzso zzso a member of the zzso protein zzso By molecular biological techniques, we demonstrate the expression of at least two zzso protein family members in blowfly zzso zzso
