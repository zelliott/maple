The zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a virulent zzso zzso strain and was found to code for DNA zzso activity zzso and zzso zzso The present work was aimed at characterizing the genetic organization and functional features of this zzso zzso zzso We found zzso almost identical to the zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso that encodes the zzso zzso system zzso et zzso zzso and related to other zzso zzso zzso of these plasmids revealed a common organization which suggests they were the result of similar zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso is nearly identical to zzso zzso whereas the gene zzso the zzso zzso to zzso zzso is truncated and its product is zzso The expression of the zzso zzso zzso by zzso is strongly affected by deletion of regions located upstream and downstream of its ORF, and is zzso controlled by the zzso gene in zzso zzso The zzso activity zzso by zzso zzso the zzso response, which could be responsible for the observed delay in the growth of zzso zzso
