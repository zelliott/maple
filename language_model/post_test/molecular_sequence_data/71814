A zzso zzso zzso zzso has been developed that zzso the zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been demonstrated to also inhibit the DNA binding of this zzso zzso zzso peptides based on zzso have demonstrated that the zzso content of these peptides directly zzso with their zzso zzso Individual zzso within zzso were identified that were responsible for the zzso secondary structure by employing an zzso replacement zzso The zzso character of the zzso zzso also correlated well with their zzso of zzso DNA zzso These results provide further evidence that interactions between the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso factor itself are zzso by a zzso zzso
