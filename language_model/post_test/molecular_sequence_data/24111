zzso expression cloning is a powerful strategy for identifying critical steps in biological pathways independently of prior zzso It is particularly suitable for the identification of molecules crucial to the control of zzso Our screen for sequences suppressing zzso zzso isolated a sequence zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso expressed zzso The fox gene in zzso zzso zzso virus is also zzso to zzso and several reports have indicated that zzso displays zzso zzso and zzso properties in different zzso Our observations indicate that the zzso zzso sequence suppresses expression of zzso zzso zzso and produces resistance to zzso induced both by the zzso analogue zzso by ultraviolet radiation, and by the zzso drug zzso In all cases, zzso ability is protected, indicating that zzso affects the critical events prior to commitment to cell zzso zzso of zzso in the sense orientation zzso cell death, which is inhibited both by zzso and by zzso of zzso in line with its proposed role in zzso
