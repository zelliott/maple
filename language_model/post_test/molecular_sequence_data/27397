To determine the role of zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso 

zzso acid sequences from zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes from all 14 zzso zzso were zzso Full zzso sequences for zzso 1, zzso 9 and zzso were available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information database and we zzso the full zzso genes from zzso reference strains of zzso 2, 8 and zzso zzso trees were constructed to zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso acid sequences were compared with all 33 previously reported zzso strains to clarify true zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were identified in zzso (39), zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated species zzso for all zzso except zzso in which zzso 4, 12, 10 and 13 formed a separate cluster more similar to zzso zzso than the remaining zzso zzso zzso zzso of all previously reported zzso strains found that one-third of identified zzso zzso could be attributed to normal species zzso therefore, the mechanism of resistance for these strains is still zzso In particular, zzso or zzso at position 112 in zzso and Ala or zzso at zzso in zzso were zzso identified when zzso zzso strain sequences were previously aligned with the published zzso 3 zzso zzso 

Combining analysis of the recently available zzso zzso with sequences from the additional zzso has enabled us to clarify which zzso found by previous investigators could potentially be responsible for zzso zzso
