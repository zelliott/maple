The interaction between the zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso was zzso zzso suggested that zzso and zzso were not associated in cultures of zzso cells arrested in zzso The zzso 170 zzso acids of zzso zzso as a bacterial fusion zzso zzso zzso from cell zzso significantly refining the location of the zzso interaction domain in zzso In zzso zzso of this fusion protein by either protein zzso A or zzso reduced its ability to bind to zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso sequences lacking or including the zzso basic domain but encompassing the zzso binding region in zzso cells revealed a zzso tip association which zzso with that of zzso zzso of the basic domain alone revealed a zzso zzso zzso In zzso interaction studies confirmed that the zzso basic domain did not contribute to zzso zzso These findings strongly suggest that the interaction between zzso and zzso targets zzso to zzso tips, and that the interaction between the two proteins is zzso during zzso by the previously described zzso zzso of zzso
