Two zzso cloning and zzso zzso identified one of the components of Alzheimer's disease zzso deposits as the zzso zzso inhibitor alpha zzso An zzso against isolated zzso zzso deposits detected zzso in normal zzso The zzso was then used to screen a liver zzso expression library, yielding three related zzso DNA sequence analysis showed that these clones code for alpha zzso zzso against zzso alpha zzso stained zzso zzso deposits, both in zzso and after zzso extraction from zzso The zzso zzso recognizes at least two distinct zzso in alpha zzso further supporting the presence of this protein in zzso zzso zzso In addition to being produced in the liver and released into the serum, alpha zzso is expressed in zzso brain, particularly in areas that develop zzso zzso Models by which alpha zzso could contribute to the development of zzso zzso deposits are zzso
