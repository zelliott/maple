We have recently established a computerized database containing information on zzso at the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The database contains sequence information on over 1000 zzso We now present an analysis of the information in the zzso zzso single base substitution zzso in the zzso coding region exist, and we have examined zzso the number of zzso and the number of zzso sites in each zzso zzso transcribed versus zzso strand bias for zzso zzso the frequency of the zzso and 3' nearest neighbors to a zzso base, and zzso the distribution of zzso acid zzso The distribution of both DNA zzso and zzso acid zzso was not uniform, several zzso of zzso were observed and we propose several possible mechanisms to account for the zzso We also examined zzso zzso zzso zzso with small zzso and zzso zzso
