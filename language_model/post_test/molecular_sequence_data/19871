zzso spontaneous zzso zzso throws light on the rules underlying the zzso zzso events occurring in zzso cells, which are part of the evolutionary zzso In zzso zzso zzso and deletion processes have been frequently described in zzso but little is known so far about these processes at the zzso zzso Here we investigated the nature and the frequency of the zzso zzso occurring at this zzso zzso Using a positive selection screen based on a particular zzso zzso of the zzso zzso spontaneous zzso zzso were selected and zzso Surprisingly, the zzso state was found to be correlated with a decrease in zzso zzso frequency, along with an increase in the complexity of the zzso occurring in the target zzso The presence of short DNA tandem repeat sequences seems to be a key requirement for deletion and zzso zzso processes to occur in zzso After discussing the differences between the zzso and zzso levels, some mechanisms possibly involved in zzso zzso and arm exchange are zzso
