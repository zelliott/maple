zzso evaluation of the bacteria was carried out on zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the environmental samples zzso and surrounding sea water) collected from six different locations of Northern zzso coastal area to investigate the interactions between the microbes in the zzso of zzso and in the zzso A total of 141 zzso and 39 operational zzso units were zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene showed that bacterial zzso are highly diverse and most of them were found in other marine zzso The observed bacterial diversity was distributed over five different classes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the greatest number of zzso zzso gene sequence derived from the zzso zzso zzso is found to be the dominant one among the different bacterial species zzso The results suggest that the zzso in the environment are maintained in the zzso of the zzso which may have a key role in the zzso zzso
