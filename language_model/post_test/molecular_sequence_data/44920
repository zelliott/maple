We describe comparative sequence analysis of 20 zzso of the recently discovered zzso G virus zzso and propose a model of the zzso secondary structure at the 3' end of the zzso untranslated region zzso of this zzso A single zzso starting at zzso position zzso which was zzso and continuous with the putative zzso was zzso in all 20 zzso and appeared to be the most likely site for the initiation of zzso zzso This consensus zzso was 14 zzso acid zzso upstream of a sequence with identity to the envelope protein E1 of zzso C virus zzso but the actual function of this zzso zzso of zzso is still not zzso None of the zzso zzso a sequence with similarity to the zzso protein of any known zzso The zzso secondary structure of the zzso under study was determined using zzso zzso and validated using the results of comparative sequence zzso Further support for the model was gained from the prediction of significant sequence and structural zzso in the zzso secondary structure of the complete zzso of zzso zzso zzso A possible mechanism for translation initiation in zzso and zzso was suggested by the identification of features in common with the internal zzso entry sites zzso of zzso and zzso
