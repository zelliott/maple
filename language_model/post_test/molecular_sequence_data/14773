zzso zzso proteins zzso zzso is the most popular zzso zzso worldwide and has been developed from US zzso as the zzso The accuracy is reduced when the zzso are from adults and children in East Asia including zzso To overcome the reduced zzso an zzso zzso using Japanese zzso zzso zzso was developed, in which the zzso were prepared by exactly the same procedure as zzso The performance of zzso was better than that of zzso in Japanese adults as well as in zzso The higher sensitivity was because of the presence of zzso protein that was absent in the preparation of zzso zzso 

zzso analysis and zzso mass zzso methods were used to identify the distinctive zzso protein present in zzso zzso The zzso sequence and identification were analyzed by zzso Search on the database of zzso zzso The identified protein was confirmed by zzso with a specific zzso and zzso zzso by the zzso 

The distinctive zzso protein was a zzso of zzso derived from Japanese clinical zzso and the zzso of Japanese patients had strongly reacted to the zzso probably to the exposed zzso on the fragmented zzso The fragmentation of zzso had occurred in the process of zzso preparation in Japanese zzso not in US zzso even under the same zzso
