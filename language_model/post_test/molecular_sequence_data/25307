zzso zzso is the first zzso in one of the two pathways of zzso synthesis in zzso We zzso zzso zzso from zzso leaves, obtained zzso zzso acid zzso and then used this information to isolate a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the derived zzso acid sequence with that of the zzso zzso gene from zzso coli reveals several regions of sequence similarity which may play a role in zzso zzso The open reading frame zzso in the zzso zzso encodes a 66 zzso zzso but the zzso zzso zzso that we zzso has an apparent molecular weight of 24 zzso and is zzso in the zzso region of the zzso A portion of the zzso zzso this region was expressed in zzso coli, and a zzso zzso was developed against the expressed zzso The zzso detects 34 zzso and 24 zzso zzso on Western blots of zzso leaf zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso appears to include processing of a precursor zzso
