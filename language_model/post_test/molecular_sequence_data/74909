The toxin preparations zzso I, zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso were investigated by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso experiments were used to monitor the separation by zzso liquid zzso of the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso For zzso zzso complete zzso resonance assignments were obtained and the secondary structure was zzso To obtain the zzso assignments we used a zzso of the sequential assignment technique which relied extensively on zzso zzso analysis in zzso zzso using spectrum simulations based on density zzso calculations with the program zzso These procedures, which resulted in extensive zzso acid spin system identifications prior to the sequential assignments, should be generally zzso for small proteins with relatively narrow zzso zzso The secondary structure of zzso I includes a beta sheet consisting of four zzso No evidence was found for the presence of regular zzso zzso The four beta strands are connected by two extended zzso and a tight turn, for which further characterization has to await the complete determination of the three-dimensional zzso
