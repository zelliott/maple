zzso analysis of the region upstream of the zzso b zzso gene in the zzso zzso zzso identifies an open reading frame with zzso to zzso protein zzso zzso and a zzso with similarity to zzso protein zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso genes have intact reading zzso but the zzso zzso is disrupted by a stop zzso and a deleted zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso gene are separated by one zzso and a zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso is zzso downstream from the zzso zzso The entire region is transcribed into a zzso transcript, containing the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are edited in several positions with different zzso The zzso zzso is transcribed and edited in one position in common with other zzso Since no intact zzso gene is found in the zzso zzso of zzso the functional gene is presumably zzso in the zzso
