zzso zzso is one of the common health zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are one of the important causes of zzso zzso However, the zzso of zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso zzso are less zzso 

A total of 440 Chinese pediatric zzso subjects were recruited from two zzso clinics in the zzso and zzso cities of Zhejiang Province, zzso These subjects underwent clinical, genetic evaluation and molecular analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were evaluated by structural and zzso zzso 

The study samples consisted of 227 males and zzso zzso The age of all participants ranged from 1 years old to 18 years, with the median age of 9 zzso zzso subjects zzso males and 40 zzso had a history of exposure to zzso accounting for zzso cases of hearing loss in this zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene identified 41 zzso known and 2 zzso zzso The zzso of the known zzso zzso zzso G, zzso zzso T and zzso zzso C zzso were zzso zzso and zzso in this entire zzso subjects, respectively, and zzso zzso and zzso among 98 subjects with zzso zzso zzso The structural and zzso evaluations showed that a novel zzso zzso G zzso and known zzso zzso G, zzso zzso G, zzso zzso T and zzso zzso C zzso zzso increased sensitivity to zzso or zzso deafness as they were absent in 449 Chinese controls and localized at highly zzso zzso of this zzso However, other zzso were zzso Of 44 subjects carrying one of zzso or putative zzso zzso zzso zzso only one subject carrying the zzso zzso C zzso zzso the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso while none of zzso in zzso gene was detected in other 43 zzso 

zzso in zzso zzso zzso accounted for zzso cases of zzso deafness in this zzso Our data strongly support the idea that the zzso zzso zzso is the hot spot for zzso associated with zzso zzso These data have been providing valuable information and technology to predict which individuals are at risk for zzso to improve the safety of zzso zzso therapy, and eventually to decrease the zzso of zzso
