The sites and relative rates of zzso bond zzso of the oxidized B chain of bovine insulin by two zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated from the zzso of the Western zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The results were compared with previous results on the zzso of the same zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso were found to cleave the zzso zzso zzso and zzso bonds of the oxidized insulin B zzso In addition, zzso zzso the zzso bond, whereas zzso zzso the zzso zzso The zzso specificity of zzso on the insulin B chain is identical to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso bond most zzso having a turnover number of zzso zzso which was approximately twice as fast as the zzso bond turnover of zzso zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, zzso the zzso bond zzso having a turnover number of zzso zzso The zzso bond is the zzso bond zzso the second fastest by zzso with a turnover number of zzso zzso The five zzso toxins from zzso zzso zzso were also examined for their capability to zzso basement membrane zzso and the identities of the zzso proteins zzso the basement membrane were zzso From the results it is concluded that all five zzso toxins cleave zzso and the component of the basement membrane referred to as band zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
