The production and characterization of zzso mouse zzso and zzso chains from zzso coli are zzso The proteins were efficiently expressed and zzso with yields of zzso zzso per liter of cell zzso They had the expected molecular mass and showed a physical stability analogous to that of the corresponding human zzso Mouse zzso and zzso had a very similar mobility on zzso zzso but could be readily separated on zzso PAGE because of the distinct slow mobility of mouse zzso zzso comparative experiments showed that mouse and human zzso had the same iron incorporation activity, whereas mouse zzso incorporated iron less efficiently than human zzso The difference was attributed to the substitution of a zzso exposed on the cavity surface zzso zzso zzso in mouse zzso a hypothesis confirmed by the finding that the mouse zzso zzso zzso incorporated iron as efficiently as human zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso mouse zzso were specific for the zzso and zzso and did not zzso with the human zzso The zzso and the derived specific zzso zzso allow the determination of zzso and zzso in mouse zzso
