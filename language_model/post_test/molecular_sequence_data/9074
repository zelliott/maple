zzso division is regulated by the zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso induction of the zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso is zzso at zzso zzso zzso expression and zzso are induced in zzso and coordinated with zzso zzso zzso transits to zzso via the zzso zzso zzso zzso is unstable and zzso restricted gin zzso and zzso cells, which are impaired in zzso membrane protein zzso In zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit juxtaposed zzso zzso zzso and zzso forms, respectively, although protein levels remain zzso In contrast with zzso the zzso zzso in zzso zzso is zzso independent, and the zzso occurs at the zzso We show that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso machinery via zzso and is regulated by zzso because zzso and zzso interact more strongly with zzso than zzso Neither zzso nor zzso is necessary for zzso division in methanol zzso We propose a model for the role of zzso in the regulation of zzso division through a zzso interaction with the zzso machinery, providing novel insights into zzso zzso
