zzso of zzso zzso and zzso leads to the formation of small amounts of zzso zzso These acids are known to be produced by the alkaline degradation of zzso The formation under neutral zzso conditions of the zzso acids provides evidence for the formation of zzso a compound that has been reported to play a role in both alkaline and zzso conversion of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso acid does not lead to significant zzso and therefore these compounds cannot be considered to play a major role in the initial zzso zzso of zzso
