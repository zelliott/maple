The zzso and zzso bodies zzso are prominent interacting zzso zzso involved in a number of crucial aspects of cell zzso Certain viruses interact with these compartments but the functions of such interactions are largely zzso Here, we show that the ability of the zzso zzso virus open reading frame zzso 3 protein to move viral zzso long distances through the zzso strictly depends on its interaction with zzso and the zzso The zzso protein targets and reorganizes zzso into multiple zzso structures and then enters the zzso by causing fusion of these structures with the zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso protein is essential for subsequent formation of viral zzso zzso particles capable of virus long-distance movement and systemic zzso We provide a model zzso the zzso protein zzso trafficking pathways involving zzso to enter the zzso and, along with zzso exit the nucleus to form viral zzso zzso particles in the zzso
