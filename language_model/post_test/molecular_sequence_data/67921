We present an integrated approach to identify and zzso a novel class of zzso zzso zzso with a unique pharmacological zzso Our strategy included zzso virtual screening through application of a recently developed protocol zzso zzso synthetic chemistry to discover zzso zzso and zzso detailed in zzso pharmacological zzso zzso are promising agents for treatment or prevention of Alzheimer's zzso They zzso the zzso product spectrum zzso zzso zzso peptides of different zzso and induce a shift from toxic zzso to shorter zzso species such as zzso with no or minimal effect on the overall rate of zzso zzso We describe the identification of a series of zzso zzso which display a novel type of zzso zzso with zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
