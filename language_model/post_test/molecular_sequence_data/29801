Over zzso of reported cases of zzso disease in the United States occur in coastal regions of northeastern and mid-Atlantic zzso The genetic structure of the zzso disease zzso zzso zzso and its main tick zzso zzso zzso was studied zzso and comparatively by sampling natural populations of zzso zzso ticks along the East Coast from 1996 to zzso zzso is genetically highly diverse at the outer surface protein zzso Since zzso is highly zzso the zzso zzso can be used to define zzso A newly designed reverse line zzso zzso zzso shows that up to 10 zzso clones can zzso a single zzso The clone zzso in zzso populations are the same across the zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso populations show strong regional divergence (among zzso zzso and southern zzso as well as local zzso The high genetic diversity within zzso populations and the disparity in the genetic structure between zzso and its tick zzso are likely consequences of strong balancing selection on local zzso zzso zzso both zzso and zzso zzso populations in the Northeast show the characteristics of a species that has recently expanded from a population zzso Major geological and ecological events, such as the last glacial maximum zzso years zzso and the modern-day expansion of tick zzso are likely causes of the observed zzso zzso for the two organisms in the zzso We therefore conclude that the genetic structure of zzso zzso has been intimately shaped by the natural history of its main zzso the northern lineage of zzso zzso zzso
