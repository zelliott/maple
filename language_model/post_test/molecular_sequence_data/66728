In the zzso zzso array technique, an array of different peptides are zzso on, and zzso linked to, cellulose zzso In one usage of this technique, these peptides are screened in an overlay zzso to determine which short zzso contains a binding site for an interacting zzso By preparing overlapping peptides that cover the entire sequence of a zzso all of the binding zzso on the protein for a second protein can be zzso We have zzso the zzso zzso array technique to identify the short zzso acid sequences within nuclear pore complex proteins (also known as zzso or zzso that bind the nuclear carrier zzso zzso studies by others have indicated that nuclear carriers such as zzso bind to zzso zzso repeats present in numerous copies in the sequences of a family of zzso zzso with this, we found that most (but not all) of the zzso binding sites for zzso identified by this technique contain zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso although not all such sequences bound zzso zzso zzso array substitution studies confirmed a crucial role for the zzso in zzso repeats and identified a zzso zzso zzso some repeats that is crucial for zzso binding to those zzso In addition to these expected binding sequences for zzso we found multiple instances of a zzso lacking a zzso zzso repeat that strongly bound zzso indicating that additional zzso sequences may form binding sites for zzso
