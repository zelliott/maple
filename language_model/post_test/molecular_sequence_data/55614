zzso is the only zzso zzso zzso protein known to have the properties of a transforming zzso in zzso zzso and the only zzso zzso besides zzso detected in zzso zzso and Hodgkin's zzso zzso zzso is characterized by zzso zzso and rapid turnover zzso 2 to 3 zzso due to specific zzso zzso which causes release of a zzso zzso zzso zzso into the zzso We used zzso functional, and zzso analyses to identify sites of zzso All of the zzso sites detected lie in the zzso zzso In particular, we identified zzso and zzso as functionally important zzso Prevention of zzso at zzso by altering it to a zzso prevented zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso indicating that it is a major site on both forms of the zzso However, lack of zzso zzso had no effect on zzso zzso or on the ability of zzso to transform zzso zzso zzso of zzso to an zzso resulted in a form of zzso that was toxic to zzso zzso zzso of zzso to a zzso zzso had no zzso effect on the ability of zzso to become zzso zzso or transform zzso zzso zzso of zzso to a zzso however, inhibited all zzso zzso and resulted in a form of zzso that was unable to transform zzso zzso These results are discussed in the context of a model in which zzso function is modulated by zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso
