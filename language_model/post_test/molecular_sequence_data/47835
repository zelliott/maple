The zzso zzso of the zzso high mobility group proteins zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso proteins zzso recognize distorted DNA zzso DNA binding also zzso a substantial zzso Using zzso resonance energy transfer zzso we have determined the changes in the zzso distance zzso on the binding of selected insect counterparts of zzso to two DNA fragments, one of 18 zzso containing a single zzso zzso and a second of 27 zzso with two zzso zzso The observed changes are consistent with overall bend angles for the complex of the single zzso domain with one zzso and of two zzso with two zzso of approximately zzso degrees and approximately zzso degrees, zzso The former value contrasts with an zzso value of 150 degrees reported by zzso et zzso zzso for the bend induced by a single zzso We also observe that the induced bend angle is unaffected by the presence of the zzso zzso zzso The DNA bend of approximately 95 degrees observed in the zzso domain complexes is similar in magnitude to that induced by the zzso protein zzso zzso each zzso unit of the integration host factor zzso zzso and the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso We suggest this value may represent a zzso limitation on the extent of DNA zzso induced by a single zzso zzso
