zzso H zzso is a zzso zzso gene product functionally implicated in the penetration of the virus into the host zzso Other human zzso require an accessory zzso named zzso for the synthesis of mature zzso We constructed a series of zzso zzso to determine whether zzso expression can overcome the constraints upon zzso virus zzso zzso zzso folding and transport in this expression zzso When zzso and zzso were zzso some zzso zzso was transported to the insect cell zzso zzso of 27 zzso acids from the zzso zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of an 80 zzso protein zzso into the culture medium when it was expressed either in the presence or absence of zzso and this protein could also be zzso with zzso In contrast, zzso was not zzso into the culture zzso Our results suggests that either zzso of zzso with zzso or removal of the predicted zzso anchor sequence can overcome some of the constraints upon zzso zzso expression in the zzso zzso
