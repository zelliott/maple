Several investigators have reported zzso zzso of the zzso gene in patients with familial zzso zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso in tumors developed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Those results provide evidence that zzso of the zzso gene plays a significant role in zzso and in sporadic tumors of these zzso zzso zzso have led to some interesting zzso First, the great majority of the zzso found to date would result in zzso of the zzso zzso Second, almost all the zzso have occurred within the first half of the coding zzso and zzso zzso in zzso tumors are further clustered in a particular region called zzso zzso cluster zzso Third, most identified point zzso in the zzso gene are transitions from zzso to other zzso Fourth, the location of zzso zzso tends to correlate with the number of zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of both zzso of the zzso gene seems to be required as an early event to develop most of zzso and zzso in the colon and zzso as well as some of those in the zzso
