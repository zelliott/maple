zzso zzso is an important therapeutic target in the search for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso is composed of three zzso and is hard to crystallize in its full zzso First structural results on IN were obtained on the zzso core domain zzso of the avian zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso A zzso and on the zzso of zzso zzso A zzso like motif was revealed as well as a zzso interface stabilized by two pairs of zzso zzso zzso These structural features have been validated in other structures of IN zzso We have determined the crystal structure of the zzso virus zzso zzso IN zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso IN shows a standard activity for integration and its zzso differs in sequence from that of zzso by a single accessible zzso in position 182 zzso zzso Surprisingly, the zzso of zzso IN associates itself with an unexpected zzso interface characterized by three pairs of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is not involved in this novel zzso which results from a rigid body zzso of the protein at its zzso zzso zzso zzso A new basic groove that is suitable for zzso zzso acid binding is observed at the surface of the zzso We have subsequently determined the structure of the zzso zzso of zzso IN zzso and obtained a zzso IN zzso structure with two pairs of buried zzso at the zzso Our results suggest that the zzso of avian zzso can zzso in more than one zzso Such flexibility can further explain the zzso of zzso zzso which beside integration of zzso are implicated in different steps of the zzso cycle in presence of viral zzso
