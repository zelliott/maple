The zzso zzso receptors on human zzso zzso zzso coupled to zzso have been characterized by examining the binding of zzso in a zzso proximity zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso was zzso inhibited by zzso zzso 80 zzso zzso zzso 170 zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 210 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the ETA zzso zzso zzso zzso only zzso zzso at 10 zzso inhibited zzso zzso In addition, the zzso zzso for zzso and zzso were shallow, with slopes less than unity, indicating zzso zzso In keeping with this finding, the presence of a small population of ETA receptors was confirmed by the ability of zzso (1 zzso to reduce the maximum binding capacity of the zzso for zzso by approximately zzso without affecting the affinity for the zzso In conclusion, these results suggest that the zzso system contains predominantly zzso zzso zzso zzso with a small ETA zzso zzso These findings should be taken into account when this zzso system is used to identify novel zzso zzso zzso
