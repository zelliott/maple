The zzso of zzso zzso encodes for 18 putative zzso sugar zzso even though its zzso only contains 7 different zzso To understand the biological significance of this phenomenon, we have begun a systematic zzso characterization of the above putative zzso and have determined that the gene zzso encodes a zzso apparatus zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This is the first zzso zzso sugar zzso characterized for any zzso and is also the first zzso zzso for zzso Evidence for the above zzso specificity and zzso transport zzso zzso was obtained by expression of zzso in zzso zzso followed by zzso enriched zzso isolation and zzso in zzso Further evidence for zzso transport was obtained by expression of zzso zzso in zzso zzso an zzso recently characterized as having zzso transport activity for only zzso zzso zzso of zzso was also able to correct the zzso of a zzso Chinese zzso cell line specifically defective in the transport of zzso into the zzso apparatus and of a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso specifically defective in the transport of zzso zzso into its zzso zzso Because up to now all three other characterized zzso sugar zzso of zzso zzso have been found to transport two or three zzso the zzso specificity of zzso raises questions as to the evolutionary ancestry of this group of proteins in this zzso
