The zzso gene cluster on human zzso 22 containing the functional zzso zzso gene zzso and two or three highly zzso zzso is involved in a clinically important variation in the zzso of drugs and environmental zzso Several zzso zzso of zzso have been identified by restriction analysis and by zzso zzso zzso To understand the evolutionary sequence of zzso events as well as recently discovered zzso differences, we analyzed the arrangement of the zzso zzso containing a common zzso zzso of zzso associated with a zzso zzso zzso This zzso contains four zzso genes instead of zzso zzso of the sequences of these genes with those of previously characterized zzso suggests that an early point zzso was followed by a crossover and a gene conversion event, the latter found zzso in zzso These data are consistent with the rapid evolution of this locus during zzso zzso with practical consequences for zzso defense of the zzso against environmental zzso
