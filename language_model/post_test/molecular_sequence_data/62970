zzso arthritis is an interesting zzso class I zzso associated zzso disease where injury is likely zzso exclusively by T zzso We used zzso zzso zzso sequencing to gain insight into the zzso immune events responsible for this injury and determine whether the numerous zzso expansions of this disease represent extreme zzso spreading among driving clones that recognize zzso or were zzso zzso zzso Because zzso suppresses but does not eliminate this zzso we hypothesized that clones zzso during zzso treatment would likely drive the zzso zzso percent of the T cell clones in active tissue were zzso and zzso accounting for zzso of zzso They were decreased greatly by zzso zzso most expanded clones in the inflamed joint did not persist during zzso treatment, were found only in inflammatory sites, exhibited no structural zzso to one another, and were either zzso or zzso in zzso suggesting they were zzso zzso zzso Only zzso of the expanded clones could be grouped into zzso sets distinguished by structurally zzso zzso zzso zzso acid motifs suggesting zzso zzso These were exclusively zzso in zzso persisted during zzso administration, and were present in both joint fluid and blood zzso they were candidate driver clones that recognized an zzso However, a major set of putative driver clones exhibited a previously described zzso zzso zzso emphasizing that the dominant feature of the disease was zzso of multiple clones apparently lacking specificity for an inciting zzso
