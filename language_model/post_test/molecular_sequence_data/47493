zzso artificial zzso zzso clones were assigned within the pig major zzso complex zzso by zzso chain zzso and Southern zzso zzso using zzso site zzso markers and zzso zzso zzso In all, 35 zzso clones were discovered containing 12 anchor genes of the zzso class I region and two genes of the zzso class III zzso Twenty of these 35 clones comprised two distinct class I gene zzso each spanning about 100 zzso One cluster enclosed three class I related genes zzso to zzso and two genes zzso and zzso more zzso related to class zzso The other cluster enclosed typical class I zzso of which three zzso zzso and zzso were transcribed by zzso zzso for the zzso zzso which we used to construct a pig zzso zzso zzso clones are certainly helpful in zzso zzso biologically, and medically important zzso They would also be useful for inducing genetic modifications in pig cell zzso
