zzso zzso zzso zzso is an zzso present in the brain of zzso zzso Using as a probe rat liver zzso zzso zzso already isolated and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 103 (1988) zzso we screened a rat brain zzso library constructed in the zzso zzso expression zzso and obtained a single zzso zzso This zzso clone contained an open reading frame zzso a zzso of 461 zzso acid zzso zzso Mr zzso zzso a zzso sequence of 967 zzso and a zzso sequence of 74 zzso The length of the zzso region of the zzso seems to be one of the longest among the zzso zzso zzso A comparison of the brain zzso sequence zzso zzso with the corresponding region of the liver zzso zzso zzso revealed differences in 5 zzso The brain clone contained zzso and zzso base differences from the zzso zzso resulting in zzso acid changes from zzso and zzso in the liver zzso to zzso and zzso in the brain zzso zzso The other 3 zzso differences are silent with respect to the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso the zzso acid sequence of the brain zzso zzso as deduced from the zzso sequence of its zzso zzso was identical with that of the liver zzso except for two zzso acid zzso These minor changes may reflect a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The brain and liver zzso seem to be zzso by the same structural zzso
