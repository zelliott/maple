zzso regulatory elements have been identified for zzso which zzso zzso damage in zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso shown to be a novel zzso zzso zzso is found in a number of zzso and cell zzso This study shows that zzso is present in mouse lens zzso as well as in the alpha zzso mouse lens zzso cell zzso To determine whether zzso is an zzso zzso zzso cell cultures were exposed to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso of cellular zzso showed that zzso zzso activity was zzso greater than zzso and zzso respectively, over the control zzso This observed activity was sensitive to zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells were found to exhibit zzso and zzso increases, respectively, in zzso protein zzso A comparable increase in zzso zzso was indicative of an induction in zzso expression in response to zzso zzso Lens zzso cells were also checked for zzso a well-known cellular protective zzso which can catalyze the zzso reduction of zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated that alpha zzso cells exposed to zzso and zzso exhibited zzso and zzso increases in zzso concentration when compared to the control zzso The data suggest that while zzso is most likely responsible for the majority of the observed increase in zzso zzso activity, the zzso gene also zzso zzso which is apparently zzso by a zzso zzso
