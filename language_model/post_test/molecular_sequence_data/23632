The zzso arches give rise to multiple zzso critical for diverse zzso including the zzso zzso and zzso Several molecular regulators of zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso between zzso and zzso However, land animals have zzso whereas fish have zzso The zzso zzso factor zzso cells missing 2 zzso is expressed specifically in the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the third zzso pouch, and in both mice and humans is required for normal development of zzso zzso The molecular regulation of fish zzso zzso remains to be zzso We report the expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and a requirement for zzso group 3 zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso portion of the zzso zzso and is required for the development of the zzso filament zzso precursors of zzso zzso zzso This study identifies yet another role for a zzso gene in embryonic development and indicates a role for zzso during the evolution of divergent zzso zzso
