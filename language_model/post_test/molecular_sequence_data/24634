Using a combination of zzso zzso and zzso analysis, we report here the identification and characterization of zzso an zzso alternatively spliced zzso of zzso in lung zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso is expressed at levels greater than zzso in 12 of 25 lung zzso tumors compared with the highest expression level found in all normal zzso zzso zzso is expressed in both early and late stages of lung zzso but it was not detected in large cell zzso small cell zzso or zzso lung neuroendocrine zzso The full-length zzso for zzso comprises 770 zzso and encodes a zzso of 160 zzso zzso zzso 94 zzso acids of zzso are identical to a cancer zzso zzso zzso found in Ewing's zzso zzso sequence analysis has revealed that zzso and zzso are alternatively spliced zzso and expression of both zzso and zzso zzso are present in lung zzso zzso analysis using affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated specific nuclear zzso in 10 of 12 lung zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso responses to zzso zzso protein were observed in seven of 17 lung zzso zzso zzso of lung cancer zzso These results strongly imply that zzso protein is zzso and suggest that it might have use as a vaccine target for lung zzso
