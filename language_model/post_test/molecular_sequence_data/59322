A zzso acid zzso zzso derived from a consensus motif of natural zzso incorporates a zzso iron sulfur cluster under zzso zzso zzso assembly of the zzso cluster within a zzso zzso was demonstrated using size exclusion zzso zzso visible CD, and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso formation was tested using peptides with either the zzso zzso exchanged for zzso or with the intervening zzso acids replaced by zzso The small size of the zzso allows for modular incorporation into more complex protein zzso In one larger structure, we describe a zzso bundle that zzso both zzso clusters and zzso thereby demonstrating feasibility for the general synthesis of zzso containing zzso juxtaposed zzso zzso This is a motif common to the zzso sites of native zzso
