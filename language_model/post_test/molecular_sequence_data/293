Upon DNA replication stress, stalled DNA replication zzso serve as a platform to recruit many signaling zzso leading to the zzso of the DNA replication zzso zzso of zzso a key zzso zzso in the budding zzso zzso zzso is essential for stabilizing DNA replication zzso during replication zzso Using an zzso zzso for zzso we found that zzso a replication zzso zzso zzso with zzso to activate zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso using zzso zzso and zzso showed that the addition of zzso zzso a more than zzso increase in the ability of zzso to activate zzso Instead of increasing the zzso activity of zzso zzso was found to facilitate the zzso of zzso by zzso via promotion of a stronger zzso interaction between zzso Further, the zzso zzso domain of zzso was found to be required for zzso zzso These results thus provide insights into the role of the zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso in the DNA replication zzso
