Cloning and sequence analysis of cartilage zzso zzso protein zzso zzso representing a cartilage zzso zzso revealed a protein of zzso zzso acid zzso with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso cells showed that zzso is a zzso composed of five identical zzso zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso half of zzso and the zzso include zzso and zzso of the zzso in zzso and zzso zzso The similarities are most pronounced in the zzso zzso and in the calcium binding type 3 repeat zzso in which about zzso of the zzso acid zzso are zzso In the type zzso growth factor repeat zzso the two proteins contain zzso identical zzso The sequence of the zzso zzso acid zzso is unique for zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences in the type 2 and type 3 repeat zzso of zzso and the zzso shows that zzso is the product of a unique gene and not the result of an alternatively spliced zzso zzso
