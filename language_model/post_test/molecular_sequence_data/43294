We report a rapid method for identifying proteins resolved by two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso zzso using zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in a way such that the volume ratio of zzso solution to gel plug was zzso controlled to promote zzso zzso and to maximize the zzso zzso To make the zzso samples more compatible with zzso the volatile salt ammonium zzso in the zzso buffer was largely removed prior to zzso zzso zzso of mixed zzso peptides from zzso zzso were used without zzso to obtain molecular weights by zzso with zzso zzso acid as the zzso zzso of zzso sample loading procedures improved the detection sensitivity by one half to one order of zzso The zzso mass zzso in zzso zzso were distinguished from those of zzso by using several types of controls, and masses were corrected by using zzso zzso fragments as internal zzso zzso Two different zzso computer programs were used to interrogate sequence databases and identify zzso Identification was enhanced by generation of zzso data sets (by using different zzso and by including experimental values of zzso point zzso and molecular weight to exclude false entries in the candidate zzso zzso zzso of the material from a spot was used in each sample zzso and nine protein spots from rat liver zzso PAGE gels were identified correctly, as judged by comparison with identification results previously obtained from zzso zzso A previously identified zzso spot was not identified by zzso presumably because there was insufficient material in a single zzso The sample handling procedure reported here should permit us to identify many zzso PAGE protein spots of medium zzso
