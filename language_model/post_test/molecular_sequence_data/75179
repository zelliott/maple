We labeled zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) with near zzso quantities of zzso zzso To reduce labeling of the zzso N zzso 23, the zzso was modified zzso with zzso zzso before zzso zzso The zzso zzso was later removed with strong acid, and four of the six possible zzso zzso derivatives were isolated by zzso focusing on an immobilized pH zzso zzso zzso and subsequent high pressure liquid zzso of the peptides yielded one dominant fluorescent peak from three of the isolated zzso zzso zzso analyses of these three fluorescent zzso indicated zzso labeling at zzso zzso and zzso Since one zzso (not identified by sequence zzso displayed essentially identical zzso zzso and binding properties as our previously identified zzso toxin zzso zzso zzso and Taylor, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we identified the site of labeling of this fourth zzso to be zzso While only small differences were observed in the extinction zzso and zzso extinction zzso the quantum yields of the isolated derivatives varied markedly and ranged between zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso derivatives to the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was associated with zzso zzso zzso and zzso changes in zzso zzso intensity, zzso Based on analyses of the zzso of zzso changes associated with zzso zzso the association and zzso rate zzso were zzso Relative to native zzso zzso zzso zzso reduced the zzso association rate zzso for binding to the zzso zzso The zzso rate binding rate zzso were less affected and were reduced zzso
