The zzso zzso zzso protein is required for normal zzso distribution in zzso and early zzso zzso of zzso cause frequent zzso and loss of zzso suggesting a role for the protein in zzso function or zzso movement in zzso and early zzso The zzso protein contains a region of predicted sequence similarity to the zzso motor zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso have demonstrated that zzso is a motor that unexpectedly moves toward the minus ends of zzso opposite to the direction of zzso zzso Using zzso directed against zzso regions of the zzso we have localized the zzso motor protein to the zzso and early zzso zzso and to zzso in a zzso dividing cultured cell zzso Its presence in the zzso of zzso and zzso cells implies a role for the protein as a zzso zzso The motor may play an essential role in establishing zzso zzso in zzso
