zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso was isolated from human liver using the zzso chain zzso zzso the zzso revealed an open reading frame of zzso base pairs zzso that zzso zzso zzso acids (Mr zzso Using zzso pair zzso clones as zzso we localized the gene zzso the zzso human zzso to zzso zzso When the zzso of zzso was compared with that of zzso the zzso sequences and the predicted zzso acid sequences had about 60 and zzso identity, zzso zzso and zzso which were found to be critical for the zzso and subsequent zzso of rat zzso zzso and zzso of human zzso are zzso in zzso and are represented as zzso and zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso which is also a zzso site in rat zzso zzso of human zzso is not zzso in zzso The zzso between the zzso acid sequences of the two human zzso however, is primarily found downstream of zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso and their zzso that is zzso and zzso in zzso suggesting that the sequence of the first 218 zzso acids at the N zzso of zzso represents a unique zzso that accounts, in part, for the zzso between the two zzso Using a zzso probe zzso zzso that encodes the zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso in Northern zzso analyses of different human and mouse zzso showed that zzso is predominantly expressed in liver, heart, and the skeletal zzso zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso reacted specifically and equally with human and rat zzso zzso confirming the uniqueness of this zzso zzso and its conservation in animal zzso In addition, we present evidence for the presence of an zzso of zzso (Mr zzso in human liver that differs from the zzso zzso by the absence of zzso zzso that zzso 101 zzso acids in the region between zzso and zzso The regulation and zzso significance of the two zzso zzso remain to be zzso
