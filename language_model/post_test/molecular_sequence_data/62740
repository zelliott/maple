zzso zzso zzso zzso signals during development to coordinate cell movement, zzso and changes in gene zzso One of these signals, the C zzso regulates the expression of many zzso including zzso a gene identified by an zzso of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is reduced in zzso zzso cells, which fail to perform C zzso and the promoter region has several sequences similar to sequences found in the regulatory regions of other zzso zzso One such zzso zzso depends absolutely on the C signal for zzso and its promoter region has been characterized previously by zzso zzso To determine if the similar sequences within the zzso and zzso regulatory regions function in the same way, deletion analysis and zzso zzso of the zzso promoter region were zzso A zzso sequence centered at zzso zzso termed a C box, is identical in the zzso and zzso promoter regions, yet zzso in the individual base pairs affected expression from the two promoters very zzso Also, a zzso change within a similar zzso element, which is centered at zzso zzso in both promoter regions, had very different effects on the activities of the two zzso Further zzso analysis showed that two regions are important for zzso zzso one region, from zzso to zzso zzso is required for zzso zzso and the other, from zzso to zzso zzso exerts a two- to fourfold effect on expression and is at least partially responsible for the C signal dependence of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso which are genes that zzso zzso factors, abolished and reduced zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso or zzso zzso correlated well with the altered levels of C signal produced in these zzso Our results provide the first detailed analysis of an zzso zzso regulatory region that depends partially on C signaling for expression and indicate that similar DNA sequences in the zzso and zzso promoter regions function zzso
