A clone of a zzso mobile element zzso corresponding to a zzso element zzso was obtained by carrying out the zzso chain reaction with zzso DNA of zzso zzso using a zzso zzso zzso sequence as a zzso This clone had a size of about zzso zzso and, after sequencing, was found to contain an zzso shorter zzso named zzso which was in turn integrated with a much longer zzso named zzso Thus, the mobile elements made a novel zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso of the composite structure each contained a zzso zzso sequence which was subsequently found to be highly zzso in all zzso and zzso elements registered so zzso We propose that the zzso stretch may be a recognition site for a zzso mechanism conducted by a reverse zzso and an zzso zzso On the basis of this zzso we propose a model that predicts how different types of zzso and zzso elements are dispersed in the zzso In addition, a zzso tree made from the current and extant zzso and zzso sequences indicated that these elements can be classified into zzso I and zzso
