The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was cloned and expressed in zzso coli from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene consisted of zzso zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated zzso of zzso The apparent zzso of the zzso determined by in zzso zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso gel zzso analysis, was approximately zzso An alignment of the zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso of the zzso acids were zzso The zzso gene was expressed in zzso coli from its own zzso however, no zzso coli zzso sequence was evident upstream from the zzso A major zzso coli zzso start point and a single zzso zzso zzso zzso start point were zzso zzso of the zzso gene was zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The ratio of zzso activity to zzso activity zzso zzso was constant for zzso preparations from zzso coli zzso indicating that both activities were associated with the zzso For zzso zzso zzso the zzso ratio varied considerably depending on the carbon source used for growth, suggesting that a separate zzso is produced in addition to the zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments and zzso zzso indicated that the zzso was exported to the zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region of the zzso revealed a putative zzso signal zzso The zzso properties of the zzso zzso were zzso The zzso was able to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso indicating that it was a zzso which was able to zzso zzso zzso
