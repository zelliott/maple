Three new zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso that we have named zzso zzso 1, 2 and 3 have been isolated from the bulbs of zzso zzso zzso and Miller by zzso zzso and gel zzso Analysis by zzso revealed that they are zzso proteins and mass zzso analysis afforded Mr values of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso 1, 2 and 3, zzso zzso strongly inhibited protein synthesis carried out by zzso zzso with zzso values in the zzso range but not that carried out by plant zzso systems or zzso zzso zzso promote the single zzso of rabbit zzso zzso zzso zzso cloning of genes coding for zzso revealed that they contain open reading frames of zzso zzso and 295 zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso contain zzso 273 and 273 zzso respectively suggesting zzso zzso zzso An untranslated zzso coding for an zzso very similar to that of zzso was detected in zzso Each of the four zzso genes contains an zzso In contrast to other zzso zzso are present only in bulbs and are not induced in leaves either by zzso or by treatment of leaves with zzso or salicylic acid, or by growth in zzso zzso these proteins could play a zzso role in plants; for instance, as zzso and protective agents only in some stages of the plant life cycle zzso
