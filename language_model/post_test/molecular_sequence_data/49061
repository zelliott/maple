We have identified a zzso zzso of zzso and show that zzso is needed to generate the longer zzso observed in this zzso zzso are specialized zzso structures at the ends of zzso that permit cells to distinguish zzso ends from zzso breaks, thus preventing zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso results in the lengthening of zzso a zzso also seen in an zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, homogeneous populations of zzso zzso cells show a steady increase in the length of zzso zzso which reach an equilibrium length and then zzso In contrast to that in zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells does not cause zzso fusion of zzso This zzso lengthening is dependent on the presence of zzso although it is not attributable to a significant increase in zzso activity per zzso These results demonstrate the essential role of the zzso protein as a negative regulator of zzso function in plant zzso
