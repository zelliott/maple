The zzso translation initiation factor 3 zzso is a zzso complex of approximately 600 zzso that binds to the 40 S zzso and promotes the binding of zzso and zzso zzso zzso 5 of the 10 zzso namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been isolated zzso Here we report the cloning and characterization of human zzso zzso the major zzso binding zzso zzso and two additional zzso zzso and zzso Each of these proteins is present in zzso formed with zzso zzso zzso Human zzso shares zzso sequence identity with a hypothetical zzso zzso zzso presumably the zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso derivatives of zzso show that the zzso domain lies within an zzso zzso acid region rich in zzso and zzso The zzso regions of human zzso and zzso are related to each other and to 17 other zzso zzso including zzso zzso a zzso of the 26 S zzso zzso analyses of the 19 related protein zzso called the zzso family, distinguish five major subgroups, where zzso zzso and zzso are each found in a different zzso The zzso composition of zzso appears to be highly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso whereas only 5 zzso of the 10 zzso of zzso zzso are zzso in zzso zzso
