zzso Collins syndrome is an zzso dominant, zzso zzso disorder, and its locus zzso has been mapped to zzso zzso To refine the location of the gene within this region, linkage analysis was performed among the zzso locus and 12 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in 13 zzso Collins syndrome zzso The highest maximum zzso score was obtained between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The best order, zzso zzso and genetic distances among these zzso were determined in the 40 zzso families by zzso linkage zzso zzso clones were used to establish the order of zzso zzso zzso By combining known physical mapping data with zzso the order of zzso zzso markers is zzso zzso zzso Based on this order, zzso analysis suggests that the zzso locus resides zzso of zzso and zzso to zzso within a region less than 1 zzso in zzso
