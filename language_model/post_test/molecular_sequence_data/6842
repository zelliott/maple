On the basis of the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso a zzso chain reaction zzso technique was developed for rapid detection and zzso differentiation of zzso zzso in a total of 100 zzso specimens from 50 female zzso Positive zzso zzso amplification was found in 28 cervical zzso and 31 urine zzso zzso agreement between zzso and culture was zzso Members of the two zzso of zzso zzso could be distinguished by the size of the zzso zzso amplification zzso zzso differentiation was also demonstrated by two additional sets of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso was used to amplify zzso 1, while zzso zzso amplified zzso 2 zzso The results indicated that use of the zzso zzso gene as a target for zzso amplification could provide rapid and specific detection and zzso of zzso DNA in zzso zzso
