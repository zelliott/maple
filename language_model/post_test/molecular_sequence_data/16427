The organic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, whereas it zzso organic zzso zzso To zzso the functional domain in zzso we constructed zzso proteins of human zzso zzso and mouse zzso zzso and introduced zzso at several zzso acids zzso among human, rat and mouse zzso We found that zzso zzso zzso zzso are responsible for organic zzso transport and for sodium dependence in zzso zzso Within zzso zzso and zzso of zzso are the critical zzso acids for the sodium zzso and double zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in minimal change in transport activity when sodium was removed from the zzso zzso We propose that zzso affinity for zzso is dependent on sodium recognition by these critical zzso acids in zzso whereas zzso transport by zzso requires functional linkage between zzso and zzso
