Many studies suggest that the zzso zzso zzso system plays a role in the zzso degradation of the zzso wall at the time of zzso zzso the zzso efficiency is reduced by zzso in mice where both zzso PA genes have been zzso To reveal the mechanism behind reduced zzso efficiency in zzso mice and its effect on zzso zzso we have studied the regulation of zzso activity in the zzso of zzso zzso mice and mice with deficient PA gene function during zzso zzso In zzso mice the zzso activity was low in zzso extracts from mice treated with pregnant zzso serum zzso However, this activity was increased between zzso h after an zzso dose of human zzso In mice lacking either zzso PA zzso or PA inhibitor type 1 zzso the zzso activity levels prior to zzso were similar to zzso mice, while extracts prepared from zzso PA zzso deficient mice had zzso or less of the zzso zzso This indicates that most of the zzso activity in the mouse zzso is generated by zzso In addition, as the zzso efficiency is impaired in zzso mice but appears normal in zzso mice, our data indicates that the amount of zzso generated by zzso prior to zzso in zzso mice greatly exceeds the amount required for efficient zzso
