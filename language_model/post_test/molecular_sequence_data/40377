A novel zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from plant litter collected at zzso Be National Park, zzso The zzso zzso and spore chains fragmented in a manner similar to zzso zzso the spores had smooth surfaces and were zzso zzso zzso had the following zzso zzso zzso acid in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso as characteristic zzso zzso as the major zzso zzso zzso as the diagnostic zzso and zzso as the major cellular fatty zzso zzso zzso shared low levels of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity zzso zzso with the type strains of recognized species of the zzso zzso and could be differentiated from its closest zzso relatives based on zzso zzso These results suggested that strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso
