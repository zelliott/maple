We have used an in zzso culture system to study the role of zzso zzso zzso in the fragmentation of guinea pig bone zzso zzso zzso and the formation of zzso fragments from these zzso zzso formation is zzso by zzso the cells on a hydrated type I collagen gel in the presence of zzso zzso express zzso proteins alpha 5, alpha 6, beta 1, and the alpha v beta 3 complex as demonstrated by zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso to the alpha v beta 3 zzso zzso blocked zzso formation, whereas the zzso zzso to the beta 1, alpha 5, and alpha 6 zzso proteins did not inhibit zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however, there was no zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gamma chain zzso zzso which binds to the zzso membrane zzso complex zzso but not to the zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit zzso formation, nor did two different zzso zzso In the absence of serum, zzso of zzso spontaneously formed processes or zzso The addition of 50 zzso of zzso to zzso cultures increased zzso formation to zzso of the zzso equal to cultures with zzso zzso zzso of zzso formation by zzso in zzso cultures was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso contain zzso zzso These data show that guinea pig zzso express alpha 5, alpha 6, beta 1, and alpha v beta 3 zzso However, only the zzso zzso zzso and its interaction with zzso plays an essential role in zzso formation in zzso
