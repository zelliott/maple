The zzso protein is essential for the completion of zzso DNA replication in zzso zzso Although its precise role in this process is zzso zzso forms a complex with zzso a zzso zzso implicated in the removal of the zzso primer during Okazaki zzso zzso To gain further insights into zzso function, we screened for zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and mapped the suppressing zzso into six zzso zzso Two of these zzso defined genes zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that all the suppressing zzso in zzso resulted in zzso of the protein and loss of sequences that included the zzso zzso zzso binding zzso previously shown to play an important role in maximizing zzso zzso in zzso zzso of this motif is shown to be sufficient for suppression of both zzso and zzso a zzso zzso of zzso suggesting that disruption of the interaction between zzso and zzso renders the activity of the zzso complex zzso
