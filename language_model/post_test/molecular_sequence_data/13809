This study determined the effects of zzso injections of zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso or control proteins (6 zzso from day 11 to day 14 zzso zzso day zzso on zzso expression of receptors zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Plasma zzso of zzso were greater on day 15 in zzso receiving zzso compared with control proteins zzso zzso zzso treatment zzso zzso zzso injected with zzso had lower zzso levels or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso on day 15 compared with zzso receiving control zzso In zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso zzso was more abundant in the zzso and zzso zzso of control zzso compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also present in the zzso and zzso zzso of control, but not zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso and protein were not different zzso zzso zzso between control and zzso zzso In zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso zzso zzso abundance was low in zzso zzso and zzso of both control and zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors were present in the zzso zzso and zzso of control zzso but confined to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso density was lower zzso zzso zzso in the zzso of zzso injected with zzso than control zzso however, zzso zzso affinity was not affected zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were not increased by zzso zzso administration in control and zzso zzso on days 10 or 12 zzso However, on day 14, control zzso responded to zzso with increased plasma zzso of zzso whereas zzso receiving zzso remained unresponsive to zzso These results indicate that the an zzso effects of zzso are to prevent increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso and protein and zzso zzso density which abrogates zzso release of zzso zzso during maternal recognition of zzso zzso may inhibit the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso by a zzso or zzso regulatory mechanism to suppress zzso zzso formation during early pregnancy in zzso
