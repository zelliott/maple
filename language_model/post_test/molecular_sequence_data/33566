The zzso sponge zzso zzso which is widely distributed in the USA, has been widely used as a model system in cell biology and has been proposed as a suitable teaching tool on biology and environmental zzso We undertook the first detailed zzso study of this sponge on samples collected from the zzso zzso A combination of zzso studies, zzso zzso gel zzso and bacterial community characterization based on zzso zzso gene sequencing revealed that zzso zzso contains a diverse zzso of bacteria that is different from that in the surrounding zzso zzso zzso individuals were successfully maintained in a zzso or zzso aquaculture system for over 6 months and shifts in the bacterial zzso of sponges in aquaculture compared with wild sponges were zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso represented over zzso of the species diversity present in the total bacterial community of the wild zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not represented in clones obtained from zzso zzso maintained in the aquaculture system although these three groups comprised zzso zzso of the clones from wild zzso zzso showing a significant effect of aquaculture on the bacterial community zzso This is the first systematic characterization of the bacterial community from a sponge found in the zzso zzso Changes in sponge bacterial composition were observed in sponges maintained in aquaculture and demonstrate the importance of monitoring microbial communities when zzso sponges in aquaculture zzso
