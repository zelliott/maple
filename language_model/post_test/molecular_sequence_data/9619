zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso factors contain two zzso arranged zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso zzso These factors have restricted patterns of zzso are found in zzso as well as zzso and are required for cell type zzso in a variety of developing zzso A recently identified, widely expressed zzso zzso binds with high affinity to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso proteins in zzso and in zzso In this study, a zzso zzso of zzso was found to be sufficient for the association of zzso with nuclear zzso zzso In addition, zzso was shown to form high affinity zzso through the zzso 200 zzso zzso but zzso of zzso was not required for association with the zzso zzso protein zzso Chemical zzso analysis revealed zzso complexes containing multiple zzso molecules bound to zzso indicating that zzso of zzso does not interfere with zzso domain zzso Additionally, zzso formed complexes with zzso on the rat insulin I promoter and inhibited the zzso zzso synergistic zzso zzso by zzso and the basic zzso protein zzso from the rat insulin I zzso These studies indicate that zzso contains at least two functionally independent zzso and may serve as a negative regulator of synergistic zzso responses which require direct interaction via zzso zzso Thus, zzso may regulate the zzso activity of zzso zzso proteins by determining specific partner zzso
