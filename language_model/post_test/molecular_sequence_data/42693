We examined the effects of zzso medium zzso obtained from a zzso zzso cell line, termed zzso on chick sympathetic zzso zzso zzso grown on a zzso coated with CM extended their zzso zzso raised against human zzso and mouse zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso factor in zzso The most zzso fraction of CM contained a zzso protein which reacted with the zzso zzso and was composed of three zzso of 330 zzso 215 zzso and 195 zzso The zzso and zzso zzso but not the zzso zzso were shown to be zzso related to mouse zzso and human zzso by zzso The presence of zzso M chain in zzso cells was ruled out by using the method of reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso These results suggest that the zzso protein is a zzso zzso having a novel heavy chain of 330 zzso and is responsible for zzso zzso activity in zzso
