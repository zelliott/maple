The associations between the zzso in the promoter region of the zzso zzso leukemia viral zzso zzso 3 zzso gene and lung cancer risk were zzso 

By direct sequencing, we first found two known zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Further zzso zzso and zzso zzso analyses were performed in order to characterize the association between the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and lung cancer risk in 425 patients with lung cancer and 411 healthy zzso To examine the potential effects of the zzso zzso zzso on zzso transcription, zzso reporter zzso were performed in zzso cell lung cancer zzso cell zzso 

The zzso zzso zzso was associated with the risk of lung cancer in a zzso model of zzso Interestingly, the T zzso zzso significantly lower promoter activity by zzso and zzso than the C zzso in zzso and zzso cell zzso 

zzso promoter zzso affect zzso gene zzso and contribute to genetic zzso to lung cancer in zzso
