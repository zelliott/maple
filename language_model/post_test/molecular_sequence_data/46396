zzso and zzso possess basic zzso zzso zzso zzso and form a zzso called zzso a key regulator of zzso zzso binds to the zzso recognition element zzso and activates zzso of many zzso zzso Since the zzso domain, which mediates DNA binding and zzso is the only functional domain established for zzso it has been assumed that zzso is required only for zzso binding to zzso and to facilitate zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso region of zzso which is distinct from the zzso domain, revealed that this region contains a nuclear zzso zzso We used a transgenic zzso rescue zzso to delineate the function of the zzso C zzso in zzso zzso mice expressing a zzso zzso protein lacking the C zzso zzso were crossed into a zzso zzso The compound zzso mice displayed severe zzso and zzso which zzso zzso zzso The zzso C zzso is essential for zzso formation and zzso gene zzso but not for zzso binding to zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso C zzso is required for zzso function and suggest that efficient targeting of zzso to a specific nuclear scaffold is important to achieve high-level zzso
