Since zzso zzso are present in the environment as degradation products of zzso zzso zzso could have developed a detoxifying system to transport these compounds into their zzso zzso from zzso zzso showed an zzso zzso transport of zzso zzso zzso that was reduced by zzso and zzso in zzso and zzso cells, zzso the double zzso showed no zzso zzso zzso the transport of zzso acids zzso was comparable in wild and deleted zzso These data identify zzso and zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso as the genes responsible for zzso zzso transport in zzso Since zzso and zzso are rather zzso with zzso resistant proteins zzso they also suggest the involvement of this class of zzso in the zzso transport of zzso zzso
