We have isolated a second goldfish zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is distinct from the zzso zzso zzso zzso reported zzso The zzso zzso isolated from a goldfish zzso and brain zzso library, encodes a 610 zzso acid zzso protein which shows only a zzso zzso sequence identity with zzso in overall zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso of zzso in contrast to that of zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso zzso and zzso as well as in liver of female zzso The existence of a second distinct zzso zzso opens new dimensions for studying zzso regulation of gene expression by zzso in the zzso zzso
