The genes zzso the zzso restriction modification system, which recognizes the sequence zzso zzso have been cloned into zzso zzso was based on expression of the cloned zzso gene which renders zzso DNA insensitive to zzso zzso in zzso Initially, an insert of 15 zzso was obtained which, upon zzso yielded a 3 zzso zzso to zzso zzso carrying the genes for both the zzso and the restriction zzso This insert has been zzso Based upon the zzso together with appropriate zzso it is shown that the two genes are transcribed zzso with the zzso gene zzso a zzso of zzso zzso zzso while the restriction zzso is composed of 262 zzso zzso zzso of the sequence of the zzso zzso with other zzso zzso shows a striking degree of zzso Especially noteworthy is the high degree of similarity with the zzso and zzso zzso
