zzso zzso may function as zzso receptors zzso and play important roles in immune zzso In this work, a zzso for a new zzso zzso zzso was obtained from Chinese white shrimp zzso zzso using expressed sequence tag analysis and rapid amplification of the zzso zzso zzso contains an zzso signal zzso and a zzso recognition domain zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso was mainly expressed in zzso and that the expression of zzso was obviously zzso by zzso zzso or white spot syndrome virus zzso zzso zzso zzso could zzso zzso and -positive bacteria with the presence of zzso A following zzso zzso test indicated that zzso could recognize zzso acid and zzso Besides, pull-down zzso showed that the zzso protein could interact with zzso one major envelope protein of zzso These results suggested that zzso might function in the recognition of bacterial and viral pathogens in zzso
