We have determined the sequence of a rat beta zzso complementary DNA zzso clone and the zzso sequence of the human beta zzso zzso zzso of the ratio of silent to zzso substitution between zzso beta zzso beta zzso and other zzso and zzso sequences revealed that the region zzso the two zzso zzso of the beta zzso sequence is the best zzso during evolution, much better than the corresponding region of the beta zzso beta zzso or the zzso zzso and even better (at least in the zzso zzso than the zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso the rate of change of the beta zzso coding sequence does not differ in the zzso and zzso zzso in contrast with previous findings concerning the evolution rates of the alpha A- or zzso sequences in these two zzso zzso of the regions that zzso the four motifs of the zzso between zzso zzso sequences showed that the extent of zzso substitution in each of these four zzso motif regions is the zzso However, when the zzso zzso genes of more zzso related species zzso vs chicken or zzso are zzso the extent of zzso substitution is higher in the regions zzso the external motifs I and III than in the regions zzso the internal motifs II and zzso This phenomenon is also observed when zzso members of the zzso zzso family are zzso
