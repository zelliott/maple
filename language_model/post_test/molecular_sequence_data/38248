In this study, two different zzso tags zzso zzso were introduced near the N zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The resulting proteins were indistinguishable from the zzso zzso in their ability to travel through the zzso pathway, as judged by quantitative zzso of isolated zzso zzso Furthermore, there were no significant abnormalities in zzso activity (including zzso for zzso zzso pH zzso and zzso for zzso by zzso or in zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso could support normal growth and displayed the expected zzso by zzso
