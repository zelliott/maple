During development all zzso males first develop a zzso zzso that later zzso and zzso into a zzso In this study, individuals undergoing zzso transformation were identified from a zzso transgenic line and used for gene expression analysis of zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso zzso and 11 zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso by real-time zzso chain reaction and in zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso juvenile zzso zzso was expressed around the zzso but zzso and zzso could not be zzso During zzso transformation zzso was zzso and could not be detected zzso in contrast zzso was zzso and highly expressed at similar regions where zzso had been expressed zzso Furthermore, the zzso transcript levels of zzso and zzso showed a zzso picture, zzso the higher was the level of zzso the lower was that of zzso zzso of zzso was also zzso but later than zzso and its zzso was not related to the position of zzso zzso These data indicate that zzso is a candidate gene zzso zzso leading to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or its product, zzso is unlikely to be the zzso of zzso zzso zzso as proposed earlier for some zzso zzso fish zzso
