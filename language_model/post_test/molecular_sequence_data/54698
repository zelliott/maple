zzso with multiple zzso strains is common in zzso zzso but its occurrence in normal hosts has not been zzso 

We analyzed zzso strains zzso in women who acquired zzso while enrolled in a zzso zzso B zzso vaccine zzso zzso of four variable genes was performed in samples collected from zzso and up to 34 months zzso 

199 cultured zzso from 53 women and 65 original zzso from a subset of 19 women were zzso 51 women were infected with one strain each without evidence for genetic zzso only two women shed multiple zzso zzso zzso among strains increased with the number of zzso genetic zzso Nevertheless, 13 of 53 women proved to be infected with an identical zzso strain based on sequencing at all four variable zzso zzso vaccine did not alter the degree of genetic diversity amongst zzso 

zzso zzso infection in healthy women nearly always involves shedding of one strain that remains stable over zzso zzso with zzso vaccine strain is not selective against specific zzso Although zzso of women zzso their unique strain, or a strain shared with only one other woman, zzso shared a single common strain, suggesting that this zzso strain with a particular combination of genetic zzso is advantageous in this large urban zzso
