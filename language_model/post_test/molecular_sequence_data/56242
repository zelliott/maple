Using a single burst zzso based on a zzso zzso I have determined the zzso virus frequency in single zzso zzso with zzso zzso form zzso DNA carrying an zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso at position zzso of the minus zzso One set of experiments was performed with zzso derived from zzso coli zzso which has normal zzso zzso Of the cells examined after zzso with DNA carrying a zzso zzso zzso produced zzso virus and zzso contained only zzso with zzso zzso of the cells had zzso and zzso produced only zzso with zzso zzso of the cells had zzso and zzso contained only zzso with zzso no zzso were detected in the 33 cells zzso In similar experiments carried out with zzso defective in zzso repair zzso coli zzso zzso the percentage of cells producing zzso zzso after zzso with DNA carrying an zzso zzso increased from 6 to zzso and the percentage of cells producing only zzso increased from 3 to zzso with DNA carrying an zzso zzso the percentage of cells producing zzso decreased from 30 to zzso and the percentage of cells producing only zzso fell from zzso to zzso In order for an individual zzso cell to produce exclusively zzso zzso from a single zzso zzso some form of selection must occur during replication because one strand of the zzso DNA is zzso and zzso repair, which could lead to a zzso with the transition in both zzso is defective in these zzso This selection must also occur in cells with normal DNA zzso The first event in the selection process is zzso if replication of the zzso occurs first and if a zzso is produced, then there is a significant probability that the cell will produce only zzso virus regardless of whether or not repair occurs in subsequent events, but the frequency one observes is influenced strongly by the status of the repair systems in the zzso
