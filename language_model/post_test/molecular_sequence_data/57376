We developed an zzso for zzso N zzso in which zzso zzso zzso zzso can be used at zzso zzso zzso well below zzso (12 zzso and at or below zzso concentration zzso Such reaction conditions simulate those in zzso where zzso hormones in zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso by zzso or zzso zzso of zzso The zzso reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso when human serum, human seminal zzso guinea pig serum, or homogeneous zzso kidney zzso was used as zzso source and zzso was within the concentration range of zzso zzso For zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Human serum zzso was in a concentration (about zzso zzso in great excess over those reported for zzso such as zzso zzso Several advantages zzso under conditions of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is measured zzso zzso When zzso is known, zzso can be zzso in zzso zzso zzso values for alternative zzso can be taken as zzso zzso zzso zzso values for zzso are Ki values when Ki zzso zzso zzso can be used to measure zzso activity in the presence of zzso and zzso that interfere with zzso and zzso zzso We have confirmed that alleged zzso such as zzso III and zzso and zzso are bound by zzso with high affinities zzso values, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso pulmonary artery zzso cell cultures were found to possess zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
