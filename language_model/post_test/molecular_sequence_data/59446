zzso cell zzso zzso factor is a protein known to enhance the survival of zzso zzso against several zzso It has been shown to have therapeutic potential in the treatment of Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative zzso We have determined the zzso and zzso zzso linkages of the zzso zzso by a combination of direct zzso analysis and zzso analysis after either partial reduction or partial zzso of the zzso Under an zzso condition, the zzso zzso bond was selectively zzso with zzso revealing that zzso was involved in the zzso zzso zzso Three other zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified as zzso zzso The determined zzso structure is highly zzso to that of transforming growth factor beta zzso Since one zzso zzso points through a ring consisting of eight zzso acid zzso based on the similarity with transforming growth factor beta 2, the zzso peptides were not zzso by conventional zzso Only the peptides from an zzso region zzso zzso to zzso were liberated by zzso treatment with zzso or zzso zzso resulting in a stable zzso zzso
