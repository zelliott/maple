zzso zzso zzso spontaneous phase variation in colony zzso zzso from transparent colonies efficiently colonize the zzso in an infant rat model of zzso zzso zzso whereas organisms from more opaque colonies are deficient at zzso A genetic approach relying on the zzso of zzso zzso was used to identify a locus contributing to zzso zzso By screening a library of zzso DNA from an opaque zzso of strain Rd, it was possible to isolate a single clone capable of transforming a transparent Rd host to a more opaque zzso A region containing two zzso designated zzso and zzso was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso has similarity to a consensus sequence for bacterial zzso zzso defined zzso in zzso were transformed into the transparent Rd to confirm that this gene is required for expression of the transparent colony zzso Although zzso lacks a signal zzso gene zzso to zzso show that zzso is zzso in zzso zzso and zzso phase variation in zzso zzso of zzso in strain Rd, and type b strain zzso resulted in loss of the ability to colonize the zzso of infant zzso The type b zzso however, was as virulent as its parent strain when zzso zzso This suggests that the contribution of zzso to zzso is limited to events associated with colonization of the zzso zzso
