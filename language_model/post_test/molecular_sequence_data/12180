zzso zzso transport selected integral membrane proteins from the cell surface and the zzso network to the zzso zzso Before fusing with their target the zzso must be stripped of their zzso This process is zzso by the zzso protein zzso together with a zzso zzso which we here identify as the coat protein zzso zzso binds with high affinity to assembled zzso zzso and, in the presence of zzso recruits zzso zzso of the lattice does not depend as previously supposed on zzso light chains or on the zzso domain of the heavy zzso The presence of a zzso at its zzso zzso now defines zzso as a member of the zzso protein zzso In conjunction with zzso zzso proteins zzso protein zzso protein transport across zzso and the selective disruption of zzso zzso We show that deletion of the zzso of zzso results in the loss of zzso zzso
