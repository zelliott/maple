We have designed a series of zzso peptides derived from the zzso of human zzso zzso acids zzso domain 4) to determine the structural basis of the zzso zzso zzso All the zzso peptides are able to bind to zzso and inhibit zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso of zzso is bound per zzso for zzso zzso However, equivalent zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso requires less than one zzso per seven zzso to be zzso We have found two zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso from the center of domain 4 which zzso zzso filament zzso zzso their effect is opposite to zzso zzso zzso zzso with one zzso or zzso bound per four zzso This effect is completely dependent upon the presence of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso and zzso also increase zzso filament zzso in the in zzso zzso zzso If the zzso sequence is extended by 20 zzso acids at the zzso end to the zzso of domain 4, the zzso becomes an zzso If zzso is extended by 19 zzso acids at its C zzso it becomes a zzso zzso and with a further extension of 7 zzso acids to reach the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso is more zzso We conclude that three regions in domain 4 of zzso contribute to zzso zzso of zzso zzso a central segment zzso zzso in the chicken zzso which is essential but not sufficient for zzso zzso of zzso zzso and two zzso binding segments zzso and zzso to this segment, zzso zzso and zzso zzso If only the central segment is present zzso zzso the zzso zzso complex is not zzso and its properties resemble zzso zzso zzso
