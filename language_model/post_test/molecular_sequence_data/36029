We have analyzed the zzso structure of the human zzso zzso one of the zzso zzso for zzso tumor at zzso zzso By analyses of three zzso covering the zzso gene as well as products generated by zzso chain reaction, zzso sites for 10 restriction zzso were mapped in a region of about 80 zzso and the positions of 10 zzso were zzso We also mapped two zzso sites for zzso Our zzso map will be useful to analyze DNA abnormalities sometimes found in the tumors, as well as loss of zzso
