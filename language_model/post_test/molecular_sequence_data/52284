The zzso zzso of zzso T zzso alpha and zzso differing in the sequence of a region near the zzso zzso arise from alternative zzso of a primary transcript of the zzso gene and are expressed in a zzso and zzso regulated manner zzso zzso zzso Nguyen, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1984) Cell 38, zzso To date, the beta zzso has not been studied directly at the protein zzso To explore the potential functional differences between the alpha and beta zzso we isolated two rabbit skeletal zzso zzso zzso a full-length zzso for a beta zzso and a zzso zzso for an alpha zzso Two restriction fragments derived from the zzso clones were used to direct zzso in zzso coli, of two zzso fragments, zzso and zzso each containing the last 108 zzso acid zzso of the alpha or beta zzso of zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso along with fluorescent derivatives of zzso C zzso and alpha zzso zzso we showed that zzso bound more strongly to zzso than did zzso both in the presence and absence of zzso and exhibited a higher affinity for zzso than did zzso More interestingly, the zzso affinities of the zzso regulatory sites of zzso in the zzso zzso complex were found to be zzso higher than in zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that the sequence divergence between the alpha and beta zzso of zzso may have functional significance in possibly contributing to the determination of the zzso sensitivity of muscle zzso
