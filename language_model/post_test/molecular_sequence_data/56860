Using a zzso zzso zzso probe, a gene coding for a zzso alcohol zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso (formerly zzso zzso has been zzso This gene is able to restore alcoholic zzso in an zzso strain of zzso zzso and its zzso protein shows strong similarity with other zzso alcohol zzso (from zzso zzso zzso zzso and its close relative zzso zzso The product of the gene expressed in zzso zzso zzso on native gel with a zzso zzso zzso zzso which is more active in cells growing on zzso carbon sources than on zzso This zzso is in contrast with that of the two zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso which are both more active in zzso than in zzso zzso
