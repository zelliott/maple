zzso bacteria were obtained after enrichment on crude oil (as a zzso zzso in a continuous supply of Indonesian seawater amended with zzso zzso and iron zzso They were related to zzso and zzso zzso which are ubiquitous zzso bacteria in marine zzso and to zzso zzso zzso % similarities in almost full-length zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso bacteria showed high zzso activity, comparable to that of zzso zzso strain zzso On the other hand, zzso strains exhibited high activity for zzso degradation and thus could be key bacteria for zzso zzso in tropical zzso zzso bacteria became most dominant in zzso that simulated a crude oil spill event with Indonesian zzso The dominance was observed in zzso that were zzso or amended with zzso suggesting that the zzso strains could become dominant in the natural tropical marine environment after an accidental oil spill, and would continue to dominate in the environment after zzso These results suggest that zzso bacteria could be major zzso of petroleum zzso zzso in the tropical zzso
