A systematic search of the zzso region of the human Y zzso zzso identified 12 novel genes or families, 10 with full-length complementary DNA zzso All 12 zzso and six of eight zzso genes or families previously isolated by less systematic means, fell into two zzso Genes in the first group were expressed in many zzso these zzso genes have X zzso that escape X zzso The second group, consisting of zzso gene families expressed specifically in zzso may account for zzso among men with Y zzso The zzso of the zzso gene content contrasts with the apparently haphazard content of most zzso zzso
