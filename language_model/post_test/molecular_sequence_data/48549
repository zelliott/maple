zzso inhibitor Portland zzso is an engineered zzso family inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso that exhibits high specificity but limited selectivity for zzso zzso over other PC family zzso Here, we characterize zzso zzso a natural inhibitor of zzso together with zzso B8 and zzso zzso to identify zzso of zzso specificity and selectivity for zzso zzso zzso zzso center loop zzso sequences of zzso with those of zzso B8 demonstrated that both the zzso zzso recognition sequence as well as the zzso sequence are critical zzso of zzso specificity for zzso zzso of PC zzso zzso revealed four variable zzso zzso whose role in zzso zzso with zzso B8 was tested by engineering zzso loop zzso The zzso loop but not the other zzso zzso affected zzso zzso with zzso B8 and zzso in a manner that depended on the zzso zzso zzso Modeling of the zzso zzso zzso complex identified zzso zzso in strand zzso close to the zzso loop whose substitution in zzso zzso affected zzso zzso depending on the zzso loop and zzso zzso zzso These studies demonstrate that zzso zzso strand zzso zzso and the zzso loop are critical zzso of zzso zzso with zzso which may be exploited in the design of specific and selective zzso zzso of zzso
