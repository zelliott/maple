To achieve continuous expression of the major zzso zzso protein zzso in insect cells, the zzso gene coding region was placed under control of a zzso zzso gene promoter and zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was detected in twelve cell lines, one of which was selected for detailed zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was targeted to and retained in the zzso zzso zzso in accordance with its signal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso We discuss the advantages of zzso over transient expression systems for zzso proteins targeted to the zzso system of insect zzso
