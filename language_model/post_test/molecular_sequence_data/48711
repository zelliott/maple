Members of the zzso zzso family zzso zzso are zzso expressed in zzso tissue and are thought to perform zzso functions for zzso zzso zzso as well as being implicated in vascular zzso and zzso zzso zzso The aims of this study were to investigate the zzso of a zzso region in zzso between the predicted zzso and zzso zzso zzso and to investigate the functional consequences of zzso zzso in this zzso 

zzso were zzso at 18 sites in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso Transport function of the zzso was investigated by zzso zzso or two zzso zzso clamp before and after zzso modification of the novel zzso 

Exposure to the zzso zzso zzso resulted in diminished transport function for 7 zzso The apparent accessibility of 5 of the zzso sites, estimated from the rate of functional zzso zzso was zzso zzso substitution at some sites also altered the apparent affinity for zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso further zzso the importance of this zzso in defining zzso transport zzso 

The external accessibility of a zzso in zzso was confirmed and sites were identified that determine zzso selectivity and transport zzso
