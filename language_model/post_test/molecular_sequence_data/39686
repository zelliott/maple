Comparative modeling and zzso zzso experiments have been applied to investigate two zzso complexes formed between the wheat zzso inhibitor zzso and two susceptible zzso zzso represents the first case of a wheat protein inhibitor active against animal zzso and bacterial zzso The model was created using as template structure that of the zzso inhibitor from barley zzso zzso zzso which shares zzso sequence identity with zzso Under these conditions of high zzso the comparative modeling approach can be successfully zzso We predicted the zzso zzso model and used it to investigate zzso complex zzso Experimental observations indicated that zzso but not zzso in addition to zzso at the primary zzso site zzso is able to zzso a second zzso bond between zzso and zzso Here, we report on zzso of the zzso bond at the zzso zzso site zzso determined using zzso zzso zzso the same event was investigated for both zzso and zzso complexes using molecular dynamics zzso The molecular details of the initial zzso zzso as well as of the changes observed during the simulations, allow us to speculate on the different fates of the two zzso zzso
