zzso zzso are thought to be zzso zzso in patients with breast zzso The present study was carried out to investigate the amplification of the zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso 

In a retrospective study of 196 patients with zzso zzso cancer, the amplification of the zzso zzso and zzso in the DNA of zzso tumor cells was determined by quantitative zzso The purpose of this study was to analyze whether the two zzso correlated with such zzso factors as zzso stage, zzso grade, zzso zzso residual tumor mass, hormone zzso content, and zzso CA 125 serum zzso The effect of zzso and zzso amplification on patient survival was also zzso 

The only correlation found in this study was between zzso and zzso CA 125 levels zzso zzso zzso No correlations were zzso between zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso zzso and overall zzso 

Unlike the established zzso factors, neither zzso nor zzso appears to be zzso for survival in patients with zzso zzso
