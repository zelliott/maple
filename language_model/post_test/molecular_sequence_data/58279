zzso zzso is a representative member of the zzso zzso seed zzso which consists of two zzso chains of zzso and zzso zzso linked by two zzso zzso In this work, a complete assignment of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been carried out by two-dimensional zzso zzso methods and its secondary structure determined on the basis of spectral zzso A calculation of the zzso structure has been performed using approximately 500 distance constraints derived from zzso assigned zzso zzso and distance geometry zzso The resulting global fold consists of five zzso and a zzso loop arranged in a right-handed zzso The folded protein is stabilized by two zzso zzso bridges and two additional ones between zzso zzso in the large zzso The structure of zzso zzso represents a third example of a new and distinctive folding pattern first described for the zzso protein from soybean and zzso zzso transfer proteins from wheat and zzso The presence of an internal cavity is not at all zzso which rules out in principle the zzso zzso as a carrier of zzso The determined structure is compatible with activities attributed to these proteins such as zzso zzso interaction, zzso and zzso zzso Given the sequence zzso of zzso with other zzso and zzso zzso zzso seed proteins from different species, it is likely that all these proteins share a common zzso The determined structure will be crucial to establish zzso relationships and to explore the mechanisms of zzso processing, and deposition of these zzso It will also provide a firm basis for a rational use of genetic engineering in order to develop improved transgenic zzso
