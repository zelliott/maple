Recent molecular studies have shown zzso zzso recovered from cases of zzso in zzso to have complete zzso zzso sequence identity and zzso zzso zzso with human zzso within the zzso zzso third zzso zzso We identified 67 clinical and two environmental zzso of the zzso zzso third zzso zzso group, of which 48 zzso had the same zzso restriction zzso analysis zzso profile as the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso zzso and were studied in more zzso Most zzso patient zzso were from Texas zzso Florida zzso or other southern coastal states zzso Clinical infections included wound infections zzso central zzso infections and/or zzso zzso and possible zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso showed zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso gene showed four zzso that differed by 2 to 3 zzso from the zzso zzso Clinical zzso were positive for zzso activity at 3 days, zzso iron zzso zzso zzso and zzso at 68 degrees zzso They were negative for zzso and zzso zzso Clinical zzso were susceptible to zzso zzso and zzso and susceptible or intermediate to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gave similar results except for being nitrate zzso These studies showed almost complete zzso and molecular identity between clinical zzso of the zzso zzso third zzso zzso group and zzso strains of zzso zzso and confirmed that they belong to the same zzso Identification of zzso zzso presently requires zzso gene zzso or zzso zzso or zzso gene zzso
