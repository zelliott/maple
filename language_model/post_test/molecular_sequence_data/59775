In this study, zzso and zzso with zzso Lewis zzso zzso Lewis zzso Lewis zzso and Lewis y zzso were isolated by zzso and zzso liquid zzso from human milk of mothers with term or zzso zzso The identification of these zzso on zzso proteins was achieved by zzso zzso and zzso after Western zzso zzso zzso were characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso which are potential zzso for selections are not of cellular origin but appear in the soluble fraction of zzso Here, they are present as zzso zzso zzso weight zzso 10 zzso or bound to proteins with a high molecular weight zzso 100 zzso Lewis zzso might represent another category of protective zzso substances in human milk with the potential to influence inflammatory processes in human milk fed zzso
