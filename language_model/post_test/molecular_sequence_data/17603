Two zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been previously identified and are thought to be point zzso in the structural gene for the neurotransmitter zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to clarify the molecular nature of these zzso and characterize the presumed zzso acid zzso we have used the zzso chain reaction to amplify zzso zzso zzso zzso acid fragments from both zzso zzso zzso zzso complementary zzso acid was cloned and used to construct zzso complementary zzso acid clones containing approximately two-thirds of the zzso sequence which would code for zzso zzso acids and one-third of the zzso sequence coding for the zzso zzso zzso After in zzso translation of complementary zzso acid produced from the zzso complementary zzso acid zzso zzso zzso activity was determined and shown to be zzso zzso analyses of these clones showed that one zzso acid substitution due to single base substitution is crucial in each zzso zzso zzso complementary zzso acid to generate a zzso zzso zzso zzso The point zzso of the structural gene for zzso zzso are thus confirmed and shown to regulate the zzso of the zzso produced by zzso and zzso
