The genes coding for the two zzso zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso which form together the zzso of the basement membrane type IV zzso were found to have a special and unusual zzso zzso The two genes are very closely linked, they are transcribed in opposite directions, and they apparently use a common and zzso promoter with a length of zzso zzso This region is characterized by a symmetrical arrangement of typical elements and by the zzso structure of the zzso In accordance with the symmetry of the promoter itself, a symmetrical organization of sequence motifs zzso zzso was also observed in zzso zzso For the promoter and the zzso regions we could detect specific binding of nuclear factors that indicates their involvement in zzso zzso This suggests that the intrinsic symmetry of the type IV collagen promoter and its zzso regions may be a structural prerequisite for its zzso zzso In transient gene expression systems no significant activity of the type IV collagen promoter was observed in either zzso This implies that additional enhancing elements are essential for the efficient and zzso zzso of both type IV collagen zzso The screening for such controlling elements within the alpha zzso and the alpha zzso gene led to the observation that the zzso in direction of the alpha zzso gene is activated by an element located in the first zzso of the alpha 2 zzso Its enhancing effect is strictly dependent on the intact zzso structure of this zzso zzso of orientation and distance to the promoter destroys its activity zzso This element, located about zzso zzso downstream from the start site of alpha zzso transcription, seems to form a zzso acting unit with the common promoter, essential for zzso activity in alpha 2 zzso We have not found additional enhancing elements in other regions of both zzso zzso for the zzso with previous data, which define an enhancing element within the first zzso of the alpha zzso gene of zzso are only speculative at zzso
