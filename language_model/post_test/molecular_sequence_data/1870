A zzso zzso zzso descended from the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso has been found in zzso zzso that preserves a zzso junction zzso event that altered the zzso end of the zzso The zzso zzso zzso transition zzso at the zzso zzso junction of zzso zzso zzso zzso 7 led to the absence of zzso 8 and more than 1 zzso of zzso 7 sequence being zzso zzso of source gene and zzso sequences indicates that the zzso event occurred 19 million years zzso Present in these sequences is an zzso stop and several available zzso signals, suggesting that the zzso zzso could have been zzso At the present time, the genetic fossil is the only evidence that the zzso ever occurred, and thus represents an archival marker of an ancient genetic event in zzso zzso
