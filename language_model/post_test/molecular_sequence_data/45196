The recently discovered zzso protein acts as an inhibitor of the essential zzso zzso zzso and we demonstrated that zzso expression of zzso affects the abundance of more than 700 transcripts in zzso coli zzso Lee, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cohen, and zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso We show that zzso is expressed from its own promoter, zzso located in the zzso zzso zzso zzso extension and zzso fusion analysis revealed that zzso from zzso is elevated upon entry into stationary phase in a zzso zzso In addition, the stability of the zzso transcript is dependent on zzso E activity, suggesting the involvement of a feedback circuit in the regulation of the zzso level in zzso zzso
