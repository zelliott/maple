zzso C virus zzso is a major health problem worldwide, infecting an estimated 170 million zzso The high genetic zzso of zzso contributes to the zzso of zzso zzso Here, we report results from a large-scale sequence analysis of 67 patients infected with zzso zzso 1, 23 with zzso zzso and 44 with zzso zzso Two regions of the zzso zzso were zzso in samples prior to combined therapy with alpha zzso plus zzso one zzso the zzso regions zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso and another one including the zzso determining region zzso and the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso diversity measures showed a clear tendency to higher genetic zzso levels in zzso patients to zzso treatment than in zzso patients, although highly disperse values were present within each response group for both zzso A more detailed analysis of zzso acid composition revealed the presence of several zzso zzso in a few positions, but no discriminating positions between zzso and zzso patients were zzso Our results also revealed that most zzso acid positions were highly zzso especially for zzso zzso We conclude that the outcome of the zzso treatment might depend not only on the nature of one or a few independent positions, but more likely on the combination of several positions along the zzso zzso Moreover, the own zzso ability to generate an appropriate systemic response, in combination with the action of zzso is also likely to be essential for treatment zzso
