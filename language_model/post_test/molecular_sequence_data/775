zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso and zzso zzso zzso belong to the zzso ear blight zzso zzso complex affecting zzso In 2007 and 2008, major zzso zzso zzso were observed in France, and the efficacy of zzso was found to be altered in some field zzso The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity to zzso of French zzso of zzso and to zzso the possible mechanisms of zzso 

Half of the strains collected in 2007 were resistant to zzso and most also displayed strong resistance to zzso zzso resistance was found mostly in zzso zzso zzso Positive zzso was observed between all zzso tested, but not with the zzso zzso zzso and the various classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso In most zzso resistance was correlated with the zzso substitution in zzso zzso the molecular target of zzso Two other mechanisms were also detected at lower zzso 

This is the first report of zzso resistance in zzso Several resistance mechanisms have evolved independently in populations and may have different impacts on field zzso This makes the accurate detection and zzso of zzso resistance zzso The management of field resistance and efficacy must be adapted to take these findings into zzso
