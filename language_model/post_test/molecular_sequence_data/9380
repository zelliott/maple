zzso zzso play vital regulatory roles in many cellular zzso The expression of zzso zzso is highly enriched in adult mouse zzso but its roles and underlying mechanisms of action are not well zzso 

In the present study, we show that zzso is detected in mouse zzso zzso and continues to be highly expressed in zzso To explore the specific functions of zzso we have established an in zzso model by zzso zzso zzso into primary zzso to study the zzso of zzso The results show that zzso of zzso significantly increases the zzso ratio and prevents germ cell from zzso induced by deprivation of zzso Moreover, zzso expression of the zzso in zzso cell trigger the cell zzso with a decreased zzso ratio and zzso zzso lead to a low spontaneous zzso ratio and an increased zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso reduces zzso protein expression without affecting zzso zzso level via directly binding to zzso zzso indicating that zzso is one of zzso target zzso Meanwhile, the zzso of zzso significantly decreases the zzso ratio and triggers zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso does not decrease the zzso cell zzso ratio in zzso zzso zzso 

Our study shows for the first time that zzso functions, at least zzso by targeting the zzso gene in germ cell zzso providing a novel mechanism with involvement of zzso in the regulation of germ cell zzso
