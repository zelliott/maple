zzso zzso requires the production of zzso toxins zzso to cause the disease tan spot of zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the species most closely related to zzso zzso is the zzso agent of brown leaf spot of zzso Because of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we investigated the possibility that zzso zzso contains sequences zzso to zzso and/or zzso the products of which may be involved in its interaction with zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso revealed the presence of zzso sequences in zzso zzso and zzso zzso was used to clone several of these zzso which were subsequently confirmed to be zzso to zzso Additionally, Southern analysis revealed zzso from zzso zzso to have a zzso nature similar to zzso from zzso zzso A combination of zzso and Southern analyses revealed that the distribution of zzso extends further into the zzso and a search of available zzso zzso identified a distant putative zzso in zzso zzso zzso agent of rice zzso Thus, unlike most described zzso zzso zzso are present across a broad range of plant zzso zzso suggesting that it may have arose in an early zzso of the zzso
