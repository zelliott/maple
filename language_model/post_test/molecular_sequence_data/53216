An unstable zzso element zzso multiple zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to include sequences zzso to the zzso genes zzso zzso in zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso As zzso have been implicated in the zzso of zzso zzso we investigated the zzso zzso in all four species of zzso DNA sequencing and zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso of a wide range of zzso zzso of diverse zzso and different geographical zzso were almost universally disrupted by deletions or zzso indicating the existence of a strong selective pressure against the expression of zzso zzso of zzso zzso coli zzso which share zzso traits with zzso zzso and cause similar diseases in humans, also possessed insertions or deletions in the zzso locus or were otherwise unable to produce zzso Since the production of zzso is a widespread trait in environmental zzso of zzso coli, our results suggest that genetic zzso that abolish zzso production in the closely related zzso zzso and in zzso are zzso zzso
