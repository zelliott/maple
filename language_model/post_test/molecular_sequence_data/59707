A combination of Southern zzso analysis on a panel of zzso zzso cell hybrids and zzso in zzso zzso techniques was used to map zzso zzso and DNA markers from the zzso region relative to the X zzso zzso of the zzso cell zzso zzso The position of the zzso could be determined as zzso zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso and zzso revealed split signals indicating that the corresponding DNA zzso span the zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that a zzso zzso zzso which is present in all zzso zzso identified, zzso to zzso restriction fragments in three independent zzso zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso in these tumors are not the same, but map within a region of approximately zzso zzso Through zzso gel zzso an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso could be isolated which encompasses the zzso region present on zzso zzso characterization of this zzso revealed the presence of a zzso region with a strong zzso to the zzso end of the mouse zzso zzso in the zzso part, and a zzso segment in the zzso zzso part identical to the zzso end of a known zzso zzso number zzso These observations suggest that a fusion gene is formed between the two corresponding genes in zzso zzso zzso cell zzso
