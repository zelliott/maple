zzso zzso zzso is an example of an unusual class of emerging zzso that gain an altered host range through genetic variation and subsequently become widespread pathogens of their new and previously resistant host zzso zzso was first detected in 1978 as the cause of new diseases in dogs throughout the world, when it rapidly spread throughout domestic zzso as well as becoming widespread in wild zzso zzso was soon shown to be a zzso of the long recognized zzso zzso virus zzso from which it differed in less than zzso at the zzso sequence zzso zzso analysis showed that virtually all of the biological differences between zzso and zzso including the canine host range, were determined by three or four sequence differences in the viral zzso protein zzso Analysis of the atomic structures of the zzso and zzso zzso showed that the differences controlling host range were located within two different structural regions and were exposed on the zzso zzso The zzso which first emerged in 1978 appeared to be derived from a single ancestral zzso which has allowed the ready analysis of the subsequent evolution of the virus in zzso zzso analysis has also revealed that zzso strains have undergone a series of evolutionary selections in nature which have resulted in the global distribution of new virus zzso This was first seen in the global replacement between 1979 and 1981 of the original zzso strain of the virus by a genetically and zzso zzso strain, and the subsequent widespread selection of other zzso which have also become globally zzso The genetic and zzso variation in the virus strains was also correlated with changes in the host range of the virus, in particular in the ability to replicate in zzso and in canine host range differences seen in tissue culture zzso
