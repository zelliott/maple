A method for preparation of zzso zzso derivatives of zzso sugar chains from zzso was zzso A zzso containing zzso Gal beta zzso was prepared from zzso and treated with zzso zzso followed by zzso of free zzso zzso Sugar chains released were zzso with improved reaction conditions and excess zzso were removed by gel zzso Gal beta zzso obtained together with zzso as a zzso was zzso by zzso zzso for the zzso treatment were investigated and the treatment at 40 degrees C for 350 h gave the best results for releasing zzso sugar zzso The total yield of Gal beta zzso from the zzso was zzso under the established conditions and that of zzso was zzso The present method was applied to a zzso and the expected zzso sugar chains were zzso Under these conditions, zzso sugar chains were also zzso
