zzso disease zzso response to intravenous zzso zzso therapy, and associated coronary artery disease progression have been associated with genetic zzso in zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso However, it is not known whether the existing gene copy number zzso zzso relates to zzso treatment response, zzso or associated zzso 

The copy number of individuals with zzso zzso and their family members zzso for three variable zzso was assessed using zzso We performed the transmission zzso test to examine the association of zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and used zzso zzso models to determine its association with zzso treatment zzso 

zzso and zzso zzso were significantly associated with zzso zzso zzso response was associated with zzso variations of zzso in zzso and zzso in Hispanics, and gene risk score based on single zzso zzso and zzso in zzso were significantly different between zzso zzso and zzso among zzso We found no significant associations between coronary artery disease and any of the zzso copy zzso 

zzso of zzso and zzso influences zzso treatment response and zzso individuals to zzso providing potential insights into understanding the mechanism of the zzso gene family in the zzso zzso
