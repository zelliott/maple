A zzso symbiotic zzso was isolated from hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was identified by zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA analysis as a zzso zzso zzso zzso The isolated zzso was able to use methanol as the sole source of carbon and energy, which is a specific attribute of the zzso zzso The zzso in pure culture was shown to degrade the toxic explosives zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was fully transformed in less than 10 zzso zzso included the reduction derivatives zzso and zzso No significant release of zzso was recorded from zzso In addition, the isolated zzso was shown to transform zzso (20 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in less than 40 zzso After 55 days of zzso zzso of initial zzso and zzso of initial zzso were zzso into zzso The zzso remaining in solution accounted for zzso and zzso of initial zzso and zzso zzso zzso detected from zzso transformation included a zzso zzso zzso and a polar compound tentatively identified as zzso Since members of the zzso zzso are distributed in a wide diversity of natural environments and are very often associated with plants, zzso zzso strain zzso may be involved in natural zzso or in zzso zzso (including zzso of zzso zzso
