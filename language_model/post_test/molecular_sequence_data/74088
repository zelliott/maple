zzso field zzso of avian infectious zzso virus zzso were recovered from commercial chicken flocks in Korea between 2003 and 2006 and were characterized zzso by zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso Our zzso analysis revealed that recent field zzso of zzso formed at least three distinct zzso types, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso type zzso consisted of zzso 13 zzso zzso which evolved from the zzso strain and then separated into the lineages of type zzso and type zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were closely related to zzso zzso zzso from China and zzso The zzso type isolate zzso first identified by this study, was closely related to enteric zzso zzso from the Chinese strains that cause zzso zzso comparisons showed zzso acid differences of zzso between zzso zzso The molecular zzso characteristics of zzso field zzso are briefly zzso
