The ability to undergo zzso previously thought to be exclusive to zzso organisms, has been demonstrated in zzso zzso On the basis of an observation that zzso zzso zzso were seen in zzso after zzso in media containing an zzso drug, we attempted to determine whether zzso zzso has the ability to undergo zzso By use of either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso in zzso asexual stages was evident by the observation of DNA fragmentation and disruption of zzso zzso zzso Next, we sought to determine whether zzso produces specific zzso zzso that can induce zzso We hypothesized that the 2 zzso proteins present in the zzso zzso contained features typical of downstream execution steps and upstream signaling pathways such zzso zzso and domain zzso We report that one of the zzso zzso zzso in addition to a universally zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso required for zzso activity, contains a putative zzso recruitment domain in the zzso zzso acid zzso This putative zzso zzso zzso protein has been designated zzso Our findings offer important insights into zzso survival strategies that could open new ways for therapeutic alternatives to drug zzso
