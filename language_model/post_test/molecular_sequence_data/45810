The zzso zzso zzso zzso is an important model zzso in zzso and gene amplification research, but up to now a limited amount of data regarding DNA sequences and molecular aspects of this species is zzso Considering the importance of going further on the DNA zzso biological meaning, we proposed to generate zzso sequences from a DNA library constructed from zzso zzso After their categorization in gene zzso terms, they were used to construct an zzso zzso that represents a general view of the zzso zzso zzso status in an important phase of zzso development: the spinning of communal zzso In this phase occurs the last zzso DNA replication cycle zzso with the specific zzso amplification related to protein zzso
