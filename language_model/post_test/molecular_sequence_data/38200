zzso zzso zzso in zzso requires as zzso small nuclear zzso zzso U2, zzso zzso and zzso in addition to the spliced leader zzso zzso To allow a zzso comparison and functional analysis of zzso zzso zzso we have cloned the zzso gene for the zzso zzso zzso zzso In addition, a putative zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso was identified by database zzso Using an zzso expression system, we introduced zzso into the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso which is the putative binding site for the common proteins that are present in each of the zzso zzso As demonstrated by zzso density zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso in core zzso zzso Furthermore, we present evidence by cell zzso that zzso zzso with zzso zzso are partially defective in zzso zzso Taken together this indicates that the zzso site of zzso zzso is responsible for stable core zzso assembly and nuclear zzso
