The zzso cap structure zzso (where N is any zzso is a ubiquitous feature of cellular zzso zzso The cap is zzso as it is involved in translation, zzso zzso zzso and stabilization of zzso against zzso zzso zzso The cap binding zzso zzso initiation factor zzso zzso is a translation initiation factor that binds to the cap structure and is part of a complex zzso that promotes zzso binding to zzso zzso of zzso in zzso results in cell zzso To test the hypothesis that some of the biological effects of zzso might be zzso by a nuclear function, we determined the cellular distribution of zzso By means of indirect zzso experiments using zzso and zzso zzso against zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso we demonstrate that a fraction of zzso zzso to the zzso These results suggest that zzso is also involved in a nuclear zzso
