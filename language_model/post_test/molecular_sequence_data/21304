zzso was first described about ten years ago as a gene expressed in zzso zzso A more recent study has suggested a role for zzso in zzso and development of zzso However, based on sequence analysis, we believe that zzso has zzso to zzso and hence we present the hypothesis that zzso is a zzso possessing zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso is a zzso protein zzso expressed in zzso hence in zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso reduces disease in a collagen zzso arthritis model in mice zzso Joint protection is evident by delayed disease zzso minimal zzso bone protection and absence of diverse zzso features of zzso zzso of genes typically associated with acute joint inflammation and erosion of cartilage or bone is blunted in the presence of zzso zzso with the observed reduction in bone zzso we demonstrate reduced levels of zzso in the zzso and zzso of mice zzso zzso Administration of zzso at the peak of disease, however, had no effect on disease zzso indicating that zzso zzso activity must be most prominent prior to or at the onset of severe joint zzso Based on this data we propose zzso as a zzso that s contributes to immune zzso zzso or in a zzso manner in the zzso
