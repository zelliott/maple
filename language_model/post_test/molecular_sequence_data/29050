zzso zzso is a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene revealed that it is zzso to that of zzso zzso zzso which is involved in the 3 (or zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso as in zzso zzso zzso the zzso gene responsible for zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso factors was zzso zzso zzso factors showed lower levels of zzso into the zzso zzso than those of zzso a polar effect of the zzso zzso into zzso over the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was zzso This zzso zzso produced zzso factors devoid of zzso groups, confirming that the zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso Neither the zzso nor the zzso zzso affected the ability of zzso to zzso several host plants, but both zzso reduced competitiveness to zzso zzso The zzso factors produced by strain zzso like those of other zzso zzso zzso lack zzso zzso By using specific zzso chain reaction zzso we zzso the zzso gene of zzso zzso strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso All the analyzed strains showed the same zzso zzso zzso that is present in the zzso zzso zzso From these results, it is concluded that, regardless of their geographical origin, zzso zzso strains carry the zzso region but that it is truncated by the same zzso zzso
