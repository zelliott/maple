zzso cell cycle progression depends on the proper integration of growth control pathways with the basic cell cycle zzso While many of the central molecules such as zzso zzso and zzso are known, and many of the zzso and zzso that modify the zzso have been identified, little is known about the additional layers of regulation that impinge upon these zzso To identify new regulators of cell zzso we have selected for human and zzso zzso that when zzso were capable of specifically overcoming zzso arrest signals from the cell cycle branch of the mating zzso pathway, while still maintaining the integrity of the zzso induction zzso We have identified 13 human zzso zzso cycle progression zzso genes and 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes that specifically block the zzso arrest by mating zzso The zzso genes represent a variety of zzso functions including a new zzso a tumor zzso binding zzso zzso zzso factors, translation factors, zzso zzso as well as novel zzso Several zzso genes require individual zzso to promote zzso resistance and those that require zzso increase the zzso levels of zzso zzso Moreover, several of the zzso zzso genes have overlapping functions with the human zzso zzso indicating a possible conservation of zzso
