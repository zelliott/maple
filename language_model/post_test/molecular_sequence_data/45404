Virtually no information regarding timing of deep lineage zzso within zzso family zzso exists, which poses an important problem in the zzso zzso To address this issue, the complete zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was assembled from both zzso and zzso sequences generated from transcripts of the zzso protein and zzso zzso Analysis of the transcript information allowed an improved zzso zzso revealing that the translation initiation zzso for the zzso gene is zzso rather than zzso longer zzso proposed in several other zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso transcripts begin with zzso and zzso zzso respectively, which apparently serve as the translation initiators for those zzso We used all the zzso zzso zzso gene sequences and three other publicly available zzso zzso zzso for the zzso of divergence time points within zzso The maximum likelihood date estimates for the splits between zzso and Aedes zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and between lineages within zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso genes are roughly twice as high as the dates based on zzso gene zzso Although existing evidence does not unequivocally favor one of the alternatives, zzso predictions of the age of the family zzso are in better agreement with dates zzso from zzso zzso
