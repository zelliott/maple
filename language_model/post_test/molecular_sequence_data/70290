The zzso zzso class of zzso zzso important in the establishment of many different cell zzso share two important zzso the ability to zzso with other members of this family and to bind DNA containing the loose consensus sequence zzso This study takes advantage of these shared characteristics to begin to address whether or not zzso proteins are present in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso using an zzso containing a zzso binding consensus sequence demonstrate that zzso proteins are present in extracts from adult zzso tissue and zzso cell lines and bind specifically to this zzso zzso extracts were also found to contain several factors which interact with Id zzso a negative regulator of zzso activity, in zzso zzso of zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso for Id is present in zzso cell lines but is absent in adult zzso zzso Together, these studies indicate that zzso proteins are present in zzso cells and their levels are zzso regulated in the separate cell zzso
