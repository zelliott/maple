A novel zzso strain, designated zzso was isolated from a soil sample collected from a cliff on Mara Island, zzso Republic of Korea, and subjected to a zzso zzso zzso The isolate produced zzso yellow zzso zzso and white aerial zzso that differentiated into straight or zzso chains of zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analyses showed that the zzso belonged to the family zzso and formed a tight cluster with the type strain of zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso zzso characteristics were consistent with its assignment to the zzso zzso in that the isolate had zzso acid as the diagnostic zzso acid in the cell wall, zzso as the characteristic sugar, zzso type of zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso as major zzso and a polar zzso profile containing zzso zzso zzso and unknown zzso zzso acids were not zzso The zzso fatty acids were zzso zzso and zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso DNA zzso of strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso data, strain zzso is assigned to a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed zzso strain zzso zzso zzso
