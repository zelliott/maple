Some zzso elements of the zzso zzso zzso zzso family have been previously identified in zzso One of them, located on zzso 7, contains a single complete open reading frame zzso zzso zzso an envelope zzso We have zzso investigated the zzso complexity and coding capacity of the zzso zzso The human zzso zzso contains at least 70, 100, and 30 zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions, respectively, widely and zzso dispersed among zzso Using in zzso zzso procedures, three putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were detected on zzso 3, 6, and 7, respectively, and their sequences zzso A zzso zzso acid gag zzso containing zzso and zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso No zzso zzso was found, but a pro sequence containing a zzso active site was zzso Finally, the previously described 538 zzso acid zzso zzso ORF, located on zzso 7, was shown to be unique and zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso of molecular mass identical to the one obtained by an in zzso zzso procedure were detected in human zzso using anti zzso zzso and zzso zzso The absence of an zzso zzso zzso versus the existence of zzso zzso and zzso proteins in healthy human zzso is discussed with respect to particle formation, zzso and zzso
