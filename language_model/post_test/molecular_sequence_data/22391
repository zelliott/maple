zzso genes zzso zzso factors that play a key role in specifying the body plan in zzso and are therefore essential in explaining patterns of evolutionary zzso As an ancient zzso group with diverse limb types, zzso are important for understanding the origin and diversification of limbs in land zzso We conducted a zzso survey in two species of each zzso order to identify zzso to zzso known to function in limb zzso Fifteen distinct zzso zzso genes and one zzso were identified, and the former confirm the existence of four zzso clusters in each zzso zzso Some genes expected to occur in all zzso based on the zzso zzso complement of zzso zzso and zzso were not recovered from our survey, and may have been zzso zzso is absent in frogs and possibly other zzso Considering its function in zzso development, the loss of this gene may be related to the absence of the fifth finger in frogs and zzso
