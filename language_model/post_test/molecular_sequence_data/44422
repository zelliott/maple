zzso in human zzso are associated with zzso zzso zzso zzso by skeletal zzso and zzso sex zzso During zzso in the zzso zzso is zzso with zzso the gene zzso zzso zzso the major cartilage zzso zzso zzso is therefore a candidate regulatory target of zzso Regulatory sequences required for zzso expression of the zzso collagen gene have been localized to zzso sequences in the first zzso in rats, mice and zzso We show here that zzso protein binds specifically to sequences in the first zzso of human zzso zzso of these sequences zzso zzso binding and zzso expression of a zzso reporter gene zzso in transgenic zzso Furthermore, zzso expression of zzso zzso both a zzso reporter gene and the zzso zzso gene in transgenic zzso These results demonstrate that zzso expression is directly regulated by zzso protein in zzso and zzso abnormal regulation of zzso zzso zzso as a cause of the skeletal abnormalities associated with zzso zzso
