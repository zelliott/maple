zzso a major zzso protein of rapidly growing zzso cells, has been thought to be predominantly if not exclusively located in the zzso Recent data however zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1989) Cell 56, zzso suggest that the protein zzso constantly between the nucleus and zzso zzso zzso studies of whole cell extracts of zzso cells identified, in addition to the LDL zzso another LDL binding protein of Mr zzso The zzso protein was partially zzso by zzso and, like the LDL zzso bound zzso and zzso zzso but not zzso However, unlike the LDL zzso the zzso protein bound zzso in the presence of zzso and reducing agents, had a lower affinity for zzso than the LDL zzso and did not react with two zzso raised against the LDL zzso The protein sequences of three separate peptides derived from the partially zzso zzso species were determined and were identical except for one zzso to three separate regions of the published sequence of zzso On zzso analysis the zzso protein reacted with a zzso zzso and zzso zzso reacted both with zzso zzso and with zzso When intact zzso cells were treated with zzso before harvest, there was a zzso decrease in zzso protein while recovery of zzso an zzso zzso was zzso When intact zzso cells were surface zzso and the proteins subjected to zzso zzso the zzso protein was found to be zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
