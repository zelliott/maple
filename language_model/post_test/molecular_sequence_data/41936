The zzso zzso protein zzso constitutes the most zzso protein present in all organisms that is known to zzso Based on global alignment of zzso sequences from organisms representing all three zzso numerous sequence signatures that are specific for zzso and zzso zzso have been zzso zzso from the two zzso species examined zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been found to contain all zzso but no zzso signature zzso Based on several novel features of the zzso family of proteins zzso presence of tandem repeats of a zzso zzso zzso sequence and structural similarity between the first and second zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso half of zzso to the bacterial zzso zzso presence of a zzso insert of zzso zzso in all zzso except those from zzso and zzso zzso a model for the evolution of zzso gene from an early stage is zzso The zzso zzso from zzso and zzso bacteria lacking the insert in the zzso zzso are indicated to be the ancestral form of the zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso sequence data zzso by zzso zzso maximum zzso and maximum likelihood zzso provide evidence that zzso are not zzso and show a close evolutionary linkage with the zzso zzso These results do not support the traditional zzso tree, where a close relationship between zzso and zzso zzso is zzso To explain the zzso based on zzso and other gene zzso a model for the origin of zzso cells involving fusion between zzso and zzso zzso is zzso
