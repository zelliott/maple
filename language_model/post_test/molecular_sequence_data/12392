We have cloned and expressed zzso zzso consisting of the zzso zzso of human zzso spliced to its zzso zzso This truncated zzso 28 zzso zzso retained the distinctive zzso activities of the larger zzso Replacement of M zzso followed by M zzso permitted subsequent zzso by zzso chemical zzso (in zzso zzso without zzso any of the zzso characteristic zzso zzso of zzso zzso occurs by limited zzso the newly zzso highly zzso zzso zzso forms a salt bridge with an zzso zzso immediately upstream of the active site zzso The role of both of these elements in zzso zzso was zzso using protein engineering and zzso zzso to alter the length and zzso acid composition of the zzso and to replace the zzso All modifications affected both zzso and zzso The results identify some structural parameters of the zzso required for zzso zzso
