We test the hypothesis that naturally occurring zzso zzso in the Delta zzso of the zzso signaling zzso contribute to standing variation in zzso and/or abdominal bristle number in zzso zzso for both a large cohort of zzso flies and previously described laboratory zzso We zzso the transcribed region of Delta for 16 naturally occurring zzso and 65 zzso including 7 zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and 6 additional common zzso all located in zzso 6 and the 3' zzso were zzso in zzso zzso flies using an zzso methodology and zzso in 38 additional natural zzso via DNA zzso None of the zzso zzso were significantly associated with natural variation in bristle number as assessed by a zzso zzso A zzso upper bound on the additive genetic zzso attributable to each zzso zzso in the large natural cohort is zzso of the total zzso zzso zzso suggest that two previously detected zzso associations between bristle number and zzso in the zzso of Delta cannot be explained by linkage zzso between these zzso and nearby zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso more zzso explain previous zzso
