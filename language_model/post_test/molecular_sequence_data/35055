The zzso causing the zzso color type zzso is one of the most used zzso zzso within American mink zzso zzso fur farming, since it is involved in some of the popular color types such as zzso and Saphire which originate from a combination of zzso zzso In the present study, the zzso and zzso sequences of the zzso zzso gene were studied in zzso zzso and zzso zzso mink zzso Although breeding schemes and previous literature indicates that the zzso zzso zzso is a triple zzso color type involving the same locus as the zzso zzso color type, our findings indicate different zzso at the zzso zzso Upon comparison at zzso level, we identified two deletions of the entire zzso 7 and of the zzso end of zzso 8 in the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso When investigating the zzso the zzso animals completely lack zzso 8, which encodes 65 zzso of which 47 define the zzso Va zzso binding zzso This may cause the incorrect zzso of the zzso protein to zzso in zzso animals, resulting in an improper pigmentation as seen in diluted zzso Additionally, in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso part of zzso 8 is retained resulting in a truncated zzso zzso which is zzso zzso long in zzso and zzso and zzso zzso long in zzso zzso our findings point out that the missing zzso domain, in neither of the 3 analyzed zzso affects the transport of zzso or the zzso final zzso Moreover, the loss of the major part of the zzso domain in the zzso zzso protein seems to be the responsible for the dilute zzso Based on our zzso DNA data, genetic tests for selecting zzso and zzso carrier animals can be performed in American zzso
