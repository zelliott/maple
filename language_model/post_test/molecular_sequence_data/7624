To analyze zzso processing of zzso zzso zzso two zzso were generated in the presumed zzso zzso zzso in the predicted zzso zzso region of the human zzso virus zzso The zzso changed either the presumed zzso zzso acid zzso to a zzso incompetent zzso or the adjacent zzso to a zzso found in most cellular and zzso zzso at this zzso Both zzso were cloned into the full-length infectious zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso directed the synthesis of particles with similar infectious zzso while the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells revealed identical patterns for the zzso and for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells expressed only a single zzso zzso of 78 zzso instead of the zzso zzso found in zzso or zzso zzso Analysis with zzso zzso yielded a protein of approximately 120 zzso zzso with zzso against zzso but not zzso zzso No zzso zzso was detected in this zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso cells showed zzso particle zzso in the case of the zzso zzso with particles of normal appearance and particles of zzso size and zzso These results indicate that zzso viruses have an zzso zzso that is essential for zzso but not for formation of the zzso Pol zzso
