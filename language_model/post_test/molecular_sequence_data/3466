zzso of zzso zzso receptors can be regulated by sequence in the beta zzso second zzso domain zzso The incorporation of a zzso zzso which contains sequence from the muscle beta zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso positions of the zzso zzso zzso increases the loss of zzso responsiveness after the application of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso an zzso partial zzso zzso of zzso responsiveness following zzso exposure may occur through either an enhancement of zzso increased channel block by an zzso or alternatively via zzso zzso Although zzso produces very little zzso of either zzso or zzso zzso zzso shows an enhanced zzso zzso zzso of zzso receptors compared with zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso zzso previously identified as zzso shows increased zzso of zzso receptors compared with zzso receptors (as related to zzso zzso but with no significant increase in zzso zzso The interaction between the binding of local zzso and the functional zzso produced by these zzso was zzso The binding of the local zzso to their zzso sites does not affect zzso effects of zzso and zzso However, zzso can protect zzso function from the zzso effects of other zzso suggesting that zzso as well as zzso that cause zzso may be binding to an zzso site, either promoting or zzso channel zzso The ability of zzso to protect zzso function from zzso zzso may point toward valuable new combination drug zzso
