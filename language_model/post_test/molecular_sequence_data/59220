Novel genes that functionally complement the growth of zzso zzso zzso strain of zzso coli zzso have been cloned from the marine zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence revealed three open reading zzso The second gene was zzso to zzso gene and allowed the growth of zzso zzso strain of zzso coli zzso zzso in the absence of zzso The first and third zzso but not zzso were required for the growth of zzso in a synthetic medium containing 10 zzso zzso and 100 zzso zzso Since zzso zzso activity of zzso was restored by the introduction of these zzso these two genes were considered to be directly related to zzso zzso zzso genes were found in zzso coli, but their functions have not been zzso
