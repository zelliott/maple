In the present study, we obtained and characterized partially a zzso zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso This zzso recognized the zzso by both zzso and western zzso and was able to inhibit its zzso activity in zzso Moreover, the zzso fragments zzso products of zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso retained almost the same zzso zzso We determined the binding site by zzso synthetic peptides containing sequences from different zzso regions of the zzso were confronted to the zzso zzso The zzso recognized by the zzso zzso was located on zzso zzso zzso and an analysis of zzso obtained with the zzso zzso suggests that the zzso spans the sequence zzso zzso zzso of the zzso This zzso is located within zzso 6, next to loop 6, an essential active loop during zzso The zzso did not recognize zzso zzso from man and zzso definitive and zzso hosts of zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, it did not bind to the zzso site, since kinetic analysis demonstrated that zzso had a zzso zzso
