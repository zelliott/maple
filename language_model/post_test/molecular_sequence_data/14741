Among 33 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene is naturally a unique and self-sufficient zzso Since the native zzso gene could not be expressed well in zzso coli, its expression was attempted using zzso synthetic zzso The gene was successfully zzso and the zzso zzso was functionally active, showing a zzso peak at 450 zzso in the reduced CO difference zzso zzso isolated from the zzso domain showed the same zzso in thin layer zzso separation as the authentic zzso zzso of the zzso specificity of zzso based on zzso zzso rate revealed that it zzso the zzso of saturated and zzso fatty acids with very good zzso similar to other zzso families depending on zzso zzso In particular, zzso zzso the rapid zzso of zzso acid with a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso models of zzso based on other members of the zzso family allowed us to alter zzso specificity to aromatic compounds such as zzso Interestingly, replacement of zzso in the active site increased zzso activity for zzso with a zzso value of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
