zzso is the major zzso zzso in most zzso cells and belongs to the zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso the exclusion of zzso from the zzso zzso is an essential zzso While the exclusion requires binding of the zzso region to zzso zzso zzso the detailed specific nature of the interaction between zzso and zzso proteins is zzso We have characterized the zzso properties of the zzso zzso region, consisting of 124 zzso acid zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso equilibrium and zzso studies of zzso revealed that the zzso zzso zzso exists in a zzso and extended form in zzso The crystal structure of the complex between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso domain and the zzso zzso region zzso reveals that the zzso region of the zzso binds zzso C of the zzso zzso zzso lacks the zzso sequence for zzso binding found in the zzso zzso zzso complex but possesses two zzso zzso zzso that dock into the zzso pocket of zzso C without forming a zzso The zzso site on zzso is overlapped with the functional nuclear zzso signal zzso Our structure suggests that regulation of zzso binding may be coupled with regulated zzso zzso of zzso followed by the nuclear transfer of the zzso zzso
