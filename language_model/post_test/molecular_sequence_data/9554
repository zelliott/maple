An artificial gene consisting of seven copies of an zzso zzso sequence arranged in a tandem was zzso and inserted downstream of the zzso zzso gene in a zzso zzso The corresponding fusion protein zzso contained 16 zzso zzso and formed inclusion bodies when expressed in zzso zzso The standard protocol involving zzso of the fusion protein and its zzso zzso on a zzso zzso was not effective because of a very low yield of the zzso zzso Attempts to perform a zzso of the zzso part of the fusion protein in solution were also unsuccessful because of a high level of protein zzso zzso of zzso zzso is known to increase a zzso of proteins and zzso Therefore we suggested a zzso approach that combines zzso of inclusion bodies and zzso of a hybrid zzso The fusion protein was completely reduced and zzso in zzso zzso at pH zzso in the presence of sodium zzso and sodium zzso The zzso protein was loaded onto a zzso column, an efficient zzso was induced by a pH shift from zzso to zzso and seven successively connected zzso zzso units were zzso The zzso was subjected to zzso yielding zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso as described previously and treated by zzso B to form the zzso zzso The target zzso zzso was then zzso via zzso zzso zzso Using this approach 6 zzso of zzso zzso can be obtained from 1 g of zzso
