Two zzso zzso directed against a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso band zzso were used to isolate zzso clones from a zzso zzso expression zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso were highly similar, with sizes ranging between zzso and zzso zzso In addition, a full-length zzso insert of zzso zzso was obtained by zzso zzso On Northern zzso a single zzso species of zzso zzso was detected by a zzso zzso Southern zzso zzso suggests that the gene is present as a single zzso The zzso sequence of the full-length clone contains a single reading frame with a coding capacity of zzso zzso The hypothetical zzso consists of a putative zzso signal zzso followed by a zzso domain of unknown function, and the mature protein zzso After zzso the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso a partial zzso zzso acid sequence was zzso Thus, the identity of the zzso sequence was zzso The deduced sequence of the mature protein is predominantly zzso and rich in zzso zzso Database searching suggested weak zzso of the hypothetical zzso to plasma zzso zzso and blood zzso zzso
