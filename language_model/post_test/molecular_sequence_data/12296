zzso is the zzso binding protein of the zzso zzso transport system of zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso as a zzso zzso on a zzso zzso The zzso zzso for zzso zzso were estimated from the zzso decrease in the intrinsic zzso intensity of zzso and were found to be zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso A, zzso B, and zzso zzso which are poorly taken up via the zzso system, displayed zzso zzso of 79, 36, and 42 zzso zzso These are the first estimated zzso zzso reported for a binding protein of a microbial iron transport zzso zzso impaired in the interaction of zzso zzso with zzso were zzso One zzso zzso with a zzso zzso at position 68 zzso differed from zzso zzso in transport activity in that zzso zzso supported promotion of growth of the zzso on zzso zzso while zzso was nearly zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso were higher for zzso than for zzso zzso and lower for zzso zzso zzso zzso than for zzso zzso zzso Another zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a weak response to zzso and zzso and exhibited zzso zzso two- to zzso higher than that of zzso zzso zzso of zzso with the zzso membrane transport protein zzso was studied by determining protection of zzso degradation by zzso and zzso K and by zzso zzso zzso and zzso loaded with zzso specifically prevented degradation of zzso and were zzso to zzso zzso loaded with zzso and also zzso free of zzso were able to interact with zzso
