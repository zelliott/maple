zzso b and zzso zzso sequences were used to study patterns of molecular evolution and zzso relationships between the zzso and the zzso which are thought to form two closely related zzso zzso zzso Our analyses used 34 complete zzso b and 22 partial zzso sequences from the zzso domain I of the zzso representing 20 zzso species (15 zzso and 12 zzso species (5 zzso We performed zzso maximum likelihood, and distance analyses to resolve these zzso zzso In this data set, zzso analyses gave results similar to those of global zzso All of our molecular zzso analyses indicated that the zzso and zzso arose through a rapid radiation, making it difficult to establish higher level zzso However, we were able to establish six major lineages containing zzso and zzso zzso including one lineage containing both zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso This result, supported by maximum likelihood tests, indicated that the zzso and zzso do not form independent zzso zzso
