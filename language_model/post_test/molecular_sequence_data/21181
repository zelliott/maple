The presence of green fluorescent protein zzso within the zzso system of zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso shortly after the discovery of zzso in zzso Despite the enormous success of zzso zzso as a genetically zzso fluorescent label, zzso zzso thus far has been defeating attempts to clone it from the zzso life cycle zzso Here, we report cloning of three zzso fluorescent proteins zzso from zzso zzso representing zzso green, and yellow spectral zzso Such color diversity has never been detected outside class zzso suggesting a more general function for zzso zzso in zzso than has been previously zzso An unusual property of the new zzso is the formation of large soluble complexes of zzso sizes and molecular zzso corresponding to up to 128 individual zzso This zzso well with the earlier observation that zzso in zzso unlike in zzso is localized within zzso zzso which zzso further inquiry into the zzso properties of the new zzso and their interactions with the zzso The discovery of zzso zzso fills the zzso gap in the knowledge of zzso zzso and provides experimental material to further investigate the details of its molecular zzso
