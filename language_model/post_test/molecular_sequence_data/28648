In zzso the genetic locus zzso is essential for all zzso cell zzso Within this region are the genes for three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These proteins are zzso regulated and their expression tightly associated with cell death in the developing fly zzso When zzso expressed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso cause zzso and eye zzso They have a short region of similarity at their zzso through which they can interact with inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso and it is by zzso zzso zzso of zzso that zzso zzso and zzso promote cell zzso The observation that zzso zzso and zzso can interact with zzso zzso and induce zzso in zzso cells suggested that zzso zzso zzso might also zzso zzso identified six years after the first description of a zzso zzso zzso is the only zzso protein identified to date that is clearly functionally related to the zzso zzso Since its discovery, there have been numerous studies investigating how zzso interacts with zzso and promotes cell zzso Here we review what is currently known about zzso and speculate on other zzso zzso zzso
