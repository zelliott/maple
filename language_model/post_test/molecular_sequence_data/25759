In this paper we report the zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso as determined from the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence with that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed long stretches of zzso sequence zzso than zzso zzso which contributed to an overall sequence identity of zzso The circular zzso zzso zzso profiles, and calculated secondary structural elements of the two zzso suggest that they may have very similar zzso structures as zzso A comparison made between the zzso acid sequence of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso with other known protein sequences revealed zzso concentrated in three stretches of zzso to a mechanistically related zzso zzso I of the zzso coli zzso sugar zzso system zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso these three stretches of sequence constitute the site for zzso binding and zzso and a possible site for the regulation of zzso activity and zzso the zzso sequences exist in a third mechanistically related zzso zzso zzso
