zzso zzso involves either the zzso exchange of nearly identical zzso regions or the direct zzso zzso and zzso of processed DNA zzso These mechanisms are involved in repairing potentially lethal or zzso DNA damage and generating genetic diversity within the zzso cell population and zzso zzso We report here the identification of a mouse zzso termed zzso for mouse zzso 1, which encodes a approximately 92 zzso protein that shares zzso to proteins of the zzso zzso family, most notably human zzso to 3' zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso proteins and zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene maps to zzso zzso 1, consistent with the recent mapping of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene to zzso zzso zzso is expressed prominently in zzso an area of active zzso zzso and zzso a prominent zzso zzso An increased level of zzso zzso was observed during a stage of zzso development where cells that are actively involved in zzso zzso arise first and represent a significant proportion of the germ cell zzso Comparative evaluation of the expression patterns of the human and mouse zzso combined with previous zzso and zzso genetic studies, indicate that the zzso proteins are important contributors to zzso processing during zzso DNA repair and zzso
