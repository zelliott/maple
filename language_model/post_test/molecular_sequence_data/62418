Since the zzso of human zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso zzso zzso zzso using known zzso site zzso zzso would allow the identification or zzso of different zzso Five populations of human zzso zzso zzso obtained from Japan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Germany, and Thailand were subjected to zzso analysis by using seven kinds of zzso zzso Ninety-nine out of 102 zzso were identified as one of the known zzso while one isolate from Thailand showed two distinct zzso and two zzso from Japan were negative with all the zzso zzso The most dominant zzso among four zzso except for all four zzso from zzso was zzso 3 and it varied from zzso to zzso The second most common zzso among four populations was either zzso 1 zzso or zzso 4 zzso zzso 2, zzso 5, and/or zzso 7 were only rarely detected among the zzso from Japan and Germany, while zzso 6 was not zzso The zzso position of the two zzso which were negative with all zzso zzso was zzso from the small zzso zzso zzso zzso genes with the known sequence data of 20 zzso zzso Since the two zzso were positioned in an additional zzso in the zzso tree, this suggested they were a new zzso These results demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso is a powerful tool with which to zzso zzso of zzso zzso obtained from clinical zzso In addition, two groups of the zzso from 15 symptomatic and 11 zzso patients in Bangladesh were compared with the zzso zzso zzso Since both groups were only classified into two distinct zzso of zzso 1 or zzso 3 and no statistically significant difference was observed between the two groups, in this study it could not be shown that the specific zzso correlated with the zzso potential of zzso zzso
