Recent findings showed that zzso zzso structurally zzso yet energetically higher zzso states is sufficient to trigger the formation of protein zzso Typically, these zzso states are made available through changing zzso conditions or introducing zzso Here we show a novel way to zzso zzso formation for Chicken egg white zzso zzso under native conditions via controlled zzso zzso Through a cassette of zzso zzso the two terminal zzso bonds in zzso can be selectively zzso The reduced zzso is then converted to zzso states with the zzso zzso floppy upon zzso zzso These states serve as precursors for the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso are stabilized by zzso zzso bonds instead of zzso zzso structures, distinct from the zzso zzso zzso reported zzso Based on the experimental zzso and zzso molecular dynamics zzso we proposed a zzso zzso model for the structure of the zzso zzso in which each zzso zzso swaps the zzso zzso into the complementary position of the adjacent zzso along the zzso We anticipate that this zzso mechanism can be extended to many other zzso zzso Our study stands for the first example of formation of protein zzso under native conditions upon zzso zzso and poses the potential danger of low zzso dose to organisms at the protein zzso
