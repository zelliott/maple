zzso zzso is an inflammatory skin disease characterized by excessively increased zzso zzso Several lines of evidence support the idea that T cells zzso zzso skin zzso play a vital role in the zzso of the zzso To establish whether zzso zzso and zzso of T zzso reflect a specific local immune response, the zzso zzso variable zzso zzso region gene usage was studied in chronic zzso zzso normal skin, and paired blood zzso By zzso zzso we found that zzso of either or both V beta 2 and V beta 6 gene families characterized the zzso zzso of normal skin and zzso skin zzso However, sequence analysis of the zzso region 3 zzso of these V beta gene families demonstrated a marked zzso zzso only in zzso zzso not in normal skin or in blood zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso clones revealed that certain zzso zzso motifs were shared by different zzso A second biopsy taken from one of the psoriasis patients 18 zzso later from a different anatomical site disclosed that the same zzso clones were again zzso These data suggest that zzso zzso T zzso expressing the prevailing zzso V beta genes represent an zzso T cell subset that expanded from a few zzso T cells in response to zzso in the skin of psoriasis zzso They are derived from a zzso T cell population that, by the expression of V beta 2 or V beta 6 zzso appears to be predisposed for zzso to the zzso
