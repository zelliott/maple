zzso is the main zzso influenza A virus circulating in human and zzso population, and has long been a threat to economy and public zzso 

To explore the genetic correlation between current circulating zzso zzso and human influenza zzso 

Three new zzso zzso influenza viruses zzso were isolated and zzso sequencing were conducted followed by zzso and molecular analysis of all zzso and human zzso influenza viruses isolated in China in the past five zzso 

zzso and zzso analysis revealed that the three zzso possessed different zzso the zzso of zzso was closely related to that of classical zzso zzso while zzso was a zzso with zzso gene from the zzso zzso influenza virus and other genes from the classical zzso zzso and zzso fell into a lineage of seasonal human zzso influenza zzso zzso 2009 zzso influenza A viruses zzso zzso in China were zzso to the zzso lineages rather than the seasonal zzso human influenza zzso zzso Furthermore, molecular analysis among human and zzso influenza viruses provided more detail information for understanding their genetic zzso 

These results suggested that in China in the past five years, the classical, zzso and zzso zzso zzso existed in zzso zzso and the zzso between zzso zzso and zzso human influenza viruses was zzso In addition, the present data showed no evidence to support a strong correlation between the 2009 zzso and the zzso influenza virus circulating in zzso
