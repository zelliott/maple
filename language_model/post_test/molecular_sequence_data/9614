A zzso clone zzso with the human zzso Y zzso zzso has been isolated from a mouse brain zzso zzso Analysis of the predicted zzso acid sequence indicates that the zzso zzso by this zzso is zzso and zzso identical to the human and rat zzso zzso respectively, but has a repeat sequence of zzso acid zzso unlike the human and rat zzso zzso in its zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that the mouse zzso zzso zzso was highly expressed in the brain, but not in the heart, zzso zzso zzso liver, skeletal muscle, and zzso A zzso DNA clone zzso the mouse zzso zzso has also been cloned and used as a probe for zzso in zzso zzso zzso The mouse zzso zzso gene consists of at least two zzso with a zzso zzso zzso sequence and is localized in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso partial sequencing, and zzso analysis of the mouse zzso and zzso zzso genes were used to determine the relationship between the two genes in the zzso zzso zzso The mouse zzso zzso gene can map about 10 zzso upstream of the zzso initiation sites of the zzso zzso gene with an opposite zzso
