The zzso analysis of three zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso zzso in the zzso trachea zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso where zzso represents zzso is inactive as zzso and zzso in this zzso In zzso the zzso results cannot be interpreted as being consistent with a single zzso However, the combined interpretation of results from zzso zzso restrained molecular dynamics simulations with application of zzso distance information from zzso zzso and pharmacological results leads to a reduced number of zzso zzso for each zzso which can be compared with each other and may be classified as responsible for their biological zzso Trying to match the zzso zzso approximately with regular zzso and zzso we find a gamma zzso at the position of the zzso occurring in all zzso For the active peptides 1 and 2 we arrive at an inverse gamma zzso at zzso and beta zzso or beta zzso with zzso and zzso at the corner positions, these zzso having a similar zzso with respect to the linking zzso zzso Other zzso zzso common to only 1 and 2 support their zzso as responsible for the biological zzso
