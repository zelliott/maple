zzso is effective in suppressing replication of zzso B virus zzso However, the emergence of zzso zzso resistant to zzso is a zzso zzso resistance has been attributed mainly to a substitution of zzso or zzso for zzso at zzso 550 zzso or zzso in the zzso site of the virus zzso A substitution of zzso for zzso at zzso 526 zzso has also been zzso To examine such virus zzso zzso in Japanese patients, we studied five patients with chronic zzso B, who showed zzso breakthrough while on a zzso zzso zzso The entire zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of the proposed reverse zzso domain of the zzso gene were determined on zzso DNA amplified by zzso chain reaction from patient zzso collected at the start and at the end of zzso The zzso sequences from all five patients were of zzso zzso In four patients, a substitution of zzso or zzso for zzso at zzso zzso which has not been reported zzso emerged in combination with zzso One also zzso zzso In the remaining patient, an zzso of zzso to zzso at zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso study of the zzso showed that the two or three zzso in each patient emerged almost simultaneously 4 weeks before or at the time of breakthrough and were replaced by zzso virus after completing the zzso Our results indicate that occurrence of zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso in combination with zzso is frequent in Japanese or zzso C zzso zzso patients who develop resistance to zzso
