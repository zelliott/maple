The solution structure of zzso zzso from zzso zzso to zzso has been solved in order to gain insights into the mechanisms of its interactions with other zzso The structure reveals a zzso similar to several common scaffolds for zzso zzso in the absence of significant sequence similarity to these zzso zzso surface zzso acid zzso are clustered on two main surface areas, which are likely involved in zzso interactions between zzso and other zzso The zzso zzso has been shown to be involved in at least three zzso zzso end joining, transcription, and zzso zzso and thus it needs to interact with different proteins involved in these different zzso The three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso domain and the availability of zzso chemical shift assignments provide a basis for further investigation of the interactions between zzso and other proteins in these zzso cellular zzso
