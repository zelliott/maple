The production of functional zzso zzso complexes involves extensive zzso processing by zzso zzso In this study, we characterized the viral main zzso zzso of the type species, White zzso virus zzso of the newly established zzso zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis and zzso data confirmed that the zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that uses a zzso zzso zzso embedded in a predicted zzso fold, which is extended by a third domain at its C zzso zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso released itself from zzso sequences and was able to mediate zzso processing in zzso Using zzso sequencing of zzso processing products we tentatively identified zzso zzso as a zzso consensus zzso zzso data provided evidence to suggest that two zzso His and zzso zzso are part of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, we observed two zzso and two zzso zzso sites in the bacterial expression zzso The detection of two major forms of zzso resulting from processing at two different zzso and one zzso site, in zzso zzso zzso zzso cells confirmed the biological relevance of the zzso data obtained in zzso expression zzso To our knowledge, the use of alternative zzso zzso sites has not been described previously for other zzso zzso zzso The data presented in this study lend further support to our previous conclusion that zzso represent a distinct group of viruses that significantly zzso from other zzso clusters of the order zzso
