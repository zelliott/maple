The zzso zzso zzso recognizes the sequence zzso and zzso the inner zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso recognizes the same sequence but zzso the outer zzso zzso Both zzso have the usual architecture of 10 zzso motifs surrounding a variable region, responsible for sequence specific recognition, that is quite different in the two zzso We have constructed hybrids between these two zzso and studied their zzso zzso A hybrid containing the variable region and zzso sequences from zzso zzso the outer zzso zzso A second hybrid identical to the first except that the variable region derives from the zzso zzso the inner zzso zzso Thus the choice of base to be zzso within the recognition sequence is determined by the variable zzso
