zzso B virus zzso infection is the main factor, which zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso high-risk area, zzso To prevent zzso infection is the most important strategy to inhibit the zzso zzso A large project was performed in zzso area to protect newborn babies from the zzso infection that zzso children born between 1984 and 1990 were zzso After three times of follow-up studies, 15 screened children were found to have symptoms of illness showing persistent zzso of serum zzso zzso zzso From these previously collected data, we found that the zzso levels of five zzso with negative zzso B surface zzso zzso were significantly higher than those of 10 zzso with positive zzso Furthermore, with the passage of time, the difference of zzso levels between the two groups zzso negative and positive zzso zzso After cloning and sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso coding zzso we found that zzso in zzso zzso were correlated with the absence of zzso zzso while no zzso were seen in the zzso positive zzso We also found that majority of point zzso were occurred in the coding sequences of the first loop structure in zzso zzso The structure of double loop zzso in zzso zzso was conservative, and important for zzso zzso These changes in a double loop zzso would escape zzso by zzso zzso
