We describe the cloning of a human zzso named zzso zzso a new putative zzso zzso sharing zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso and zzso identity with zzso It displays four zzso zzso that are zzso among all other zzso zzso zzso transcripts were detected by Northern zzso in the T zzso cell lines zzso and zzso but not in the zzso zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso transcripts were also detected by reverse zzso and zzso chain reaction analysis in zzso zzso and zzso T cells and zzso cells prepared from peripheral zzso The zzso zzso was performed by radiation hybrid mapping and testing of a panel of zzso artificial zzso zzso This allowed the assignment of the zzso zzso gene to the zzso region of human zzso 3, in close proximity with the functionally characterized zzso Future work is required to identify the zzso of this new zzso zzso and to define its role in the recruitment of white blood cell zzso
