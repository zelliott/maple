zzso of protein synthesis on the zzso disease virus zzso occurs at two sites, thus, two forms of the leader zzso termed Lab and zzso are zzso zzso have been constructed which zzso these proteins either together or zzso zzso zzso the Lab protein alone express a modified form of this protein in which the second zzso zzso which zzso to the first zzso acid of zzso is changed to an alternative zzso Four different zzso forms of the Lab sequence were zzso Each of the plasmids was introduced into a zzso cell transient expression system which allowed the determination of the known activities of the L zzso It was shown that the zzso protein and each of the modified Lab proteins were capable of zzso the zzso junction in zzso Furthermore, each of these proteins induced the zzso of the zzso component of the zzso complex zzso producing zzso of zzso zzso These results indicate that the two species of L have the same zzso
