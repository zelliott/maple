An zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be the major protein in the culture zzso of zzso zzso when grown on zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso no zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso under the conditions zzso This zzso was zzso to zzso by high performance zzso and zzso zzso It had an zzso of 35,000 as estimated by zzso and was shown to be active as a zzso No zzso of the protein could be detected neither by a sensitive zzso nor by zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso randomly, yielding zzso and zzso as major end zzso It had no zzso zzso zzso or zzso activity but acted on zzso The pH and temperature zzso for its activity were pH zzso and 40 degrees C, zzso Eight peptides obtained after zzso zzso zzso of zzso have been zzso six of them showed considerable zzso acid similarity to zzso and high zzso zzso from different bacteria, zzso and zzso
