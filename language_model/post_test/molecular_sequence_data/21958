The zzso S are closely related peptides with zzso zzso activity that are produced by the skin of the South American zzso frog, zzso zzso These peptides are zzso zzso zzso and zzso with their zzso and zzso zzso acids on opposing faces along the long axis of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso structure is believed to enable the peptides to interact with membrane zzso leading to zzso and disruption of the target zzso We have identified new members of the zzso S family that do not resemble any of the naturally occurring zzso peptides characterized to zzso One of these zzso designated zzso zzso zzso has a zzso structure that includes a zzso core sequence encompassing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso determined by the zzso zzso flanked at both zzso by zzso and polar zzso This structure is reminiscent of that of synthetic peptides originally designed as zzso zzso models and that spontaneously become inserted into zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 47, zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso acting on zzso and zzso zzso The structure of zzso zzso in zzso solution and in zzso zzso was analyzed by circular zzso and two-dimensional zzso zzso combined with molecular dynamics zzso zzso zzso is zzso in water, but a zzso zzso zzso zzso mostly in zzso zzso is stabilized by the addition of zzso These results, combined with membrane zzso zzso and surface zzso resonance analysis of the zzso binding to zzso and zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that spatial segregation of zzso and zzso zzso on opposing faces along the long axis of a zzso is not essential for the zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso
