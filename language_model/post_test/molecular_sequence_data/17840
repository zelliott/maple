The zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory proteins that control the determination of different zzso zzso zzso of zzso proteins to regulatory DNA sequences is zzso by an evolutionary zzso protein domain, the zzso Although zzso zzso by the zzso genes are very similar in their zzso acid sequence and in zzso zzso properties, here we provide additional evidence that the zzso is responsible for most of the regulatory specificity of the entire zzso A zzso zzso gene was constructed that encodes a zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso is zzso for that of zzso zzso of this zzso protein throughout the zzso causes zzso transformation of anterior segments toward more zzso zzso A number of other zzso zzso zzso all normally zzso by zzso are zzso activated by the zzso zzso These results support the hypothesis that the target specificity of similar zzso proteins is largely determined by the zzso acid sequence of the zzso
