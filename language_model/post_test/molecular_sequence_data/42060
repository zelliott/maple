Gene amplification is a common event in the progression of human zzso The detection and zzso of certain amplified zzso has been shown to have zzso importance in certain human zzso A method is described that zzso the principles of competitive zzso for zzso of the zzso gene copy number in relation to the copy number of a reference gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso located on the same zzso zzso as the zzso zzso This ratio gives the true level of amplification of the zzso zzso accounting for variables such as cell number, cell cycle phase, and zzso 8 zzso The determination of gene amplification depends on the precise measurement of the ratio of target and reference zzso An important feature of this zzso is that the competitive reference standards used for target gene zzso and reference gene zzso have been linked to form a zzso This simple modification guarantees that both reference gene and target gene zzso tubes get identical amounts of the competitive template for each zzso thereby eliminating a significant source of zzso This method has the same desirable attributes of standard zzso in that very small sample sizes are required and that results can easily be obtained in zzso 24 zzso In addition, this technique does not require the use of zzso or expensive DNA detection zzso and thus, may give it wider zzso for the study of human zzso
