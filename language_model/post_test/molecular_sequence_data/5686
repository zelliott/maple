zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene have been generated as small zzso zzso zzso The true zzso zzso of zzso in zzso is now seen to be very similar to that originally zzso with each odd segment zzso No other previously isolated zzso in the zzso region proved zzso to zzso The generated zzso covering the zzso locus and immediately surrounding regions do not cover any other gene tested from that zzso The entire zzso gene has been cloned and zzso and represents more than 120 zzso of zzso zzso The gene has been zzso except for two very large zzso Analysis of the upstream control region of the gene indicates the presence of a large number of putative binding sites for zzso factors that direct relevant zzso regulated gene zzso
