The expression of a zzso bean zzso zzso zzso zzso D zzso zzso zzso gene has been studied by examining its promoter activity in transgenic tobacco zzso zzso carrying a zzso zzso zzso and by monitoring the levels of zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso analyses revealed that the zzso zzso region from zzso zzso to zzso is required for the regulation and zzso function of the zzso zzso The zzso promoter in zzso zzso is highly active in the rapidly growing regions such as the shoot zzso and the secondary zzso producing zzso buds and vascular zzso of young leaves and zzso The zzso promoter activity in floral zzso was high in zzso zzso and zzso zzso but low in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso styles, and zzso The zzso promoter activity was enhanced by zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso in zzso bean showed that the zzso zzso levels were high in young and metabolically more active zzso such as expanding leaves, zzso zzso developing seeds, and young zzso and they decreased in mature zzso such as fully expanded leaves and developed zzso These patterns of expression suggest a role of zzso in rapid cell growth, zzso and zzso
