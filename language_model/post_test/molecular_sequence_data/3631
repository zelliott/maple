Two zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso are assumed to transport zzso out of the zzso coli zzso but how nitrate enters enteric bacteria is zzso We report the construction and use of four zzso strains that lack nitrate zzso Z and the zzso nitrate zzso but express all combinations of zzso and zzso The active site of the only functional nitrate zzso nitrate zzso A, is located in the zzso so nitrate reduction by these four strains is totally dependent upon a mechanism for importing zzso These strains were exploited to determine the roles of zzso and zzso in both nitrate and zzso zzso Single zzso that lack either zzso or zzso were competent for zzso zzso growth on a zzso carbon source, zzso They transported and reduced nitrate almost as rapidly as the parental zzso In contrast, the zzso double zzso was defective in zzso growth unless nitrate transport was facilitated by the nitrate zzso reduced zzso zzso zzso It was also unable to zzso nitrate reduction in the presence of zzso electron zzso zzso of active nitrate zzso A and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were unaffected by the zzso and zzso zzso The rate of zzso reduction zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the double zzso was almost as rapid as that of the zzso strain, indicating that there is a mechanism for zzso zzso by zzso coli that is zzso of either zzso or zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso reduction of zzso to zzso One additional component that contributes to zzso zzso was shown to be zzso the zzso product of the third gene of the zzso zzso which is predicted to be a zzso membrane protein with six zzso zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso decreased zzso zzso and reduction to a zzso rate that was fully restored by a single zzso copy of either zzso or zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso for zzso zzso but not for zzso zzso We conclude that, in contrast to zzso which zzso only zzso zzso and zzso provide alternative mechanisms for both nitrate and zzso zzso However, zzso might selectively promote zzso zzso not zzso zzso
