zzso syndrome zzso is a clinically and genetically zzso disease accounting for zzso of the zzso deaf zzso It is characterized by deafness in association with zzso anomalies and various defects of neural zzso zzso At least four types are recognized zzso zzso zzso and zzso on the basis of clinical and genetic zzso Two previously described families seemed to delineate a new zzso characterized by zzso in conjunction with zzso zzso zzso Since zzso in the zzso gene are responsible for some instances of zzso we screened for zzso in one of the zzso families and discovered a 1 zzso deletion in zzso 8 of zzso zzso previously has been associated with compound zzso for a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso a functionally significant zzso that is associated with moderately reduced zzso zzso zzso In this family, all of the individuals with the zzso zzso are either zzso or zzso for zzso and zzso for the 1 zzso deletion in zzso This suggests that the zzso zzso may result from zzso interaction between a gene for a zzso factor zzso and a gene that it regulates zzso
