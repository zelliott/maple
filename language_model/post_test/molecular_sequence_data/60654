The D1 protein of the zzso II reaction center is thought to be the most zzso component of the zzso zzso To understand the mechanisms underlying the light sensitivity of zzso we performed in zzso random zzso of the zzso gene that codes for zzso transformed the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and selected zzso zzso that did not zzso in high intensity zzso A region of zzso coding for 178 zzso acids of the zzso portion of the zzso was subjected to random zzso by low zzso zzso chain reaction amplification or by zzso zzso This region contains the binding sites for zzso zzso (through zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso with single and multiple zzso acid zzso were selected from a half million zzso exposed to white light at 320 zzso zzso zzso A strain transformed with zzso zzso became zzso under the same zzso zzso zzso has confirmed that one or more zzso of zzso acids at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The rate of degradation of D1 protein was not appreciably affected by the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells may result from continued buildup of zzso zzso systems caused by changes in zzso signals originating from zzso
