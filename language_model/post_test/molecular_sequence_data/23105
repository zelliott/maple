Severe acute respiratory syndrome zzso is an emerging infectious disease caused by a novel coronavirus zzso The binding of zzso spike zzso protein to cellular zzso zzso 2 zzso is the first step in zzso zzso zzso we zzso the zzso effects of small peptides derived from S protein on the binding of S protein to zzso and on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso significantly blocked the interaction between S protein and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso scanning suggested the region spanning zzso zzso might act as a zzso zzso zzso blocked both binding of the S protein and zzso of S zzso zzso to zzso E6 zzso In conclusion, this is the first report of small peptides designed to disrupt the binding of zzso S protein to zzso Our findings suggest that zzso may be developed as an zzso agent for the treatment of zzso zzso
