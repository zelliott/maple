To assess human zzso zzso diversity in environmental samples based on sequence comparisons of zzso gene fragments amplified using newly designed zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso 

Six zzso primer sets were designed based on 56 aligned zzso sequences from zzso zzso to amplify different zzso gene sections zzso zzso of the six zzso zzso The amplified zzso genes from wastewater samples were zzso zzso and compared with those in publicly accessible databases zzso zzso zzso by using the zzso zzso A total of 46 zzso positive clones were affiliated to five zzso zzso zzso 1, 2, 12, 31 and zzso zzso between the cloned and database zzso sequences ranged from zzso to zzso (with an average of zzso zzso zzso 

The designed zzso showed higher amplification efficiencies when compared with the existing zzso Using the new zzso zzso species A, C, and F zzso 1, 2, 12, 31 and 41 in zzso were identified in the studied municipal zzso 

The six zzso primer sets developed in this study can be used to efficiently amplify zzso gene fragments in zzso Multiple zzso zzso identified in the municipal wastewater provide new information about zzso diversity in environmental zzso
