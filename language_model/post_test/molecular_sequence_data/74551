zzso is one of the larger zzso within the avian zzso radiation, the family zzso Fairly zzso by size and shape but highly variable by zzso these have been classified mainly on basis of zzso zzso In the present study, which is the first zzso analysis of the zzso zzso based on molecular sequence data zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso we investigate zzso between 16 species and 34 subspecies of zzso zzso zzso were aligned and subjected to maximum likelihood and zzso zzso zzso zzso strongly support the zzso of zzso and place it close to zzso but without outlining a precise zzso In a generally zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso constitute deep branches and the remaining species form five zzso which are not zzso with previously defined zzso The black and white zzso belong to two different zzso zzso zzso appears zzso and our results support the resurrection of zzso major, zzso zzso and zzso zzso We also find that zzso zzso described in 1991 based on the only known live individual, is identified as an unusual zzso zzso from zzso zzso The black zzso are not zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso appear as isolated species whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso are zzso We recovered the zzso of crimson zzso and new hypotheses on their relationships have been zzso Overall, the variation in zzso and patterns does not follow zzso zzso The zzso zzso could be thoroughly subject to modification and it could not reflect exactly zzso zzso of the zzso From then on, the zzso zzso appears as an unreliable zzso character for defining species and species zzso
