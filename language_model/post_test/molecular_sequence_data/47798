zzso is a cellular process for bulk degradation of zzso zzso The attachment of zzso a modifier with no significant similarity to zzso to zzso is crucial for zzso in zzso This reaction proceeds in a zzso manner, and requires zzso and zzso zzso exhibits a considerable similarity to zzso zzso zzso and is found to activate zzso with zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, shows no significant similarity to other proteins whose functions are zzso Here, we show that after zzso by zzso zzso is transferred to the zzso zzso of zzso to form an zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso do not generate the zzso zzso which leads to defects in zzso and zzso targeting of zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso is a new type of zzso zzso that functions in the zzso zzso zzso
