Natural zzso of zzso often associated with drug resistance, are widely described in zzso and reverse zzso regions but data on their presence in the zzso region, especially in non-B zzso are still very zzso We aimed to characterize naturally occurring zzso in the zzso region in 104 zzso and 10 zzso patients infected predominantly with zzso zzso and its zzso with zzso A1 and/or zzso zzso No primary drug resistance zzso against zzso zzso were found, but zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso were seen in more than zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso associated with zzso resistance, were found in only two zzso zzso We conclude that similar to other zzso non-B zzso the zzso and its zzso with zzso A1 and zzso are rich in zzso region natural zzso which may impact the development of resistance against zzso zzso
