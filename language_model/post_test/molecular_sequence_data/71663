zzso E plays a critical role in plasma zzso zzso zzso models of a highly zzso zzso domain of this protein have been shown to increase the binding of low density zzso zzso to zzso cell surfaces independently of the low density zzso zzso Here we provide data to show that these peptides not only increase the binding of LDL, but also of high density zzso though not zzso zzso We also have data suggesting that this novel activity is zzso at least in part, by a member of the scavenger zzso family, zzso Furthermore, we show that this activity is also prominent in zzso a cell relevant to zzso In addition, this current paper provides evidence suggesting that this complex binding activity is initiated by a zzso interaction, and that our peptides are able to induce activity at zzso relevant zzso This study provides evidence for a possible novel zzso interaction and further zzso properties of zzso E and raises the possibility of a therapeutic potential of our zzso zzso
