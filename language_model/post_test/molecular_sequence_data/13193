There is increasing evidence that zzso of the zzso growth factor I zzso zzso plays a major role in the control of cellular proliferation of many cell zzso We studied the zzso effects of zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso on zzso zzso cells, a human cervical cancer cell zzso All three growth factors promoted zzso increases in cell zzso In zzso cells, zzso usually requires stimulation by a zzso factor such as zzso zzso or insulin (in zzso zzso in order to exert a zzso zzso zzso we investigated whether an zzso zzso involving zzso or zzso participated in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso With the zzso protection zzso zzso zzso was not zzso However, zzso zzso increased in a zzso manner following zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso in a zzso manner by zzso protein 5 zzso which binds to zzso and zzso zzso An zzso zzso to zzso also inhibited the zzso response to zzso In addition, zzso but not zzso stimulation with zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso with both zzso and zzso attenuated this zzso These data demonstrate that zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cervical cancer cells can participate in zzso zzso and suggest that zzso signals involving the zzso zzso occur zzso of competence growth factor receptors such as the zzso zzso
