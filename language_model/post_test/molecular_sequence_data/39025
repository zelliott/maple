The total synthesis of the zzso core 2 class zzso zzso in a completely protected form was accomplished for the first zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso via zzso zzso employing readily accessible zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, 9 and zzso zzso zzso zzso For the introduction of the zzso acid, the zzso group was used to temporarily mask the zzso group of zzso so as to obtain an zzso linkage without participation from the zzso zzso The zzso was attached to the sugar unit at the zzso stage to avoid loss of zzso at a later zzso The zzso and zzso zzso protected zzso acid at the reducing end zzso efficient zzso synthesis on zzso zzso
