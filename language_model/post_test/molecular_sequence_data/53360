Within the zzso zzso the zzso growth zzso proteins zzso are known to play a pivotal role in cell proliferation and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso is proposed to be an essential mechanism for regulating zzso zzso The generated zzso fragments in part exhibit different zzso and zzso biological zzso zzso naturally occurring forms of zzso in human zzso we identified both a zzso and a zzso zzso of zzso by means of zzso zzso As a source for zzso isolation, we used large amounts of human zzso obtained from patients with chronic zzso zzso zzso of the zzso peptides from zzso was performed by consecutive zzso and zzso zzso zzso Mass zzso and sequence analysis revealed an zzso of 13 233 for the zzso zzso zzso spanning zzso zzso of zzso and an zzso of 11 344 for the zzso zzso extending from zzso to zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso analysis showed that the six zzso of the zzso zzso zzso are linked between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso bonding pattern, zzso zzso and zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso analysis, and zzso and displacement studies demonstrated a very low affinity of the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso whereas the zzso zzso retained significant zzso binding properties zzso zzso zzso 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso This study provides the first molecular characterization of circulating human zzso fragments formed in zzso exhibiting an at least zzso decrease in the affinity of the zzso zzso zzso for the zzso and a very low zzso binding capacity of the zzso zzso
