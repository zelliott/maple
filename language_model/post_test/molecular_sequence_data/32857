zzso hibernation is characterized by prolonged zzso bouts zzso by brief zzso zzso zzso zzso defenses are needed both to sustain cell viability over weeks of deep zzso and to defend against high rates of zzso formation associated with massive zzso zzso during zzso The present study shows that zzso of zzso contributes to zzso defense during zzso in zzso ground zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of three zzso of the zzso zzso zzso family were zzso by Western zzso the results showing zzso and zzso increases in zzso protein in brown zzso tissue zzso and heart, respectively, during hibernation compared with zzso zzso increases in zzso were zzso and zzso whereas zzso rose by zzso in heart of zzso zzso Total zzso zzso zzso activity also rose during hibernation by zzso in heart and zzso in zzso Furthermore, zzso showed that zzso zzso levels increased by zzso and zzso in BAT and heart, respectively, during zzso A partial zzso sequence of zzso from ground squirrels was obtained by zzso amplification, the deduced zzso acid sequence showing zzso identity with zzso from other zzso Some unique zzso acid zzso were identified that might contribute to stabilizing zzso zzso at the near 0 degrees C body temperatures during zzso
