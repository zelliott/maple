In zzso there is a family of proteins which combine zzso zzso with zzso light chain zzso zzso A member of this family from the liver fluke, zzso zzso been identified and zzso zzso zzso has an zzso domain containing two imperfect zzso sequences and a zzso zzso light zzso zzso zzso zzso predicted that the two zzso are joined by a flexible zzso Native gel zzso demonstrated that zzso binds to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not to zzso or zinc zzso The zzso fluorescent probe zzso bound more tightly to zzso in the presence of calcium zzso This suggests that the protein zzso a zzso change on zzso binding which increases the number of zzso zzso on the zzso zzso was protected from limited zzso by the zzso zzso zzso but not by zzso or zzso zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso underwent calcium zzso zzso Since zzso are commonly zzso it is likely that zzso zzso through this zzso The molecular model reveals that the calcium zzso site is located close to a key sequence in the zzso domain, suggesting a plausible mechanism for zzso zzso
