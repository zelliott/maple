A procedure is described for zzso zzso identification of proteins using zzso laser zzso tandem zzso trap mass zzso in conjunction with a zzso database searching zzso The procedure involves zzso of zzso bands or spots from zzso gels, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso mass zzso analysis of the zzso mixture of zzso zzso followed by tandem zzso trap mass zzso analysis of selected individual zzso and database searching of the relevant zzso database using the program zzso The scheme provides sensitive, real-time protein identification as well as facile identification of zzso A single operator can zzso identify zzso zzso from an zzso whose zzso is known at a level of zzso zzso zzso of protein loaded on a zzso The utility of the technique was demonstrated by the identification and characterization of a band from a human zzso preparation and 11 different proteins from a zzso zzso zzso II zzso repeat zzso zzso The technology has great potential for zzso biological science, where it promises to facilitate the dissection and anatomy of zzso zzso the definition of disease state zzso and the investigation of protein targets in biological processes such as the cell cycle and signal zzso
