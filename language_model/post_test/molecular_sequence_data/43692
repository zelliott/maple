zzso zinc fingers are generally regarded as independent zzso zzso that each specify three base pairs in zzso but zzso zzso However, zzso evidence suggests that a contact also can occur from the second zzso position of one finger to the zzso of the preceding zzso Here we show for the zzso zzso domain of the protein zzso and a panel of zzso that deleting the putative contact from finger 3 can affect the binding specificity for the zzso base in the adjoining zzso which forms part of the binding site of finger zzso This finding demonstrates that zzso zinc fingers can specify overlapping zzso zzso and that sequence specificity at the boundary between zzso arises from zzso between adjacent zzso This has important implications for the design and selection of zinc fingers with novel DNA binding zzso
