The zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso whose function has been implicated in zzso zzso and the cell cycle zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to identify zzso regions of the protein and potentially important functional zzso the zzso gene was cloned and zzso from two other insects zzso zzso and Aedes zzso and three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso from a flowering plant zzso zzso These sequences along with those of a zzso zzso zzso exhibit a high degree of zzso zzso of zzso zzso is zzso identical to the three zzso zzso zzso identical to the zzso zzso and zzso identical to the plant zzso There is high evolutionary conservation among the zzso The mouse and human proteins are identical and differ from that of the zzso by a single conservative zzso change zzso for zzso A dramatic sequence conservation is seen in the position of the zzso zzso zzso Of the 27 positions occupied by zzso zzso acids in zzso of zzso zzso 25 of the corresponding positions in the human zzso 23 of the positions in zzso zzso and 20 of the positions in zzso zzso have zzso zzso zzso Most of these zzso are present in three zzso zzso zzso which are proposed to function in zzso zzso Two zzso sites for zzso zzso II zzso have also been zzso within the animal zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is zzso in zzso by zzso arguing that these two sites are functional in zzso A putative shift in the secondary structure of zzso caused by the zzso of these sites suggests that zzso may be regulating the activity of the zzso in zzso
