The complete sequence of 57 zzso of the human zzso locus has been determined using automated fluorescent DNA zzso The strategy employed increasingly directed sequencing zzso A randomly generated zzso library was zzso to generate zzso overlapping sets of sequences zzso zzso clones at the ends of these zzso were further zzso using zzso zzso and zzso and custom zzso zzso to order the zzso and to complete the sequencing zzso The human zzso sequence includes zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3' to zzso 1 and 9, zzso The sequence contains 49 representatives of the zzso zzso along with several other types of repetitive zzso The zzso sequences exhibit a biased orientation, with those sequences in the first half of the locus oriented in the minus direction relative to zzso of the gene zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso and those sequences in the latter half of the locus oriented randomly zzso zzso zzso P less than zzso The development and performance of the sequencing strategy and the features of the human zzso gene are zzso
