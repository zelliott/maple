To understand the structure and activity relationship of human zzso a series of zzso fragments was zzso The zzso fragment, zzso was not active, while the zzso fragment, zzso killed zzso coli, as well as zzso and drug-resistant cancer zzso A zzso core zzso and zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of zzso was identified based on total correlated zzso by trimming zzso regions zzso Because zzso acts on bacterial zzso three-dimensional structures of its fragments were determined in zzso by zzso including structural refinement by natural abundance zzso and zzso chemical zzso zzso interactions in the zzso zzso were proposed to be essential for zzso zzso The zzso core zzso adopts a similar structure in the zzso of zzso or zzso zzso This structure is retained in the zzso zzso zzso and very likely in intact zzso based on zzso signal zzso The higher zzso activity of the zzso core zzso than zzso zzso was attributed to additional zzso zzso To achieve selective membrane zzso zzso acids were incorporated into zzso While the zzso showed similar zzso activity to the zzso it lost toxicity to human zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso defects in the new zzso structure of the zzso leading to a much shorter retention time on a zzso zzso zzso It is proposed that zzso defects as a result of incoherent zzso packing provide a structural basis for the improvement in cell selectivity of the zzso zzso
