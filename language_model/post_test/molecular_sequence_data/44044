The complex anatomy of the zzso zzso in which the zzso cells are grouped in zzso dispersed among the zzso zzso zzso has hampered study of the molecular events governing the development of pancreatic cell zzso To investigate whether fish may provide relevant, complementary models of zzso development, we characterized the trout insulin zzso promoter and its molecular interactions with zzso a key zzso and zzso factor of the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso reporter zzso containing the 280 zzso zzso region of the zzso gene resulted in strong activity in zzso pancreatic beta cells but not in zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments indicated that zzso zzso binds to and activates the zzso zzso By zzso plasmids to zzso zzso eggs, we showed that the expression of mouse zzso is capable of zzso the zzso zzso promoter zzso in most cell types of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso role of zzso in zzso insulin gene regulation opens the possibility to exploit fish models in the study of zzso zzso
