From protein sequence comparison data found in the literature, a library was organized using zzso zzso sequences which are common to related zzso Each of the fragments was then examined for its occurrence in all the protein zzso defined by the zzso data zzso We have selected those zzso peptides that appear exclusively in one or a few zzso and thus made a library of zzso peptides that characterize specific zzso Such characteristic peptides are, in general, five to seven zzso long and contain unusually high proportions of zzso and zzso This collection is a useful resource for the zzso and functional prediction of protein zzso
