Different zzso zzso regions of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were compared systematically to establish a preferred V zzso for use in zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso The zzso products of the zzso region produced the most zzso zzso profiles and permitted identification of common zzso from rumen samples from zzso This study also showed that different zzso might be detected when different V regions are targeted by zzso zzso fat appeared to zzso stimulate zzso zzso but inhibit zzso zzso strain zzso in rumen zzso
