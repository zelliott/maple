zzso zzso iron zzso protein zzso zzso zzso has zzso to a family of zzso element zzso proteins zzso found in different zzso We have previously demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso binds a zzso consensus zzso and that the binding activity is regulated by iron zzso In the work we now report, we have cloned a zzso zzso zzso and zzso it in a bacterial expression system in soluble form capable of binding zzso To zzso zzso we used the zzso zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with the zzso strain of zzso coli, which carries extra copies of zzso genes usually found in organisms such as zzso zzso whose zzso is zzso The zzso zzso protein zzso in soluble form was partially zzso using zzso zzso We searched the zzso database, zzso to identify sequences capable of forming zzso zzso using a specially developed algorithm, and found three zzso sequences matching the search zzso In gel zzso zzso zzso bound three zzso putative zzso zzso with affinity exceeding the affinity for the zzso consensus zzso The binding was zzso and was not inhibited by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso of zzso resulted in substantial zzso of the signal intensity in the gel zzso zzso and in Western zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso retained all three putative zzso at the same position on the gel as the zzso zzso
