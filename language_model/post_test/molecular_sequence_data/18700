Due to evolutionary conservation of biology, experimental knowledge captured from genetic studies in zzso model organisms provides insight into human cellular pathways and ultimately zzso zzso zzso profiling is a powerful approach for zzso cellular responses to small zzso Using an zzso platform, we provide the relative sensitivities of the zzso and zzso deletion collections for nearly zzso biologically active zzso The data quality enables unique insights into pathways that are sensitive and resistant to a given zzso as demonstrated with both known and novel zzso We present examples of novel compounds that inhibit the zzso relevant fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso and zzso and demonstrate how the individual profiles facilitate zzso experiments to delineate compound mechanism of zzso zzso the scale and diversity of tested compounds yields a zzso where the number of modulated pathways approaches zzso This resource can be used to map novel biological connections, and also identify functions for zzso zzso We validated hypotheses generated by global zzso zzso zzso of profiles for zzso novel compounds with a similar mechanism of action acting upon zzso or zzso zzso and zzso an zzso ORF, zzso that plays a role in zzso in the zzso Finally, we identify and characterize background zzso in the widely used zzso deletion collection which should improve the interpretation of past and future screens throughout the zzso This comprehensive resource of cellular responses enables the expansion of our understanding of zzso zzso zzso
