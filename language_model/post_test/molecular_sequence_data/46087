The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a promising contraceptive target because it is specific to male germ cells, essential for zzso zzso and male zzso and well suited to pharmacological zzso However, zzso is difficult to isolate from native sources and zzso expression frequently results in high production of zzso zzso We chose to use the zzso zzso cell system to express a zzso form of human zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso This zzso Hu zzso was successfully produced in zzso zzso 9 zzso cells by infection with zzso virus as a zzso zzso active form in high yield, zzso zzso zzso zzso characterization of the zzso zzso by mass zzso and size exclusion zzso confirmed the presence of the zzso zzso Further characterization by zzso zzso matching mass zzso and zzso sequencing showed that unlike the mixed zzso forms produced in bacterial expression systems, human zzso expressed in zzso insect cells is zzso The ability to express and purify active human zzso as zzso in high amounts will greatly aid in drug discovery efforts targeting this zzso for discovery of novel zzso and three compounds were identified as zzso of Hu zzso from a pilot screen of 1120 zzso zzso
