A gas zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from a sea ice core collected from Point zzso Alaska, zzso zzso of strain zzso were large zzso zzso in zzso zzso contained gas zzso of two distinct zzso and grew well at zzso zzso of zzso % and at temperatures of zzso to 10 degrees zzso The DNA zzso content was 40 zzso zzso fatty acid analysis showed that 16 : zzso comprised 67 % of the total fatty acid zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that this zzso was closely related to members of the zzso zzso with highest sequence similarity zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso analysis differentiated strain zzso from zzso zzso on the basis of several zzso including cell zzso growth temperature range and the ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments revealed a level of zzso of 37 % between strain zzso and zzso zzso providing further support that it represents a distinct zzso The name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed for this novel zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
