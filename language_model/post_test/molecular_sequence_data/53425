zzso zzso proteins play key roles in controlling the activities of zzso and zzso in bone zzso These zzso zzso zzso proteins contain zzso acid sequences that mediate cell zzso and many of the zzso zzso proteins also contain zzso zzso that interact with the mineral surface and may orient the signaling zzso Here we report a fusion zzso design that is based on this natural approach for the display of signaling zzso sequences at zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso acid zzso binding domain zzso that is loosely zzso in zzso To test whether zzso can serve to orient active zzso sequences on zzso the zzso and zzso zzso from zzso were fused to the C zzso The fusion peptides bound tightly to zzso and the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso of zzso melanoma cells when immobilized on the zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso was the primary zzso target for the fusion zzso Solid state zzso experiments showed that the zzso portion of the hydrated fusion zzso is highly dynamic on the zzso zzso This fusion zzso framework may thus provide a straightforward design for zzso zzso sequences on zzso for zzso tissue engineering, and vaccine zzso
