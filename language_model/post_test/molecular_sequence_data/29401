The zzso binding of zzso to zzso zzso of G zzso receptors zzso is thought to be a crucial step in zzso zzso In some zzso systems, zzso have also been demonstrated to be involved in zzso zzso zzso and the zzso of signaling zzso The objective of the current study was to examine binding interactions of members of the zzso family with the zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso representing the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were zzso and bound to polystyrene beads via a zzso zzso Using zzso zzso binding interactions between zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by flow zzso zzso and zzso bound to the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, with zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso of visual zzso which binds zzso with high zzso was not zzso zzso and zzso truncated zzso forms of zzso that display zzso binding to intact zzso were also observed to bind the zzso zzso zzso in a zzso manner, but with much greater affinity than the full-length zzso yielding zzso values in the zzso zzso zzso Two additional zzso zzso which are full-length but display zzso binding to intact zzso were evaluated for their binding affinity to the zzso zzso zzso Whereas the single point zzso zzso zzso displayed an affinity similar to that of the full-length zzso the triple point zzso zzso zzso displayed an affinity more similar to that of the truncated forms of zzso The results suggest that the zzso zzso of zzso is a critical zzso in regulating the binding affinity of zzso for the zzso zzso of zzso
