zzso are an abundant and ubiquitous class of proteins first identified by their high affinity for the zzso drug zzso zzso zzso have zzso zzso activity in zzso and thus may be involved in protein folding and trafficking in zzso In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of this zzso zzso reveals an open reading frame coding for a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso This zzso zzso zzso shares a central zzso zzso and a zzso domain with other zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequence shares zzso identity with the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso This identity suggests that zzso zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso A zzso zzso From the alignment of zzso zzso we have found that 62 zzso zzso identity of zzso have remained zzso in zzso for more than 1 billion years of zzso We calculated a unit evolutionary period of zzso million years for the zzso zzso zzso analyses show that zzso zzso zzso zzso is abundant, and present in all insect zzso zzso The highest values for zzso zzso zzso zzso tissue content were found in zzso zzso followed by brain, zzso and gut zzso the content of zzso The muscle, fat body, and zzso zzso contained the lowest zzso zzso level zzso the content of zzso There is a zzso pattern of gene expression affecting the zzso zzso These results suggest that this zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso is subject to a differential regulation in zzso and during zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso DNA shows that only one copy of the zzso gene is present per zzso whereas at least 20 genes or zzso were detected in the zzso zzso
