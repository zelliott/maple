zzso belong to the zzso which is a zzso zzso zzso To shed more light on the evolution of the zzso process, zzso of the zzso segment polarity genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been recovered from the zzso zzso zzso The zzso has two zzso zzso The expression of zzso is reminiscent of zzso expression in insects and zzso suggesting that this gene is regulated in a similar zzso This is different for the second zzso zzso zzso zzso which is expressed at the zzso cap of the zzso from which stripes split off, suggesting a different mode of zzso Nevertheless, the zzso stripes eventually define the same border as the zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes are expressed in different patterns from their zzso in insects and zzso The zzso gene is expressed in zzso stripes just anterior to the zzso zzso but is not expressed in the most zzso region of the germ zzso However, zzso appears to act in this zzso zzso zzso and zzso together seem to perform the role of insect zzso Although there are differences, the zzso cells and zzso cells seem to define an important boundary that is zzso among zzso This boundary may match the zzso compartment boundary and is even visible zzso in the zzso zzso An additional piece of evidence for a zzso organization comes from the expression zzso of the zzso genes that are confined to the zzso as zzso defined by the zzso and zzso zzso zzso therefore, are presumably important functional units and zzso entities in zzso development and form an ancestral character of zzso The lack of by zzso and zzso boundaries in other segmented zzso does not support a common origin of zzso
