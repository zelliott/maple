To investigate if zzso 42 of zzso isolated from pigs represents genuine zzso zzso which was previously only isolated from zzso 

A total of 15 field zzso from horses and pigs from five different countries representing three zzso were subjected to extended zzso zzso Although minor differences were observed between zzso 42 and zzso zzso these differences did not allow zzso zzso zzso based on zzso zzso showed five profiles based on nine band zzso One zzso zzso strain and two zzso 42 strains shared the same zzso zzso using zzso gave a higher diversity with nine profiles based on ten band zzso While no profiles were shared between the zzso 42 and zzso zzso zzso pattern analysis showed that two of the zzso 42 zzso were most similar zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequencing of one strain of zzso 42 and one strain of zzso zzso was performed and compared with the published sequence for the type strain of zzso zzso The three strains showed nearly identical sequences with at least zzso zzso DNA zzso measured by the zzso method were 79 and zzso respectively between the type strain of zzso zzso and two strains of zzso 42 representing distinct zzso and confirmed that zzso 42 belongs to zzso zzso 

The present investigation documents that zzso zzso can be isolated from clinical respiratory specimens from pigs and the recognized association with respiratory infections in horses and horse bite infection in zzso zzso classified as zzso 42 are zzso zzso isolated from pigs and for both pigs and horses, zzso mainly include the respiratory zzso 

The results will improve the zzso and progress studies of zzso and epidemiology of zzso zzso
