The nuclear zzso zzso zzso was originally identified as an zzso zzso complex localized exclusively to the nuclear zzso zzso was shown to recognize two binding sites, site A zzso to zzso and site B zzso zzso to zzso in the rat zzso zzso gene zzso This study shows that the zzso binding sites A and B as well as a third zzso binding site zzso zzso to zzso constitute a consensus zzso zzso and represent an zzso recognition zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso factor family which is associated with acute zzso leukemia and binds to the sequence zzso via its zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso reveal that a component of zzso is a member of the zzso domain zzso factor family based on zzso with zzso consensus zzso Limited zzso of zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso and inability of the zzso partner protein zzso to form complexes with zzso indicate that zzso is not identical to zzso but represents a zzso zzso domain zzso Western and Northern blots reveal the presence of multiple zzso proteins and zzso transcripts in several zzso cell zzso Furthermore, our results indicate that zzso family members may selectively partition between nuclear zzso and zzso zzso Because proteins that contain a zzso domain are implicated in zzso zzso regulation, our results support the concept that the nuclear zzso mediates zzso expression of the zzso zzso
