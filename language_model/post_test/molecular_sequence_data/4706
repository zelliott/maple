zzso zzso expression is crucial for maintaining the normal zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso zzso is altered, and may participate in tumor zzso We therefore investigated how zzso expression was regulated in a cultured zzso SCC cell line zzso At low calcium concentration zzso zzso zzso cells expressed zzso zzso in the zzso At a higher calcium zzso zzso was promptly zzso to the cell surface within 30 zzso gradually increased on the cell surface for up to 48 zzso and was continuously expressed for at least 7 zzso During this time course, the total amount of zzso protein had increased, whereas the zzso zzso levels for zzso had not zzso The zzso of protein synthesis by zzso but not the zzso of gene zzso by zzso completely suppressed the expression of zzso The effect of calcium was inhibited by zzso but not by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso calcium concentration did not mobilize the zzso calcium pool, and were accompanied by the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso In addition, zzso cells expressed zzso for a zzso zzso originally demonstrated in the zzso zzso The results suggest an unique mechanism for regulating zzso gene expression in zzso cells by zzso zzso which stimulates the de zzso synthesis of zzso at the zzso level through protein zzso zzso
