zzso are of special interest for studies in comparative zzso because of their zzso position in the animal kingdom as zzso zzso Furthermore, their zzso symmetry as adult animals provides a unique context for analysis of the zzso and behavioral roles of zzso signaling zzso Here we report the first extensive survey of zzso and zzso hormone precursors in a species belonging to the class zzso zzso sequence data obtained from the sea cucumber zzso zzso were analyzed to identify zzso of precursor proteins that have recently been identified in the sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A total of 17 precursor proteins have been identified in zzso zzso including precursors of peptides related to zzso hormone, pedal zzso zzso AN zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso hormone zzso and zzso In addition, an unusual finding was an zzso zzso zzso precursor protein zzso the first to be discovered that comprises two zzso zzso this contrasts with the products of the zzso zzso gene in zzso which comprise either zzso or zzso zzso the data obtained provide new insights on the evolution and diversity of zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, because zzso zzso is one of several sea cucumber species that are used for human consumption, our findings may have practical and economic impact by providing a basis for zzso strategies to improve methods of zzso
