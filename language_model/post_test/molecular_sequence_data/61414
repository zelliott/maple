The aim of loop prediction in protein zzso modeling is to connect the main chain ends of two successive regions, zzso in template and target structures by protein fragments that are as similar to the target as zzso For the development of a new loop prediction method, examples of insertions and deletions were searched automatically in data sets of structurally aligned protein zzso Three different criteria were applied for the determination of the positions where the main chain zzso of the proteins begin to zzso zzso the zzso groups of the insertions and zzso giving three test data zzso The target structures in these data sets were predicted by inserting fragments from different zzso data banks between the zzso groups of the zzso The proposals of matching fragments were sorted with decreasing correspondence in the geometry of the zzso zzso For assessment of the prediction quality, the template zzso were zzso by the proposed ones, and their root mean square zzso to the target structures were zzso In addition, the best 20 fragments in the whole loop data bank zzso with the lowest zzso from the target structures after zzso into the zzso determined and compared with the zzso The analysis of the results shows limitations of zzso loop zzso It is demonstrated that the selection of the zzso groups is the most important step in the whole zzso zzso zzso
