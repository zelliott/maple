Four bacterial zzso designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from soil in zzso All these strains could use zzso as a sole carbon zzso The strains grew in a medium containing zzso zzso zzso The strains were strictly zzso zzso zzso The best growth was achieved at 25 degrees C and pH zzso in medium containing 1 % zzso zzso The strains showed identical profiles of zzso zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso and nearly identical zzso zzso gene zzso zzso patterns and zzso zzso demonstrating their relationship at the species zzso The cellular fatty acid profile of zzso consisted of significant amounts of the zzso zzso fatty acids zzso : zzso zzso zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso The diagnostic zzso zzso acid was zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence of zzso showed the highest similarity to the sequences of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso Studies of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses and zzso data based on zzso zzso gene sequencing allowed strains zzso zzso zzso and zzso to be described as members of a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
