A zzso tree for major lineages of zzso zzso is estimated from zzso aligned base positions zzso zzso of newly reported zzso DNA sequences representing coding regions for eight zzso zzso and portions of zzso and zzso Two zzso groups are zzso the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso This zzso hypothesis is used to investigate evolutionary shifts in zzso gene order, origin for zzso zzso and secondary structure of zzso These three characters shift together on the branch leading to zzso zzso Plate zzso and the fossil record indicate that these characters changed in the zzso We propose that changes to the secondary structure of zzso may destroy function of the origin for zzso replication which, in turn, may facilitate shifts in gene zzso
