The regulation of human zzso hormone zzso gene promoter activity by zzso of zzso was investigated by transient zzso with a construct containing the zzso gene promoter fused to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was strongly enhanced by zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of protein zzso A dispensed the need for zzso and zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso enhanced zzso expression of the zzso zzso Progressive zzso deletions of the zzso promoter delineated a zzso responsive region between zzso and zzso base zzso This zzso contained the sequence zzso at zzso base pairs, consistent with the consensus motif for a zzso A zzso zzso responded to zzso when cloned in either orientation in front of the zzso zzso zzso However, the level of zzso and zzso zzso expression was dependent on the cell line and on intrinsic properties of the zzso zzso of the wild type zzso sequence into an zzso site zzso completely abolished stimulation by zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso zzso of protein zzso A dispensed the need for stimulation with zzso which showed that the zzso zzso served as a functional equivalent of the native zzso zzso
