Ewing's zzso zzso cells accumulate elevated zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso we cloned and zzso the zzso region of the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis demonstrated no variations in the zzso promoter region in zzso zzso The zzso promoter encompasses multiple binding motifs for the zzso zzso zzso We have also observed that there is a coordinated zzso of the expression of both zzso and zzso relative to cells of other human tumor types expressing lower levels of zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells resulted in a strong enhancement of zzso zzso The participation of zzso in the regulation of zzso gene expression was further demonstrated in zzso cells zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso resulted in the zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells, and zzso these cells to zzso zzso These data provide support for zzso regulation of zzso expression levels, and zzso zzso zzso factors in the radiation response of zzso zzso
