In the zzso cell cycle, nuclear DNA replication zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are linked such that replication must be complete before zzso can zzso In order for this zzso to work, there must be some system for detecting zzso DNA and zzso an zzso signal to prevent the zzso of zzso zzso The zzso protein zzso is involved in this regulatory process since zzso zzso before DNA synthesis is finished in the absence of zzso This has led to the proposal that zzso is a zzso zzso detecting zzso DNA and producing the zzso zzso However, zzso in zzso show defects beyond their inability to regulate the cell cycle, suggesting other roles for the zzso protein in the nucleus and thus zzso unexplored relationships between cell cycle control and other cellular zzso
