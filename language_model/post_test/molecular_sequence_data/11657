zzso zzso zzso zzso that contain an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso domain against zzso bases of a zzso and a zzso base pair were studied for their relative stability and sequence specificity of triplex zzso In general, the zzso zzso has less zzso effect against a zzso base pair than a zzso base zzso zzso of three zzso zzso zzso resulted in decreased binding to the target, which was comparable to results observed with three zzso matched natural base zzso The zzso zzso incorporation did not result in the loss of sequence specificity of zzso unlike in the case of normal zzso zzso zzso The introduction of a positively charged zzso zzso however, resulted in decreased stability of the zzso because of loss of hydrogen bonding and stacking interactions in the major zzso The results of a molecular modeling study show that zzso zzso can be readily incorporated without any change in the zzso of the natural zzso backbone zzso overall triple zzso zzso Further, the modeling study suggests a hydrogen bond formation between the zzso group of zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by a zzso zzso zzso in the floor of the base zzso in addition to a contribution from the positive charge on the zzso zzso zzso zzso Either a direct or zzso hydrogen bond between the zzso group of the zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso is unlikely when the zzso is placed against a zzso base zzso
