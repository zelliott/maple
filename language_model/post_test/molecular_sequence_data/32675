A feasible and fully described strategy, with a detailed list of zzso for zzso cloning and sequencing known and potentially novel zzso genes zzso by a zzso zzso strain was successfully zzso Based on the analysis of zzso regions of the zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso were designed to amplify the whole open reading frame of these zzso The zzso products obtained revealed the successful amplification of zzso genes from 13 zzso zzso zzso These bacteria were previously known to zzso at least one zzso zzso An Argentinean zzso zzso isolate zzso zzso was randomly chosen for cloning and sequencing of zzso genes by using a primer set developed in this zzso Both zzso and zzso acid sequences similarity analysis revealed that zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso are new natural zzso showing several differences with the other known zzso zzso These genes were named by the zzso zzso zzso Crystal zzso zzso Committee as zzso and zzso zzso
