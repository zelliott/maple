This work has identified regulatory elements in the major zzso pathogen zzso zzso that enable response to zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso is generated by zzso of the host immune system and zzso bacteria, and the ability to resist its toxicity is one adaptation that promotes survival of zzso zzso inside the human zzso zzso zzso zzso to NO zzso zzso of the zzso zzso This protein zzso protection by zzso converting NO to harmless zzso but it is unknown how zzso zzso is able to detect NO in its environment and thus initiate this defense only as zzso We analyzed this problem by zzso mutating the zzso regulatory region to identify a zzso zzso element zzso that is required for NO zzso Five zzso factor candidates of the zzso family were then isolated from crude zzso extracts by using magnetic beads coated with this DNA zzso Of the five, only deletion of the zzso gene prevented induction of zzso zzso during zzso stress and caused growth sensitivity to the NO donor zzso zzso zzso associates in zzso with zzso DNA from the zzso regulatory zzso zzso of zzso caused a small but significant decrease in zzso A zzso putative zzso zzso zzso by zzso is also implicated in NO response, but zzso zzso zzso zzso were not sensitive to zzso in contrast to findings in zzso zzso zzso is the first protein found to be necessary for initiating NO response in zzso zzso
