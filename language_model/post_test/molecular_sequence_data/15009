zzso is a protein that was previously cloned as a negative regulator of zzso Ras and classified as a class II tumor zzso Its structural similarity to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso led us to analyze zzso as an zzso involved in zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso from zzso human, and mouse possess zzso zzso A1 or zzso activity toward zzso zzso Further examination with zzso zzso protein revealed that zzso functions as a zzso zzso zzso for PC and zzso with higher zzso activity than zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid exhibited zzso and zzso effects, zzso zzso and zzso of rat zzso were presumed to form a zzso zzso based on database analysis, and their single zzso were totally zzso These results suggested that zzso is a zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso were earlier reported to be responsible for the regulation of cell zzso Analysis of deletion zzso indicated that these zzso are also zzso essential, suggesting relevance of the zzso activity to the zzso zzso
