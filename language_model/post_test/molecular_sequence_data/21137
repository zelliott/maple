Although enrichment culture is typically employed to isolate zzso zzso this approach tends to favor fast-growing species and discriminates against all zzso zzso efforts to prevent the overgrowth of fast-growing species are necessary to isolate novel zzso zzso In this study, we developed a simple culture method for zzso zzso microbes that possess zzso activity, particularly zzso In this method, the microbial source (a forest zzso was suspended in zzso water and zzso onto a mineral zzso zzso zzso which was then zzso with filter paper to sandwich the microbial suspension between the zzso surface and zzso The filter paper fibers served to zzso the microbial cells and were the dominant carbon zzso Following zzso at zzso for zzso emerging colonies were isolated based on their zzso and were then subjected to zzso and zzso zzso Using this method, zzso dry soil were zzso and the ratio of zzso to bacterial zzso was approximately zzso zzso analyses revealed that most zzso and bacterial zzso belong to ten and two zzso zzso zzso all zzso possessed zzso activity, and several strains showed strong activity that was comparable to zzso zzso Many zzso also exhibited zzso and zzso activity, and several strains possessed zzso zzso It is expected that the culture method described here will be useful for the isolation of zzso zzso microbes and the identification of novel zzso
