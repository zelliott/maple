The zzso disease agent zzso zzso is primarily transmitted to zzso by zzso zzso The classical and alternative complement pathways are important in zzso zzso by the zzso zzso We recently identified a tick zzso zzso designated zzso which reduced zzso killing of zzso We now discover that zzso interferes with the human zzso complement zzso resulting in impaired zzso zzso and zzso and diminished zzso zzso zzso zzso was renamed the tick zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso or ticks exposed to zzso mice, were hampered in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso acquisition and persistence in tick zzso was impaired in zzso on zzso zzso zzso Together, our findings suggest an essential role for the zzso complement cascade in zzso zzso and demonstrate how a zzso pathogen zzso a zzso protein to facilitate early zzso infection and zzso zzso
