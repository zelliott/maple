Four rice zzso zzso zzso zzso genes have been zzso The rice zzso genes show a conservation of zzso number and position that is characteristic of plant zzso zzso comparisons revealed that the plant zzso generally have a high degree of zzso and zzso sequence zzso However, one rice zzso gene has a much higher degree of zzso sequence identity to a previously isolated zzso sequence from zzso zzso than to any other plant zzso zzso This leads us to suggest that the two sequences may represent functionally zzso genes which arose from an ancient zzso gene lineage that was separated by the divergence of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso analysis showed that the rice zzso gene family contains at least eight unique zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that individual rice zzso genes can display different patterns of transcript zzso The observed differences in sequence and transcript zzso patterns suggest that the individual rice zzso genes may differ in their zzso regulation and/or cellular zzso
