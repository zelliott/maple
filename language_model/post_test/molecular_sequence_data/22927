Three zzso zzso zzso that developed accelerated AIDS after virus zzso along with three control zzso were followed for evolution of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from plasma samples collected at weeks 6, 12, and 20 zzso A zzso zzso in the viral zzso was amplified and cloned into a zzso zzso Between 5 and 10 clones were zzso at each time point from individual zzso The sequence analysis showed more zzso in the control animals compared to those seen in the zzso zzso The virus at different points did not separate completely in zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso was more apparent in the control zzso zzso diversity and divergence were significantly higher in the control zzso The control animals lost zzso sites more zzso These results suggest that zzso dependence diminished virus evolution in zzso zzso zzso and there was an inverse correlation between virus evolution and onset of clinical zzso
