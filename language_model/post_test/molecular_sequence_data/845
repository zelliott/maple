zzso similarity to characterized proteins provides testable functional hypotheses for less than 50% of the proteins identified by zzso sequencing zzso With structural zzso it is believed that structural similarities may give functional hypotheses for many of the remaining zzso 

We provide a systematic analysis of the zzso relationship in proteins using the novel concept of local zzso of protein zzso A local zzso is a small zzso of a protein which includes both zzso and long-range zzso We employ a library of commonly zzso local zzso general enough to assemble most existing protein zzso We then model the relationship between these local shapes and Gene zzso using zzso zzso Our zzso rule model offers zzso high resolution descriptions that combine local zzso and is able to discriminate functions even for functionally versatile folds such as the frequently occurring TIM barrel and zzso zzso By evaluating the zzso performance of the model, we provide a comprehensive zzso of the zzso relationship based only on local structure zzso Our findings are, among others, that zzso structure is a stronger prerequisite for zzso activity than for binding zzso and that zzso predictions complement zzso zzso The model is capable of generating correct zzso as confirmed by a literature study, even when no significant sequence similarity to characterized proteins zzso 

Our approach offers a new and complete description and zzso of the zzso relationship in zzso By demonstrating how our predictions offer higher sensitivity than using global structure, and complement the use of zzso we show that the presented ideas could advance the development of zzso in function zzso
