zzso viruses attach to host cells by binding to terminal zzso acid zzso on zzso or zzso Both the linkage of zzso and the identity of other carbohydrates within the zzso are thought to play roles in restricting the host range of the zzso In this study, the zzso specificity of an zzso avian influenza virus zzso protein that has recently infected man zzso strain zzso has been zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso expression system that allows facile and safe analysis of the zzso binding specificity of zzso of zzso zzso engineered at sites that are predicted to effect a switch in host range has also been zzso
