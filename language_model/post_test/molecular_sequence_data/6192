A simple and efficient method to generate zzso DNA fragments from a trace amount of zzso DNA isolated by zzso is zzso After zzso zzso of the gel slice containing the resolved zzso zzso the zzso DNA is zzso with zzso and a compatible zzso zzso duplex zzso zzso A probe is generated by zzso amplification using a primer complementary to the zzso with a single zzso zzso incorporated at the zzso zzso When used as a FISH probe, this material yields mapping results superior to zzso or whole zzso labeling methods and allows sensitive detection of zzso
