We present the synthesis and the study of properties of a new series of modified zzso namely zzso zzso zzso of this class zzso and zzso were prepared from the previously known zzso using the zzso zzso The comparison of the zzso properties of zzso and its natural analog zzso with respect to four zzso indicates that the former is much more resistant than the zzso Such resistance to zzso in addition to relatively high zzso values for zzso zzso with zzso show that these new zzso are good candidates for potential zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso have been also evaluated as non sequence specific zzso of zzso reverse zzso All available zzso based primarily on zzso zzso are consistent with the binding of zzso and zzso to zzso at a site which is different from the zzso site of the zzso
