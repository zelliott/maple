zzso (target of zzso protein zzso were identified in zzso zzso and zzso as central controllers of cell growth in response to zzso and growth zzso Here we show that zzso zzso possesses a single zzso gene zzso a protein able to complex with zzso zzso zzso protein and zzso despite the zzso of zzso zzso growth to zzso Analysis of two zzso zzso zzso shows that disruption of zzso leads to the premature arrest of zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso fusion of zzso with the zzso reporter gene allows us to show that zzso is expressed in primary zzso zzso and zzso but not in differentiated zzso The implications of these features for the plant zzso zzso are zzso
