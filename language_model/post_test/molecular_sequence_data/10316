There has been speculation that the zzso zzso reaction mechanism may involve the formation of an zzso zzso A zzso zzso motif that is zzso throughout the zzso zzso family, and is present also in the zzso zzso contains the only two zzso zzso The functional role of this motif in zzso zzso was zzso by using a zzso zzso strategy to generate all seven possible zzso zzso single, double and triple zzso zzso analyses of these zzso zzso demonstrated that the zzso motif is not essential for zzso thereby excluding an zzso intermediate from the reaction zzso The kinetic analyses support, however, substantial roles for the zzso motif in zzso binding and zzso zzso
