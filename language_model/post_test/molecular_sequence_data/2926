We have isolated a zzso zzso clone for human zzso zzso zzso zzso is a distinct zzso protein of the zzso large specific zzso known primarily for its ability to induce zzso paralysis, and central nervous system cellular zzso in experimental animals zzso zzso The open reading frame encodes a zzso acid mature zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso leader zzso The sequence of the mature zzso is identical to that reported for human urinary zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Iwama, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Dekker, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso 27, zzso and to the zzso sequence of human liver zzso zzso zzso Tucker, zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso encodes a zzso in position 7, which was previously unidentified in the zzso acid sequences of zzso or the urinary and liver zzso Both zzso and the related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have zzso zzso sequence similarities among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from liver, zzso and zzso and zzso define a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso zzso cells and was zzso in cells induced toward zzso differentiation with zzso growth factor zzso 5 and toward zzso differentiation with zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in mature zzso even though zzso zzso activity is not found in zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso contain a protein that is closely related or identical to zzso
