The zzso zzso and its cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA binding zzso that control the expression of certain target genes in immature zzso zzso Here, we report the isolation of a zzso chicken zzso chicken zzso We show that expression of zzso unlike that of zzso is not restricted to zzso cells, suggesting that zzso functions in a broader spectrum of cell types than zzso We have identified the authentic chicken zzso protein as a nuclear protein of approximately 110 zzso We show that the zzso protein specifically recognizes zzso binding sites in zzso and that binding is zzso by an zzso located DNA binding zzso Although zzso protein recognizes zzso binding sites, zzso fails to zzso several zzso gene zzso as well as the zzso zzso gene zzso Instead, we find that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso most likely by competing with other zzso proteins for binding zzso Our results raise the possibility that zzso is an zzso member of the zzso zzso
