zzso zzso X is zzso in current maps of the zzso of the domestic dog ( zzso zzso To address this problem, we have constructed a zzso zzso DNA library in zzso from zzso canine zzso X zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed that the library was highly enriched for zzso zzso zzso containing zzso were identified and zzso Database searches detected significant sequence identity between four zzso clones and genes previously characterized in other zzso zzso markers derived from these clones were mapped on zzso X by zzso and of these, 28 were mapped by using the zzso zzso zzso radiation hybrid zzso panel zzso zzso Four zzso canine genes from publicly available data were also zzso Eight zzso linkage groups with zzso zzso were identified, and FISH data were used to locate the groups on the zzso four groups could be zzso zzso by FISH zzso In each case, the FISH and zzso data were mutually zzso The data suggest strongly zzso zzso between canine and human X zzso The zzso region has been further zzso and the putative or actual locations of nine genes of clinical relevance have been zzso
