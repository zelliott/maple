Little is known about the zzso of birth size zzso among zzso zzso and nutritional factors have been zzso but familial zzso suggests genetic factors as zzso As a first step in testing this hypothesis, we examined common sequence zzso in zzso and zzso two genes involved in the regulation of growth and subject to parental zzso The zzso gene was scanned with five zzso spanning the coding and zzso for possible association with birth size in a set of 97 normal newborns in zzso In addition, a silent zzso in zzso zzso 2 was similarly tested as an exploratory first zzso Birth weight and length were compared between groups of newborns divided according to which zzso they had received from zzso zzso No significant differences were found between zzso in either zzso examined either by parental origin or in zzso Thus, we found no evidence that zzso zzso zzso zzso growth within the normal zzso If such zzso exist in zzso they are not in linkage zzso with the marker zzso
