Plant growth and productivity are greatly affected by water stress, such as drought and zzso Here we report on the cloning and expression analysis of a water zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso number zzso by rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso The full-length zzso of zzso consisted of 594 zzso and contained a 285 zzso open reading frame zzso zzso a zzso zzso The deduced protein had a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso and an zzso point of zzso The sequence similarity and comparative analysis showed that zzso was zzso identical to zzso zzso putative water zzso protein zzso zzso number zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that zzso was a zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that the expression of zzso was zzso by zzso acid zzso zzso zzso drought, salicylic acid zzso and hydrogen zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso is extremely related to the zzso stress in zzso zzso
