We have investigated the origin of zzso breeds through the joint analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a sample of pigs and wild zzso with a worldwide zzso zzso differentiation between pigs and wild zzso was remarkably weak, likely as a consequence of a sustained gene flow between both zzso The analysis of nuclear markers evidenced the existence of a close genetic relationship between Near Eastern and European wild zzso making it difficult to zzso their relative contributions to the gene pool of modern European zzso Moreover, we have shown that European and Far Eastern pig populations have contributed maternal and paternal lineages to the foundation of African and South American zzso Although West African pigs from Nigeria and zzso exclusively zzso European zzso Far Eastern and European genetic signatures of similar intensity were detected in zzso breeds from Eastern zzso This region seems to have been a major point of entry of livestock species in the African continent as a result of the Indian Ocean zzso Finally, South American zzso breeds had essentially a European ancestry although Asian zzso and zzso zzso were found in a few zzso zzso The existence of Spanish and Portuguese commercial routes linking Asia with America might have favored the introduction of Far Eastern breeds into this zzso
