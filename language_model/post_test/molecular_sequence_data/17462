The zzso protein is a zzso outer membrane zzso specified by large, usually zzso zzso zzso Two biological activities have been associated with the zzso zzso prevention of zzso of cells carrying identical or closely related zzso zzso by blocking the formation of stable mating zzso and zzso resistance to the zzso activities of serum, possibly by zzso the correct assembly or efficient functioning of the terminal membrane attack complex of zzso The protein therefore interacts not only with components of the outer membrane but also with specific external zzso In zzso plasmids the zzso gene lies within the region necessary for the zzso transfer of DNA zzso although its expression is not necessarily dependent on the expression of other zzso zzso Recently, however, the gene has been discovered in isolation from other zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso providing further evidence that the zzso protein may have a role in zzso The zzso sequences of several zzso genes have been determined, and comparison of the corresponding zzso acid sequences suggests that a central region of five zzso acid zzso flanked by zzso zzso determines the specificity of the protein in surface zzso Additionally, studies of zzso with different zzso acid zzso within the zzso zzso have shown that zzso of charged zzso zzso normal outer membrane zzso This review considers our current knowledge of the distribution, structure, and biological zzso of the zzso Recent applications of the protein in studies of the unusual zzso properties of the outer membrane and for the transport of foreign zzso zzso to the bacterial cell surface are also zzso
