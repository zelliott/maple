The contribution of the zzso zzso and zzso gene products in the recognition of zzso zzso zzso dust zzso by helper T cells isolated from an zzso individual zzso zzso zzso with perennial zzso was zzso Using a panel of zzso and zzso accessory cells, the restriction specificity obtained for a long term T cell suggested that a component of the dust zzso zzso repertoire recognized zzso in association with zzso gene zzso zzso DNA typing of the presenting cell panel demonstrated a correlation between the zzso zzso and T cell zzso zzso zzso expressing zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso presented zzso to both the T cell line and cloned T cells zzso derived from the line, indicating that the zzso specificity zzso was able to restrict recognition of dust zzso zzso Additional T cell clones zzso and zzso also isolated from the line were restricted by the products of the B1 gene locus zzso as determined by zzso zzso zzso with the appropriate zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in its restriction zzso also recognizing dust zzso presented by accessory cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso with zzso zzso genes and zzso B cell lines expressing zzso and zzso indicated that the functional site restricting recognition may be associated with zzso 70 and 71 of the DR beta chain zzso wall of the zzso combining zzso Furthermore, we have recently demonstrated that both T cell clones zzso and zzso induce zzso dependent zzso synthesis in zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
