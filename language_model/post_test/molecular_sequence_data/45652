Among a large number of zzso gene clusters in zzso zzso two gene families that appear to undergo concerted evolution were studied in zzso Both gene families are zzso specific and zzso small zzso proteins of unknown zzso For both families in three zzso species, concerted groups of genes are characterized by close zzso proximity and by genes in zzso zzso The rate of protein evolution in one of the two families could be zzso by comparison with a closely related zzso singleton gene with zzso zzso in all three zzso This comparison suggests that protein evolution in concerted gene clusters is two- to zzso zzso A broader survey of clustered gene families, focused on adjacent zzso gene pairs, identified an additional seven families in which concerted evolution probably zzso All nine identified families zzso relatively small zzso eight of them zzso putative zzso zzso and most of these have very unusual zzso acid composition or zzso I speculate that these genes zzso rapidly evolving zzso zzso
