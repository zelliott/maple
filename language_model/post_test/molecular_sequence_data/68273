zzso is a system in zzso cells that generates zzso and hydrogen zzso in the zzso zzso both of which are important for killing of the engulfed zzso zzso of this zzso results in the syndrome of chronic zzso disease, characterized by a profound predisposition to bacterial and zzso zzso A zzso b is the site of most of the zzso causing this zzso The zzso and zzso binding sites have been located on the beta zzso of this zzso the zzso half of which showed weak sequence similarity to other zzso including the zzso zzso zzso of known zzso This enabled us to build a model of the zzso binding zzso of the zzso using this structure as a zzso The model was built initially using a novel automatic modeling method based on zzso projection and then refined using energy zzso with appropriate zzso zzso zzso The resulting model rationalized much of the observed sequence conservation and identified a large zzso as a potential regulatory zzso It confirms the inclusion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as a member of the zzso family of zzso and strongly supports its function as the zzso electron transporting component of the zzso zzso
