We have identified two genes in the zzso database for zzso zzso that code for proteins with significant sequence similarity to the zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso The respective transcripts were cloned from a mixed stage zzso library from zzso zzso The corresponding proteins obtained after zzso expression in insect cells zzso standard zzso zzso zzso including zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso The zzso activity was inhibited by zzso compounds originally designed to inhibit the zzso zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso using the most potent of these compounds resulted in elevated levels of the zzso in the zzso These results suggest that the zzso are involved in the metabolism of possible zzso signaling molecules in zzso zzso
