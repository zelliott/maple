Recently we isolated a zzso zzso a tobacco plasma membrane zzso channel protein zzso zzso with a putative zzso zzso zzso Here we analyzed in detail the interaction of zzso with zzso A full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso insect cells, and the corresponding tobacco membrane protein were zzso from their respective membrane zzso and partially zzso by zzso affinity zzso zzso was detected in the zzso zzso using specific zzso raised against the zzso zzso By binding zzso to zzso zzso zzso fused to zzso zzso we identified a single region consisting of 66 zzso acids capable of binding zzso A 23 zzso acid synthetic zzso from within this region formed a complex with zzso in the presence of zzso We measured the zzso of zzso interacting with this zzso which revealed a zzso constant of about 8 zzso The zzso zzso domain was found to perfectly coincide with a zzso zzso zzso motif of its putative zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, a 23 zzso acid region in an equivalent site in the zzso domain of a zzso protein zzso regulatory zzso was also found to bind zzso Thus, coinciding zzso and zzso zzso zzso may serve as a point of communication between calcium and zzso zzso signal zzso pathways in plants and zzso
