Genes from zzso zzso have been identified that zzso proteins zzso to zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso origin recognition complex zzso The abundance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso regulated and is greatest during the earliest stages of zzso zzso with the highest rate of DNA zzso zzso of zzso nuclear extracts revealed that zzso is found in a tightly associated complex with five additional zzso much like the zzso zzso These studies will enable direct testing of the zzso model of replication in a zzso
