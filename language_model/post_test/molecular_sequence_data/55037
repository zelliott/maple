The in zzso DNA binding profile of zzso zzso zzso factor zzso was analyzed by a novel approach employing a genetic library of beads and flow zzso zzso An artificial library with 22 zzso zzso was constructed and subjected to a zzso binding reaction with zzso zzso DNA fragments with potential zzso sites were labeled with zzso zzso to be enriched by flow zzso through 5 rounds of successive zzso Finally, a binding motif with a single zzso zzso was obtained from DNA fragments showing weak zzso zzso while another motif with dual zzso triplets was discovered with stronger binding zzso An zzso zzso zzso was found to exist only in the promoter region of highly zzso zzso These results suggest that this system is a powerful tool for the rapid and comprehensive analysis of the binding preferences of zzso zzso
