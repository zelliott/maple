zzso evidence has pointed to an important role of zzso in cell cycle regulation, especially for M zzso In the current studies, we have obtained evidence through in zzso studies that the master M phase regulator zzso B zzso zzso the zzso machinery component zzso leading to its enhanced zzso zzso First, we show that zzso B, but not many other cell cycle zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso specifically enhances zzso zzso Second, zzso B zzso the zzso machinery component zzso but not zzso or zzso Third, zzso zzso zzso exhibits increased zzso activity and elevated zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Fourth, zzso B enhances zzso activity through zzso of zzso at zzso zzso These studies demonstrate for the first time that the cell zzso zzso zzso B zzso a zzso machinery component to increase its overall zzso activity, suggesting that zzso is part of the cell cycle program orchestrated by zzso through zzso
