zzso TAP and its zzso zzso zzso are involved in the export of zzso zzso from the zzso TAP has also been implicated in the export of zzso type D viral zzso bearing the zzso transport element zzso Although TAP directly interacts with zzso zzso the mode of interaction of zzso with cellular zzso is different from that with the zzso zzso and is likely to be zzso by zzso zzso Here we show that zzso directly interacts with zzso an essential zzso zzso zzso This interaction is zzso zzso as zzso also interacts with zzso zzso expression in zzso cells implicates zzso p in the export of cellular zzso Database searches revealed that zzso belongs to an zzso zzso family of zzso proteins having more than one member in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and at least one member in several species including zzso The zzso members of the family directly interact with zzso Because members of this protein family are characterized by the presence of one zzso zzso domain and exhibit zzso activity, we called these proteins zzso for zzso and export factor binding zzso Thus, zzso and members of the zzso family of zzso proteins may facilitate the interaction of zzso with cellular zzso
