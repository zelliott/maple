zzso is a zzso zzso assembly comprised of two, zzso zzso rings that, when associated with its zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso form the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The symmetry mismatch is an absolute feature of this large zzso zzso and also of the zzso which shares a similar zzso architecture, but how it is zzso within the complex has yet to be zzso despite recent structural zzso due in part to the zzso zzso of the zzso We present the structures of zzso coli zzso to zzso and an inactive zzso that provide some clues for how this might be zzso In the wild type zzso the highly zzso zzso 20 zzso can be grouped into two major structural zzso In the first, a loop formed by zzso zzso zzso out of the central access channel extending approximately zzso from the surface of the zzso resulting in the closing of the access channel observed in one zzso Similar zzso are implied to be exclusively observed in human zzso and a zzso of zzso from zzso zzso In the other ring, a second class of loop is visible in the structure of zzso zzso from zzso coli that forms closer to zzso 16 and faces toward the interior of the zzso creating an open zzso of the access zzso In both classes, zzso zzso provide a zzso interaction zzso In the inactive zzso a third class of zzso zzso is observed, which arises from a zzso change in the position of zzso We have performed a detailed functional analysis on each of the first 20 zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso that extend beyond the plane of the zzso zzso have a lesser effect on zzso interaction than those lining the pore zzso and zzso Based upon our zzso analysis, we present a model to explain the widely disparate effects of individual zzso on zzso complex formation and also a possible functional reason for this zzso
