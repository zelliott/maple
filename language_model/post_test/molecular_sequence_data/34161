A rare zzso zzso was identified in two human group A zzso strains designated as zzso and zzso that were detected in stool specimens from children with zzso in zzso zzso gene sequences of these two strains were identical and genetically closely related to zzso human zzso strains reported in European countries and the United zzso To our knowledge, this is the first report of detection of a zzso human zzso in zzso For further genetic analysis to zzso the origin of the zzso zzso nearly full-length sequences of all 11 zzso segments were determined for the zzso zzso The complete zzso constellation of zzso was determined as zzso a novel zzso constellation for human zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso and zzso genes of zzso clustered with zzso zzso human strains and some animal strains into zzso distinct from those of common zzso zzso human zzso On the other hand, zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed high sequence identities to the human zzso strain zzso and clustered with zzso and some zzso strains within the same zzso These findings suggested that the zzso human zzso detected in Japan may have occurred through zzso among uncommon zzso human zzso and zzso zzso zzso
