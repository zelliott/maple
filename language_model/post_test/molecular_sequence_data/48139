The zzso toxin and one zzso of zzso zzso designated zzso were zzso from a type D culture of zzso zzso by a newly established zzso and their zzso activities as well as that of zzso type C zzso toxin were zzso zzso analysis indicated that the free zzso forms a zzso with a molecular mass of approximately 200 zzso Type C and D zzso toxins zzso human zzso in the same zzso Their zzso zzso were dramatically reduced by employing zzso that had been previously treated with zzso zzso or zzso K, and were inhibited by the addition of zzso acid to the reaction zzso In a zzso test to zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso such as zzso A and/or B prepared from the zzso both toxins bound to zzso and zzso but bound to neither neutral zzso nor zzso On the basis of these results, it was concluded that type C and D 165 toxins bind to zzso through zzso zzso zzso showed no zzso activity, although it did bind to zzso We therefore speculate that binding to zzso rather than to zzso may be important in causing zzso by type C and D zzso zzso
