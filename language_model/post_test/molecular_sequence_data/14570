Currently, about 20 crystal structures per day are released and deposited in the zzso Data zzso A significant fraction of these structures is produced by research groups associated with the structural zzso zzso The biological function of many of these proteins is generally unknown or not validated by zzso zzso a growing need for functional prediction of protein structures has zzso Here we present an integrated zzso method that combines zzso relationships and three-dimensional zzso structural similarity of zzso regulators with computer prediction of their zzso DNA binding zzso We applied this method to the zzso family of zzso factors, which is a large family of zzso regulators found in many bacteria controlling the expression of genes involved in diverse biological zzso Three putative new members of this family with known zzso structure but unknown function were identified for which a probable functional zzso is zzso Our zzso analyses suggest that they could be involved in plant cell wall degradation zzso protein from zzso zzso zzso code zzso symbiotic nitrogen fixation zzso from zzso zzso zzso code zzso and either metabolism of zzso biomass or nitrogen fixation zzso from zzso zzso zzso code zzso
