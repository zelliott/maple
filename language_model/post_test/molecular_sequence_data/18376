A zzso acid zzso corresponding to a common part of the 40 and 46 zzso forms of human zzso zzso zzso was coupled to zzso zzso zzso zzso and used as zzso in zzso After a cycle of four zzso zzso able to recognize the zzso acid zzso as evaluated in zzso zzso were zzso by an zzso with the zzso immobilized on zzso zzso and used in Western zzso employing a secondary zzso zzso and zzso protein A as indicator zzso zzso obtained using extracts from human and mouse cells treated for 15 zzso with zzso as zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso recognize several forms of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These zzso therefore represent a useful tool for monitoring the induction of the above zzso
