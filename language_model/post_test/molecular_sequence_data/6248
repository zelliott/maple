A zzso zzso structure was added to the zzso of an zzso zzso at the zzso by a zzso zzso zzso in order to enhance the zzso resistance of these zzso zzso The influence of this zzso on the zzso resistance, the binding affinity to a target zzso and the zzso efficiency of zzso zzso zzso zzso was compared to that of the parent zzso without the zzso The results showed that the zzso slightly decreased the binding affinity and consequently the zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso toward a target zzso but the much higher zzso resistance makes zzso zzso zzso good candidates as zzso zzso zzso for studies on zzso
