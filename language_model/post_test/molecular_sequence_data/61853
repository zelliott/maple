zzso zzso and/or deletions of zzso ( zzso gene with zzso to zzso on the X zzso are responsible for zzso zzso zzso in zzso In the present study, three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated by the screening of a zzso zzso library and expressed sequence tag zzso zzso The structural region involving motif II: zzso zzso according to human zzso motif zzso zzso and motif zzso zzso was zzso in the zzso zzso zzso motifs zzso and zzso were also zzso in the zzso zzso All three zzso genes were expressed during all stages of zzso zzso The expression of zzso was suppressed by dietary zzso zzso but the expression of zzso and that of zzso were not zzso zzso zzso showed a ubiquitous distribution of zzso and zzso while zzso was highly expressed in the zzso zzso In an analysis of zzso zzso zzso was localized to zzso zzso and zzso was localized predominately in the plasma membrane of zzso embryonic zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso promoter region, was completely lethal at an early stage of embryonic zzso The present study indicates that three zzso are likely involved in the zzso zzso of zzso
