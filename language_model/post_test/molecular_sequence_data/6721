zzso zzso are zzso proteins required for heavy metal tolerance in animals and zzso Recent results indicate that plants also possess functional zzso zzso Here we report the cloning and characterization of five zzso genes from zzso zzso The position of the single zzso in each gene is zzso The proteins zzso by these genes can be divided into two groups zzso and zzso based on the presence or absence of a central domain separating two zzso zzso Four of the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso are transcribed in zzso Several lines of evidence suggest that the fifth zzso zzso is zzso There is differential regulation of the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso is expressed highly in roots, moderately in leaves and is barely detected in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso are more abundant in leaves, zzso and in roots from mature plants, but are also detected in roots of young plants, and in zzso zzso zzso is strongly induced in zzso by zzso whereas zzso zzso is relatively abundant in this tissue and levels increase only slightly upon exposure to zzso zzso and zzso are located within 2 zzso of each other and have been mapped to zzso zzso zzso and zzso map to separate zzso on zzso zzso and zzso is located on zzso zzso The locations of these zzso genes are different from that of zzso a gene involved in cadmium tolerance in zzso
