Two zzso zzso zzso zzso elements occur in zzso zzso A zzso mobility zzso zzso was developed for the rapid characterization of sequence diversity in a zzso zzso of the small zzso element of zzso with either a natural sequence from zzso zzso or a synthetic sequence as reference zzso The zzso zzso was generated from 265 samples of whole feces zzso from humans and 18 from livestock with zzso zzso zzso 1 or 2, 4 from humans with zzso zzso and 1 from a human with zzso zzso The zzso method identified 21 patterns in zzso zzso (8 in zzso 1, 12 in zzso 2, and a type common to both zzso 4 patterns in zzso zzso and 1 pattern in zzso zzso All patterns were confirmed as distinct by DNA zzso For zzso 1, a single zzso type was found in zzso of zzso 64 of 65 cases from three zzso outbreaks, all 16 cases from eight zzso outbreaks, and 17 of 28 sporadic zzso Among the remaining 11 sporadic cases due to zzso 1, seven other zzso types were zzso For zzso 2, a single zzso type was found in zzso of zzso 36 of 43 cases from three zzso outbreaks, 11 of 15 cases from seven zzso outbreaks, 44 of 75 sporadic cases, and all 18 samples from zzso Within the zzso outbreaks, two other zzso types were zzso the same zzso type was detected in samples from cases within the same zzso Among the sporadic cases due to zzso 2, 10 additional zzso types were zzso
