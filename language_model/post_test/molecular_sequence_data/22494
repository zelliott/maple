Most zzso zzso express a zzso 5 or 8 zzso zzso zzso However, zzso of human zzso and up to zzso of bovine strains of zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso to zzso types 1, 2, 5 or zzso A vaccine that targets the zzso zzso zzso would not protect against zzso zzso The aim of this study was to characterize zzso zzso zzso zzso at the molecular level to explain their lack of type 5 or 8 capsule zzso The zzso locus was present in all 22 zzso clinical zzso from humans, eight of 21 bovine zzso and in all eight zzso zzso zzso strains positive for the zzso transcript had zzso within essential capsule genes and could be zzso in zzso zzso zzso strains with reduced zzso transcript had zzso within the zzso promoter, decreased zzso levels, or a truncated zzso gene zzso More than one zzso was identified in several zzso The zzso locus was replaced by zzso in 13 of 21 zzso bovine zzso of zzso zzso Lack of capsule expression in zzso zzso zzso can be explained by multiple mechanisms, and the data argue against the existence of capsule zzso other than 1, 2, 5 and zzso
