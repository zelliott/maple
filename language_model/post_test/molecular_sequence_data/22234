zzso zzso zzso from ripe zzso zzso zzso zzso fruit was zzso by a combination of zzso exchange and gel zzso zzso into three forms, zzso zzso 1, 2 and zzso The zzso zzso zzso 2, was probably a zzso with a native molecular mass of about 170 zzso and 52 zzso zzso and an estimated zzso of zzso The zzso zzso zzso acid sequence shared high identity zzso with the deduced sequence of a zzso zzso clone zzso a putative zzso zzso as well as with an zzso zzso zzso zzso clone zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso zzso activity increased zzso with zzso loss and this increase was largely ascribed to zzso zzso The protein level of zzso 2 as estimated by zzso was low in developing fruits and generally increased with zzso zzso 2 also had the ability to markedly zzso increased zzso zzso and zzso while the zzso were still structurally attached to the cell walls zzso in part, the changes that occur during zzso The close correlation between texture changes, zzso 2 activity and protein levels as well as capability to modify intact cell walls suggest that the zzso might contribute to zzso fruit softening during zzso The zzso mechanism of zzso 2 action as a softening zzso was discussed in terms of its functional capacity as a zzso or perhaps, as a zzso
