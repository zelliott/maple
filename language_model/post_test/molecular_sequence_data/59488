zzso levels of expression of complement C4 vary in individuals but it is unknown whether this is due to gene copy number, protein clearance rates or differences in zzso To investigate whether differences in the promoter region may influence zzso of the C4 zzso we zzso the promoter region of the zzso gene from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared this with an equivalent zzso zzso The promoter regions of the C4 genes were highly zzso indicating that zzso differences are zzso An unusual feature of the alignment was the higher level of zzso in the zzso genes past the zzso of zzso in a region where the highest conservation would be zzso
