The zzso sequencing and structural characterization of a gene zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso is zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed four open reading frames designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso from zzso zzso and is situated between two zzso zzso and zzso Genes zzso zzso and zzso are transcribed in the same direction, while zzso is transcribed in the opposite zzso By comparing the zzso acid sequence of the zzso from zzso zzso with other zzso it appears that the zzso is a member of the zzso zzso The proteins of this family have an zzso barrel super secondary zzso The zzso of the zzso was predicted by zzso zzso The zzso of the secondary structures of the zzso resembles the structure of barley zzso but the primary structure resembles most closely the zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and calcium binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso are zzso
