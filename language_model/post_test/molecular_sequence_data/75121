Two new zzso beta zzso peptides have been detected in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Previously, it was reported that zzso beta 4 can be found in various species, from zzso to zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1983) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, zzso and zzso from zzso zzso contain no zzso beta 4 but a similar zzso without zzso The zzso from zzso zzso zzso from a zzso column about 5 zzso later than zzso beta zzso The zzso from zzso zzso referred to as zzso beta zzso can hardly be distinguished from zzso beta 4 by its retention time on zzso by zzso acid analysis, its zzso point, or zzso zzso zzso acid analyses of the zzso fragments, however, have revealed that zzso beta 4 and beta zzso are zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso beta zzso is zzso zzso beta 4 and beta zzso differ in the zzso acid zzso at positions 15, 40, and zzso At position 15 zzso is replaced by zzso and at zzso the sequence is zzso instead of zzso Depending on their size, zzso zzso contain between zzso and zzso zzso zzso beta zzso which is comparable to the amount of zzso in zzso
