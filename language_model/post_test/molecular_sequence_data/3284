zzso by the zzso zzso zzso is an important zzso anchor modification of zzso and viral zzso zzso prediction of zzso zzso from the zzso protein sequence alone is necessary for large-scale sequence zzso projects but it requires a low rate of false positive hits in addition to a sufficient zzso Our previous analysis of zzso protein sequence zzso zzso sequences and zzso structures has revealed motif properties in addition to the known zzso motif that are zzso in a new predictor described zzso The composite prediction function (with separate ad hoc zzso zzso for queries from zzso zzso and their viruses and zzso for sequences from zzso zzso consists of terms evaluating zzso acid type preferences at sequences positions close to the N zzso as well as terms zzso zzso from the physical property pattern of zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso correlation within the motif zzso The zzso has been validated with a zzso and two zzso tests for the learning set as well as with kinetic data for model zzso The sensitivity in recognizing documented zzso zzso is above 95 % for both zzso zzso The corresponding rate of false positive prediction (for sequences with an zzso zzso zzso is close to zzso zzso thus, the technique is zzso for large-scale automated sequence database zzso The predictor is available as public zzso with the zzso zzso Additionally, we propose a version of the predictor that identifies a number of zzso protein processing sites at internal zzso zzso and that evaluates possible zzso zzso of the protein zzso scan of public protein databases revealed new potential zzso targets for which the zzso modification may be of critical importance for biological zzso Among others, the list includes zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso 4, zzso interacting proteins zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso calcium sensor zzso and of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of complete zzso zzso indicate that about zzso % of all zzso proteins are apparent zzso zzso except for a higher fraction in zzso zzso ( approximately zzso zzso
