The screening of the open reading frames identified in the whole zzso zzso has allowed us to discover 34 proteins belonging to the zzso carrier zzso By zzso study, they can be divided into 27 zzso including zzso zzso and zzso carriers, putative zzso and zzso carriers and 22 new zzso zzso predictions using the zzso inside zzso approach have shown that the zzso carriers are similarly oriented with both zzso exposed to the zzso In each zzso a strict conservation of the charged zzso in the six zzso zzso is observed, suggesting a functional role for these zzso and the existence of 27 functionally distinct zzso
