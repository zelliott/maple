zzso evidence indicates that copy number zzso zzso have great relevance to common human zzso In zzso clinical zzso are related to zzso specifically copy number changes in the human zzso gene zzso zzso are available for zzso screening of unknown zzso zzso and also for targeted zzso zzso at zzso associated with genetic zzso Here we describe a universal quantitative approach based on zzso real-time quantitative zzso chain reaction for accurate determination of copy numbers at multiple particular gene zzso We used the zzso gene as a model system, obtaining the zzso and sensitivity to analyze different gene copies and testing 95 DNA samples with 16 different known zzso Our results showed that this approach has high sensitivity and low standard zzso for correctly zzso DNA samples containing different copy numbers of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Our method is zzso simple, and reliable, and it could be used to simultaneously screen for zzso deletions or zzso Moreover, it has potential as a versatile technology for the rapid zzso of known zzso in a targeted zzso
