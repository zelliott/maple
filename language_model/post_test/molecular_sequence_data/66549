zzso of the zzso body via the sequential formation of zzso is an important process in zzso This sequential process is governed by the zzso and regulation of zzso molecular zzso by zzso growth factor and zzso acid zzso zzso In this study, we identified zzso a novel gene of zzso zzso expressed specifically in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso zzso zzso shifted the developing zzso front and altered the expression of genes that regulate molecular zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso also zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso active zzso of the zzso zzso zzso subsequently reduced the altered zzso zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso is essential for zzso zzso activity and differentiation of the zzso zzso during zzso zzso
