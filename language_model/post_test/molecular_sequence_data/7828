The distribution of two common DNA zzso zzso untranslated zzso 1 and zzso zzso of the zzso III zzso gene was studied in three ethnic groups in zzso 251 Chinese, 221 zzso Indians and 102 zzso The zzso were identified by the zzso chain reaction and size zzso in zzso zzso The zzso untranslated to zzso 1 zzso is a length zzso while the zzso 5 zzso is a restriction site zzso zzso The frequency of the short zzso zzso of the zzso to zzso 1 length zzso of the zzso gene was found to be zzso in the Chinese, zzso in the zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso For the Chinese, this was significantly lower compared to the Caucasians and Indians zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso of zzso did not vary significantly among these three populations zzso zzso zzso The distribution of different zzso at these two zzso of the zzso gene was in zzso equilibrium in all three ethnic zzso A strong linkage zzso between these two zzso was observed in all the ethnic groups and the estimated correlation zzso zzso was zzso in the Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso Indians zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were, respectively, zzso zzso and zzso in the Chinese, zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso Indians and zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
