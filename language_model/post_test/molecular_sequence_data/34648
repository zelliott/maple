Human zzso zzso zzso zzso was consistently associated with increased risk for zzso zzso zzso in Chinese zzso Previously we have reported that an zzso virus zzso strain carrying an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso is prevalent in zzso in southern China and Taiwan zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso has zzso selectively involved one of the two anchor zzso in position 2 zzso zzso and an additional zzso in position 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso were carried out in the present zzso The stabilization zzso on zzso cells indicated that the zzso zzso zzso zzso prevalent in zzso binds to zzso zzso molecules less efficiently than the zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso binding of the zzso zzso molecules with added peptides was zzso In ex zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso from zzso donors revealed that the zzso zzso was able to lyse zzso B cells expressing zzso zzso whereas the zzso recognition was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso responses, measured both by zzso zzso and zzso zzso after zzso zzso also indicated that the zzso zzso zzso failed to give an zzso zzso The zzso response was almost entirely restricted to those zzso zzso These results show that zzso zzso from zzso of southern China and Taiwan is dominated by an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso which would allow the virus to resist immune recognition and may in part contribute to the prevalence of zzso in these zzso
