Vitamin D3 receptors zzso bind as zzso with zzso X receptors zzso to vitamin D response elements zzso and zzso gene expression in a zzso zzso These elements are tandem direct repeats zzso of the zzso zzso separated by three zzso zzso We determined whether this zzso was the optimal and/or only recognition zzso by zzso binding site selection with zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a pool of random zzso We derived a consensus binding site for zzso zzso zzso zzso and analyzed 10 of the 45 sequences zzso by zzso zzso interference and zzso zzso all the sequences were specific and acted as positive zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with the zzso the zzso of the third T in the second motif to a G did not influence zzso zzso Thus, the selectivity of vitamin D zzso involving zzso rather than zzso is not due to internal sequence zzso Except for mouse zzso zzso the natural zzso would be efficient, only when helped by adjacent sequences and/or zzso other than zzso and zzso
