The zzso zzso is known to play central roles in the growth of many zzso However, little is known regarding its distribution in higher zzso Here, we report the spatial distribution pattern of zzso (a regulatory zzso zzso and C2 (a zzso of the zzso zzso in rice ( zzso zzso zzso zzso as determined by in zzso zzso The transcripts were abundantly zzso in the zzso and marginal zzso of shoots and zzso Interestingly, these transcripts also accumulated in the leaf and zzso zzso of the shoot zzso Our results suggest that the zzso zzso is zzso distributed among various zzso and may be involved not only in cell division but also in organ formation in higher zzso
