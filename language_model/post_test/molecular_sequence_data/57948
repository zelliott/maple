zzso growth factor 1 zzso is involved in the regulation of brain development and has been suggested as an zzso zzso of brain tumor cell zzso This study demonstrates the expression of IGF-1 in tumor tissue from human zzso and one zzso Using zzso expression of an zzso zzso was localized in tumor cells of 6 of the 9 zzso examined as well as the zzso From one zzso zzso (which showed strong IGF-1 zzso the IGF-1 transcripts were characterized after isolation of zzso followed by amplification using the reverse zzso chain zzso Two IGF-1 complementary zzso resulting from alternative zzso of the IGF-1 primary transcript were zzso These transcripts zzso two different precursor proteins which zzso to zzso IGF-1 and zzso zzso The significance of IGF-1 alternative zzso zzso pathways remains to be zzso
