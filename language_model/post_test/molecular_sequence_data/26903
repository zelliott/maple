The zzso of folded proteins via the zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated to prevent the futile export of inactive zzso zzso is part of a class of zzso zzso that play a role in preventing certain zzso proteins from premature zzso zzso from zzso coli has been zzso in space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, in the presence of a small zzso The structure has been solved by molecular replacement to a resolution of zzso A and refined to an R factor of zzso There are four molecules in the zzso unit that may mimic a higher order structure in zzso There appears to be density for the zzso in a predicted binding pocket, which lends support to its role as the zzso surface for this class of zzso
