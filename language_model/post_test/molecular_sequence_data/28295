zzso zzso zzso is essential for both zzso and zzso growth of the zzso zzso zzso However, a zzso lacking zzso zzso could be obtained by replacing the natural zzso gene with the corresponding gene from zzso zzso a zzso zzso This treatment produced an zzso whose growth depended on the activity of the structurally and functionally dissimilar foreign zzso As a further consequence of this zzso replacement, the zzso also lacked microscopically zzso zzso the zzso inclusion bodies in which the zzso zzso naturally zzso The zzso dependent on a zzso with an inferior relative specificity for CO2 versus zzso and apparently lacking zzso is extremely sensitive to the zzso ratio supplied during growth and is unable to grow at all in zzso This response to the gas composition should prove useful for selection of various zzso zzso zzso zzso with altered zzso for CO2 and zzso
