A zzso zzso gene zzso from the zzso DNA of an zzso zzso zzso was found to code for a functional zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence including the structural gene and the zzso and 3' zzso sequences of the zzso gene have been zzso An open reading frame starting from zzso zzso zzso zzso 402 zzso gave a zzso of 133 zzso acids of calculated molecular mass zzso zzso The occurrence of three potential zzso sites in zzso gene is a unique feature for a gene of bacterial zzso The stop zzso was followed by hairpin loop structures indicating the presence of zzso termination zzso The secondary structure analysis of zzso predicted that the zzso was primarily formed of zzso zzso appeared to be a member of family zzso of zzso based on its molecular weight and basic zzso zzso However, sequence zzso revealed similar identity with families 10 and 11 of zzso The zzso zzso zzso where zzso is zzso or zzso was identified only in the zzso from zzso zzso Our results zzso for the first time the concept of zzso evolution for zzso and provide a basis for research in evolutionary relationship among the zzso from zzso and zzso zzso
