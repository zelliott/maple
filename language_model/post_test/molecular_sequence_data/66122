zzso protection against viral infection is best achieved by vaccination with attenuated zzso zzso zzso attenuated vaccine strains has traditionally been an empirical process, which greatly restricts the number of effective vaccines for viral zzso Here we describe a rational approach for engineering zzso attenuated viruses that can serve as safe and effective zzso Our approach exploits the observation that restricting viral population diversity by increasing replication zzso greatly reduces viral tissue zzso and zzso We show that zzso zzso with reduced genetic diversity elicit a protective immune response in an animal model of zzso Indeed, these novel vaccine candidates are comparable in efficacy to the currently available zzso type 1 vaccine strain, but have the added advantage of being more stable, as their increased replication zzso prevents zzso to the zzso zzso zzso We propose that restricting viral zzso diversity provides a general approach for the rational design of stable, attenuated vaccines for a wide variety of zzso
