Secondary metabolism involves a broad diversity of zzso reactions that result in a wide variety of biologically active zzso Terminal zzso formation during the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso expression of the unique zzso zzso zzso and incubation with a zzso zzso zzso These experiments provide evidence that the terminal zzso is formed from a carrier zzso zzso acid that is zzso to zzso This intermediate is transformed to an zzso by extension with zzso and subsequent zzso zzso by zzso The final steps of zzso assembly involve a highly similar zzso intermediate zzso to zzso a zzso of zzso which is transformed to an zzso by zzso zzso of zzso In this study, we also show that the zzso zzso of zzso A can be zzso in zzso to the formerly unknown free zzso acid by zzso expression of zzso in the zzso producer zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso can finally zzso the acid to give rise to the zzso zzso which is produced as the final product in the zzso A zzso zzso These experiments clarify the role of zzso and zzso during zzso zzso
