Nearly complete sequences of zzso zzso viruses zzso infecting 18 different nonhuman zzso species in sub-Saharan Africa have now been zzso yet, our understanding of the origins, evolutionary history, and geographic distribution of these viruses still remains zzso Here, we report the molecular characterization of a zzso zzso naturally infecting De zzso monkeys zzso zzso Complete zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were amplified from zzso blood zzso cell DNA of two zzso De zzso monkeys from zzso In addition, partial pol sequences zzso zzso were amplified from four offspring of De zzso monkeys originally caught in the wild in zzso zzso zzso zzso and partial pol zzso zzso zzso sequences were also amplified from zzso monkeys zzso zzso from zzso Analysis of these sequences identified a new zzso zzso zzso which differed from previously characterized zzso at 40 to 50% of sites in Pol protein zzso The viruses most closely related to zzso were zzso and members of the zzso group of viruses infecting greater zzso monkeys zzso zzso zzso monkeys zzso zzso and zzso monkeys zzso zzso zzso In zzso trees of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso clustered together, and this relationship was highly significant in all major coding zzso Members of this virus group also shared the same number of zzso zzso in their zzso envelope zzso and a zzso zzso binding site zzso in their zzso zzso zzso as well as a unique zzso response element in their viral long terminal zzso however, zzso and zzso unlike zzso zzso and zzso did not zzso a zzso zzso These data indicate that De zzso monkeys are naturally infected with zzso that this infection is prevalent in different areas of the zzso habitat, and that geographically diverse zzso strains cluster in a single virus zzso The consistent zzso of zzso with zzso and the zzso group also suggests that these viruses have evolved from a common zzso that likely infected a zzso host in the distant zzso The zzso gene appears to have been acquired by a subset of these zzso viruses after the divergence of zzso and zzso
