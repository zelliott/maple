The zzso protein is essential for the zzso of the zzso I zzso complex and acts at a zzso zzso The sequence of zzso is zzso in zzso algae, and plants and contains three zzso repeats zzso zzso have been shown to function as sites for zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso in the second and third zzso repeats lead to a modest decrease of zzso but they prevent zzso growth and cause enhanced light sensitivity even though the accumulated zzso complex is fully zzso This zzso can be reversed under zzso conditions and appears to be the result of zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso generated by random zzso of a zzso region near the zzso end of zzso was used in zzso experiments to show that zzso is required for zzso assembly but not for its zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso separated by two-dimensional gel zzso and zzso shows that zzso interacts directly with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not with zzso from other zzso zzso Thus, zzso appears to act as a zzso that interacts directly and specifically with at least two of the zzso zzso during assembly of the zzso zzso
