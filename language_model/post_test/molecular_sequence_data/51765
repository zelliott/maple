zzso was found to be a zzso of DNA zzso zzso by a DNA zzso zzso zzso complex on the zzso template and zzso zzso After complete primer extension in the presence of zzso under zzso of the reaction mixture, zzso of the template was zzso linked to the zzso zzso of the 165 zzso zzso of the DNA zzso zzso 59 zzso and 49 zzso zzso of the DNA zzso and an unknown protein with apparent molecular weight of 31 zzso was zzso By another way of protein labeling zzso was zzso bound to the zzso of the zzso under zzso zzso and then this zzso was introduced into the zzso of the zzso by the zzso activity of DNA zzso or DNA zzso In this case zzso labeling of the 165 zzso 49 zzso and 31 zzso zzso was zzso
