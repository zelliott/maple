zzso analysis of the L zzso zzso segment and predicted zzso L zzso protein of zzso zzso fever zzso virus zzso zzso family zzso demonstrates that they are approximately twice the size of those found in viruses of other zzso zzso The zzso virus L segment and zzso protein zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are similar in size and sequence to those of the zzso zzso virus zzso and zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso zzso The identification of an zzso tumor zzso zzso motif in the L protein zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and Nairobi sheep disease zzso indicates these proteins are members of the recently described zzso zzso family and suggests that these large proteins may be zzso that are zzso zzso or involved in zzso
