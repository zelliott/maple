Attempts to access antibiotics by capturing zzso genes and pathways directly from environmental DNA, which is overwhelmingly derived from zzso bacteria, have revealed a large and previously unknown family of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso reveals structural similarity to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The overall structure has a central beta sheet with alpha zzso on both zzso A bound product at a zzso in the beta sheet identifies the active site and the structural basis for zzso and sequence conservation in this region indicates a bias for recognition over zzso zzso interacts with an zzso carrier protein zzso and the structure, zzso and zzso zzso reveal that a small zzso pocket in alpha zzso 5 dominates binding of zzso to zzso The structural and zzso analyses suggest that the products of zzso could be bacterial signaling zzso
