The three-dimensional solution structure of the DNA binding domain zzso of the zzso X zzso alpha zzso zzso was determined by nuclear magnetic resonance zzso The two zinc fingers of the zzso zzso fold to form a single structural domain that consists of two zzso oriented zzso and that resembles the corresponding regions of the zzso and zzso receptors zzso and zzso zzso However, in contrast to the zzso of the zzso and zzso the zzso zzso contains an additional zzso immediately after the second zinc zzso This third zzso mediates both zzso and zzso interactions required for zzso zzso binding of the zzso zzso to zzso Identification of the third zzso in the zzso zzso thus defines a structural feature required for selective zzso of the zzso on hormone response elements composed of zzso zzso arranged as tandem zzso
