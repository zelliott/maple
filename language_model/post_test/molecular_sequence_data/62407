In zzso coli, the zzso zzso is the zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso at replication zzso It is composed of three zzso a small zzso zzso domain, a larger central domain responsible for zzso zzso and a zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso that interact with the zzso zzso zzso Presumably because of this interaction, it had not been possible previously to express the zzso domain in a zzso transformed zzso coli zzso This problem was overcome by expression of zzso under control of tandem zzso zzso and the protein was zzso in yields of 4-6 zzso of culture and studied by zzso A zzso spectrum of a zzso solution of the protein at pH zzso indicated that its structured core comprises zzso zzso This was consistent with sequence conservation among zzso related zzso zzso in a zzso spectrum of a zzso sample in zzso zzso pH zzso zzso zzso recorded at 36 degrees C, indicated the protein to be zzso zzso of zzso zzso obtained by the zzso zzso method were zzso zzso space group zzso with unit cell parameters zzso zzso and zzso beyond zzso resolution with zzso zzso
