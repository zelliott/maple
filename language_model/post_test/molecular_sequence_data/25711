In the human and bovine adrenal cortex, 17 zzso zzso zzso zzso reactions involved in the production of zzso (17 zzso and zzso zzso The bovine and human forms of zzso alpha share zzso primary sequence zzso Using naturally occurring restriction sites common to zzso zzso both human and bovine zzso zzso we have constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and bovine zzso zzso zzso that have been expressed in zzso 1 cells, and the zzso properties of the zzso zzso proteins have been zzso The three zzso zzso studied have 17 zzso activities intermediate between those of the zzso bovine and zzso human zzso although the zzso activity of these zzso is significantly lower than that of either of the zzso zzso Surprisingly, the opposite zzso zzso containing a human zzso zzso and a bovine zzso zzso are all virtually zzso even though they appear to be expressed at normal zzso These results indicate that the folding of zzso alpha initiated by the bovine zzso zzso can accommodate human zzso alpha sequences of various lengths to produce a relatively normal 17 zzso having decreased zzso zzso On the other hand, folding initiated by the human zzso alpha zzso zzso does not easily accommodate bovine zzso sequences to produce a functional zzso Presumably this difference arises from the fact that the zzso structures of the bovine and human forms of zzso alpha are sufficiently different so that zzso sequences will not lead to functional zzso in a predictable zzso
