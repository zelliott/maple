Both zzso and zzso hormones are known to regulate expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In order to determine whether these effects occur at the zzso level, zzso studies were conducted with a zzso zzso of the zzso region of the mouse zzso gene coupled to a zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso We demonstrated that the zzso zzso regulates expression of the mouse zzso zzso zzso construct in mouse zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso and quail zzso zzso cell zzso zzso analysis indicated that several areas of this zzso including a region containing a putative zzso response element zzso are involved in zzso zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso containing a putative zzso linked to the zzso zzso promoter of zzso zzso increased zzso induction of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of a zzso binding protein zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso data demonstrated that the putative zzso forms specific, zzso complexes with nuclear proteins from alpha zzso and zzso zzso Additional experiments indicated that zzso can zzso both zzso and zzso zzso activity in an zzso zzso These data provide evidence that the zzso region of the zzso gene contains sequences which mediate the effects of both zzso and zzso
