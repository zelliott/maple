The cell surface zzso tissue factor zzso zzso zzso by supporting the zzso zzso of factors X and IX as well as zzso to active zzso zzso Architectural similarity of zzso to the zzso zzso family suggests a zzso structure for zzso zzso zzso zzso Ala exchanges in the predicted surface loop demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are important for zzso zzso of side chain atoms at the zzso position decreased function, whereas the Ala exchange was zzso The dysfunctional zzso bound zzso with high affinity and fully supported the zzso of small zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso substitution was compatible with efficient zzso of factor X, whereas the zzso exchange and zzso in the zzso aspect of the predicted loop resulted in diminished zzso of factor zzso The specific plasma zzso activity of all functionally deficient zzso increased 7- to zzso upon the supplementation of zzso suggesting that zzso zzso zzso also provide important interactions that accelerate the zzso of zzso to zzso These data are consistent with assignment of the zzso zzso region as contributing to protein zzso recognition and zzso by the zzso zzso
