The zzso compositions of zzso zzso alpha zzso from intact zzso and free zzso were analyzed using a combination of chemical analysis, zzso affinity zzso and zzso zzso For direct compositional analysis, parallel samples were zzso in zzso acid and analyzed for zzso acid and neutral zzso without prior zzso zzso of the zzso was achieved by zzso on a zzso zzso column zzso at high zzso and the resolved zzso were zzso by zzso zzso zzso The amounts of sugar that were found relative to zzso indicated the presence of two zzso zzso per zzso on both zzso alpha and free zzso Free alpha contained zzso higher amounts of zzso acid and zzso as well as a higher amount of zzso than did zzso zzso Free alpha also contained a zzso higher amount of zzso than did zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of intact zzso alpha and free alpha molecules by zzso affinity zzso indicated that virtually all of the zzso zzso contained at least one zzso zzso site, whereas as many as zzso of the free alpha molecules could not bind to zzso zzso on Lens zzso zzso resulted in zzso binding of zzso alpha and approximately zzso binding of free alpha zzso of the zzso free alpha and zzso of the zzso free alpha bound to zzso zzso zzso treatment of zzso alpha released a portion of the zzso The zzso material appeared to be a zzso hybrid based on zzso properties and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso zzso free alpha was completely resistant to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso alpha with zzso resulted in the release of two zzso which could be separated into zzso and zzso zzso on the basis of size and zzso The collective data suggest that zzso alpha contains primarily zzso hybrid zzso structures and relatively little zzso In contrast, free alpha contains primarily zzso zzso structures, and most of the free alpha molecules contain at least one zzso with zzso attached to the zzso zzso zzso
