In the immune system, B cells, zzso cells, zzso cells, and T zzso all respond to signals received via zzso binding to receptors and zzso Although the specificity of T cell recognition is determined by the interaction of T cell receptors with zzso complexes, the development of T cells in the zzso and their sensitivity to zzso are also dependent on zzso molecules zzso (for zzso class I zzso and zzso (for zzso The zzso zzso is a potent zzso for T cell zzso but efforts to understand its function fully have been hampered by ignorance of the structural details of its interactions with zzso In this study we describe the structure of zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso A zzso The focus of the zzso interaction is the zzso loop zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso The beta zzso occupies a T cell membrane zzso position, defining the relative positions of the zzso and zzso zzso Unlike the zzso zzso zzso does not contact the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as the flexibility of the zzso CD loop facilitate the zzso zzso The structure resolves zzso data on the zzso of the zzso interaction, indicates that zzso is crucial in zzso the zzso zzso provides a framework for understanding the zzso role of zzso in zzso cell zzso and offers a tangible context for design of structurally altered zzso for tumor and viral zzso
