zzso are proteins that induce extension in isolated plant cell walls in zzso and have been proposed to disrupt zzso interactions between zzso and cellulose zzso Because the plant primary cell wall acts as a constraint to cell enlargement, this process may be integral to plant cell expansion, and studies of zzso have focused on their role in zzso We report the identification of an zzso zzso from tomato that exhibits high levels of zzso abundance and is specifically expressed in zzso fruit, a zzso period when growth has ceased but when selective zzso of cell wall components is zzso zzso closely related to zzso were also identified in zzso zzso and zzso suggesting that they are a common feature of fruit undergoing rapid zzso Furthermore, the sequence of zzso and its zzso from other zzso fruit define a zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso is regulated by zzso a hormone known to coordinate and induce zzso in many zzso zzso is zzso expressed in the zzso tomato zzso zzso zzso and nor, and zzso abundance appears to be influenced directly by zzso and by a zzso modulated zzso zzso The identification of a zzso zzso gene in tomato and other fruit suggests that, in addition to their role in zzso the expansion of plant cells, zzso may also contribute to cell wall zzso in zzso zzso possibly by enhancing the accessibility of zzso bound zzso to zzso zzso zzso
