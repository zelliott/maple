zzso is a member of the growth hormone family and is required for the growth and terminal differentiation of the zzso zzso zzso production of this hormone has been reported in several species, including zzso zzso goat and human zzso zzso In this study, mouse zzso cell lines, zzso in the zzso zzso from these cell lines and from zzso zzso zzso spontaneous zzso and normal zzso were studied for de zzso production of this growth zzso zzso transcripts were found by reverse zzso zzso in some zzso and zzso zzso and in mouse zzso cell lines, zzso and zzso but were not detected in the normal mouse zzso zzso Northern analysis revealed a 1 zzso transcript for both cell lines that zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso medium from zzso cells was positive for zzso zzso by the zzso rat zzso cell proliferation zzso and Western analysis revealed the presence of zzso proteins at zzso 14,000 and zzso zzso zzso was not detected in zzso medium from zzso cells, but an zzso protein of zzso 60,000 was detected by Western zzso The mouse zzso cell line, zzso D, was negative for zzso zzso however, zzso derived from zzso of zzso D cells into the cleared zzso fat pad were positive by reverse zzso zzso in two of four zzso zzso zzso maintained in the cleared zzso fat pad as well as spontaneous tumors were positive for zzso transcripts in one of four zzso These results suggest that zzso can be produced zzso by the zzso mouse zzso zzso
