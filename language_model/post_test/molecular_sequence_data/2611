The zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso was cloned from enteric zzso zzso and its zzso sequence was zzso zzso zzso zzso was noted in the region extending from the proposed zzso sequences through the first 59 base pairs of the zzso gene open reading frame zzso and the upstream zzso regions and zzso of several other zzso resistance zzso zzso were noted to be zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso resistance zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and several zzso zzso zzso Small regions of zzso were noted in the zzso regions of these resistance genes as zzso A DNA probe for the zzso gene was selected from the zzso sequence information and was tested against a series of genetically and zzso defined zzso The probe, which proved specific for the zzso zzso was then tested against a series of 58 zzso and 219 zzso zzso zzso isolated from patients at the Seattle Veterans Administration Medical zzso Only six clinical zzso were noted to carry the zzso zzso Each was resistant to zzso but susceptible to zzso zzso and zzso The presence of zzso regions of DNA at both the 3' and zzso ends of the zzso gene reinforces the importance of choosing zzso from within the zzso of genes and of avoiding zzso zzso When the zzso with other sequences extends into the ORF, as it does with the zzso zzso development of a specific probe may require determination of the zzso zzso
