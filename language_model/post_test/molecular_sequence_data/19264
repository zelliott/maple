The regulation of the system responsible for the production of zzso oxygen species zzso during zzso interaction is still largely zzso The protein zzso has been recently demonstrated as the plasma membrane zzso responsible for zzso production in zzso tobacco zzso Here, its zzso part was used as a bait in a zzso screen in order to identify putative regulators of this zzso This led to the isolation of a zzso coding for a member of the zzso protein zzso The corresponding transcript was induced after zzso of tobacco leaves with the zzso zzso zzso zzso cells transformed with an zzso construct of this zzso no longer accumulated zzso which constitutes a functional validation of the zzso zzso This work provides new insights to the understanding of the regulation of zzso production in a zzso context and gives a new light to the possible role of zzso proteins in zzso zzso
