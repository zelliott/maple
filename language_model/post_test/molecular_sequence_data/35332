Three novel peptides were isolated from the zzso of the sea zzso zzso zzso All of them are 29 zzso acid peptides zzso by two zzso bridges, with a primary structure similar to other sea zzso peptides belonging to structural group zzso The structure of the gene zzso the shared precursor protein of the identified peptides was zzso One zzso zzso zzso zzso (short name zzso zzso produced a zzso zzso effect on both the transient and the sustained current of human zzso channels expressed in zzso zzso zzso It completely blocked the transient component zzso 10 zzso zzso zzso and partially zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso of the sustained component zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using in zzso tests in mice, zzso zzso significantly reversed inflammatory and zzso zzso The other two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso did not inhibit the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso has an uncommon spatial structure, stabilized by two zzso bridges, with three classical zzso and twisted zzso without zzso zzso zzso This is a novel zzso spatial structure that we propose to name boundless zzso
