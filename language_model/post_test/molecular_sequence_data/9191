zzso zzso zzso is an important component of innate immunity capable of zzso the zzso zzso of the complement zzso A zzso gene was isolated from channel zzso zzso zzso The deduced protein contains a zzso zzso domain, a zzso recognition domain zzso and a neck region similar to zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso contains the zzso motif shown previously to mediate zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed zzso identity with zzso protein sequences of rainbow trout, zzso common zzso and zzso and zzso identity with sequences of zzso zzso In this study, while liver was the zzso source of zzso zzso gene expression in healthy zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso rose sharply following challenge with a zzso zzso
