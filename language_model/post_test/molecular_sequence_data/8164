zzso zzso comprise a large gene zzso that zzso zzso reactions in the presence of a zzso zzso Because the zzso members are, without exception, zzso zzso they have resisted zzso analysis by means of X-ray zzso zzso Among zzso zzso the zzso reaction that zzso the conversion of zzso steroids to zzso is one of the most complex and least zzso Thus, to better understand the reaction zzso we have constructed a three-dimensional model of zzso not only to examine the active site and those zzso potentially involved in zzso but to study other important structural features such as zzso recognition and zzso zzso which require examination of the entire zzso zzso the putative zzso zzso This model of zzso was built based on a zzso zzso identified from the structures of the zzso bacterial zzso zzso zzso and zzso rather than by molecular replacement, after which the less zzso elements and zzso were added in a rational zzso zzso and dynamic simulations were used to zzso the model and the zzso of the structure was zzso From this model we have zzso a zzso zzso region of zzso and aromatic zzso involved in zzso recognition, a zzso binding region that may be unique compared to other zzso as well as zzso involved in active site orientation of zzso and an inhibitor of zzso namely zzso We also have proposed a scheme for the reaction mechanism in which a zzso zzso determines whether oxygen zzso into the zzso zzso involves an oxygen radical or a zzso zzso
