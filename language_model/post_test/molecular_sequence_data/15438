A novel zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso carbon zzso zzso and zzso room temperature zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso zzso was developed on the glassy carbon zzso zzso for zzso sensing of the zzso and zzso of zzso The properties of the zzso the characteristics of the zzso and zzso of DNA were studied by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso as the zzso zzso The synergistic effect of zzso zzso and zzso could dramatically enhance the sensitivity of DNA zzso zzso The electron transfer resistance zzso of the zzso surface increased after the zzso of probe zzso on the zzso membrane and rose further after the zzso of the probe zzso with its complementary zzso The remarkable difference between the zzso value at the probe zzso zzso and that at the zzso zzso could be used for zzso zzso detection of the target zzso The zzso DNA of zzso zzso zzso gene from zzso modified rape was detected by this DNA zzso zzso Under optimal conditions, the dynamic range for detecting the zzso DNA of the zzso gene was from zzso zzso to zzso zzso and the detection limit was zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso hold great promises for the applications in sensitive zzso zzso
