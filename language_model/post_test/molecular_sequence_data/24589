zzso zzso result in zzso zzso an zzso human disease that affects zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso exchange factor zzso that specifically activates the zzso zzso zzso To gain insight into the function of zzso we have isolated and characterized zzso the zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso Comparative sequence analyses show that zzso and zzso share a similar structural organization and a high degree of sequence identity throughout shared signaling zzso In zzso interference with zzso expression results in zzso cell abnormalities and zzso zzso of the zzso cell zzso zzso zzso associated with two zzso zzso affect the zzso zzso and zzso transgenic expression zzso the zzso zzso Together, these data confirm that the zzso transcript zzso to the zzso zzso zzso expression studies show that zzso has a limited pattern of expression that is confined to the zzso cell during development, a finding that suggests that the zzso zzso protein might function in a cell autonomous zzso zzso observations indicate that zzso zzso lead to zzso zzso cell abnormalities that cause zzso zzso and interfere with canal process zzso Based on these data, we conclude that zzso is the zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso a new member of the zzso family of zzso zzso and that zzso plays a critical role in zzso cell zzso and cellular zzso
