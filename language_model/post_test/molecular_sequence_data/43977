We have investigated the role of zzso protein zzso zzso in the survival of zzso zzso cells in primary zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and insulin, but not zzso growth factor zzso promoted the survival of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso promoted a sustained zzso of zzso zzso whereas that induced by zzso was only zzso zzso promoted a small but transient zzso of zzso zzso that was completely blocked by zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso or zzso survival of zzso zzso zzso We also investigated the role of zzso zzso in zzso The zzso of zzso zzso by zzso was zzso whereas zzso and insulin promoted a sustained zzso of zzso zzso zzso which blocked zzso zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso or zzso survival of zzso zzso zzso We conclude that sustained zzso of zzso zzso is not correlated with the survival response of zzso zzso zzso indeed zzso survival is independent of zzso zzso Survival of zzso zzso cells is also independent of the zzso of zzso zzso
