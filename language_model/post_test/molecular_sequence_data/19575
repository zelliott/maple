Using in zzso approaches, we cloned a novel mouse gene zzso that was strictly expressed in the central nervous zzso zzso was first identified as an zzso after carrying out digital differential display for zzso libraries from various mouse zzso The full-length zzso sequence was obtained by extending the ends of zzso by zzso The zzso sequence was zzso zzso long and contained an zzso of zzso zzso A positive zzso region was found in the zzso hybrid, zzso and in human embryonic kidney zzso cell zzso zzso and in zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso gene was only expressed in the brain and spinal zzso during the embryonic zzso and throughout all regions of the adult brain, showing higher levels in the zzso and zzso
