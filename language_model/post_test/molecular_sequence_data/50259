We have studied the effect of zzso zzso formation on the yield of zzso zzso in zzso DNA duplex within the zzso triplex zzso is protected from the formation of zzso zzso in the case of the stabilization of this triplex by acid zzso and in the case of supplementary stabilization by zzso or zzso We have studied zzso zzso zzso stabilized by zzso zzso In such zzso the protection from the formation of zzso zzso is observed, whereas the protection from zzso zzso formation does not take zzso The formation of the zzso triplex leads to an inversion of the zzso of zzso CT and zzso zzso We observed a sharp decrease in zzso with respect to zzso zzso in the duplex tract zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The formation of the zzso triplex leads to zzso zzso an increase in the yield of zzso zzso
