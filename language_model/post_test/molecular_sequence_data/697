The zzso zzso zzso and zzso several zzso peptides belonging to the zzso zzso hormone zzso family, which are considered major zzso regulators during the zzso life zzso However, it is intriguing that zzso of many zzso zzso crustaceans prove to have varying degrees of zzso In the present study, we characterized full-length zzso zzso two important zzso hormones of the zzso family, zzso and zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso shrimp zzso zzso The two zzso of zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso in zzso respectively, and the deduced zzso contained 137 and 138 zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso zzso in zzso zzso a putative zzso of 113 zzso When compared with other known protein sequences of zzso and zzso these zzso from zzso vents show high similarity with their zzso zzso These results may provide evidence for the mechanisms of zzso reduction and zzso evolution of zzso The zzso zzso shrimp with reduced zzso may take a different evolutionary zzso than zzso zzso and the reduced zzso can be considered a good example for the investigation of the diversity of zzso evolution in different zzso
