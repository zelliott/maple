In zzso regulated promoters in zzso coli, the zzso complex acts as a zzso zzso as well as a zzso for the zzso zzso zzso by zzso depends on the formation of zzso complexes in which zzso binds zzso to the DNA with one or two zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that in order to establish zzso regulation in a zzso dependent class II promoter with a single zzso site zzso site zzso around position zzso in which the zzso operator is located upstream of the zzso site, high affinity binding sites for both regulators are zzso The efficiency of zzso regulation was observed to be modulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso Specifically, in class II promoters with a single zzso site, the efficiency of zzso regulation was found to correlate zzso with zzso independent promoter zzso These observations can be zzso in a competition model for zzso regulation in which zzso and zzso compete for cooperative binding with zzso to the promoters in zzso In this model, two mutually exclusive zzso complexes can be zzso a zzso repression complex and an zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso regulation critically depends on formation of a repression complex that binds the promoter with sufficiently high affinity to exclude formation of the competing zzso zzso We suggest that the transition from repression to zzso involves a switch in the zzso interactions made by zzso from zzso to zzso On the basis of the regulatory features of the promoters zzso here, we speculate about the advantages offered by the structural complexity of natural zzso regulated zzso
