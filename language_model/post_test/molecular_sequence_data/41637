The zzso zzso promotes zzso zzso and zzso Yet, exact molecular mechanisms of zzso destruction itself, under DNA damaging conditions, remain zzso Recently, we identified zzso as a novel zzso zzso that targets zzso for zzso and destruction in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, it remains elusive how the zzso signaling axis is regulated by DNA damage signals to govern zzso zzso zzso with previous studies, we found that zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in turn, impaired DNA zzso zzso zzso Although zzso of zzso at zzso (an zzso zzso zzso facilitated zzso interaction with zzso zzso was zzso zzso from zzso by zzso upon DNA damaging zzso This indicates that in addition to zzso zzso at zzso zzso may govern zzso stability through other unknown zzso We further demonstrated that DNA zzso zzso of zzso directly zzso zzso at two zzso zzso sites, which promotes zzso nuclear zzso to increase zzso zzso of zzso thereby zzso subsequent zzso zzso by zzso Our studies provide a molecular mechanism of how zzso could govern DNA zzso destruction of zzso in part by zzso both zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso Given the pivotal role of zzso in the negative regulation of zzso this work will also provide a rationale for developing zzso or zzso zzso as zzso zzso
