The targeting of zzso proteins to nuclear pores is zzso via the formation of a nuclear zzso complex, through the interaction of nuclear zzso signal zzso with its zzso zzso Recently, a novel human zzso zzso was identified from a zzso zzso system with DNA zzso zzso This study demonstrates that zzso is a novel third class of zzso zzso that efficiently recognizes the zzso of the zzso zzso Moreover, the data obtained in this study show that the specific interaction between zzso and the zzso of the zzso zzso requires its upstream sequence of the minimal essential zzso By using zzso zzso proteins alone in the zzso zzso transport system, it was demonstrated that the two known human zzso zzso zzso and zzso are able to transport all the tested zzso zzso into the nucleus, while zzso most efficiently zzso the zzso zzso zzso which contain its upstream sequence in so far as we have examined the zzso Furthermore, in zzso cell crude zzso it was found that zzso zzso binds to all the tested zzso zzso while the binding of zzso zzso is restricted to only some zzso despite the fact that zzso itself shows binding activity to a variety of zzso These results indicate that at least three structurally and functionally distinct zzso receptors exist in the human single cell population, and suggest that the nuclear import of zzso proteins may be controlled in a complex manner at the zzso recognition step by the existence of a variety of zzso receptors with various zzso to each zzso
