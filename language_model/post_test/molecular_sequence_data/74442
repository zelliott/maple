The increasing prevalence of BK virus zzso diseases in zzso patients has prompted an investigation of the immune response to zzso especially the role of zzso in regulating viral zzso We examined the effect of zzso a zzso that is zzso by certain zzso therapies, on zzso gene expression during zzso infection of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso and specifically the activity of the zzso early promoter, is regulated by zzso in a zzso zzso zzso activity is zzso in the presence of zzso for the zzso strain of zzso and not for the zzso zzso or zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we have identified a small segment of the zzso promoter that is required for stimulation in response to zzso These results demonstrate that zzso strains can respond differently to zzso treatment and suggest that zzso may play a role in the zzso of zzso
