zzso is a zzso zzso involved in the interaction between cells and the zzso zzso A large variety of alternatively spliced zzso zzso are expressed by different tumors with possible implication for tumor zzso formation of zzso and zzso In colon zzso previous reports described higher molecular bands of zzso transcripts in zzso zzso zzso although a complete analysis of multiple combinations of zzso transcripts were not zzso We therefore analyzed the pattern of zzso standard and zzso zzso transcripts in zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso amplification and sought zzso transcripts specific for zzso zzso Our data indicate that zzso standard zzso including the zzso form zzso corresponding to a zzso zzso transcript, were detected in zzso zzso samples of normal zzso zzso zzso zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso High molecular zzso zzso zzso transcripts were found in zzso zzso samples from normal zzso zzso zzso from zzso and in zzso from zzso zzso zzso Similar zzso transcripts were detected in five from seven zzso liver zzso while normal liver did not contain high molecular zzso zzso The same zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected in zzso human colon zzso zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso transcript in samples from zzso zzso and zzso cells confirmed the assumed zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of other zzso zzso transcripts zzso using zzso specific zzso were less frequently associated with zzso zzso These data report for the first time frequent expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso supporting the role of increased zzso zzso expression as an early event in zzso zzso The described zzso zzso zzso zzso might be relevant for diagnosis and treatment of zzso zzso
