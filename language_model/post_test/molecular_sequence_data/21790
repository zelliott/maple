Lake zzso is a zzso crater lake located in the French zzso Central zzso In this ecosystem, most methane zzso produced in high quantity in the zzso bottom zzso and especially in zzso is consumed in the water column, with only a small fraction of annual production reaching the zzso This study assessed the diversity of zzso and zzso populations along the water column and in sediments using zzso and reverse zzso approaches targeting functional zzso zzso zzso zzso of the particulate methane zzso for zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso M zzso for zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso rates were much higher in zzso our results confirm that zzso production also occurs in the water column where zzso were almost exclusively composed of zzso zzso whereas both zzso and zzso were almost equivalent in the zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso suggested that zzso may be an important group actively involved in zzso zzso in the water zzso Two main zzso were zzso one of which could consume zzso under conditions where the oxygen amount is zzso
