zzso function both positively and zzso in the regulation of gene zzso mainly governed by zzso modifications on specific zzso acid zzso Although zzso modifications are not necessarily prerequisite codes, they may still serve as good zzso indicators of zzso state associated with gene zzso or zzso In particular, six emerging classes of zzso zzso modifications are subjected for zzso profiling by the International Human zzso zzso In general, zzso start sites of actively transcribed genes are marked by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and active enhancers can be identified by zzso of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso Gene bodies of actively transcribed genes are associated with zzso zzso zzso Gene repression can be zzso through two distinct mechanisms involving zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of these zzso modifications on specific zzso or in zzso zzso in given cells can be analyzed by zzso zzso zzso methods using an zzso directed against the zzso zzso When performing zzso experiments, one should be careful about the specificity of zzso as this affects the data zzso If cell samples with preserved zzso contacts are available, evaluation of zzso zzso in addition to DNA zzso at specific gene zzso would be useful for deciphering the zzso state for human zzso zzso
