The molecular composition and drug responses of zzso zzso zzso channels of skeletal muscle are zzso zzso experiments combined with transcript scanning of the zzso gene zzso the alpha zzso of the BK channel were performed in rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso skeletal zzso Five zzso products of the zzso gene were isolated from Sol and zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the expression of zzso and zzso were zzso higher in zzso than zzso whereas the expression of zzso was zzso higher in Sol than zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was equally expressed in both muscle zzso No beta zzso zzso were zzso In zzso a large BK current with low zzso sensitivity was zzso The BK channel of Sol also showed a reduced response to BK channel openers, such as zzso zzso and related zzso In zzso a reduced BK current with high zzso sensitivity and an enhanced drug response was zzso The total BK zzso content, which was zzso higher in Sol than in zzso correlated with the BK currents in both zzso Drug responses primarily correlated with zzso and zzso expression levels in zzso and to zzso expression in Sol zzso In conclusion, zzso BK channel zzso and pharmacological properties correlated with the expression levels of the zzso in zzso These findings may be relevant to conditions affecting zzso muscles, such as prolonged zzso and to diseases affecting zzso muscles, such as periodic zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso associated with pathological conditions may affect channel composition and drug zzso
