To examine the function of zzso a thick zzso protein of zzso zzso muscles, during zzso the zzso zzso chicken cardiac zzso and the truncated zzso were zzso into a expression zzso and introduced into mouse C2 zzso zzso The expression and assembly of the zzso was investigated by zzso zzso When the zzso containing the entire open reading frame was introduced, in C2 zzso the zzso expressed zzso cardiac zzso existed only zzso in the zzso but it became localized in zzso structures together with zzso zzso heavy chains zzso in zzso To clarify the functional zzso of zzso the zzso zzso that lack the regions zzso the zzso zzso zzso C2 motif or the zzso zzso C2 motif were introduced into C2 cells to produce zzso zzso The truncated chicken cardiac zzso which lacked the zzso zzso C2 zzso apparently lost the ability to bind to zzso zzso the protein was not assembled into zzso but diffused in the zzso even in the zzso The protein without zzso zzso C2 zzso however, was assembled into zzso structures just as complete protein zzso From these results, we conclude that 1) the assembly of zzso zzso into zzso in zzso is accompanied with that of cardiac zzso and 2) the zzso zzso C2 motif is necessary for assembly of cardiac zzso in zzso structures in the zzso
