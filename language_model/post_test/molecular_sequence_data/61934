The zzso and cellular immune responses in the zzso zzso likely play an important role in the prevention of sexually transmitted infections, including infection with human zzso virus type 1 zzso Here we show that zzso infection of zzso zzso mice with a zzso influenza virus bearing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso envelope protein from an zzso zzso isolate zzso zzso can induce a specific immune response in regional zzso zzso zzso as well as in a systemic site (the zzso A single zzso of mice with the zzso influenza virus induced long-lasting (at least 5 zzso zzso zzso memory zzso as a rapid recall of zzso zzso upon zzso infection with zzso zzso virus expressing zzso zzso envelope gene zzso zzso zzso zzso memory was also induced and maintained in distant zzso zzso when mice were zzso zzso with the zzso influenza zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso and, in particular, local zzso zzso with zzso influenza virus can provide strong, durable immune responses in the female zzso tract of zzso
