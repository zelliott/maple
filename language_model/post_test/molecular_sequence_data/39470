zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are frequently expressed on the surfaces of bacterial zzso The limited zzso acid sequence variation among zzso zzso results in structural and functional differences with possible implications for bacterial zzso and host zzso In particular, the zzso zzso and zzso magna zzso zzso zzso exhibit a degree of structural and dynamic diversity that may account for their varied affinities for different species of zzso To explore the impact of zzso module zzso on zzso binding and zzso we recently used offset zzso zzso to shuffle seven artificially constructed representatives of the zzso sequence space and scan the zzso zzso zzso for zzso that supported binding to the zzso distinct human and guinea pig serum zzso zzso and zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso 45, zzso Surprisingly, zzso selection revealed an overwhelming preference for a single zzso domain zzso zzso zzso regardless of whether the zzso were enriched for their abilities to bind one or both of these zzso We describe here the zzso structure, zzso and stability of zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that increased flexibility is not a requirement for broadened zzso as had been suggested earlier zzso et zzso (2002) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso because zzso binds the zzso diverse zzso and zzso even more tightly than zzso but is less zzso The structural basis for zzso specificity is analyzed in light of these new zzso
