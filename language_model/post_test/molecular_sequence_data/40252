Major zzso products of a zzso zzso zzso long primary transcript zzso the zzso zzso precursor zzso zzso and the zzso mature zzso contain the same sequence required for target gene zzso Thus, it is zzso difficult to discern the contribution of individual zzso species or to rule out a function of zzso precursor species in target zzso Here, we describe a novel approach to dissect the functional contribution of zzso without compromising important cellular zzso We show that zzso has a direct function in target repression in the absence of properly processed mature zzso Moreover, we show that loop zzso provide regulatory controls of the activity of zzso by modulating interactions between zzso and target zzso in zzso and in zzso Finally, we show that human zzso zzso can directly interact with target zzso These findings illustrate that the regulatory information zzso in structured zzso may be translated into function through direct interactions with target zzso
