The zzso protein components from snake zzso complexes have been zzso for studies of zzso structural biology, and zzso The zzso zzso snake zzso is the only snake species found exclusively at the Chinese zzso zzso Island in zzso To investigate the protein components of Chinese zzso zzso zzso we zzso a zzso zzso for zzso by the combination of sodium zzso zzso gel zzso with zzso liquid zzso zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso Thirty gel bands zzso by zzso blue zzso were excised and zzso by zzso The zzso peptides were separated by zzso and subsequently zzso by zzso zzso types of proteins were identified by searching the mass zzso data against zzso database through zzso zzso The most abundant proteins are zzso zzso , zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Except for 20 types of known snake zzso zzso the zzso peptides of hypothetical protein zzso zzso zzso zzso box zzso and pancreatic zzso 1 from other organisms are matched for zzso protein zzso Mass zzso data also indicated that zzso zzso happens to zzso s as zzso and zzso of zzso s coexist in zzso and zzso zzso or zzso might happen to zzso as three zzso zzso species are present in zzso The results provide an zzso view of the protein composition and important information for protein characteristics of zzso
