The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been recorded from a variety of zzso worldwide, including monkeys and zzso Due to its wide host range, it has been suggested that the zzso may be transmitted locally to any zzso host by zzso To investigate this notion, the zzso zzso gene zzso mainly regions of the internal transcribed zzso zzso 1 and 2, and a zzso c zzso zzso I zzso region of zzso DNA of zzso zzso were characterized using zzso from the following hosts located in zzso zzso zzso zzso wild zzso Japanese zzso a feral Reeves's zzso and captive zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso were generally well zzso regardless of their host zzso However, a few zzso of zzso along with a few base zzso in the zzso and zzso regions were observed in zzso zzso from zzso zzso wild zzso and Japanese zzso and those differed from zzso zzso in zzso the feral Reeves's zzso and captive zzso zzso The zzso sequences of zzso zzso were further divided into multiple zzso and two groups of zzso zzso those from a majority of zzso zzso wild zzso and Japanese zzso and those from cattle and zoo animals, were clearly zzso Our findings indicate that domestic and zzso transmission cycles of the zzso zzso are currently present, at least in zzso
