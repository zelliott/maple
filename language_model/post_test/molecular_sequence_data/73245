The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the transfer of zzso from zzso to the zzso of zzso During this reaction the zzso zzso 54 of the zzso zzso forms a zzso The single zzso acid replacement zzso resulted in a drastic change of zzso zzso The zzso activity decreased from 140 to less than zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso activity increased from less than zzso to 16 zzso The new zzso was able to zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Since the zzso zzso and zzso showed neither zzso zzso nor zzso activity, it was concluded that the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acted as a general base which facilitated the attack of water at the zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso for zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso as compared to zzso by the zzso zzso zzso was 40 times zzso A 65 zzso zzso obtained by fusing the zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso retained zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid sequences of 13 related zzso demonstrated that Nature already has applied gene fusion in the case of pig heart zzso and has been using the E zzso D zzso for zzso by a zzso zzso zzso
