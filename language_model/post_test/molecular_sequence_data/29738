Fusion proteins made of green fluorescent protein coupled to zzso or zzso were zzso in bovine zzso cells in order to study the role of critical protein zzso in zzso Point zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso and zzso produced a marked zzso of zzso whereas single zzso zzso and double zzso zzso of zzso acids from the so-called zero layer only produced a moderate zzso in zzso The importance of the zzso zzso domain in zzso was also confirmed by the similar effect on zzso of zzso in analogous zzso of zzso zzso zzso The effects on the initial rate and magnitude of zzso correlated with the zzso of single zzso fusion zzso since the zzso spikes from cells expressing zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso had lower zzso and larger zzso values than the ones from controls, suggesting slower neurotransmitter release zzso than that found in cells expressing the zzso proteins or zero layer zzso of zzso We conclude that a small domain of the zzso C zzso and its counterpart in zzso play an essential role in the final membrane fusion step of zzso
