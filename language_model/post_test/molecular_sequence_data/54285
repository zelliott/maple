The synthesis of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso requires the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity is short-lived, apparently in part because of an intrinsic instability of the zzso We identified a zzso zzso sequence that is involved in zzso the zzso zzso which binds the zzso zzso Here, we report the crystal structure at zzso zzso resolution of human zzso stabilized by replacement of this zzso
