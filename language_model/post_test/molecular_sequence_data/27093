Gene expression in zzso zzso is largely zzso To compare gene expression in potato zzso zzso zzso zzso and leaf zzso amounts of transcripts of all zzso genes were determined by zzso to zzso zzso Except for a few zzso transcript zzso was much lower in zzso compared with zzso zzso of zzso genes showed a greater reduction in zzso compared with leaves than transcripts of genes for the genetic zzso zzso zzso copy number in zzso was zzso to zzso lower than in leaves and thus cannot account for the observed reduction of transcript zzso in zzso Both the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were active in potato zzso zzso initiation sites were identical in zzso and zzso although some differences in promoter zzso between the two zzso were zzso For some zzso zzso zzso zzso was less efficient in zzso than in zzso Furthermore, zzso differences in editing of zzso transcripts were zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso extracted from zzso indicated that, in zzso zzso association of transcripts was generally zzso Nevertheless, some zzso such as the transcript of the fatty acid zzso gene zzso displayed relatively high zzso zzso zzso nuclear genes involved in zzso gene expression were generally significantly less expressed in zzso than in zzso zzso compared with leaf zzso gene expression in zzso zzso is much lower, with control occurring at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso regulatory sequences that potentially can improve zzso zzso expression in zzso have been zzso
