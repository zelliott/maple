zzso collagen peptides containing larger numbers of zzso repeats are difficult to purify by standard zzso zzso zzso efficient strategies are required for the synthesis of higher molecular weight zzso zzso zzso the zzso chemistry, a comparative analysis of the standard zzso chain zzso procedure on solid support with the procedure based on the use of the zzso zzso and zzso was zzso The crude products resulting from the zzso zzso procedure and from the use of zzso clearly revealed large amounts of zzso that result from incomplete zzso acid zzso as well as from zzso formation with zzso of zzso units from the growing zzso zzso zzso by the use of the zzso zzso the quality of the crude products was significantly zzso moreover, protection of the zzso side chain zzso function is not required using the zzso zzso With this zzso synthetic zzso relatively large zzso peptides were obtained in satisfactory yields as highly homogeneous zzso
