zzso zzso zzso zzso replication and zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso is a zzso switch protein for viral zzso from zzso The expression of zzso activates the expression of downstream viral zzso and is necessary for triggering the full viral zzso zzso Using zzso zzso zzso coupled with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso approach, we identified a set of 19 zzso binding sites in the zzso zzso in a zzso cell line zzso These binding sites are located in the regions of zzso zzso or zzso of zzso genes including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the two origins of zzso replication zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso We confirmed these zzso binding sites by zzso and quantitative real-time zzso We further mapped the zzso binding site in the first zzso of the zzso zzso and determined that it is zzso The zzso zzso binding sequence zzso zzso consists of a zzso structure of two tandem repeats, of which each itself is also an imperfect zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso confirmed the binding of the zzso protein to this sequence in zzso zzso alignment with other zzso binding sites identified the zzso consensus binding motif as zzso Interestingly, most of the identified zzso binding sites contain only half or part of this zzso binding zzso These results suggest the complexity of zzso binding in zzso and the involvement of other cellular or viral zzso factors during zzso zzso of target zzso
