zzso locations of zzso zzso complex zzso genes contributing to zzso diabetes zzso zzso in mice have been determined by zzso zzso mice to other zzso strains zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso At least nine zzso zzso zzso genes zzso were previously identified at first zzso zzso after zzso of zzso to zzso zzso mice zzso We investigated whether the same set of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso after zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso to zzso and zzso were performed in the same zzso direct comparisons were made of the zzso locations and relative strengths of zzso zzso in diabetic progeny from the two different zzso In comparison with the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso produced significantly higher zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso The high zzso diabetes frequency allowed evaluation of the effects of zzso expression of both the zzso and the resistance zzso at zzso zzso This analysis demonstrated that no single zzso zzso locus was essential for the onset of diabetes in this zzso After zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), and zzso zzso zzso did not segregate with zzso in either the zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 3) were segregating in the zzso An zzso zzso contributing to zzso on zzso 7 zzso was also zzso zzso traits, zzso only in the zzso zzso were zzso by zzso 4 zzso and two newly mapped zzso on zzso 13 zzso and 5 zzso A third dominant trait was zzso by zzso 6 zzso zzso but here, in contrast to zzso zzso and zzso the zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso data confirmed that the ability to identify certainty of the zzso zzso zzso was contingent on the extent of zzso for zzso background zzso This study shows that the zzso zzso can be achieved through the actions of variable combinations of zzso genes and a zzso zzso zzso
