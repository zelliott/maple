Nine zzso zzso and zzso zzso bacteria were isolated from pigs affected by different pathological zzso zzso and zzso methods were adopted to determine the relationships of these new zzso to recognized species of the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequences demonstrated that the clinical zzso represented a new lineage within the zzso zzso The zzso were closely related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso gene sequence similarities of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso displayed zzso relative binding ratios of zzso to each other, but distinctly lower levels of zzso zzso were observed with zzso closely related zzso zzso The new zzso could be distinguished from all other recognized species of the zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso and molecular data, the nine new zzso from pigs represent a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
