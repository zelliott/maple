We have recently reported on a class of zzso peptides designed based on the zzso structure of the high affinity zzso zzso contain zzso key zzso located within the two distinct binding sites for zzso and selectively bind zzso with an affinity ranging between 6 and 60 zzso We have here designed and characterized a new zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and an zzso zzso for joining them made of a zzso side chain and a zzso This new zzso shows an increased affinity zzso 30 zzso compared to the parent loop zzso + zzso previously zzso while retaining the same zzso mechanism of binding and the same zzso It also blocks the binding of zzso to the zzso zzso and efficiently prevents zzso release from mast zzso These properties make the zzso a useful scaffold for the development of new zzso zzso
