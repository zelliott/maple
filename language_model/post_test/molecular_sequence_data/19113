The zzso zzso zzso protein zzso functions to activate two zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso and 12 members of the zzso family of protein zzso The highly zzso zzso zzso of zzso are zzso zzso by zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso within a zzso zzso To better define the role that these zzso modifications play, we created zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These animals were viable, fertile and displayed no overt zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso that we generated, we established by zzso that the vast majority, if not all, of the zzso zzso is zzso zzso of zzso localized at the membrane of the liver of zzso mice and their zzso were reduced substantially compared with the zzso mice, confirming that zzso plays a role in zzso membrane zzso Although zzso was activated normally in the zzso animals, we unexpectedly observed in all of the examined zzso and cells taken from zzso mice that the zzso as well as that induced by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and muscle contraction were significantly zzso This resulted in a reduced ability of zzso to inhibit zzso synthesis in primary zzso isolated from zzso zzso The activity of several of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso family, zzso zzso 1), zzso zzso zzso 3) and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not affected in zzso derived from zzso or zzso zzso Our observations reveal for the first time that zzso of zzso is required for the zzso of zzso Previous reports have indicated that a pool of zzso is localized at the plasma membrane as a result of zzso of its regulatory zzso zzso This raises the possibility that zzso zzso and zzso of zzso might promote the interaction and zzso of these zzso on a two-dimensional membrane surface and thereby promote efficient zzso of zzso
