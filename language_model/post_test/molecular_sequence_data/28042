zzso zzso II zzso is a highly specific zzso zzso zzso which complexes zzso with zzso in a reaction zzso by zzso and other zzso The molecular basis for the zzso specificity may be explained by the identification here of a segment of zzso including zzso zzso that binds to zzso A synthetic zzso zzso based on this segment of zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity of zzso was inhibited 50% at a concentration of 28 zzso zzso gel zzso showed that zzso inhibited zzso zzso of both the A alpha and B beta zzso in zzso However, the zzso did not block zzso active site, as zzso of zzso zzso was not zzso zzso probably binds to the same site on zzso as do zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibited binding of zzso to a synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of zzso zzso but the zzso zzso was about zzso more potent in binding and zzso zzso Both synthetic zzso as a result of their zzso character, might be expected to stimulate the reaction of zzso with zzso However, the zzso zzso inhibited this reaction, suggesting that it blocked a site on zzso required for interaction with zzso zzso had a net zzso effect on the zzso reaction as a consequence of its lower affinity for zzso and greater negative charge relative to the zzso zzso These studies suggest that zzso zzso of zzso interact with a zzso binding site on zzso and that this interaction contributes to efficient zzso of zzso by zzso
