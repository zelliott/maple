zzso zzso zzso zzso are among the simplest members of a recently recognized family of zzso and zzso zzso that catalyze similar zzso reactions with various secondary or zzso zzso acids and contain zzso bound zzso Other members of this family include zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso may be more zzso related family zzso 

The X-ray crystal structure of zzso from zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli, has been solved at zzso A resolution by zzso anomalous zzso zzso from zzso of the zzso zzso Fourteen zzso sites, belonging to two zzso molecules in the zzso unit, were used for MAD phasing and to define the local twofold symmetry axis for zzso zzso The structures of the native zzso and of two zzso complexes were also zzso 

zzso is a zzso protein with an overall zzso most similar to that of zzso acid zzso with which it shares zzso sequence zzso The zzso ring is located in a very basic environment, making contact with zzso of zzso zzso zzso and the zzso end of a zzso zzso The zzso is zzso attached through an zzso linkage to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso attachment is probably zzso through interactions with the positive zzso and the zzso zzso zzso binding is probably stabilized by hydrogen bonds between the zzso zzso and two basic zzso zzso and zzso located above the zzso face of the zzso zzso
