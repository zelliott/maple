We have constructed the first ever zzso for the New Zealand earthworm zzso zzso and zzso including representatives from other major zzso zzso zzso and maximum likelihood zzso trees were constructed from zzso base pairs from the zzso large zzso zzso zzso gene and zzso base pairs from the nuclear large zzso zzso zzso zzso Within the zzso we were able to identify a number of zzso zzso that were restricted to zzso zzso Estimates of zzso support for these major zzso were generally high, but relationships among zzso were poorly zzso The zzso analyses revealed several independent lineages in New Zealand, some of which had a comparable zzso depth to zzso groups sampled from zzso Africa, North America and zzso These results are consistent with at least some of these zzso having inhabited New Zealand since zzso from zzso in the Late zzso Within the New Zealand zzso major zzso tended to be restricted to specific regions of New Zealand, with the central North Island and Cook Strait representing major zzso zzso Our field surveys of New Zealand and subsequent identification has also revealed extensive cryptic zzso diversity with approximately 48 new species sampled in addition to the 199 species recognized by previous zzso Our results indicate that further survey and zzso work is required to establish a foundation for future zzso and ecological research on this vitally important component of the New Zealand zzso
