We isolated zzso for a novel protein with a calculated molecular mass of 46 zzso containing a zzso repeat zzso with zzso zzso sequences and a zzso zzso zzso zzso This novel protein was considered to be a new member of the zzso zzso and was named zzso zzso zzso containing zzso These zzso are known to be important for zzso interaction or cell zzso and therefore it is possible that the novel protein zzso may also interact with other proteins or zzso Northern zzso analysis showed the presence of a zzso transcript in various human zzso including zzso heart, skeletal muscle, zzso zzso small zzso zzso adrenal cortex, zzso stomach, and spinal zzso as well as fetal lung and fetal zzso The zzso gene was mapped on human zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso
