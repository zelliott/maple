zzso Carlo simulations zzso zzso zzso were performed for the zzso shell of zzso in zzso B form and for the zzso shell of zzso in zzso B zzso and in a zzso with narrow minor groove, highly inclined zzso but with a nearly zzso base pair plane zzso zzso We introduced zzso periodic boundary conditions with a rather small unit cell and a limited number of water molecules to reduce the zzso of the zzso zzso The coordinates of local zzso of water density and the properties of one- and zzso water bridges between polar groups of the DNA were zzso The zzso duplex zzso mirrors the zzso symmetry of polar group zzso At the zzso step, a water bridge between the two zzso zzso zzso of zzso is formed as in the central zzso step of Dickerson's zzso In the major groove, zzso water chains along the zzso pattern zzso are zzso The zzso geometry of zzso in zzso B zzso is distinguished by autonomous primary zzso of the zzso edges in both zzso When this zzso adopts a zzso with highly inclined bases and narrow minor groove, the water density distribution in the minor groove is in excellent agreement with Dickerson's spine zzso One local maximum per base pair of the first layer is located near the zzso axis between adjacent base pairs, and one local maximum per base pair in the second shell lies near the zzso axis of the base pair zzso The water bridge between the two strands formed within the first layer was observed with high zzso But the water molecules of the second layer do not have a statistically favored orientation necessary for bridging first layer zzso In the major groove, the zzso geometry of the zzso zzso edge resembles the main features of the zzso zzso derived from other sequences for the zzso B zzso The preference of the zzso zzso for zzso tracts may express the tendency to common zzso of zzso edges of successive base pairs in the grooves of zzso zzso The mean potential energy of zzso of zzso zzso was estimated to be zzso to zzso zzso zzso in dependence on the zzso zzso Because of the small system size, this zzso is zzso
