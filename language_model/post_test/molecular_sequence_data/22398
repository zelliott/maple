Only zzso zzso possess the Strategy II iron zzso system in which zzso is absorbed by roots as an zzso In spite of being a Strategy II plant, however, rice zzso zzso contains the previously identified zzso zzso zzso In this study, we isolated the zzso gene from rice, which is highly zzso to zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso and zzso are expressed predominantly in roots, and these zzso are induced by zzso zzso When expressed in zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso zzso reversed the growth defects of a zzso zzso zzso This was similar to the effect of zzso zzso zzso and zzso fluorescent protein fusion proteins localized to the plasma membrane when zzso expressed in onion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso is expressed in the zzso and zzso of the zzso zone and in the inner layer of the zzso of the mature zone of zzso zzso zzso expression was also detected in the zzso zzso Analysis using the zzso zzso imaging system showed that rice plants are able to take up both an zzso and zzso This result indicates that, in addition to absorbing an zzso rice possesses a novel zzso system that directly absorbs the zzso a strategy that is advantageous for growth in submerged zzso
