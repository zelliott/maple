In the cloning and sequencing of zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two DNA variable number of tandem repeats zzso were identified in zzso zzso zzso One contained a 33 zzso repeat unit zzso located in the 3' untranslated region of a putative growth hormone zzso zzso and the repeat was designated as zzso The other contained an 18 zzso repeat unit zzso located in the 3' untranslated region of a putative zzso zzso peptides zzso zzso and was designated as zzso zzso zzso the two zzso repeat regions were derived from sequence zzso One hundred zzso zzso were collected along the Victorian coastline and used in a preliminary population zzso The range of zzso zzso containing the 33 zzso basic unit repeat motif included 7 to 20 repeats, with zzso zzso 8 not being zzso The most frequent zzso contained zzso 16 and 17 repeats zzso and zzso zzso Four types of zzso were identified in zzso zzso 4, 5, 6 and 7 zzso The zzso containing 6 and 5 repeats were the most frequent zzso and zzso zzso Overall, the results indicate that these two DNA zzso have use in zzso studies, including zzso resting, zzso testing, population genetic structure, and gene zzso
