A zzso zzso class 10 protein zzso zzso was first isolated from the Chinese medicinal material zzso zzso using a combination of affinity zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso exchange zzso on zzso zzso zzso and gel zzso on zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed a single band with a molecular mass of zzso in zzso The molecular mass of intact zzso was determined to be zzso by gel zzso Thus, zzso is a zzso protein composed of two identical zzso zzso was a zzso detected by periodic zzso zzso zzso and its neutral zzso content was zzso The zzso was mainly composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso on the basis of zzso zzso exchange zzso zzso zzso Its zzso sequence of 15 zzso acid zzso was determined as zzso and showed significant sequence zzso to some zzso zzso class 10 zzso This sequence had zzso identity with the zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso identity with the zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso suggesting it is a new member of zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso activity as do some other zzso zzso The optimal pH and temperature for zzso activity were pH zzso and 60 degrees C, zzso The zzso activity was stable within pH zzso It was stable up to 60 degrees C at pH zzso The zzso and characterization of zzso in this investigation furnish additional data to the relatively zzso literature pertaining to zzso zzso zzso
