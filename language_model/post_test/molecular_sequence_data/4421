One hundred and zzso independent primary zzso of lettuce zzso Diana were obtained by zzso with zzso zzso carrying zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso families were screened for zzso at four genes zzso for resistance to zzso zzso One family, designated zzso had lost resistance to an isolate of zzso zzso expressing the zzso gene zzso Loss of resistance zzso as a single zzso zzso of zzso The zzso was not due to a large deletion as all molecular markers zzso zzso were zzso Loss of zzso activity zzso with a zzso from which Ds had zzso zzso DNA zzso the right border of this zzso was isolated by inverse zzso chain zzso This zzso sequence was present in four to five copies in zzso zzso zzso One copy was missing in all eight deletion zzso of zzso and altered in zzso indicating tight physical linkage to zzso Three open reading frames zzso occurred in a zzso region zzso the zzso zzso however, expression of these zzso was not zzso No similarities were detected between these zzso and resistance genes cloned from other zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso fragments of Diana spanning the zzso site failed to restore zzso function to two zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso or to zzso Cobham Green, which naturally lacks zzso zzso zzso either the zzso inserted extremely close to, but not zzso zzso and the zzso may have been caused by secondary movement of zzso or zzso activity is zzso by a gene extending beyond the fragments used for zzso
