During the course of the last decade, the development of zzso and particularly zzso zzso zzso has been based on the rational design zzso zzso though this approach has been in zzso zzso zzso zzso its limitations are becoming apparent from the findings that: zzso zzso bond metabolism gives rise to cholesterol and zzso in a mechanistically similar manner, zzso zzso are harmful to human zzso and zzso zzso modified zzso designed to inhibit the zzso zzso in zzso zzso may be ineffective or operate by another kinetic mechanism in a related zzso rendering it zzso zzso Nevertheless, it may be possible to ultimately capitalize on the unique aspects of zzso zzso chemistry and zzso to design zzso zzso With increased understanding of the structure and function of zzso zzso in different zzso it should be possible to prepare novel zzso zzso to control zzso activity uniquely and with high specific zzso
