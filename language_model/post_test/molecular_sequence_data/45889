zzso zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso analogue containing various zzso acid zzso zzso was zzso by exchanging the 1st and 3rd Ala zzso of alpha carbon of zzso zzso This analogue revealed to have the quite tight and stable zzso structure using the nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso The biological activities of these zzso were examined using a zzso generating zzso in zzso cell lines zzso zzso with the zzso type human zzso zzso Only the zzso analogue zzso with zzso zzso without zzso showed significant zzso generating action with zzso zzso zzso of zzso Then, we used an zzso rat model system to compare the in zzso effects of zzso hormone analogue with that of zzso zzso Daily subcutaneous administration of the zzso zzso zzso for 5 weeks in 30 zzso zzso with positive control group receiving zzso zzso with 8 zzso zzso were zzso However, there was no significant change in spinal or zzso bone mineral density assessed by dual zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso group where zzso increase of these parameters shown in the zzso zzso group zzso zzso zzso Assessment of bone strength was evaluated with no significant differences among all zzso It was quite disappointing to see the actual discrepancies between the result of significant zzso potency and the in zzso clinical effect of the zzso zzso However, there are several limitations to mention, such as the short duration of treatment, matter of zzso and insufficient effect of tight zzso structures with absence of zzso In conclusion, our findings suggest that zzso zzso zzso did not exhibit any anabolic effects at the bones of zzso zzso
