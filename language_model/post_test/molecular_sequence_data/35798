Digital zzso imaging with a zzso cooled zzso device zzso camera is used to zzso DNA sequencing fragments zzso bound to a zzso zzso The detection is based on DNA zzso with an alkaline zzso labeled zzso probe and zzso triggered zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The detection using a direct zzso zzso is compared to the secondary detection of zzso zzso with respect to their sensitivity and zzso binding to the nylon membrane by quantitative zzso Using the direct zzso zzso as a zzso probe, zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso quantities of membrane bound DNA are zzso with 30 zzso zzso zzso zzso using the zzso probe in combination with zzso was found to be background limited by zzso binding of zzso and the zzso label in equal zzso In contrast, the zzso background of zzso zzso is indistinguishable from that seen with zzso in that respect making zzso an ideal zzso zzso The effect of zzso time, probe zzso and presence of zzso enhancers on the detection of zzso DNA were zzso
