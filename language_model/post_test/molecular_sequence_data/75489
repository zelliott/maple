We have developed a method for constructing zzso libraries enriched for zzso DNA zzso enabling the isolation of zzso from higher zzso organisms with large zzso The method was used to clone zzso DNA sequences from the flowering plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are composed primarily of zzso repeated blocks of the sequence zzso and are zzso in zzso zzso sequences that zzso at high stringency with zzso zzso zzso repeats are present in other higher zzso In zzso zzso zzso these zzso sequences are located at the zzso In addition, the zzso zzso zzso repeats zzso at low stringency to zzso sequences located at the zzso of human zzso
