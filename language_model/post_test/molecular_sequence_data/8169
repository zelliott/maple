By means of zzso Carlo zzso we investigated the equilibrium between folded and unfolded states of lattice model zzso The zzso acid sequences were designed to have pronounced energy minimum target zzso of different length and zzso For short fully compact zzso zzso the zzso transition from the unfolded state to the native state was zzso This was not always the case for longer zzso Among 12 designed sequences with the native structure of a fully compact zzso a simple zzso transition was observed in only three zzso For the other nine zzso three states of zzso native, zzso and intermediate zzso zzso The zzso part of the native structure zzso was zzso in the intermediate state, whereas the remaining part was completely unfolded and zzso These parts melted separately from each zzso
