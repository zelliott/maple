The maturation of zzso in the zzso is a complex process that requires the active involvement of the zzso zzso The primary focus toward zzso the role of the zzso in the maturation process has been the study of zzso zzso proteins and their interaction with zzso To date there is a paucity of information regarding zzso zzso cell surface zzso which may also play important roles in zzso zzso Through a zzso zzso approach to identify genes specifically expressed in the zzso zzso the mouse zzso of a member of the zzso (a zzso and zzso family of proteins was zzso This rapidly growing gene family encodes cell surface proteins that possess putative zzso and zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses demonstrated that the mouse zzso zzso termed zzso is expressed in the zzso region of the zzso and in the anterior zzso zzso with no zzso expression in the zzso other zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso zzso experiments revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited an zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso zzso that may correlate with an unusual sparsely zzso zzso zzso uniquely present in the zzso region of the zzso and to which no known function has been zzso zzso zzso and genetic strategies demonstrated that zzso gene expression requires, in a zzso manner, zzso as well as zzso factors for zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso is dependent upon an intact zzso because in zzso zzso analyses of the zzso zzso zzso from a testosterone maintained zzso mouse did not show the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Finally, zzso mapping demonstrated that the zzso gene maps to the central region of mouse zzso 14, approximately 4-5 zzso zzso from the zzso beta zzso which encodes another zzso zzso zzso
