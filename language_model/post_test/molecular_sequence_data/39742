The importance of zzso in governing the zzso protein degradation process has been increasingly zzso Recent investigations indicate that zzso complexes may exist in a zzso and zzso zzso To date, despite evidence linking impaired protein degradation to cardiac disease zzso virtually nothing is known regarding the molecular zzso function, or regulation of cardiac zzso We have taken a functional zzso approach to characterize zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to obtain highly zzso and functionally viable cardiac zzso and zzso zzso complexes, which were subjected to zzso and tandem mass zzso zzso Our data revealed complex molecular organization of cardiac zzso zzso some of which are similar to what were reported in zzso whereas others exhibit contrasting features that have not been previously identified in other species or cell zzso At least 36 distinct zzso (17 of zzso and 19 of zzso are zzso and assembled as zzso zzso in this vital cardiac zzso whereas the expression of zzso and zzso zzso were detected with limited participation in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso included a new alternatively spliced zzso of zzso zzso along with its primary zzso zzso zzso and zzso verified the expression of key alpha and beta zzso in zzso The expression of 14 zzso alpha and beta zzso in parallel with their three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the normal heart was not zzso these findings represent a distinct level of structural complexity of cardiac zzso significantly different from that of zzso and human zzso Furthermore, liquid zzso mass zzso characterized 3 distinct types of zzso modifications including zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso Taken together, this report presents the first comprehensive characterization of cardiac zzso zzso providing critical structural and zzso information fundamental to our future understanding of this essential protein degradation system in the normal and diseased zzso
