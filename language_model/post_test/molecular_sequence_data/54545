English walnut zzso zzso zzso is the most economically important species from all the 21 species belonging to the zzso zzso and is an important and healthy food as well as base material for zzso zzso The aim of this study was to develop a simple technique for specific characterization of English walnut using DNA zzso The first and second internal transcribed zzso zzso and zzso as well as the intervening zzso coding region of the zzso gene for 18 zzso of zzso zzso zzso isolated from different geographic origins were zzso The size of the zzso sequences ranged from zzso to 263 bases for zzso and from 217 to 219 bases for zzso Variation of zzso contents has also been observed and scored as zzso and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso This data exhibited the presence of zzso among zzso zzso of the zzso sequences from 18 walnut zzso showed that there were zzso single zzso zzso zzso and 1 short zzso zzso at zzso end zzso zzso zzso zzso system strategy was successfully applied to the zzso markers of the zzso and zzso sequences for the zzso analysis of 17 on 18 walnut zzso The prediction of zzso and zzso zzso secondary structure from each zzso was improved by detecting key functional elements shared by all sequences in the zzso zzso analysis of the zzso region clearly separated the isolated sequences into two zzso The results showed that zzso and zzso region could be used to discriminate these walnut zzso
