We identified and characterized zzso zzso a restriction zzso integration zzso zzso affecting zzso body zzso in zzso zzso The zzso produces an zzso zzso body in which the zzso hardly zzso during zzso body zzso In the wild type, zzso zzso cells, zzso growth of which is responsible for zzso zzso make side-by-side contact with one another and run parallel to the zzso zzso whereas in the zzso the organization of the zzso tissue is disturbed and much space is produced between zzso zzso This disorganization of the zzso zzso together with reduced zzso of the zzso cells, causes the zzso zzso short and zzso After a zzso rescue, the zzso gene was identified as a DNA zzso that zzso the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a general zzso domain and to be located in the plasma zzso zzso of the zzso gene is specifically activated in rapidly zzso zzso zzso involvement of the putative zzso zzso in zzso connection is zzso
