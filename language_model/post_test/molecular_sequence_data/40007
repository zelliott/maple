zzso a member of the zzso family, is a high zzso high capacity, zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso critical for zzso binding and transport lie in a highly zzso signature motif downstream from zzso and within zzso Here we examine the role of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso First, using a zzso analysis, we studied the role of a short motif zzso zzso in all zzso zzso zzso were zzso decreasing zzso zzso zzso or abolishing zzso the capacity for zzso zzso without affecting zzso zzso binding or expression in the plasma zzso All zzso zzso showed nearly normal zzso binding affinities but most zzso zzso zzso were zzso a zzso associated with partial zzso retention and/or targeting of zzso in small zzso Only zzso zzso showed nearly zzso function, suggesting that His or zzso zzso might act as H donors in interactions affecting zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso and zzso seem to affect the flexibility of zzso in a way that affects either transport zzso per zzso zzso or expression in the plasma membrane zzso We then examined the role of a zzso zzso Repeat zzso motif present in zzso of zzso but not in other zzso zzso replacing zzso with Ala zzso altered zzso the binding affinities of zzso and zzso acid, in a zzso zzso This result strongly suggested that the presence of zzso zzso and zzso affects the flexibility of zzso zzso binding site, in a way that is necessary for high affinity zzso acid zzso A possible role of the zzso motif in zzso interactions or in zzso zzso is zzso
