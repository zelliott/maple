zzso zzso copper zzso zzso is a functional zzso of zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso copper zzso In higher plants, zzso has to be transported to zzso cells through zzso being the only zzso reported to date that leaves the cell where it is zzso zzso has two different zzso the zzso domain zzso among other zzso and a zzso domain absent in all the identified zzso zzso The aim of the present study was the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso domain of the copper zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of the isolated zzso in solution is complex and implies the adoption of mixed zzso in different zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso of zzso adopts and extended zzso in solution with a high content in zzso structure that zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso drying electron zzso studies revealed the existence of well ordered zzso zzso in preparations from both the zzso and its zzso zzso 

A number of proteins related with copper zzso have a high tendency to form zzso The zzso for zzso formation, as well as the possible zzso role are not fully zzso Here we show that the plant exclusive zzso of the copper zzso zzso has zzso plasticity and forms zzso at defined experimental zzso The putative influence of these properties with plant copper delivery will be addressed in the zzso
