The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso usage and specificity of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso derived from zzso have been zzso In young conventionally reared mice, approximately 50% of the zzso express zzso alpha beta and 50% express zzso gamma zzso although there is considerable variation between zzso Here we demonstrate that zzso zzso can be prepared from freshly isolated zzso mouse zzso The expressed zzso of these zzso reflects the zzso zzso distribution of the zzso zzso Analysis of the gamma delta zzso expressed by the zzso demonstrates that zzso express a greater number of zzso V gene segments than has been reported for gamma delta T cells in several other zzso zzso At least five types of gamma delta zzso are expressed by a panel of zzso zzso zzso although use of the gamma delta zzso V gene repertoire clearly is not zzso Some zzso gamma delta cells and gamma delta zzso have been reported to recognize zzso protein zzso zzso however, none of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in response to zzso These data suggest that most zzso gamma delta zzso are not likely to be zzso zzso
