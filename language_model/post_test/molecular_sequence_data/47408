zzso experiments with zzso I provide a zzso for investigating the molecular basis of zzso sequence recognition by zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso produced by directed zzso in zzso zzso Using zzso DNA molecules variously zzso with zzso and/or zzso zzso it is shown that the location of the zzso group of zzso zzso in the minor groove of the double zzso exerts a dominant influence in determining where the zzso will zzso as it does for zzso However, newly created binding sites in DNA molecules zzso with zzso zzso all located round zzso steps, bind zzso with so much higher affinity than the zzso zzso steps that the latter fail completely to appear as zzso in zzso zzso indeed zzso sequences appear in regions of enhanced zzso to zzso zzso as do zzso steps in doubly D + zzso zzso zzso zzso plots confirm that sequences surrounding zzso steps bind zzso several zzso more tightly than do zzso zzso with zzso zzso of the order of 25 zzso To test the hypothesis that differences in stacking interactions between the zzso of the drug and the DNA base pairs could account for the differences in binding zzso models of zzso bound to two DNA zzso containing either a central zzso or a central zzso step were zzso zzso of the molecular zzso potential zzso of zzso in solution using a zzso method revealed a distinctive pattern that is considered relevant to DNA zzso When the zzso calculated for the two DNA zzso in the zzso state were zzso substantial differences were found in the major groove and in the space between the base pairs that is occupied by the zzso of the drug upon zzso The zzso data support the notion that zzso stacking interactions zzso the considerably preferred binding of zzso and zzso around zzso steps rather than zzso zzso
