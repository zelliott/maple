There is a clear need for new approaches in the field of microbial community zzso since the methods used can be severely zzso We have developed a DNA zzso method that targets zzso zzso DNA zzso enabling the direct detection and zzso of zzso from complex communities without zzso The approach is based on the construction of specific zzso from the zzso zzso sequence data retrieved directly from the zzso The specificity of the zzso is obtained through a combination of DNA array zzso and zzso labeling of the constructed zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and scanning electron zzso were used as reference methods in the development and evaluation of the zzso The description of microbial communities in ready-to-eat vegetable salads in a modified atmosphere was used as the experimental zzso Comparisons were made with respect to the effect of storage at different temperatures for up to 12 days and with respect to the geographic origin of the zzso lettuce zzso or zzso the main salad zzso The conclusion drawn from the method comparison was that the DNA zzso method gave an accurate description of the microbial zzso zzso zzso dominated both of the salad zzso containing either Norwegian or Spanish lettuce, before storage and after storage at 4 degrees zzso The zzso population also dominated the batch containing Norwegian lettuce after storage at 10 degrees zzso On the contrary, zzso and zzso acid bacteria dominated the microbial community of the batch containing Spanish lettuce after storage at 10 degrees zzso In that zzso the zzso also were abundant after storage at 4 degrees C as well as before zzso The practical implications of these results are that microbial communities in ready-to-eat vegetable salads can be diverse and that microbial composition is dependent both on the origin of the raw material and on the storage zzso
