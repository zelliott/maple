The expression of zzso zzso gamma and delta zzso of zzso protein zzso type II zzso zzso zzso in the brain of mature and zzso developing rats was examined by in zzso zzso zzso At the adult stage, zzso for both zzso were expressed in the zzso bulb, and zzso zzso The cerebral zzso expressed the gamma zzso zzso evenly through the layers II to VI at a moderate level, whereas the delta zzso zzso was expressed in a distinctly zzso zzso The zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells expressed the gamma zzso zzso intensely without any significant expression signals for the delta zzso In the zzso moderate expression signals for the gamma zzso were confined to the zzso cell layer, while intense expression signals for the delta zzso were detected in the zzso zzso cell layer, without any significant expression signals in the zzso cell zzso In the spinal cord, zzso for the gamma zzso was expressed in zzso throughout the gray matter, while the expression of zzso for the delta zzso was confined to zzso in zzso I and zzso The expression pattern of genes for both zzso was basically accomplished at birth with lower intensity, except for the zzso and zzso zzso cells, which zzso expressed zzso for the gamma and delta zzso respectively, at zzso These results indicate that the expression of genes for each of the zzso of zzso zzso II is zzso regulated in various brain regions and that the individual zzso are involved in differential functions in mature and developing rat zzso
