It has been shown previously that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso zzso at the active site, involving zzso participating in zzso binding and the zzso change that results in zzso release to the zzso zzso and formation of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and McIntosh, zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This study shows that 10 zzso of zzso of protein attached zzso to the zzso under conditions optimal for formation of the zzso zzso Half of this amount zzso 1 zzso zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso released two zzso zzso species, which were isolated and identified as zzso AND zzso zzso zzso where the missing zzso are zzso and zzso The majority of the zzso label was released in the sixth cycle of both zzso zzso confirming the zzso zzso zzso and zzso are evidently close together in the active site, but their distance apart in the linear sequence suggests that they may arise from separate zzso which together constitute an zzso binding zzso zzso in both regions, and zzso in particular zzso zzso zzso zzso and Berman, zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have been zzso by zzso affinity zzso zzso of both of these zzso in some of the bacterial zzso zzso suggest that they do not play an essential zzso role, and the inability of the zzso zzso to form zzso and to release zzso to the zzso is probably because an essential zzso structural movement at the active site is zzso
