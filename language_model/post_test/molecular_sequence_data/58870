From a human zzso zzso library we isolated two novel genes zzso peptides containing six zzso zzso Both showed significant zzso with zzso a gene strongly expressed in neural zzso of zzso The zzso designated zzso zzso type 1) and zzso zzso type zzso contained open reading frames zzso 810 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is strongly expressed in brain of adult and fetus but only zzso in fetal zzso zzso and zzso were mapped by FISH to zzso bands zzso and zzso zzso
