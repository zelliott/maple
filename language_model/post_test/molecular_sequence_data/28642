The sequences of part of the zzso zzso gene zzso and of the zzso gene zzso were determined and aligned for 45 zzso zzso zzso from different clinical and geographical zzso The patterns of sequence divergence of zzso and zzso were very zzso The sequences of a zzso fraction of zzso showed 45 zzso zzso 40 of which allowed the separation of zzso zzso into two major zzso which were not found when the deduced zzso acid sequences were zzso The zzso sequences zzso for the zzso gene showed 112 zzso zzso 96 of which separated the population into the same two divisions as those described for zzso In this case, the deduced zzso acid sequences showed this subdivision as well: three of the six observed zzso acid zzso were zzso Within the two zzso both genes presented a high degree of sequence zzso Each zzso zzso division was associated with the presence of a different zzso resistance zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso I) and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso No particular clusters associated with geographical or clinical origin, or with the production of an zzso were zzso zzso of the zzso gene allowed identification of two different zzso in division zzso However, no association of these different zzso zzso with the expression of zzso resistance was zzso In conclusion, the zzso patterns observed by sequencing zzso and zzso are in agreement with those obtained previously by zzso zzso zzso zzso Thus, it appears that the evolution of zzso and zzso genes is similar to that of the whole zzso of zzso zzso zzso gene transfer between divisions I and II seems to be low, at zzso However, the results of the present study could not clarify definitively whether divisions I and II should be considered as two different zzso zzso zzso
