The zzso fusion inhibitor zzso zzso is the first of a new class of entry zzso to receive zzso zzso We previously determined the zzso of 55 zzso zzso to zzso and a second zzso zzso zzso Seven of the 55 viral zzso were zzso to zzso zzso or both zzso in the absence of prior zzso To determine the molecular basis of the zzso zzso we zzso amplified and cloned five zzso and one zzso zzso biologically functional zzso genes and characterized viruses zzso with the zzso proteins in a zzso drug sensitivity zzso Overall, the mean 50% zzso zzso of zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso zzso were zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso greater, respectively, than those for a zzso lab strain, zzso however, all of the zzso zzso proteins zzso the sequence of a critical zzso interaction site zzso 36 to 38 of zzso zzso in zzso In contrast, multiple zzso acid changes were observed zzso to zzso many of which were located in regions of zzso corresponding to the zzso Nevertheless, peptides based on zzso zzso sequences were not more potent zzso than zzso or zzso arguing that the basis of zzso zzso is not a zzso competitive zzso zzso These results demonstrate that regions of zzso outside the zzso interaction site can significantly impact the zzso zzso of zzso zzso even prior to drug zzso We zzso that both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that minimize the window of opportunity for zzso to bind provide a growth advantage and possibly a predisposition to resistance to this new class of drugs in zzso
