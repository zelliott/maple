The zzso zzso zzso zzso is the primary mechanism for the zzso of plasma cholesterol into cells and serves as a zzso for a growing family of cell surface zzso These receptors all zzso zzso repeated zzso zzso to bind their zzso Each zzso module is about 40 zzso long, has six zzso zzso zzso and contains a zzso zzso region near the zzso which serves as a zzso zzso The structure of the interface presented for zzso binding by these zzso and the basis for their specificity and affinity in zzso zzso is not yet zzso We have zzso zzso molecules corresponding to zzso zzso five zzso six zzso and the module zzso pair zzso of the LDL zzso zzso is required to establish native zzso bonds and to maintain the structural integrity of zzso zzso and the zzso module zzso zzso studies of the zzso and zzso zzso within zzso indicate that each change leads to zzso of the zzso explaining the previous observation that each of these changes mimics the functional effect of deletion of the entire module zzso zzso zzso Brown, zzso zzso and Goldstein, zzso zzso (1989) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso By fluorescence, the affinity of zzso for zzso which is crucial for folding and function of these zzso remains approximately 40 zzso whether zzso is zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of individual zzso to those of the module pair indicates that most of the significant zzso changes lie within the zzso region between zzso and that little structural interaction occurs between the zzso of zzso five and six in the 5-6 zzso These findings strongly support a model in which each module is essentially structurally independent of the zzso
