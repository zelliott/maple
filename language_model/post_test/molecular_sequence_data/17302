Unlike many other zzso channels, unrelated gene families zzso gap junctions in different animal zzso zzso and zzso genes are found in zzso while zzso species use zzso zzso zzso are often described as zzso zzso despite the existence of zzso zzso We have cloned zzso sequences from an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso shared zzso sequence identity with human zzso had zzso zzso containing six zzso zzso zzso coding regions that were interrupted by zzso and formed functional channels in zzso These data show that gap junction channels based on zzso are present in animals that zzso zzso zzso
