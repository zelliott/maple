We have constructed a zzso physical and zzso map that spans the human zzso region and includes the zzso end of the zzso using a combination of zzso In total 88 zzso units including zzso zzso and zzso zzso were characterized and 60 were confidently positioned on the physical zzso These include a number of genes zzso nuclear and zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso cell cycle, DNA packaging, and zzso related zzso zzso zzso immune response zzso zzso zzso zzso and zinc zzso genes zzso zzso zzso related zzso cell signaling zzso structural zzso and other genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as a number of zzso genes and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, several novel genes (a zzso a zzso a zzso a zzso and zzso have been identified, as well as zzso and zzso zzso The detailed map of the gene content of this zzso segment provides a number of candidate zzso which may be involved in several biological processes that have been associated with this region, such as zzso development, zzso and zzso The data provide useful tools for zzso studies between mice and humans, for zzso structure analysis, gene density zzso and studies of zzso zzso of different zzso and zzso light and zzso dark zzso
