In this report we investigate the role of zzso genes of the zzso class in adult zzso the process by which zzso are formed in the bone zzso We initially identified zzso genes expressed in mouse zzso cells by a zzso technique using zzso zzso capable of detecting most of the known genes in zzso clusters zzso Four different zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso An zzso zzso directed against zzso zzso zzso of zzso was used to study the effect of the colony formation by human zzso zzso zzso The zzso inhibited the formation of zzso unit zzso colonies but did not affect the size or degree of zzso The more primitive zzso zzso unit colonies or zzso colonies were not zzso These results show that zzso is involved in an early step in the proliferation of the zzso zzso unit subset of zzso zzso
