The zzso protein associates with zzso zzso complexes and zzso their zzso zzso zzso is regulated at various levels, including translation, degradation by the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Here, we describe point zzso of zzso deficient in their interaction with either zzso zzso zzso zzso or both zzso and demonstrate that each contact is critical for zzso zzso and induction of zzso zzso Through its intact zzso zzso zzso associated with active zzso zzso and, unlike wild type zzso zzso or zzso was efficiently zzso by zzso on a zzso zzso zzso target site zzso zzso expressed zzso was rapidly zzso through the zzso in zzso cells, but was stabilized by secondary zzso of the zzso site to zzso In this experimental setting, zzso zzso zzso formed inactive zzso complexes with cellular zzso zzso was not zzso through the zzso and was not further stabilized by the zzso zzso zzso which was not recruited to zzso zzso also remained stable in zzso Thus, selective degradation of zzso depended upon association with active zzso zzso and subsequent zzso Altogether, these data show that zzso must be zzso by zzso on the zzso site in order to be zzso by the zzso We propose that cellular zzso must also exist zzso in a zzso zzso zzso in zzso
