Twelve zzso (one complete zzso of zzso flexible, zzso zzso zzso have been simulated in zzso solution with zzso zzso for 70 zzso Most of the zzso zzso have rotated in accordance with a zzso zzso The zzso zzso was probably partly stabilized by zzso which coordinate one of the zzso zzso and the zzso of the next zzso zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso close to the zzso axis rotated and pulled about half of the zzso zzso further into the zzso These zzso also gave rise to rather large zzso from the crystal structure zzso with their tendency of pulling the bases closer toward the zzso zzso A flipping of the orientation about the zzso bond from the zzso to the zzso region was observed for one zzso also leading to zzso from the crystal zzso Many bridges containing one or two water molecules were found, with a dominance for the zzso They essentially formed a network of zzso and zzso bridges between zzso and zzso zzso zzso A zzso of water molecules could be distinguished as a dark zzso pattern in the water density zzso The lifetime of a bridge containing one water was about twice as long as that of a zzso bridge and it lasted zzso times longer than a hydrogen bond in zzso The lifetimes were also calculated for a selection of bridge types, in order of decreasing zzso zzso zzso W zzso zzso much greater than zzso zzso W zzso zzso greater than zzso zzso W zzso zzso The zzso motion of water molecules in the first zzso shell around selected groups was slowed down considerably compared to bulk water and the decreasing order of correlation times was zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso greater than zzso
