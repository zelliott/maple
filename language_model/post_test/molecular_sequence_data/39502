A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed via zzso fusion and expressed successfully in zzso zzso The zzso fusion protein zzso zzso exhibited both zzso and zzso zzso Compared with parental zzso the zzso zzso was characterized by kinetic parameters of decreased zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso had an increased zzso zzso and decreased zzso zzso These indicate a zzso net increase and a zzso decrease in zzso efficiency zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso of both zzso at zzso degrees C or pH zzso were compared with those of the parental zzso Despite some variations, common zzso were 40 degrees C and pH zzso for the zzso zzso and parent, and zzso degrees C and pH zzso for the zzso zzso Thus, the fusion zzso zzso was zzso with greatly enhanced zzso activity associated with a decrease in zzso zzso
