We have characterized an unusual family with two different zzso zzso zzso gene zzso in which we propose a novel mechanism of deletion formation has zzso zzso individuals have the zzso disorder zzso zzso syndrome, and we previously showed that different family members have deletions of different zzso of the zzso zzso We have now fully zzso the deletions from affected individuals, and confirmed the presence of different deletions in different affected family zzso Most affected and zzso individuals have a zzso deletion of zzso 5 that occurred between repeated zzso motifs in zzso 4 and zzso One affected zzso individual has a zzso deletion of zzso 6 and 7 that occurred between repeated zzso motifs in zzso 5 and zzso The zzso 5 zzso junctions of the two deletions are only 11 zzso zzso Surprisingly, the maternal grandmother of the original index case was found to be mosaic for both zzso events, as well as having the normal zzso zzso zzso ruled out zzso zzso indicating triple zzso for the two different deleted zzso zzso and a normal zzso zzso This triple zzso must have occurred early in embryonic development, as both deletions were passed on to different zzso Based on these findings, we propose a novel mechanism of deletion zzso We suggest that during zzso gene zzso a double strand DNA break occurred in zzso 5, and that a zzso of replication zzso occurred on both newly zzso strands between the repeat motifs of zzso leading to the formation of the two different zzso gene zzso
