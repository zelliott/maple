A partial zzso library of sea bass DNA was constructed and screened with a goldfish zzso zzso zzso Two identical clones were isolated and zzso The clones contain a segment with high identity to zzso 2 of the zzso gene in zzso This segment encodes a zzso acid zzso consisting of a signal zzso of 28 zzso acids and the main portion of the mature zzso zzso zzso zzso In the latter extension, sea bass zzso shows high identity with the human and deduced ancestral zzso sequences zzso and zzso zzso The open reading frame is followed by a consensus zzso donor zzso Northern zzso zzso to examine tissue distribution detected a zzso zzso transcript restricted to brain zzso These data show that the zzso gene of this zzso fish has the same zzso positions as zzso for at least two of the zzso three zzso In addition, the high evolutionary conservation of zzso is zzso since sea bass zzso exhibits the same identity to both goldfish and human zzso
