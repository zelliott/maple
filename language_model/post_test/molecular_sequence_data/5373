The zzso system of zzso zzso mediates zzso maintenance by killing of zzso zzso zzso of the stable zzso zzso zzso is zzso by the unstable zzso zzso zzso Using genetic zzso simulations and zzso zzso we zzso five zzso and two zzso zzso zzso A similar folding zzso was found for all zzso zzso zzso at the very zzso of the zzso were predicted to prevent the formation of structures required for translation and zzso zzso zzso Thus the folding of the zzso zzso appears to explain the apparent zzso of the nascent zzso In the full-length zzso long-range zzso to 3' interactions were predicted in all zzso The zzso to 3' interactions lock the zzso in inactive zzso zzso of the zzso is activated by 3' zzso zzso zzso of the 3' processing predicted that it triggers zzso of the zzso zzso with the formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso target zzso zzso of the zzso sequences revealed a large number of zzso zzso that support the existence of the proposed secondary zzso Furthermore, coupled zzso support the folding zzso and provide evidence that the zzso zzso pair with three different partners during the proposed series of dynamic zzso zzso
