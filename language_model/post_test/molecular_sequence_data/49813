The zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso of the prion protein sequence zzso zzso is largely used to explore the zzso mechanisms underlying the prion zzso However, whether the zzso toxicity of zzso zzso is caused by a soluble or zzso form of this zzso is still zzso The aim of this study was to correlate the structural state of this zzso with its zzso Here we show that the two zzso zzso and zzso zzso in force of their intrinsic flexibility, prevent the zzso assuming a structured zzso zzso its zzso in zzso zzso The substitution of both zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso AA zzso zzso reduces the flexibility of this prion zzso and results in a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso AA zzso was highly toxic when incubated with zzso cells, likely behaving as a zzso zzso intermediate of the zzso zzso zzso These data further confirm that the zzso zzso is not necessary for the induction of the toxic effects of zzso zzso
