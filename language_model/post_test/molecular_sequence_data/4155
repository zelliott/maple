zzso zzso or zzso have been identified and characterized in plants, the blood fluke zzso zzso and zzso The zzso are a novel family of zzso zzso and display restricted specificity for zzso zzso on the zzso side of zzso zzso Two forms of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso have been analyzed for zzso specificity using a zzso synthetic zzso library zzso We first screened zzso using a zzso zzso This library demonstrated the absolute specificity of zzso for zzso at zzso To determine the zzso preferences of zzso we constructed a library with zzso fixed at zzso and the zzso positions zzso The library was screened using the two forms of zzso human zzso zzso and to confirm its diversity, zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso showed a preference for zzso zzso and zzso zzso with an overall broader specificity at zzso than at zzso Both human and zzso zzso can accommodate zzso and Ala at zzso and zzso However, optimal zzso sequences zzso with zzso preferring zzso and human zzso preferring zzso zzso of zzso specificity from the library screen were confirmed using single zzso zzso for kinetic zzso
