zzso acid zzso has been shown to induce zzso differentiation and/or zzso and is widely used as a zzso agent for treating the patients with zzso However, the therapeutic effect of zzso is still zzso To unveil the molecular zzso inducing differentiation and zzso in zzso cells, we compared zzso and zzso cell lines, in which zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso cell lines, in which it zzso zzso zzso Here, we found that zzso was strongly zzso in zzso and zzso cells, whereas it was abundantly expressed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells was associated with a significant zzso of zzso and zzso as well as zzso release of zzso c from zzso in a zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso significantly inhibited zzso zzso in zzso zzso In addition, treatment of zzso cells with a zzso zzso zzso enhanced zzso response induced by zzso Of note, two out of 10 sporadic zzso expressed zzso at zzso levels and underwent cell death in response to zzso in primary zzso Thus, our present results suggest that zzso of zzso is one of the key mechanisms to give zzso cells the resistance against zzso zzso This may provide a new therapeutic strategy against the zzso and aggressive zzso by combining treatment with zzso and a zzso zzso
