zzso zzso resonance zzso zzso zzso zzso has been used to characterize a proposed zzso zzso of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso zzso Each of nine consecutive zzso was zzso to zzso and subsequently labeled with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso protein zzso into zzso Continuous wave zzso power zzso methods were used to determine exposure of the zzso side chains to a series of zzso relaxation agents, including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and molecular zzso The zzso attached to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had higher collision zzso with molecular oxygen than with polar relaxation agents, indicating that these sites are exposed to the zzso phase of the zzso zzso zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso had higher collision rates with the polar agents than with zzso suggesting that these sites are exposed to the zzso zzso The alternating zzso observed with the polar relaxation agents, zzso and zzso and in opposite phase with zzso is consistent with zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso concentration zzso of zzso and zzso across the zzso and zzso for our system with zzso zzso indicated that zzso was nearest the center of the zzso and that zzso and zzso were located just below the zzso surface in opposite leaflets of the zzso Thus, we conclude that this approach, through mapping of individual zzso has the capability of defining zzso secondary zzso
