zzso membrane proteins often contain zzso zzso in their zzso zzso zzso fragments, which may strongly influence their folding and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain of zzso A zzso showed that replacement of the zzso located at the center abrogates zzso packing while substitution of the zzso forming the ending zzso turns allows zzso zzso zzso TM peptides revealed that a point zzso of one of the zzso of the zzso motif zzso located at the zzso zzso turn of the zzso TM fragment, adopts a secondary structure and zzso state similar to the zzso sequence in zzso In addition, both zzso mapping in biological zzso and molecular dynamics showed that the presence of a zzso zzso at the zzso interface has as an effect the extension of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso packing can be an important factor that determines appearance of zzso in TM zzso zzso proteins might accumulate zzso zzso at the two ends of their TM segments in order to zzso the zzso of key zzso acid zzso at the interface for molecular recognition events while allowing stable association and native zzso
