A new zzso species, zzso zzso was isolated from respiratory tract specimens of five human zzso The strains of this species exhibited similar zzso and zzso features that differentiated them from all recognized zzso zzso all of these strains developed irregular and strongly adherent colonies under zzso conditions and produced acid from zzso and zzso The cells are long zzso rods with some zzso This species has characteristics of the zzso zzso such as 55 zzso zzso plus zzso in the DNA and the presence of zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso in the cell zzso These zzso formed a homogeneous group in which the zzso similarity values (as determined by an zzso zzso zzso compared with reference strain zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso ranged from 71 to zzso The analysis of the nearly complete zzso zzso gene sequence of zzso zzso indicated that this new species represents a distinct zzso within the zzso zzso This new species can be identified on the basis of its colony zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the type strain of zzso zzso
