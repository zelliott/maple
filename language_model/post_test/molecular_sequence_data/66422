zzso genes belong to the zzso family of zzso regulators and have been shown to control different aspects of shoot development in various zzso zzso including flower zzso in zzso and zzso zzso growth in zzso Genes related to the zzso gene from zzso show independent zzso in both zzso and zzso However, it remains unclear to what extent this affected the evolution of flower symmetry and shoot branching in these and other zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso genes have also undergone zzso in two related zzso families, zzso and zzso zzso These families exhibit zzso diversity in flower symmetry and zzso architecture that is potentially related to functions of zzso zzso We present sequences of 14 zzso genes covering 9 zzso zzso analyses indicate the presence of three zzso of zzso zzso Shared motifs in the region between the zzso and R zzso of zzso genes between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicate that the observed zzso originated from a single zzso gene present in all zzso zzso expression data suggest that gene zzso and diversification in zzso and zzso zzso was accompanied by divergence in expression zzso
