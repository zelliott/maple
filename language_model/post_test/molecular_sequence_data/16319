zzso zzso zzso and zzso suitable for in zzso gene amplification for subsequent zzso zzso were zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso coli host cells and zzso resistance to animal cells and contains a single zzso zzso site, zzso near the zzso site (the recognition site is zzso The cassette zzso zzso zzso contains a multiple cloning site zzso between the zzso virus 40 early promoter and the zzso signal sequence flanked by the same zzso sites and zzso zzso resistance to zzso coli host zzso After inserting a coding zzso for human protein C or its zzso in the appropriate orientation in the zzso of zzso the zzso expression unit zzso was zzso mixed with zzso zzso DNA at a molecular ratio of 20 to zzso and zzso This allowed for tandem gene amplification due to zzso cohesive zzso zzso products were packaged in zzso zzso zzso amplified in zzso coli cells as large zzso zzso and then introduced into zzso zzso zzso zzso were found to produce and zzso zzso protein molecules at a high zzso The zzso zzso developed in this work will provide a rapid screening system useful for protein engineering in animal zzso
