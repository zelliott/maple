zzso of zzso zzso receptors requires the binding of both zzso and zzso to independent sites on the zzso These zzso bind to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso are located in two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which have been implicated in zzso binding in other zzso zzso zzso zzso To further define the zzso acids through which zzso activates the zzso we generated zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and expressed them with wild type zzso in zzso zzso zzso Using calcium imaging and whole cell patch clamp we determined zzso and zzso zzso Of the eight zzso zzso we identified five zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso whose zzso leads to a large reduction (from zzso to zzso in zzso zzso consistent with a role for these zzso in zzso zzso by zzso The potency of zzso was largely unchanged by these zzso Thus our results extend the knowledge base of zzso involved in zzso zzso function and identifies a new site in S1, in the region of zzso that has a role in zzso zzso by zzso
