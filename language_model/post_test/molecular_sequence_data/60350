zzso zzso zzso are powerful zzso of zzso channels that contain certain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channels only, whereas zzso is less zzso but exhibits highest affinity for zzso zzso the nature of interactions of zzso with native zzso channels composed of zzso and zzso (plus zzso zzso were zzso using 15 zzso zzso in which zzso acids were altered in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso antagonism of zzso zzso binding to zzso zzso channels in rat brain zzso and blockade of the zzso 1 current expressed in zzso were zzso Also, the levels of zzso of zzso binding to brain zzso by the zzso zzso were used to measure their zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with zzso zzso channels that possess zzso as a major or minor zzso zzso of toxin binding to either of these zzso was not altered by single substitution with zzso of three basic zzso in the zzso region, or zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso representative zzso zzso zzso blocked the zzso current with the same potency as the natural zzso In contrast, competition of the binding of the zzso zzso or zzso was dramatically reduced by zzso substitution of zzso or zzso in the zzso whereas changing nearby zzso caused negligible zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited diminished functional blockade of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso region of zzso was found to be responsible for recognition of zzso channels because zzso of zzso led to approximately zzso reduction in the zzso potency for zzso binding and a large decrease in its ability to block the zzso zzso the effect of this substitution on the affinity of zzso for zzso zzso was much less dramatic zzso zzso
