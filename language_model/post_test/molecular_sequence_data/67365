We have constructed a zzso zzso zzso capable of using the human zzso zzso zzso as its entry zzso The envelope protein of the virus was made by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso for zzso flanked by zzso zzso into one of the variable zzso of the zzso binding domain of zzso a zzso leukemia virus zzso that uses the zzso virus zzso zzso and which has a host range limited to zzso zzso This envelope protein can zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso for entry into host cells with equal zzso In addition, the zzso virus replicates in cells expressing either of its zzso zzso and zzso zzso and causes resistance to zzso and zzso of zzso in infected zzso Thus, zzso is the first example of a zzso zzso zzso with replication characteristics and zzso interference properties similar to those of natural zzso
