zzso studies revealed that the novel rice zzso zzso zzso has several unique zzso characteristics as compared to conventional zzso The zzso form of zzso is very stable, whereas the zzso form of conventional zzso is zzso In the present study, the crystal structure of the novel rice zzso motor domain zzso zzso with zzso was determined at zzso zzso zzso The overall structure of zzso is similar to that of conventional zzso motor zzso as expected from the high zzso acid sequence similarity zzso However, several unique structures in zzso were zzso The position and length of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are key functional regions, were different from those observed in conventional zzso Moreover, the zzso region of the zzso zzso showed an ordered zzso at a position quite different from that previously observed in conventional zzso These structural differences may reflect the unique zzso characteristics of rice zzso zzso
