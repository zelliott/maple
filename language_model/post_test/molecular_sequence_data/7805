The zzso locus of zzso zzso appears to control the production of a signal that must be transmitted between cells for the completion of zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis suggested that the zzso locus encodes the E1 zzso zzso of E1 alpha and E1 beta zzso of a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso that is involved in zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The properties of an zzso zzso zzso supported this zzso These properties include: zzso the growth yield of the zzso was reduced with increasing zzso of the zzso in the medium while the growth yield of zzso cells increased, zzso zzso extracts were deficient in zzso activity, and zzso growth of the zzso in media with short zzso fatty acids related to the expected products of the zzso helped to correct the zzso defects in growth, pigmentation and zzso The zzso zzso appears to be involved in the synthesis of long zzso fatty acids since the zzso contained reduced levels of this class of zzso Our results are consistent with a model in which the zzso zzso is involved in the synthesis of zzso fatty acids during zzso growth, and these compounds are used later in zzso zzso during zzso
