zzso architecture of barley zzso zzso zzso is common among the zzso species, which bear one to three zzso zzso at each zzso zzso Triple zzso zzso is one of the unique features of barley zzso in which three zzso (one central and two lateral zzso are produced at each zzso zzso zzso of the lateral zzso at triple zzso zzso gives zzso identity to barley zzso zzso spikes show fertile lateral zzso and produce increased grain yield per zzso compared with zzso spikes with sterile lateral zzso Thus, far, two zzso governing the zzso zzso were isolated in barley that include zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the present study, we isolated zzso zzso zzso a barley zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso architecture gene zzso zzso zzso coding zzso in barley zzso zzso were specifically associated with lateral zzso fertility and loss of zzso zzso zzso analyses through zzso in zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso zzso controls the zzso zzso through zzso zzso a negative regulator of lateral zzso fertility in zzso Moreover, zzso may also regulate transcripts of barley zzso OF zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso implicated to control zzso zzso Our expression data illustrated that, although zzso is zzso among different grass species, its zzso target genes appear to be modified in barley and possibly other species of tribe zzso
