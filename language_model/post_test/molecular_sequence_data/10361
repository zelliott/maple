zzso from a damaged blood vessel is stopped by the formation of a zzso zzso The zzso plasma zzso von zzso factor zzso plays an essential role in this process by zzso blood zzso to the damaged vessel wall under conditions of high zzso zzso This factor mediates zzso zzso by binding both to collagen of the damaged blood vessel and to zzso zzso on the zzso zzso The A3 domain of zzso allows it to bind to collagen types I and III present in the zzso zzso tissue of the damaged vessel zzso To gain insight into the mechanism of collagen binding by zzso we have determined the crystal structure of the human zzso A3 zzso 

The crystal structure of the 20 zzso A3 domain of human zzso zzso zzso determined by the method of zzso anomalous zzso at zzso A resolution, exhibits a common zzso zzso The putative zzso site of the A3 domain is rather smooth and shows a markedly high concentration of zzso charged zzso This region encompasses a potential zzso site containing the motif zzso which is required for zzso interaction in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso Although zzso A3 has considerable sequence and structural similarity with zzso and zzso in this region, one loop of A3 adopts a zzso which is incompatible with zzso zzso 

The structure of the A3 domain suggests that zzso to collagen is primarily achieved through interactions between zzso charged zzso on A3 and positively charged zzso on zzso The absence of a pronounced binding groove zzso a large van der zzso surface interaction between A3 and collagen and is consistent with the low affinity for collagen of a single A3 domain and the requirement for zzso zzso for tight association with zzso The absence of bound metal zzso upon soaking the crystal in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso for metal binding is consistent with the absence of a functional role for metal zzso binding in A3, which contrasts the metal zzso zzso required for zzso binding by the zzso zzso I type zzso
