zzso zzso zzso zzso is one of the most extensively studied and widely used zzso zzso While the benefits of zzso treatment in gastrointestinal disorders and zzso are zzso functional zzso research of this zzso has only recently been zzso In the present study, a zzso zzso approach was used for the quantitative analysis of growth zzso changes in zzso protein zzso zzso were isolated from cells grown in zzso zzso medium or in rich laboratory medium for subsequent zzso zzso The analysis revealed patterns of protein abundance unique to each growth zzso In total, 196 zzso altered protein spots (at least zzso change in relative zzso p zzso zzso representing approximately zzso of all protein spots in the gel were zzso From these protein spots, 157 were identified by mass zzso and were found to represent 100 distinct gene zzso zzso these data show that growth of zzso in zzso medium increased the relative abundance of proteins involved in zzso zzso zzso zzso and fatty acid zzso In comparison, growth of zzso in laboratory medium resulted in an increase in the amount of proteins involved in translation and the general stress response, as well as zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, several zzso of the zzso system of zzso demonstrated growth zzso zzso The present study demonstrates the fundamental effects of culture conditions on the zzso of zzso which are likely to affect the functionality and characteristics of its use as a zzso
