The distribution of secondary structures along the zzso chains of zzso proteins zzso 1 and 2 and their zzso zzso has been studied by statistical zzso It was found that these proteins in the zzso form contain only trace amounts of zzso At the same time, the regions of the sequence including Ala and zzso are predicted as zzso (with zzso and zzso of zzso II zzso An analysis of literature data and our data obtained in this study shows that the main zzso of the zzso chain solutions of zzso 1 and 2 and their zzso zzso in water solutions is the zzso of zzso II type with some zzso of zzso and a very small share of zzso The transition to the state with extended zzso which are peculiar to mature filaments of zzso zzso requires the zzso of the zzso chain zzso Thus, the genesis of zzso in zzso web proteins is determined by the conditions of zzso transitions between the main regular zzso of the zzso chain zzso
