Satellite tobacco necrosis virus zzso zzso zzso is a naturally zzso viral zzso that contains zzso zzso 29 in the zzso untranslated region zzso 591 in the coding region and 619 in the 3' zzso zzso were made in the zzso and 3' zzso and the effects of these zzso on zzso efficiency and cap independence were measured in an in zzso translation system from wheat zzso zzso of the first 12 zzso or 10 changes in the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso reduced zzso efficiency approximately zzso capping of these zzso zzso zzso restored their zzso zzso zzso of the 3' zzso to zzso zzso or zzso or deletion of zzso zzso reduced zzso efficiency more than zzso capping of these 3' zzso zzso restored their zzso zzso These modifications in the 3' zzso increased the concentration of initiation factor zzso required for zzso zzso zzso were constructed which contained the coding region of rabbit zzso zzso and either the zzso zzso 3' zzso or both the zzso and 3' zzso of zzso zzso Both the zzso and 3' zzso of zzso zzso were necessary to obtain zzso zzso These findings indicate that interaction between zzso zzso and the region between zzso zzso and 737 in the 3' zzso are required for zzso zzso
