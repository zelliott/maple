The pepper L gene conditions the plant's resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a broadening zzso of resistance to different virus zzso In this study, we report the genetic basis for the zzso interaction between L genes and zzso zzso We cloned zzso using zzso methods, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using a zzso zzso L gene zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso resistance proteins with the ability to induce resistance response to the viral coat protein zzso zzso zzso by zzso Their different recognition zzso in original pepper species were reproduced in an zzso zzso transient expression system in zzso zzso zzso analysis with zzso which showed the zzso recognition spectrum, indicates that the broader recognition zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso require different zzso of the zzso zzso We identified a critical zzso acid zzso for the determination of recognition zzso but other regions also influenced the L zzso resistance zzso The results suggest that the zzso interactions between L genes and zzso zzso are determined by the interaction of multiple zzso of the zzso domain of L proteins with different viral zzso themselves or some protein complexes including zzso
