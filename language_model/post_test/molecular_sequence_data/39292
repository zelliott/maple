Two zzso strains were isolated from soil surrounding zzso zzso The zzso formed short spore chains with spores showing diverse zzso The zzso contained zzso acid, zzso zzso and zzso acid in the cell wall, zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the zzso zzso zzso The zzso formed a distinct zzso in the zzso tree of the zzso based on analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences and showed chemical and zzso properties that were different from members of all of the other zzso of this zzso Based on these zzso it is proposed that the novel zzso belong to a new zzso zzso zzso zzso The type species of the zzso is proposed as zzso zzso zzso zzso with strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as the type zzso
