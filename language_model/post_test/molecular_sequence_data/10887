A small heat shock protein zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso showed expression patterns that differ from what is known for members of this gene zzso The zzso of this gene accumulated in seeds during late zzso stages of zzso zzso but not in response to heat shock in zzso zzso The failure to respond to heat shock was independent of the zzso stage after zzso and shock zzso Nuclear zzso analyses demonstrated that zzso from the zzso zzso zzso promoter is not induced by heat zzso This agrees with the presence, in this promoter, of sequences with little similarity to heat shock zzso Our results show an evolutionary zzso in the regulation of plant zzso zzso which has originated zzso genes and zzso members within this gene zzso We discuss implications for mechanisms controlling the zzso regulation of zzso genes in zzso
