zzso comparisons and functional analysis of the zzso upstream regions of zzso genes have revealed the importance of zzso elements acting to control the zzso expression of zzso in the zzso and retinal pigmented zzso of developing zzso To date there are no reports addressing the control of zzso gene zzso in zzso a zzso model zzso of increasing zzso To exploit the zzso gene as a marker in zzso we set out to clone its promoter and zzso its regulation during zzso zzso of a zzso zzso complementary DNA zzso by reverse zzso zzso chain reaction allowed us to isolate and sequence a zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso that includes a zzso initiation site and 73 zzso of the open reading zzso zzso analysis of this zzso sequence revealed five zzso zzso including one zzso type zzso present in a putative initiation zzso These are zzso positive regulatory elements in zzso zzso zzso We show that a region of zzso zzso upstream from the translation start site of the zzso zzso gene can drive expression in retinal pigmented zzso in zzso transgenic zzso zzso but that its activity is not restricted to zzso zzso This region is unable to drive zzso in human melanoma cell zzso zzso expression from this zzso zzso promoter zzso is probably due to the absence of positive and negative zzso zzso such as a zzso zzso element, which is known to function as a zzso zzso zzso
