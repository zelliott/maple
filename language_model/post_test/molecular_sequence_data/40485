zzso is the zzso zzso of the orphan zzso domain zzso G zzso zzso zzso zzso is involved in the regulation of body fluid zzso and cardiovascular zzso We previously showed the importance of the zzso zzso of zzso 17 zzso in the zzso activity of this zzso Here, we show either by deleting the zzso zzso zzso or by substituting it by an Ala zzso that it plays a crucial role in zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso binding or in zzso zzso Then we built a zzso three-dimensional model of the human zzso zzso using the zzso zzso model as a template, and we subsequently zzso zzso into the binding zzso We zzso a zzso cavity at the bottom of the binding pocket in which the zzso zzso of zzso was embedded by zzso in zzso and zzso and zzso in zzso Using molecular modeling and zzso zzso studies, we further showed that zzso and zzso are key zzso in triggering zzso zzso without playing a role in zzso binding or in zzso zzso These findings bring new insights into zzso zzso zzso and show that zzso and zzso by interacting with the zzso zzso of the zzso form of zzso 13 zzso or zzso are crucial for zzso zzso zzso
