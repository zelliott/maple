zzso zzso DNA zzso that target an internal region of the gene zzso zzso the large zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were developed for two groups of marine zzso zzso and zzso The specificity and utility of the zzso were evaluated in the laboratory and also during a zzso zzso experiment in which we investigated the zzso zzso in zzso gene expression and primary production in response to zzso zzso zzso We found that the onset of successive bloom events dominated by each of the two classes of zzso algae was associated with marked zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso of zzso gene expression can provide an early indicator of the development of zzso zzso and may also be useful in predicting which zzso are likely to dominate a zzso
