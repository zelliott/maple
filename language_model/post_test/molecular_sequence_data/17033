The human zzso is particularly rich in zzso repeats zzso or zzso zzso zzso and this characteristic likely zzso us from lower zzso such as zzso How and why the complex human zzso architecture consisting of multiple zzso has evolved remains an open zzso Using molecular and zzso analyses of human and zzso zzso regions, we analyzed the structure and evolution of zzso that resulted in complex architectural features of the human zzso in zzso zzso We found that multiple zzso of different origins are situated adjacent to one another, whereas each zzso changed at different time points between zzso to zzso million years ago zzso during zzso zzso zzso studies in primates suggested communication between the zzso by gene zzso The DNA zzso element zzso and zzso zzso elements were identified at the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso gorilla, suggesting a potential role for zzso in evolution of the zzso zzso Thus, a series of consecutive zzso zzso events during zzso evolution resulted in complex zzso architecture in zzso zzso Some of the more recent events led to the formation of novel genes that in human are expressed primarily in the zzso Our observations support the contention that serial zzso zzso events might have orchestrated zzso evolution by the generation of novel zzso genes as well as potentially by zzso zzso associated with decreased zzso rates zzso gene zzso
