Analysis of zzso clones coding for human and zzso transforming growth zzso 2 zzso 2) revealed the existence of two types of zzso 2 precursor proteins of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of the precursor region that replaces an zzso zzso located at position 116 in zzso zzso Of these 29 zzso zzso three are zzso suggesting a more extensive zzso zzso secondary structure for zzso zzso than for zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis using zzso specific for the insert in zzso zzso indicated that this protein is zzso by a minor zzso zzso species present in human and zzso zzso Since the DNA sequences zzso the insert are identical between clones coding for the two precursor zzso we suggest zzso coding for these proteins arise via differential zzso Evidence is also presented that indicates that additional zzso 2 zzso zzso is due to alternate zzso We propose that the zzso precursor be referred to as zzso zzso and the zzso precursor be referred to as zzso zzso
