zzso of the five zzso zzso zzso 2 beta gamma zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso into a functional structural model is zzso The principles used to arrange the sequences into a structure include: zzso zzso crossing segments zzso zzso zzso segments zzso channel with single group zzso zzso molecular shape zzso zzso zzso dimensions of zzso portion zzso choice of zzso binding zzso folding of zzso segments zzso location of zzso zzso (near zzso binding zzso zzso of zzso arrangement zzso genetic zzso of functional group choices zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso model is divided into three parts zzso zzso 11 zzso zzso from each zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso and 1 zzso zzso from each zzso and zzso zzso one zzso loop from each zzso The zzso strands can form a closed zzso (the zzso zzso which is opened zzso by zzso bound perpendicular to the zzso zzso of the zzso to a zzso position and partial closing of the zzso leads to a zzso zzso The actions of zzso and zzso and zzso zzso are clarified by the zzso The opening and closing of the zzso zzso controls access to the zzso channel which is composed of the 5 zzso zzso zzso A molecular mechanism for zzso flow in the channel is zzso The unusual zzso of zzso zzso in zzso beta and zzso but not in zzso near the binding site for zzso zzso zzso is zzso The dynamic behavior of the zzso channel and many experimental results can be interpreted in terms of the zzso
