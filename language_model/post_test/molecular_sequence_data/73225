A general zzso is presented for identifying sets of positions in multiple sequence alignments that best characterize an a zzso zzso such as those determined by zzso studies or other experimental zzso The zzso explores combinations of zzso columns in the alignment and evaluates how well these sites reflect the original input zzso zzso across the zzso columns are derived using a tree building procedure with conventional zzso acid substitution zzso zzso of those zzso acids which govern the zzso zzso of a protein with a given zzso or inhibitor can provide insights towards an understanding of the zzso zzso of the zzso Since it is likely that such positions will be zzso clustered in the protein fold, these positions may give rise to useful distance constraints for zzso model protein zzso The method is exemplified using data for a set of human zzso class zzso zzso A novel aspect for predicting the zzso of new zzso sequences is also zzso
