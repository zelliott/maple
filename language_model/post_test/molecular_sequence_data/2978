zzso zzso zzso is a powerful zzso zzso capable of degrading most protein components of the zzso zzso We zzso that this zzso may play a significant role in lung cancer development and tested our hypothesis in a study of 348 primary lung cancer cases and 299 zzso Analysis of the entire gene using zzso high performance liquid zzso identified two novel single zzso zzso zzso in the promoter zzso zzso T or G zzso and zzso G or A zzso zzso zzso of these two zzso were compared between the cases and controls using zzso zzso The estimated relative risk in association with the zzso at zzso or the zzso at zzso was measured by odds zzso zzso with zzso or zzso zzso had a zzso and zzso times higher risk of developing lung cancer than those with zzso or zzso zzso zzso The relative risk for the combined effects of both high-risk zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso type, was zzso zzso association of the two markers with cancer risk was examined by zzso activity of the promoter containing different zzso We demonstrated a zzso relative zzso activity in the promoter construct with zzso zzso compared with the zzso zzso in zzso human zzso cell lung cancer cells, providing evidence that the zzso type zzso with a high zzso zzso In conclusion, our findings support an zzso role of zzso in lung cancer zzso
