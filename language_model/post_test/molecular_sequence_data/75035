We have isolated from a constructed zzso zzso expression library two classes of zzso clones zzso the entire sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso zzso of a full-length zzso I zzso in zzso coli resulted in the synthesis of zzso active zzso zzso I that is zzso indistinguishable from the native zzso zzso Another zzso I zzso with a truncated zzso sequence is also active in zzso zzso Our zzso III zzso sequence differs from the version reported by Moore et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso O'Connell, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in eight reading frame shifts which result in partial zzso acid sequence conservation with the rat zzso zzso zzso The zzso I and zzso III sequences share approximately zzso zzso acid sequence zzso Both the zzso I and the zzso III zzso contain different repeating motifs in front of the initiation zzso zzso Multiple zzso addition sites have been identified for these two classes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso results suggest that both zzso I and zzso III are present in single or low copies in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
