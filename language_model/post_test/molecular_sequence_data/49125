zzso colonizing fine roots of containerized zzso zzso zzso were assessed in four large conifer zzso in northern zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso transcribed zzso and a portion of the zzso end of the large zzso zzso from random samples of fine zzso roots gave between 1 and 4 zzso per zzso zzso were either separated by zzso and zzso directly, or cloned and zzso The resulting sequences were compared to sequences obtained from cultures established from zzso roots and from zzso by maximum zzso zzso ITS sequences formed 11 distinct zzso each including at least one reference zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were dominant, whereas zzso were less zzso zzso with sequences similar to members of the zzso which form zzso zzso were also zzso zzso analysis revealed strong positive and negative associations among zzso zzso as well as an influence of applied fertilizer level on zzso diversity and species zzso
