Fish and zzso zzso are zzso after their synthesis during zzso cell zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso and protein zzso C zzso both requiring basic zzso acids at their recognition sites, have previously been found to zzso fish zzso in zzso In this study, these zzso were used to zzso zzso and bull zzso zzso in zzso A zzso difference was found, since zzso was able to zzso both zzso while zzso zzso only zzso zzso zzso the only zzso zzso in zzso zzso and most probably the zzso zzso in bull zzso are the sites for zzso zzso in addition to an internally located zzso present only in zzso zzso This zzso zzso was zzso in zzso by both zzso zzso zzso by zzso was found to be almost independent of zzso and was inhibited only by a tenfold concentration of zzso when compared to zzso of a model zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso caused a twofold stimulation in zzso of zzso zzso by zzso indicating that specific zzso of zzso may have a role in zzso zzso zzso We suggest that zzso is a good universal candidate for in zzso zzso of zzso
