The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have different assembly behavior when expressed in zzso expression zzso zzso zzso require other zzso to assemble functional zzso whereas zzso zzso can produce zzso zzso A previous analysis of zzso zzso zzso identified a domain zzso the first putative zzso segment, zzso as essential to zzso zzso The present study dissected further this domain, identifying three zzso acid zzso which are located at the most zzso third of the zzso zzso segment, as important in the assembly of zzso Moreover, formation of zzso complexes seems to require a compatible accommodation between this region and certain zzso of the second zzso segment, zzso Thus, zzso between defined zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso segments appears as a zzso factor governing zzso association of zzso zzso
