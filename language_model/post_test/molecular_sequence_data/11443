zzso DNA was isolated, zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was isolated by a zzso zzso chain reaction based zzso The zzso used were designed on the basis of zzso zzso regions found in zzso zzso The complete zzso sequence was zzso The primary structure and zzso of the zzso were zzso zzso has zzso zzso acids and a predicted molecular mass of 113 zzso This protein is zzso identical and zzso related to several zzso zzso zzso but lacks the zzso domain that exists in the zzso zzso 1 and zzso The membrane zzso predicted for zzso is characteristic of the zzso zzso showing two major zzso zzso and ten zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that are important for the function of the zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso sites, the putative zzso zzso binding site, the zzso binding site and the zzso zzso site, are zzso in zzso suggesting that the cloned gene is a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, three zzso products were cloned which share zzso with another zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso and with the alpha zzso of a zzso
