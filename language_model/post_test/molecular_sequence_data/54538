While there have been more and more studies concerning zzso protein zzso zzso signaling zzso which control many cellular complex zzso such as cell zzso zzso cell death and zzso However, few studies are carried out about expression and zzso of classical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in human zzso cancer cell zzso zzso in the present study, we investigated the expression and zzso of zzso in human zzso cancer cell line zzso and human normal zzso zzso cell line zzso which is as zzso This study showed that zzso was zzso zzso both in zzso and zzso the zzso of which were slightly zzso To further study the zzso signaling zzso in zzso and zzso cell line, zzso a kind of specific inhibitor of zzso was zzso This study showed that zzso can block the zzso of zzso in a short time, the complete zzso concentration for zzso and zzso cell line is 50 and 20 zzso zzso zzso to further investigate the different roles of zzso and zzso zzso short hairpin interference zzso targeted on zzso was zzso Moreover, the effective interference target sequence was screened out in a transient zzso zzso zzso experiment showed that zzso is more important than zzso in the proliferation of zzso zzso
