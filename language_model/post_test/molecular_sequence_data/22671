zzso zzso zzso the transformation of zzso into zzso thus playing an important role in zzso and zzso zzso So far, mouse zzso and gene zzso zzso has not been zzso In this report, we describe the isolation of a mouse zzso zzso and the characterization of its zzso specificity and tissue zzso zzso analysis indicates that zzso shares zzso zzso acid identity with rat zzso zzso zzso zzso with this zzso catalyze the transformation of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression levels of this zzso was determined in male and female mouse zzso zzso using quantitative zzso zzso We show that this zzso is mainly expressed in zzso zzso while being almost absent from zzso zzso In the liver, the same expression level is seen in both male and female, while there is zzso higher expression level in female zzso than in zzso These results strongly suggest that zzso could play an important role in the female mouse physiology similar to that of type 1 zzso with which it works in zzso This role could be related to the zzso of excess of zzso and zzso that are more severely regulated than in zzso
