zzso is an economically important zzso as a number of species belonging to this zzso are human and animal zzso The zzso has been divided into different groups based on zzso zzso gene sequence zzso The zzso observed among the members of these groups is low and it is difficult to distinguish zzso The present study was taken up to explore zzso zzso gene sequence to develop methods that can be used for preliminary identification and can supplement the existing methods for identification of zzso zzso of the zzso zzso 

zzso zzso gene sequences belonging to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were analyzed with the purpose to define genetic zzso within each species to generate a zzso zzso to identify zzso signatures and zzso restriction zzso zzso 

The framework based analysis was used to segregate zzso zzso previously identified zzso zzso zzso This segregation was validated using zzso signatures and zzso restriction zzso zzso 43 zzso zzso zzso could be identified using this zzso 

The markers generated exploring zzso zzso gene sequences provided useful tool that can be further used for identification of different species of the zzso zzso
