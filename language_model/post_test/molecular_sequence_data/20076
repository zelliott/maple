The seed oil of zzso zzso contains significant amounts of zzso acid zzso zzso an unusual zzso fatty acid with pharmaceutical potential similar to zzso zzso Two candidate zzso zzso and zzso for the zzso zzso from developing seeds of zzso zzso were functionally characterized in transgenic zzso zzso zzso zzso The open reading frames of both zzso showed some similarity to zzso zzso A zzso zzso found in animals and zzso When expressed in transgenic zzso zzso showed a broad range of zzso zzso utilizing both saturated zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso did not show any activity in zzso zzso zzso of zzso or zzso with a zzso zzso in transgenic zzso plants resulted in the production of zzso and zzso fatty acid zzso Thus, zzso acted only on zzso zzso fatty acids in a manner analogous to zzso zzso However, neither zzso nor zzso contain the zzso zzso domain normally present in this class of zzso zzso profiling of transgenic zzso plants and developing zzso zzso seeds revealed significant zzso of zzso fatty acids as zzso compared to the zzso of these fatty acids in total zzso zzso analysis of zzso of zzso zzso seeds showed that zzso fatty acids were present in both zzso and zzso + zzso positions, although the majority of zzso zzso and zzso was present at the zzso zzso Our data provide zzso evidence for the zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso
