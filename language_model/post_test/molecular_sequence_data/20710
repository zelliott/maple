zzso is often found as a zzso at sites zzso with organic zzso For zzso zzso zzso may be not only directly toxic but may also specifically interfere with N zzso In soil zzso amended with organic electron donors, zzso and zzso bacteria oxidized added zzso but relatively low doses of zzso caused a lag and then lower rates of zzso zzso zzso strongly inhibited nitrate zzso it occurred only after soluble zzso could not be zzso However, zzso additions did not eliminate zzso zzso after a second dose of zzso bacterial activity was strongly zzso zzso in microbial community composition zzso by zzso zzso gel zzso driven by different organic zzso zzso and zzso were smaller than when other electron zzso had been zzso However, the selection of bacterial zzso was modified by zzso Nine isolated zzso of zzso zzso zzso bacteria were closely related to cultivated members of the zzso zzso or zzso In zzso zzso zzso the nature of the electron donor zzso or zzso affected zzso resistance level and zzso nitrate zzso Our results indicate that carbon zzso and nitrate reduction in these zzso were contingent upon the reduction of added zzso The amount of zzso required to inhibit nitrate reduction was zzso less than for zzso zzso of the same organic zzso We speculate that the resistance level of a microbial process is directly related to the diversity of microbes capable of conducting zzso
