The function of the gene zzso human zzso zzso zzso type 1, the zzso zzso is regulated by a zzso zzso at position zzso to zzso The adjacent zzso zzso whose function is not known, contains an analogous region in its zzso zzso The identity between the zzso zzso and the zzso equivalent is as high as zzso zzso they differ by only five zzso zzso from reporter gene analyses showed that the zzso zzso a zzso has only zzso the activity of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the results indicate that the reduced function of the zzso is a consequence of the presence of G and A at positions zzso and zzso whereas the zzso zzso contains zzso and zzso In addition, three protected areas were localized to regions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso I zzso analysis of the zzso zzso Replacement of the zzso regions with a nonsense sequence demonstrated that the zzso region is the most critical for zzso zzso zzso of zzso or a short zzso region within it led to almost complete zzso of zzso zzso We have identified several zzso that are essential for appropriate function of the zzso zzso The results also show that the zzso and zzso genes operate differently despite the high zzso between zzso
