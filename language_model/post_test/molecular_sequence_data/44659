To establish a system for zzso of zzso protein which is a component of zzso II zzso complex, a zzso designated as zzso was constructed and expressed in zzso coli zzso A fusion protein of zzso and zzso proteins zzso zzso on zzso was accumulated in zzso coli cells to a level of zzso of the total protein upon zzso zzso zzso The zzso part of zzso zzso was zzso from the fusion protein and zzso by an zzso exchange column zzso in the presence of zzso This zzso zzso protein was identified as zzso by zzso zzso acid sequence analysis and the zzso behavior on an zzso exchange zzso A few types of zzso zzso were also prepared by the essentially same procedure except for using plasmids which contain given zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso depleted zzso reaction center core complex consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso zzso together with the zzso or zzso zzso produced in zzso coli or isolated zzso from zzso zzso difference between the zzso zzso proteins from zzso coli and spinach was not recognized in the effectiveness to recover the zzso electron transfer activity in the resulting zzso The analysis of zzso of zzso per reaction center in the zzso zzso zzso II revealed that two molecules of zzso were zzso into a reaction center independent of the presence or absence of zzso These results suggest that zzso recovers the electron transfer activity in the zzso zzso by a mechanism different from the stabilization of zzso in the zzso site of zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso for recovering the zzso supported electron transfer activity in the zzso zzso reaction center zzso The results obtained with the zzso zzso proteins revealed that the zzso terminal part rather than zzso terminal part of zzso is crucial for recovering the electron transfer activity in the zzso zzso
