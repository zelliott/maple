zzso zzso binding protein zzso is a zzso zzso protein that binds both zzso acids and fatty zzso We have determined the solution structure of zzso zzso in complex with zzso by zzso and zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso complex was determined by restrained energy zzso and simulated zzso calculations after zzso the zzso zzso into the protein zzso The overall zzso structure of zzso is highly analogous to the three-dimensional structures of several other zzso zzso binding proteins zzso Like the zzso the zzso complex of zzso is composed of 10 zzso zzso that form a zzso zzso structure, and two short zzso Chemical shift data indicated that the zzso acid zzso is bound inside the protein zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments showed zzso contacts between several aromatic zzso located in the proposed zzso acid portal region and the zzso zzso A single zzso acid zzso is bound inside the zzso with the steroid zzso penetrating deep into the zzso internal zzso such that ring A is located right above the plane of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso tail of the zzso is protruding from the proposed zzso acid portal into the surrounding zzso zzso The body of the steroid zzso is oriented with the zzso face in contact with the mostly zzso zzso of zzso C, D and zzso while the polar face shows contacts with the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso I and zzso Thus, the zzso arrangement of the zzso complex suggests that the binding affinity of zzso for zzso acid molecules is based mainly on strong zzso interactions inside the protein zzso Furthermore, this binding mode explains how zzso can transport zzso and zzso zzso zzso
