The zzso content of the zzso of zzso zzso rice zzso is zzso zzso which was half of its origin zzso rice zzso zzso The whole sequence of zzso gene of zzso was amplified and zzso A base was absent on the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso which resulted in zzso zzso and terminating zzso occurred ahead in the 9 zzso The zzso of zzso also led to the change of some zzso in the 9 zzso and terminating zzso occurred zzso The change of zzso also led to changes of the sites of common restriction zzso The results showed that zzso added two zzso sites compared to zzso and zzso zzso Compared to zzso rice, zzso six zzso sites, and added 4 zzso a zzso and a Sal restriction zzso zzso analysis showed that the DNA sequence of zzso gene of zzso was closer to zzso zzso We supposed that the zzso gene of zzso originated from zzso of zzso According to the differences of zzso in zzso we deduced the absent base led to zzso zzso obstacle, which was the main cause of low zzso content and it might be related to the soft rice zzso Based on analysis of zzso of zzso zzso and zzso and according to the special sites of the three species, zzso as zzso were designed to distinguish zzso from other zzso Combining with primer pair zzso dominant and zzso ways were established for discriminating them, and rapid and correct identification of zzso from other rice could be zzso
