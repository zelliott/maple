The zzso zzso zzso zzso was located on the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its surrounding regions was zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso contains two divergent zzso units of zzso and zzso zzso the expression of which is considerably higher in cells grown on zzso than in cells grown on zzso This was confirmed by primer extension studies which demonstrated that zzso is initiated at two zzso promoters with a back-to-back zzso The zzso zzso unit includes the zzso gene which most probably encodes the zzso zzso II of the zzso system, and may contain the gene zzso zzso The zzso zzso unit includes genes zzso and zzso The protein zzso by the zzso gene is likely to be involved in the regulation of the zzso zzso zzso since its deduced N zzso is zzso to zzso zzso zzso found in several regulatory zzso
