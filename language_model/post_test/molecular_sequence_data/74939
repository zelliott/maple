zzso from the zzso zzso zzso promoter is induced as cells enter stationary phase under conditions in which the zzso of the zzso acid cycle are zzso This zzso requires the presence of a secondary form of zzso zzso E zzso B, that is found in zzso growing cells and in zzso zzso Starting with a defective zzso promoter that had either a base substitution at position zzso or a base substitution at position zzso we were able to identify four independent zzso zzso within these zzso promoters that suppressed the effect of the original zzso and thereby restored function to the zzso zzso Three of these zzso promoters had an additional base zzso at positions zzso zzso or both -5 and -9 that enhanced their zzso in zzso by E zzso B, whereas one of the promoters had a zzso deletion in the zzso region that placed it under a completely different form of regulation than that of the zzso zzso zzso In addition to zzso in the zzso promoter region, we also isolated three classes of zzso that exhibited increased zzso zzso The effects of the zzso in these strains were not zzso specific, since they increased expression from both zzso and zzso zzso zzso One class of zzso which affected expression from the zzso promoter carried zzso that blocked the activity of the zzso acid zzso A second class of zzso mapped near zzso and was unable to zzso zzso transformation crosses and zzso analysis indicated that one of these zzso was an zzso of zzso The third class of zzso is closely linked to zzso and may define a regulatory gene for zzso the zzso B structural zzso
