In the zzso of acute zzso leukemia zzso the zzso on zzso 21 zzso the zzso zzso generally in the zzso between zzso 5 and zzso To isolate fusion transcripts of zzso and an as yet unidentified gene on zzso 8 involved in the zzso we used rapid amplification of zzso ends zzso and zzso for zzso zzso 5 and zzso A fusion transcript was identified by 3' zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso cells that also express multiple normal zzso zzso This result clearly indicates that at least one zzso active zzso gene is generated by the zzso zzso This gene on the zzso zzso represents the fusion between the zzso portion of the zzso gene with the 3' portion of a zzso 8 gene that contains a region of sequence zzso with the zzso zzso zzso here referred to as the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene is probably responsible for the zzso of the zzso zzso This finding makes it possible to detect the zzso at the molecular level, thus improving the diagnosis and monitoring of the disease in zzso zzso
