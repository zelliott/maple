zzso is a common skin disease characterized by zzso zzso zzso growth and zzso of zzso The zzso of psoriasis is unknown, although several genetic and cellular factors have been zzso To find new zzso zzso we have cloned zzso that are zzso expressed between normal and zzso zzso Among these zzso we have identified a new gene that codes for a new member of the type IV zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We refer to this gene as zzso It encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids that has significant zzso with known zzso proteins in the C2 and zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped to the zzso zzso zzso near to the locus of the zzso zzso from which it is separated by a physical distance of about 220 zzso To identify the zzso zzso activity of zzso we zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso The cell zzso from these cells had zzso zzso zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that a zzso transcript of about 4 zzso is expressed in zzso zzso zzso such as those in skin and zzso but not in other zzso In zzso zzso and zzso revealed that zzso is expressed strongly in the upper zzso layer of the zzso zzso expressed zzso and zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and not detected in the zzso of normal zzso zzso is not detected in either normal or zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso exhibits a unique distribution pattern compared with that of known zzso zzso and it may play a critical role in inflammation in zzso zzso
