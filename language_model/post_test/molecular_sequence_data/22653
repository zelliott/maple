The expression of zzso biologically active mouse zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso domain of mouse collagen alpha 3 Type IV was achieved for the first time in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso insect zzso using a zzso expression zzso Following zzso the proteins were identified by reducing and zzso zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso has a molecular weight of approximately 90 zzso and mouse zzso approximately 32 zzso In addition, zzso quantities of native mouse zzso were zzso from zzso zzso Both native and zzso zzso were biologically zzso This study also demonstrated that the zzso of zzso deficient zzso mice with zzso zzso mouse zzso induced a significant zzso response to native zzso
