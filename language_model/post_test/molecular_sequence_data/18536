The zzso zzso of zzso is composed of only three zzso zzso zzso and zzso Together, they generate an autonomous zzso zzso rhythm of zzso of zzso zzso stimulates zzso zzso by binding to the so-called zzso of zzso whereas zzso sequesters zzso in a zzso complex far away from the zzso thereby inducing zzso zzso The switch from zzso zzso to zzso is initiated by the formation of the zzso complex, which occurs upon zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso We show here that formation of the zzso complex is promoted by zzso suggesting zzso in the initiation of the zzso zzso In the zzso interaction, one zzso zzso of zzso likely binds to one face of a zzso zzso leaving the other face zzso We also show that the zzso of zzso exist in a dynamic equilibrium between zzso exposed and zzso buried zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of zzso shift the zzso toward the buried position, thereby weakening the zzso interaction, which is expected to be an additional mechanism promoting formation of the zzso zzso We also show that zzso and the zzso protein zzso compete for overlapping binding sites, which include the zzso on the zzso ring of zzso zzso strongly shifts the competition in zzso zzso Thus, in addition to stimulating zzso zzso it is likely that zzso plays roles in switching zzso from zzso to zzso as well as regulating clock zzso
