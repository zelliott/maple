The human zzso zzso a zzso of the zzso coli zzso gene zzso encodes zzso that degrades a zzso zzso for DNA zzso To determine whether this gene is associated with zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso we examined the zzso sequence in 32 zzso cases by means of zzso chain zzso strand zzso zzso and sequencing zzso Three different DNA zzso were identified in normal and the corresponding tumor zzso The first zzso a G to A transition at zzso 83, changes zzso to zzso and was detected in 9 zzso zzso The same change was detected in 5 of 30 unrelated healthy individuals, suggesting that it is not associated with a marked zzso zzso The second zzso is a silent C to T transition at zzso zzso Another C to T transition at 31 zzso upstream of the beginning of zzso 4 was also zzso However, specific zzso in zzso were detected in neither normal nor tumor cells from zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso is not directly involved in zzso
