The analysis of zzso zzso in cultured human zzso is, in principle, able to detect exposure to zzso and zzso zzso There is, however, no clear evidence from human zzso studies or animal experiments showing that in zzso exposure of resting zzso to an zzso could actually be expressed as MN in cultured zzso In zzso a pulse treatment of human zzso with zzso an zzso did result in MN induction even if performed before zzso zzso although a much more pronounced effect was obtained in actively dividing zzso zzso On the other hand, it is probable that a considerable portion of zzso MN contain whole zzso their contribution increasing with zzso It also seems that zzso B, used for the identification of second cell cycle zzso cells in the MN zzso is able to slightly increase the level of MN with whole zzso If MN harboring zzso fragments represent a minority of the total MN frequency, there may be difficulties in detecting a weak effect in this fraction of MN against the background of MN with whole zzso This would reduce the sensitivity of the zzso in detecting zzso unless MN with whole zzso and zzso fragments are distinguished from each zzso That a problem may exist in sensitivity is suggested by the difficulty in demonstrating MN induction by smoking, an exposure capable of inducing zzso zzso The sensitivity of the zzso MN zzso could be increased by detecting zzso or zzso in zzso or by automation, allowing more cells to be zzso
