zzso zzso zzso which zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso was zzso and characterized from zzso zzso zzso The molecular weight of zzso zzso was estimated as 60 zzso consisting of a 28 zzso zzso as shown by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso studies showed that the zzso constant for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso The reverse reaction zzso to zzso activity of the zzso was detected even though it was quite zzso The zzso zzso gene zzso was cloned by zzso using the zzso DNA zzso designed on the basis of the determined zzso zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso The determined DNA sequence of the zzso gene contains an open reading frame which encodes a zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene product shows no significant zzso to any zzso acid sequences in the protein data zzso
