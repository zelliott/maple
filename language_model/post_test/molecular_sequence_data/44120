The zzso of zzso zzso ubiquitous products of zzso zzso was assessed using an in zzso zzso forward zzso zzso zzso zzso plasmids were incubated with a range of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and then zzso into competent, zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso produced a zzso decrease in zzso survival, with a 500 zzso concentration of the zzso zzso reducing the zzso efficiency by more than zzso while inducing a corresponding zzso increase in zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was completely prevented by the zzso radical scavenger zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis of the zzso alpha gene of 100 zzso zzso zzso revealed that the most frequent sequence changes were base pair zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment prior to zzso diminished the zzso of damaged plasmids to a level resembling that of unmodified zzso While zzso sites might account for the sensitivity to alkaline zzso the possibility that unidentified zzso zzso zzso also contribute to zzso radical zzso cannot be zzso zzso these findings raise the possibility that DNA damage caused by a major class of zzso zzso contributes to one of the most common spontaneous zzso events, the zzso zzso
