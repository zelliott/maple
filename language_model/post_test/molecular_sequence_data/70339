We have investigated the zzso of two types of zzso sequences found in human zzso DNA in equivalent positions in zzso gorilla, orangutan, zzso and zzso monkey zzso These sequences are one zzso derived from the zzso zzso gene and seven complete zzso zzso The zzso zzso is present in the apes but not in Old World zzso indicating fixation in an zzso zzso Five of the zzso elements are shared by the whole set of primates zzso indicating zzso and fixation prior to the split of the zzso and Old World monkey zzso One is absent only from the zzso monkey zzso and another is absent from both zzso and zzso zzso indicating fixation at different times in zzso evolutionary zzso Since branching times for the zzso zzso tree are known from a combination of the fossil record and multiple molecular data sets, it is possible to compare zzso fixation times determined from the zzso information with those calculated from zzso element zzso zzso
