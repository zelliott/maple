By sequencing random clones from the zzso zzso zzso library of the zzso zzso zzso a transcript, named zzso zzso a zzso zzso was zzso The zzso acid sequence of the putative mature zzso of zzso is zzso except for seven different zzso with that of zzso a zzso found in the zzso of zzso zzso The mature peptides of zzso and zzso are the zzso of zzso with two or three zzso acid zzso truncated at the zzso The zzso zzso and zzso were expressed successfully by the zzso expression system and zzso by using a combination of zzso and reverse phase high performance liquid zzso zzso The molecular masses of the two expressed peptides were identified by mass zzso indicating that the zzso of the two peptides were not zzso The two peptides can zzso human zzso at minimal zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso modeling of zzso has given a clue to the low zzso zzso of these zzso zzso These zzso zzso due to the small molecular sizes, may have the advantage to investigate the binding mechanism of the zzso and have the potential to be the carrier for drug zzso
