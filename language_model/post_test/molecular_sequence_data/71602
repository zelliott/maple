In this study, we report that zzso zzso I zzso can zzso the open circular DNA of duck zzso B virus zzso Using synthetic zzso mimicking the zzso zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso the DNA plus strand in a suicidal manner, which mimics the zzso of the zzso zzso We also report that zzso can cleave the DNA minus strand at specific sites and can zzso the minus strand via a zzso zzso zzso These results are consistent with the possibility that zzso can act as a DNA zzso and strand zzso and play a role in the zzso zzso and possibly integration of viral replication zzso
