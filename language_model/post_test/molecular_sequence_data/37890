zzso between zzso zzso infection and zzso has been confirmed in several studies, but the precise role of this zzso in the disease process is not zzso We investigated the relation and zzso of T zzso of human carotid plaques to C zzso zzso zzso specimens were obtained from 17 patients who underwent carotid zzso zzso zzso and/or in zzso zzso revealed the presence of C zzso in 11 zzso of the 17 of the zzso zzso zzso seen in the vessel walls consisted primarily of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso range 50% to zzso whereas zzso B cells and zzso were in minor zzso In zzso activated T zzso were zzso from the specimens with zzso and the zzso specificity of the established zzso lines zzso was analyzed against C zzso elementary body zzso zzso were established from all 17 carotid zzso but none from the control specimens of ascending zzso C zzso was recognized as a specific zzso zzso in 7 zzso of 17 zzso Further analyses of the C zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso zzso protein induced specific proliferation in 5 zzso of 7 cases and revealed 2 zzso zzso and zzso binding motifs in human zzso zzso zzso C zzso was identified as a specific microbial zzso recognized by zzso of zzso zzso from in zzso activated plaque T zzso Our results suggests that zzso immunity to C zzso plays a role in the zzso process and that this response may involve zzso
