B cell chronic zzso leukemia zzso is the most common leukemia in western societies, and is currently zzso B cells of some zzso patients are resistant to the zzso effects of transforming growth zzso zzso zzso we identified two zzso within the putative signal sequence of zzso type I zzso zzso gene of zzso zzso patients zzso a zzso substitution together with an zzso single Ala zzso Although zzso zzso were expressed to the cell surface and zzso normally with zzso zzso their expression significantly reduced gene zzso zzso by zzso suggesting a zzso relationship in the development of zzso zzso zzso of additional zzso patients solely for the presence of zzso signal sequence zzso showed that these zzso correlated with and predicted for zzso patient zzso to zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso is linked to signal sequence zzso within the zzso zzso and may eventually be employed as a zzso indicator in zzso
