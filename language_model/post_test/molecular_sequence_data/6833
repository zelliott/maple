A molecular zzso approach to zzso mapping is proposed, based on the method of Rizzi zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1990, 33, zzso In zzso method, the interaction energy between a series of drug molecules and probe atoms (which mimic functional groups on the zzso such as hydrogen bond zzso was zzso These interactions were calculated on a three-dimensional grid within a molecular mechanics zzso were placed at these zzso The distances between the dummy atom sites were monitored during molecular dynamics simulations and plotted as distance distribution zzso Important distances within the zzso became apparent, as drugs with a common mode of binding share similar zzso in the distance distribution zzso In the case of specific zzso zzso the important zzso distance within the zzso has a range of zzso zzso zzso In the case of specific beta zzso zzso the important zzso distances within the zzso lie between zzso zzso A and between 8 and 10 zzso These distances distribution functions were used to assess three different models of the beta zzso zzso zzso The comparison of the distance distribution functions for the simulation with the actual zzso distances in the zzso models suggested that two of the three zzso models were much more consistent with the zzso zzso These zzso studies gave support for the use of zzso rather than the zzso template, for modeling zzso receptors but also sounded a warning that agreement with binding data from zzso zzso experiments does not necessarily validate a zzso zzso
