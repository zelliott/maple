Despite increasing identification of concurrent gastric and zzso zzso of zzso zzso tissue zzso the zzso relationship between the two tumors and their sequential development are poorly zzso It is also unknown whether the development of these concurrent tumors is closely associated with direct zzso zzso which is thought to play an important role in the zzso expansion of zzso zzso zzso To investigate these, we have studied six cases of concurrent gastric and zzso zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction zzso amplification, zzso and sequencing of the rearranged zzso zzso a strategy that has been widely used for analysis of zzso and zzso properties of zzso zzso In each case, an identical or nearly identical zzso determining region zzso 3 sequence was observed between the dominant clones of concurrent gastric and zzso zzso zzso In four of six cases zzso sufficient zzso variable region sequence information was obtained to permit analysis of zzso zzso The zzso patterns in one case suggest that the zzso zzso is secondary to the gastric zzso and the zzso patterns in two cases indicate that the gastric and zzso zzso are derived from different zzso zzso which emerge after expansion of a common early tumor zzso Furthermore, three of four cases showed ongoing zzso zzso among different zzso clones at each zzso These results show that concurrent gastric and zzso zzso zzso are derived from the same clone and suggest that the zzso zzso result from dissemination of gastric zzso zzso stimulation may play a role in tumor evolution, particularly at an early zzso
