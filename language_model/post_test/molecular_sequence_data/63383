Certain proteins can undergo zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso have recently been identified in a family of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso However, no zzso zzso zzso has yet been zzso Here we identify a zzso in the zzso proteins by using an zzso zzso The zzso reacted with a zzso zzso protein that accumulated in zzso zzso Using tandem mass zzso of zzso samples, zzso by the zzso from the zzso cells, we identified the zzso protein as zzso assembly protein 1 zzso zzso zzso incorporated zzso into zzso zzso in zzso zzso analyses indicated that zzso zzso at zzso and 360 in the zzso part of zzso are putative sites for the zzso Thus, zzso is a zzso for zzso
