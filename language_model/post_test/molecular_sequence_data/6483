We have investigated zzso zzso formed in zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli and zzso zzso at the molecular level using zzso and zzso as zzso zzso We identified zzso acids zzso to zzso for 13 zzso proteins from these organisms, namely derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Several other zzso stretches zzso to zzso have been zzso in which no direct zzso zzso acid could be zzso The zzso zzso acids are positioned within loop zzso carrying zzso binding features such as zzso basic and aromatic zzso One of the zzso peptides in zzso protein zzso shows a common primary sequence zzso zzso zzso involved in interaction with zzso and the zzso zzso acid in zzso protein zzso lies within the zinc zzso motif of this zzso The zzso zzso acids in zzso proteins zzso and zzso prove the proposed zzso interacting site derived from three-dimensional zzso A comparison of our structural data with zzso in zzso proteins that lead to zzso resistance, and with those from zzso zzso experiments, reveals functional implications for zzso proteins that interact with zzso
