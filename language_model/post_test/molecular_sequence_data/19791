zzso zzso are small zzso zzso that inhibit expression of specific target genes at the zzso zzso zzso variations in zzso zzso including zzso zzso and mature zzso could potentially influence the processing and/or target selection of zzso In this study, we have systematically identified single zzso zzso zzso associated with 227 known human zzso Among 323 total zzso that we zzso 12 are located within the zzso precursor and one is at the eighth zzso zzso of the mature zzso which has been proposed to play a critical role in recognition of zzso targets by zzso Through a series of in zzso zzso we unexpectedly find that this zzso zzso significantly blocks the processing of zzso to zzso in addition to reducing zzso zzso zzso Thus, our study reveals an additional structural requirement for zzso processing and emphasizes the importance of identifying new zzso zzso and their contributions to zzso zzso and human genetic zzso
