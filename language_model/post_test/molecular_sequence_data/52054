The primary mechanism of regulation of smooth muscle contraction involves the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso light chain zzso However, additional mechanisms, both zzso and zzso can zzso the zzso state of smooth zzso zzso zzso C was first implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle contraction with the observation that zzso zzso induce slowly developing, sustained zzso zzso zzso C occurs in at least four zzso zzso beta I, beta II, and zzso and four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Only the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been identified in smooth zzso Both classes of zzso have been implicated in the regulation of smooth muscle zzso However, the zzso important protein zzso of protein zzso C have not yet been zzso zzso zzso may be activated by different zzso zzso and individual zzso exhibit some degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C can result in its zzso to the zzso active zzso zzso protein zzso M, which would zzso from the zzso and zzso proteins such as zzso that are zzso to zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso M zzso relaxation of zzso smooth muscle fibers contracted at zzso zzso zzso We suggest that protein zzso C plays two distinct roles in regulating smooth muscle zzso zzso triggering zzso turnover or zzso zzso induce zzso of protein zzso C (probably specific zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso and a slow zzso zzso association of the zzso with the membrane may lead to zzso and release into the zzso of protein zzso M, resulting in zzso zzso and zzso
