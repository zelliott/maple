The zzso zzso is required for the zzso phase transition during the cell cycle and plays a direct role in the zzso of individual origins of replication in zzso zzso Here, we report the identification and characterization of mouse and human zzso whose products are related in sequence to zzso zzso zzso zzso Both zzso zzso proteins contain a putative site for zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso sites, nuclear zzso signals and a zzso zinc zzso zzso zzso of zzso is suppressed in mouse zzso zzso made zzso by serum zzso Upon zzso of the zzso transcript levels increase during progression through zzso zzso as cells enter S zzso zzso interacts physically with zzso and zzso in zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso zzso the human zzso gene was localized to zzso 7 zzso whereas FISH mapped the zzso counterpart to band zzso on zzso zzso The results of zzso mapping indicate that in both mouse and human the gene is present as a single zzso The structural conservation between zzso proteins suggests that these proteins play a key role in the regulation of DNA replication during the cell cycle in all zzso
