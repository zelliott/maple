zzso zzso zzso events are being increasingly exploited to disrupt zzso function, an important objective in zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso that zzso the removal of zzso from precursor zzso has previously been zzso for zzso zzso of cellular zzso In one of these strategies, borne out in bacterial and zzso cell culture, an external guide sequence zzso zzso zzso to a target zzso makes the latter a zzso for zzso zzso P by rendering the zzso target zzso complex a precursor zzso structural zzso In this study, we first obtained evidence that four different zzso and zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso in zzso using their respective constituent zzso and protein zzso recognize and cleave such zzso zzso We further demonstrate that these zzso engage in multiple rounds of zzso recognition while assisting zzso zzso zzso zzso of a target zzso in zzso Taken together, the zzso approach merits consideration as a gene zzso tool in zzso
