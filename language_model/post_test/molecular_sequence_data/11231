The energy landscape theory of protein folding is a statistical description of a zzso potential zzso It assumes that folding occurs through organizing an ensemble of structures rather than through only a few uniquely defined structural zzso It suggests that the most realistic model of a protein is a minimally frustrated zzso with a rugged zzso landscape biased toward the native zzso This statistical description has been developed using tools from the statistical mechanics of zzso systems, zzso and phase transitions of finite zzso We review here its zzso background and contrast the phenomena in zzso random zzso and zzso zzso that are zzso and zzso capable of zzso The connection between these statistical concepts and the results of minimalist models used in computer simulations is zzso The review concludes with a brief discussion of how the theory helps in the interpretation of results from fast folding experiments and in the practical task of protein structure zzso
