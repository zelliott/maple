The sequence of the zzso zzso and mercury resistance region of zzso a large zzso from a clinical isolate of zzso zzso collected in 1997 in Australia, was zzso Most of the zzso found in the resistance zzso zzso or zzso region of zzso (also known as zzso isolated from a zzso zzso strain in Japan in the late 1950s, were present in zzso but in a different zzso The location was also different, with the zzso region flanked by the zzso module of zzso and a mercury resistance module almost identical to one found in the zzso zzso This arrangement is consistent with a three-step zzso First, the zzso was zzso via zzso zzso between the zzso elements and zzso at a new location, possibly in a different zzso via zzso zzso between the zzso zzso or zzso of the zzso zzso in the zzso and the same region of a second class 1 zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso between the zzso sites in the zzso and a second mercury resistance zzso removed one end of the zzso zzso and part of the second zzso Other events occurring within the zzso portion have also contributed to the formation of the zzso resistance zzso zzso or a close relative that includes the zzso gene had moved into the zzso mercury resistance module with subsequent deletion of the adjacent zzso and all four zzso zzso repeats corresponding to zzso family zzso zzso have been interrupted by an zzso zzso
