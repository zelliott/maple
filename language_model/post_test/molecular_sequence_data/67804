zzso zzso isolated from the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is a specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso sodium channels in rat zzso root zzso zzso zzso It adopts an inhibitor zzso knot zzso and structural analysis revealed a positively charged patch consisting of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso distributed on its molecular zzso Our previous study demonstrated that zzso and zzso but not zzso were critical zzso for zzso binding to zzso sodium zzso In the present study, we examined the roles of zzso and zzso in the interaction of zzso with its zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso were generated by zzso chemical synthesis and zzso by zzso zzso after zzso and zzso yielding two compounds of high purity with zzso masses of zzso and zzso respectively, as determined by zzso mass zzso This indicated the presence of six zzso zzso forming three zzso zzso Moreover, circular zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the substitution of zzso or zzso did not affect the overall structure of zzso The zzso activity of zzso and zzso against zzso sodium channels in rat zzso cells was analyzed by zzso zzso zzso The zzso values for the zzso were zzso and zzso zzso and zzso lower than the activity of the native zzso indicating that zzso and zzso may be important for the zzso activity of zzso Taken together, our results suggest that the positively charged patch might be the binding site for the interaction of zzso with zzso sodium zzso These findings might contribute to the zzso of the structure and function relationship of zzso
