Silver zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso have attracted much attention as novel zzso because of their convenient zzso zzso by the sequence and length of the template zzso However, the precise production of zzso zzso in a zzso manner still remains a challenge to attain highly selective and zzso DNA zzso Here we exploited the availability of a gap site in DNA duplexes as a new scaffold for the synthesis of zzso zzso Compared to the commonly used DNA templates for the creation of zzso zzso the gap site in DNA duplexes was found to facilitate the rapid formation of the fluorescent zzso zzso without sacrifice of their bright zzso and excellent zzso We found that fluorescent zzso zzso were highly selectively formed when zzso faced toward the gap site in DNA duplexes, and they were in zzso zzso as zzso by zzso manner for the DNA zzso zzso This zzso growth of the fluorescent zzso zzso at the gap site would find promising applications in practical detection of single zzso zzso zzso and construction of zzso functional sensors with zzso and cost-effective zzso
