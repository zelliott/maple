The complete zzso sequence of zzso the gene for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli, was determined and compared with the published sequence of zzso zzso the gene for the zzso zzso zzso These zzso genes were found to be identical over zzso of their zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of the respective gene products, zzso and zzso were identical over zzso and similar over zzso of their zzso zzso of high levels of zzso during growth of strains carrying the zzso zzso of zzso on zzso plasmids had no zzso effect on growth or on the synthesis of zzso A zzso deletion strain was constructed and was shown to grow normally at low temperature zzso degrees zzso but poorly at 44 degrees zzso the slow growth zzso of zzso at elevated temperature was fully reversed by plasmids bearing zzso zzso The implications of these findings for the existence of two zzso zzso for zzso are zzso
