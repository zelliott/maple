zzso zzso has been shown to be expressed by cells in zzso of various origins, but whether it plays a functional role in zzso formation is not zzso Here we used a zzso zzso zzso model, to test the hypothesis that zzso contributes functionally to zzso zzso We zzso zzso and normal zzso by subcutaneous injection of bovine serum zzso in complete zzso zzso and assessed various zzso for both zzso zzso expression and zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso and formed zzso zzso in heart tissue in both zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso induced expression of zzso in lung and zzso zzso of zzso (but not zzso zzso and also induced zzso formation in these zzso To test whether zzso expression could play a functional role in inducing zzso we produced an zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso zzso and introduced this zzso zzso into the lungs of normal zzso The zzso zzso but not the control zzso induced pulmonary zzso zzso These studies provided direct in zzso evidence that zzso can contribute functionally to the formation of zzso zzso and suggest that zzso expression may be a common factor involved in formation of zzso of various zzso
