The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso to zzso from skeletal muscle of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso procedure including ammonium zzso zzso followed by Blue zzso zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increase in specific activity and a final yield of approximately zzso The native protein exhibited an apparent molecular weight of approximately 146 zzso with absolute specificity for zzso Only one zzso zzso zzso zzso was obtained by zzso The zzso is an zzso protein composed of identical zzso with an apparent molecular weight of approximately 37 zzso zzso zzso zzso raised in rabbits against the zzso zzso zzso zzso a single zzso zzso band in extracts from different zzso zzso onto zzso A zzso zzso zzso that zzso to an internal region of a zzso gene was obtained by zzso amplification using zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence has been used to establish the zzso relationships of the zzso zzso first zzso from an zzso of the zzso group studied so zzso other zzso of major zzso zzso
