Though zzso is an important evolutionary strategy in zzso zzso only two cases of zzso zzso strains have been zzso Our objective was to analyze the evolutionary history of the zzso zzso aiming to obtain evidence of significant zzso zzso due to either zzso or selective forces leading to zzso zzso The data support an evolutionary preservation of the zzso related zzso region zzso for the zzso 1 and zzso On the other hand, there was no evidence that zzso has occurred in the past with the possible exception of zzso zzso Moreover, it is evidenced that zzso 3 and 10 split more recently than zzso zzso and zzso This analysis zzso a commonly found pattern in rapidly evolving zzso that is the strongly disturbed evolutionary history which zzso the uniform distribution of the zzso relationships across the zzso and introduces a conservative zzso framework for approaching this kind of zzso
