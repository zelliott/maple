The zzso zzso in a number of organisms is represented by linear DNA molecules with defined terminal zzso The zzso of linear zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso consist of tandem zzso of large repetitive units possessing zzso zzso extension of about 110 zzso Recently we identified the first zzso zzso protein zzso that specifically binds a sequence derived from the extreme end of zzso zzso linear zzso and protects it from attack by various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1997) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the isolation of zzso the gene zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso shares zzso with several bacterial and zzso zzso zzso proteins that zzso bind to zzso DNA with high zzso zzso zzso displays a preference for the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of a zzso fusion protein resulted in its zzso to the zzso but was unable to functionally substitute for the loss of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso gene and its translation product zzso may provide an insight into the evolutionary origin of linear zzso zzso and the role it plays in their replication and zzso
