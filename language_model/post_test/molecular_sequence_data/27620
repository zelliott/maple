A human zzso zzso the alpha zzso of zzso zzso II and a partial zzso zzso the rat zzso were isolated by using a zzso zzso zzso II zzso zzso The zzso human zzso contains a zzso open reading frame, 150 zzso of zzso leader, and zzso zzso of 3' zzso zzso Except for the first 7 deduced zzso acids that are missing in the rat zzso the zzso zzso acids beginning with the zzso zzso are identical between human and zzso The zzso zzso sequence is zzso identical with the human zzso zzso II zzso and there is only a single zzso acid difference between the published partial bovine sequence and the human zzso In addition, the zzso of the human zzso has an extra 53 zzso acids not present in zzso Northern analysis of rat and human zzso showed zzso bands of zzso zzso and zzso zzso In rat zzso brain and zzso had the highest levels of zzso zzso II alpha zzso specific zzso while skeletal muscle showed the zzso Southern analysis of human cultured cell and tissue zzso DNA using the full-length zzso probe revealed two bands with restriction zzso that have no recognition sites within the zzso and three to six bands with zzso having single internal zzso These results are consistent with the possibility that two genes zzso the alpha zzso
