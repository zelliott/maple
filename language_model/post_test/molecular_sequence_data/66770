zzso A zzso replaces zzso as the major low molecular weight zzso in zzso zzso it is maintained in the reduced state by zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso similar to zzso zzso but containing a novel zzso zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso has been solved using zzso anomalous zzso data and refined at a resolution of zzso zzso The resulting electron density maps define the zzso zzso zzso with zzso located at the zzso si face, zzso A from zzso and the zzso zzso lying in an extended zzso within a zzso at the zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso is positioned adjacent to the zzso zzso and receives a hydrogen bond from zzso of the complementary zzso suggesting a role for zzso as an zzso catalyst during the reduction of zzso zzso is located zzso A from zzso as well and, based on its conservation in known functional zzso also appears to be important for zzso Identification of zzso involved in recognition of the zzso zzso and in formation and stabilization of the zzso zzso center has allowed development of a zzso zzso zzso analyses indicate that zzso zzso are broadly distributed in both bacterial and zzso zzso suggesting an even broader significance for the zzso zzso system in zzso zzso zzso
