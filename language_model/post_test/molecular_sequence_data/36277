An exhaustive zzso analysis of the zzso zzso leukemia virus zzso sequence shows numerous zzso in the zzso distribution, suggesting three overlapping levels of a zzso duplicative zzso zzso The sequence fits the universal rule of zzso excess which has been proposed as the construction principle of all zzso and maintains some degree of symmetry between the two complementary zzso zzso zzso repeating units share a core consensus regularly scattered throughout the zzso This consensus is not merely predictable from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso but could zzso to an zzso stage in a so-called zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso local zzso could be accounted for by zzso zzso zzso with the human zzso zzso shows similar segments in the overrepresented zzso of the two zzso The zzso stage of transition zzso repeating units is not so clearly suggested in zzso perhaps because of numerous zzso local zzso In any case, a common evolutionary origin for the two viruses is not ruled zzso
