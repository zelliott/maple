zzso of the three zzso zzso zzso of zzso mosaic virus requires the activities of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso One hundred zzso zzso acids of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso region of over 50 zzso are both necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso zzso of the large size of the zzso zzso domain suggests that higher order structures might be necessary for the zzso interaction with zzso To explore the structural properties of zzso we used limited zzso of in zzso zzso zzso Treatment of zzso and its deletion derivatives with zzso or zzso revealed that the zzso zzso segment of approximately zzso zzso is highly resistant under our zzso conditions to zzso while the zzso is rapidly zzso All tested zzso in the zzso region that renders this region zzso have previously been found to be defective for zzso replication in zzso To complement the in zzso studies, we examined the interaction of the zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso in zzso using the zzso zzso zzso previously known to disrupt zzso interaction also prevented interaction in zzso Furthermore, results from zzso analysis suggest that the structural domain mapped in zzso is important for zzso zzso Finally, we found that the zzso proteins of three other zzso zzso viruses also contain zzso located zzso zzso
