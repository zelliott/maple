Here we report the first natural zzso in the mouse zzso zzso zzso of mouse zzso in the zzso revealed a zzso that deleted the zzso site of zzso zzso This results in zzso 1 being erroneously spliced to zzso 3 causing a zzso in the reading frame and the introduction of a stop zzso at position 2 of zzso 3 in the zzso zzso zzso studies of lens zzso isolated from zzso zzso and zzso strains confirmed the presence of this zzso in these diverse 129 strains and similar zzso were found in both zzso and 101 zzso but not in zzso or zzso mouse zzso This zzso is predicted to result in a severely truncated protein product called zzso zzso essentially only zzso 1, but zzso zzso to zzso failed to detect either full length or fragments of zzso in extracts made from either zzso or zzso suggesting that these 129 strains lack zzso zzso Like the knockout of zzso reported recently, zzso protein levels and its zzso processing were altered also in the zzso and zzso strains compared to zzso zzso zzso of the lens zzso from zzso revealed similar zzso changes in the zzso as compared to the zzso zzso with beaded and intermediate filaments being apparently replaced by poorly defined zzso zzso zzso was a key component of this residual material as shown by zzso zzso and by the generation of a zzso double knockout zzso This report of a natural zzso in zzso in the 129 and other mouse strains also has important implications for lens studies that have used the zzso strain in knockout zzso
