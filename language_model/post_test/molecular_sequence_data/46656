The second major zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso o 2, has been zzso and its zzso zzso Of patients with zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso produce zzso zzso which react with zzso zzso o zzso The zzso protein has a molecular mass of 46 zzso and its 12 zzso zzso acid sequence displays a high zzso with that of zzso zzso 2, the second major zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso clones coding for zzso o 2 have been isolated using zzso zzso 2 zzso as a zzso zzso o 2 zzso clones were zzso and found to code a putative zzso signal sequence and a zzso mature protein with a molecular weight of 50 zzso Two possible zzso zzso sites were found in the zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso o 2 shows zzso identity with that of zzso zzso zzso In its primary structure, zzso o 2 shows significant identity with those of the zzso of zzso tomato, and zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso
