A single copy of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso (a zzso zzso was identified within the DNA zzso of the zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso of the complete zzso sequence zzso base zzso of the integrated copy indicated that zzso belongs to the family of zzso that includes zzso zzso elements zzso and gypsy and thus represents the first zzso member of this zzso group to be zzso The internal portion of zzso flanked by long terminal repeats zzso is composed of three long open reading frames comparable in size and location to the zzso zzso and zzso genes of the zzso zzso zzso similarity with the zzso elements was the highest within individual zzso of zzso open reading frame 2 zzso zzso that are also zzso among the zzso and zzso zzso reverse zzso and zzso functions, zzso zzso the zzso and 3' zzso of zzso zzso indicated that the zzso have a zzso zzso structural organization that is capable of directing the synthesis of transcripts that represent potential zzso for reverse zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso were also initiated from a site within the zzso zzso that matches the consensus motif for the promoter of late, zzso zzso zzso The presence of this zzso promoter within zzso and its subsequent zzso only after integration within the viral zzso suggest a possible symbiotic relationship with the zzso that could extend zzso host zzso
