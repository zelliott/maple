zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso a nutritionally versatile zzso has an extremely efficient natural transformation zzso Here we describe the generation of eight zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso by zzso zzso These zzso were found by Southern zzso analysis and zzso studies to result from single zzso marker insertions at different zzso zzso DNA binding and zzso studies with one zzso zzso revealed that the transformation zzso of this zzso results from a complete lack of DNA binding and, therefore, zzso zzso A novel competence gene essential for natural zzso named zzso was cloned by zzso of zzso zzso The zzso sequence of zzso was determined, and its deduced zzso zzso displays significant similarities to type IV zzso Analysis of the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso strain revealed that both are covered with zzso thin zzso (3 to 4 zzso in zzso and individual thick zzso (6 zzso in zzso These results provide evidence that the zzso zzso is unrelated to the zzso structures of strain zzso Taking all data into account, we propose that zzso functions as a major zzso of an zzso acting as a channel or pore zzso DNA binding and/or zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso
