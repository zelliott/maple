zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein zzso with a wide range of zzso many of which are involved in cell cycle zzso zzso activity is elevated in a variety of human tumors and we have used a transgenic mouse model to demonstrate that zzso expression of zzso can induce zzso Thus, zzso fulfills the definition of an zzso A zzso zzso or zzso gene that contributes to cancer in a dominant zzso zzso zzso in transforming cells with other zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso and here we show zzso with loss of the tumor zzso gene zzso To understand more about the zzso and pathological role of zzso we are cloning the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso will be used to generate transgenic and knockout mice and the regulatory elements for gene expression will be zzso
