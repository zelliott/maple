To establish the zzso profile of the promoter zzso islands of 31 genes that might play zzso roles in colon zzso 

The zzso specific zzso in conjunction of sequencing zzso was used to establish the zzso of the promoter zzso islands of 31 genes in zzso cancer zzso zzso zzso the neighboring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and normal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of 10 genes was assessed on the zzso tissue zzso of zzso from 58 zzso The correlation of tumor specific changes with each of zzso features was scrutinized with relevant statistic zzso 

In comparison with the normal zzso of the zzso patients, the following 14 genes displayed no tumor associated zzso breast cancer 1, early onset zzso zzso 1, type 1, zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 1 zzso DNA zzso 1 zzso melanoma zzso family A, 1 zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso candidate 3 zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in multiple advanced zzso 1) zzso zzso acid zzso beta zzso , Ras association zzso domain family 1 C zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso tissue inhibitor of zzso 3 zzso zzso dystrophy, zzso zzso and von zzso syndrome zzso The rest 17 targets exhibited to various zzso the tumor associated zzso As changes in zzso of the following genes occurred zzso their impact on the formation of zzso cancer were zzso zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso Ras association zzso domain family zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso reading frame zzso zzso zzso The following genes exhibited moderate changes in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, colon cancer, zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor 2A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso in tumor 31 zzso zzso zzso The rest changed greatly in the zzso pattern in zzso cancer zzso zzso A1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 13, zzso (heart) zzso zzso zzso zzso box 1 zzso zzso zzso tumor protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso tumor 1 zzso zzso zzso However, no significant correlation of changes in zzso with any given zzso features was zzso Furthermore, the frequent changes in zzso appeared to be an early phase event of colon zzso The in zzso expression of 10 genes was assessed by the zzso approach at the protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso , and zzso genes in the context of the zzso status in zzso zzso No clear correlation between the zzso of the promoter zzso islands and the negative expression of the genes was zzso 

The zzso profile of 31 genes was established in patients with colon cancer and zzso zzso which provides new insights into the DNA zzso zzso mechanisms underlying the zzso of zzso cancer and may be of zzso values for zzso zzso
