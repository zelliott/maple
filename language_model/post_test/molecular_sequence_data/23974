zzso zzso zzso zzso 3) and zzso zzso zzso are two zzso proteins essential for zzso A controlled zzso responses in zzso zzso zzso There are 12 additional zzso genes in the zzso zzso The predicted sizes of this family of proteins range from 531 zzso acids to zzso zzso zzso and they share zzso to zzso zzso acid identities over their entire zzso In addition, most zzso proteins contain one to three zzso zzso and one or two putative nuclear zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso chain reaction analyses revealed that all zzso genes except zzso are expressed in all zzso zzso including zzso leaves, zzso leaves, zzso zzso flowers, and zzso zzso of gene specific zzso fusion reporter gene expression revealed that all zzso genes except zzso are expressed in zzso and their expression in zzso is induced by zzso light zzso zzso expression of green fluorescent protein zzso zzso fusion proteins in onion zzso zzso zzso cells revealed that all zzso proteins are targeted into the zzso zzso knockout zzso and zzso zzso zzso early under both zzso and zzso conditions (with much more drastic effects under zzso zzso suggesting that zzso and zzso regulate flowering zzso In addition, zzso zzso transgenic plants showed a specific hypersensitivity to red light zzso of zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso indicating that zzso is a specific negative regulator of zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso In zzso our results support the notion that zzso family members play distinct roles in light control of zzso development, most likely by regulating nuclear gene zzso
