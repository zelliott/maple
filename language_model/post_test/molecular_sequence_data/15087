The zzso zzso of influenza A viruses has been classified into zzso distinct zzso zzso to zzso The zzso zzso of influenza A viruses are principally defined as zzso determined by zzso or zzso zzso tests using zzso zzso to the respective zzso zzso which have little zzso to the other zzso zzso Thus, it is generally believed that the zzso zzso are not broadly zzso among zzso zzso In this study, we generated a novel zzso zzso zzso specific to zzso designated zzso zzso which showed zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of influenza A zzso This zzso was found to have broad zzso to many other viruses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso We further found that zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso activities against particular strains of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of influenza A zzso zzso viruses that escaped zzso by zzso zzso were selected from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and sequence analysis of the zzso genes of these escape zzso revealed zzso acid zzso at positions zzso zzso and 193 zzso zzso A molecular modeling study showed that these zzso acids were located on the zzso head of the zzso and formed a novel zzso zzso adjacent to the zzso domain of zzso Furthermore, passive zzso of mice with zzso zzso provided zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso binds to a common zzso site shared among a variety of zzso zzso and zzso viral zzso in zzso and in zzso by affecting viral attachment to zzso The present study supports the notion that zzso zzso play some roles in zzso immunity against influenza A virus infection, and underscores the potential therapeutic utility of zzso zzso against zzso
