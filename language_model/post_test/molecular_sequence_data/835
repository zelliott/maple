In zzso zzso zzso reduction of zzso to zzso In zzso it has been proposed that this reaction is zzso by zzso which despite limited zzso and a different predicted zzso can replace zzso in zzso zzso of zzso revealed a direct correlation between zzso levels and zzso activity, showing that zzso is the principal zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies identified an zzso zzso domain in zzso zzso in zzso oriented to place it in the zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso studies showed that the N zzso of zzso is zzso Fusion of the zzso domain of zzso to green fluorescent protein directed the fusion protein to the zzso demonstrating that it is sufficient for zzso Although both proteins have two predicted zzso zzso zzso to a zzso zzso domain, neither had an identifiable zzso zzso Nevertheless, both zzso and the residual zzso of zzso produced by removal of the zzso domain with factor zzso zzso behave as integral membrane zzso In addition to their zzso differences, zzso of zzso zzso zzso had different effects on the activities of the two zzso Thus, while zzso can replace zzso in zzso there are substantial differences between the two zzso that may be important for regulation of zzso zzso in higher zzso
