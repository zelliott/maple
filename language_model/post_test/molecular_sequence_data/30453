This paper reports the mapping of both mature and precursor zzso zzso zzso zzso Several zzso were found to have zzso and 3' zzso which differ from those zzso through DNA sequencing zzso et zzso zzso The 3' ends of the two zzso zzso and zzso overlap with the downstream transcripts zzso and zzso zzso by 5 and 10 zzso zzso The 132 zzso zzso region is extensively zzso in particular it contains a 124 zzso zzso and the zzso end of a possible precursor of 13 clustered zzso This latter zzso by 7 zzso with the 3' end of the 124 zzso zzso In addition to the mature zzso 32 high molecular weight zzso which are probably the precursors of the smaller more abundant mature species, were detected by Northern zzso The mapping of these transcripts indicates that they are processed at the level of zzso or zzso sequences and suggests the existence of two zzso initiation sites upstream of the zzso and the zzso b genes zzso In the light of these results it appears that zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso takes place via multiple and probably overlapping zzso zzso Moreover, the wide variation in the zzso levels of the mature zzso indicates that sea zzso zzso DNA expression is also regulated at the level of zzso zzso
