zzso experiments revealed that an zzso raised against an zzso could specifically detect the recently isolated zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The characterization indicated that two different zzso in the zzso region of zzso I and zzso are zzso One zzso is the zzso the other is the zzso Among the peptides isolated from zzso zzso the zzso zzso only with zzso zzso tests of the zzso with zzso in zzso zzso abolished the reaction, while tests with zzso zzso did not cause any zzso zzso In the zzso head zzso zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso the zzso lobe and the zzso zzso Although some zzso zzso extended into the zzso zzso zzso II, no zzso was observed in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso No zzso was found zzso With this study we demonstrate that zzso isolated from a whole body zzso is truly a zzso and the data suggest that its function is zzso or zzso rather than zzso
