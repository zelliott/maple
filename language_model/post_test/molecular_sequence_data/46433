To further investigate the genetic diversity of zzso B virus zzso zzso A in Africa, we zzso 263 zzso strains from Nigeria zzso and Cameroon zzso zzso analysis of S zzso sequences attributed 175 strains zzso to zzso E and 88 zzso to zzso zzso In zzso zzso A strains were the most prevalent zzso zzso zzso in Nigeria, zzso E was highly dominant zzso zzso The zzso A strains grouped with reference strains of zzso A3 zzso the provisional zzso A5 zzso a recently reported new zzso from Rwanda zzso or as zzso zzso Ten complete zzso sequences obtained from strains that clustered with the new zzso from Rwanda formed a separate group supported by a zzso value of zzso The zzso distance to other potential or recognized zzso of zzso A was at least zzso Thus, the new group of strains could be considered as a new zzso of zzso zzso A, tentatively named zzso Interestingly, the zzso strains from Rwanda and Cameroon showed an zzso zzso but essentially no other zzso were shared between the two countries, suggesting that zzso may have evolved in a yet unknown place and may have only relatively recently spread to Rwanda and Western zzso zzso attributed to provisional zzso A5 were found for the first time in Cameroon zzso and Central Nigeria zzso indicating that A5 is more widespread than previously zzso
