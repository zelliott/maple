This paper describes the first zzso synthesis of zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was used to zzso couple zzso onto zzso resulting in a zzso zzso Two methods zzso and radioactive zzso are described and validated to determine the zzso loading onto the zzso zzso This zzso carrier, through its own intrinsic zzso activity, is expected to act not only as a drug delivery agent but also as an zzso zzso zzso between the two drugs zzso and zzso was demonstrated when zzso cells were zzso with the zzso zzso prior to zzso A threshold of zzso loaded onto the zzso was required to achieve this synergistic zzso Such zzso zzso could be of great therapeutic interest because these zzso which contain a low zzso zzso present improved zzso activities relative to free zzso Moreover, zzso is a zzso zzso already used in the food zzso
