zzso of zzso zzso from human zzso has been subjected to the reverse zzso specifically initiated from the zzso zzso zzso 1 alpha by a synthetic zzso complementary to the zzso coding zzso to yield the corresponding zzso zzso Under conditions of the zzso chain reaction, with the above zzso as a downstream primer and an upstream primer corresponding to the beginning of the mature zzso 1 alpha zzso zzso zzso the zzso duplex yielded the desired zzso whose structure was proved by the restriction and sequence zzso The zzso containing translation initiation and termination zzso can be used for producing zzso 1 alpha in various expression systems and as a probe in studies of the zzso zzso This method of the gene synthesis does not need construction and analysis of zzso libraries nor synthesis of zzso DNA, and can, in principle, make use of the total zzso cellular zzso
