zzso of zzso regulatory zzso factor 3 zzso zzso is an important zzso protein to mediate the induction of type I zzso In this study, we identified an alternatively spliced zzso of zzso lacking zzso 7, termed zzso protein zzso zzso shares the zzso portion zzso zzso with zzso but possesses a unique zzso sequence at the zzso terminal part, therefore lacking the zzso zzso including zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso zzso is expressed in multiple zzso and distinct cell zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso of zzso promoter by zzso virus infection and zzso zzso treatment but enhanced that in zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso expression was reduced after zzso virus infection but was zzso after zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso induction of zzso via zzso regulatory zzso factor 3 by zzso the zzso zzso However, zzso zzso was still activated by zzso as zzso retained the ability to interact with zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso acts as a dominant negative regulator of zzso induction of zzso zzso
