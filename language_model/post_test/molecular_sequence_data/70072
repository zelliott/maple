zzso A novel preparation of the trachea and main zzso with attached zzso nerve from the guinea-pig maintained in zzso was used to study the properties of single zzso zzso nerve zzso with identified receptive zzso zzso zzso were made from zzso C zzso with a mean zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso m zzso and zzso A delta zzso with a mean zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso m zzso zzso fields for C and A delta zzso were of small diameter, distributed throughout the trachea and right zzso and possessed very low mechanical thresholds of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso of isolated zzso was studied by applying drugs directly onto identified receptive zzso A delta zzso were insensitive to zzso (up to 3 zzso zzso (3 zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso zzso 10 zzso applied for up to 1 zzso zzso (10 zzso zzso (10 zzso and zzso (10 zzso were also ineffective in exciting C zzso zzso zzso at zzso ranging from 30 zzso to 3 zzso evoked a sustained firing of all C zzso tested when applied for a period of 30 s directly onto receptive zzso zzso zzso zzso also zzso excited C zzso in a zzso zzso The effect of zzso appeared to be zzso by a B2 zzso since it was not zzso by the selective B1 zzso zzso zzso (3 zzso and was abolished by prior application of the selective B2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 140 was without effect against zzso discharge of C zzso zzso zzso and zzso discharge of C zzso was present to a similar degree in preparations zzso with zzso (1 zzso indicating that it was not dependent on, or influenced by, zzso zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate that single zzso zzso may be studied in zzso and provide the first examination of the properties of sensory zzso zzso guinea-pig zzso C and A delta zzso both exhibit low threshold mechanical sensitivity but show marked differences in terms of their zzso
