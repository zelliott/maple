zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso that use molecular oxygen to zzso a variety of zzso zzso The DNA sequence of the alpha zzso zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso bacterial strain zzso was zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso soil samples adjacent to automobile workshops and oil stations after enrichment and establishment of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified as a member of zzso zzso based on sequence analysis of the zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso zzso zzso by strain zzso was tentatively proposed to proceed via a zzso zzso after zzso to the corresponding zzso This hypothesis was supported by zzso chain reaction zzso detection of the zzso zzso sequence and zzso zzso analysis of the culture zzso showing zzso of zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso The detection of zzso genes involved in zzso degradation by zzso showed the presence of both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the alpha zzso of zzso from strain zzso revealed specific zzso grouping to known zzso The metal coordination zzso regions from strain zzso were found to be zzso with those from the zzso zzso zzso bacterial zzso Two zzso motifs was detected in zzso of strain zzso within an approximate 100 zzso acid zzso a typical arrangement characteristic of most known zzso
