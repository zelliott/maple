zzso zzso is an alleged B cell zzso binding certain zzso human zzso We reasoned that a zzso fusion protein could possess higher affinity for zzso and improved zzso zzso zzso To test this we produced several human zzso zzso harboring zzso Unlike zzso or zzso zzso bound zzso considerably stronger than zzso zzso exhibited approximately zzso increase in zzso of two zzso zzso strains when compared to zzso zzso improved zzso of zzso zzso B primary zzso or zzso exceeding zzso for zzso and zzso for zzso It enhanced zzso of zzso zzso C zzso and had negligible effect on 1/4 zzso A zzso We attribute this improvement to possible pairing of zzso with zzso D1 and stabilization of an zzso zzso structure, rather than to zzso zzso These novel findings support the current notion that zzso fusion proteins can act as better zzso entry zzso with potential clinical zzso
