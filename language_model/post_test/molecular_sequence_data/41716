The rapid motions of the backbone of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been investigated using zzso zzso zzso experiments on zzso protein at pH zzso and with a 200 zzso molecular dynamics simulation of hydrated zzso zzso The experimental data were interpreted in terms of a generalized order zzso zzso and an effective correlation time zzso zzso for the internal motion of each zzso zzso A back zzso using the same model, yielded the zzso nuclear zzso effects zzso and the zzso zzso relaxation times zzso from the simulated zzso The rapid motions of the backbone turned out to be rather limited and uniform throughout the zzso with a somewhat reduced mobility in the two major zzso regions and a slightly enhanced flexibility for some zzso in the first zinc zzso zzso The agreement between the experimental and simulated zzso was as good as quantitative for most of the zzso except for some zzso that were subject to a more zzso and in the simulation thus poorly zzso zzso Examples of such motions that were found in the simulation include jumps of the zzso bond of zzso between the charged zzso of the side chain of zzso and less distinct large scale motions for some of the zzso in the extended regions, that were shown to give rise to noisy and/or fast zzso internal zzso correlation zzso For these zzso large differences in the simulated and experimental zzso zzso were found, indicating that motions on different time scales were dominating in the experimental and simulated zzso The lower zzso zzso experimental zzso for these zzso could not be reproduced in the simulation and were shown to be a consequence of the lower zzso zzso estimated in the zzso By combining information from the simulation and the experiment a more complete picture of the motions for these zzso can be obtained as is illustrated with an zzso of the jump angle and jump frequency for the zzso bond of zzso
