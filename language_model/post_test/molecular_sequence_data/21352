zzso is a zzso zzso gene that is lost in several zzso including zzso zzso We tested the zzso zzso hypothesis and evaluated the biological influence of zzso zzso on its expression and clinical relevance in zzso zzso zzso zzso was frequent in zzso cancer cells analyzed by zzso zzso and zzso sequencing and was associated with low gene zzso being restored in zzso by zzso zzso zzso was also frequently observed in a large series of zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with increasing stage zzso zzso zzso and tumor grade zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with low zzso transcript expression by quantitative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript expression was also associated with zzso tumor stage zzso zzso zzso Low transcript expression alone zzso zzso zzso or combined with zzso zzso zzso zzso was associated with poor zzso survival zzso zzso zzso zzso transcript expression remained an independent zzso in zzso analyses zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in zzso cancer, providing a potential zzso explanation zzso zzso for the observed loss of zzso in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and its expression with zzso variables and poor survival suggest the utility of incorporating zzso measurement using zzso material for tumor zzso and clinical outcome prognosis of patients with zzso zzso
