We previously characterized a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also called zzso zzso in zzso zzso which differs from its zzso zzso in that it zzso contains an zzso zzso domain and zzso does not produce zzso when zzso although it does slow growth zzso it is zzso by a gene called zzso Here we describe a second zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso by zzso which was cloned as a zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The DNA sequence of zzso encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids that shows zzso identity with the sequence of zzso zzso Surprisingly, comparison with sequences in the zzso data base showed that the product of zzso has even greater zzso zzso zzso with rat zzso which was characterized as an initiation factor zzso protein but not yet shown to have zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells expressing zzso in a zzso zzso contained 3- to zzso increases in zzso activity on different zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene product was zzso by zzso zzso and shown to contain zzso zzso To evaluate the zzso significance of zzso the zzso gene was deleted from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso strain, like the zzso zzso strain, is viable but with a slower growth zzso The zzso zzso zzso strains are zzso Thus, removal of zzso zzso is an essential function in zzso as in zzso but zzso require two zzso zzso to provide the essential function which can only be partially provided by zzso or zzso zzso
