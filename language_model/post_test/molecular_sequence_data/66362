To evaluate the zzso status of the zzso zzso islands in zzso gene using plasma and tissue samples from cervical cancer patients and find a novel marker for zzso diagnosis of cervical cancer, zzso zzso zzso was employed to examine zzso island zzso in zzso gene in 151 zzso plasma samples and 30 tumor tissue samples obtained from cervical cancer zzso MSP product was cloned and zzso zzso zzso island zzso of zzso was detected in zzso of the plasma samples, and in zzso of the tissue zzso The total zzso rate of zzso status between plasma and tissue samples in zzso gene was zzso We found a strong positive correlation between zzso zzso in the plasma and the clinical stage and zzso grade of the zzso The data showed that zzso island zzso of the zzso gene is prevalent in the plasma and tissue samples from cervical cancer zzso zzso detection may be used as a zzso marker for diagnosis of cervical cancer and zzso treatment zzso
