zzso of zzso by proteins and small molecules often involves large changes in zzso structure and zzso yet very few studies have so far characterized these zzso zzso Here we extend to the zzso zzso recent zzso relaxation studies of motions in the zzso recognized by human zzso zzso a well-known model for zzso zzso Changes in relaxation observed upon complex formation demonstrate that the zzso site becomes rigid in the complex, but the upper zzso that defines the secondary structure of this zzso experiences unexpected zzso zzso By using a zzso zzso strategy, we observe that the upper zzso moves independently of the remainder of the structure also in the absence of zzso Surprisingly, zzso zzso making important zzso contacts in the structure of the complex exhibit increased flexibility in the presence of the zzso Both of these results support the hypothesis that zzso proteins select a structure that zzso zzso contacts in the zzso of zzso sampled by the free zzso and that protein binding zzso these zzso Together with previous studies of the zzso zzso they also demonstrate that zzso zzso experience complex motions that zzso the strength of individual zzso
