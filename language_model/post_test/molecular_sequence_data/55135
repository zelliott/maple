The zzso sweet taste zzso zzso is expressed on the zzso membrane of certain populations of zzso zzso zzso of zzso and other sweet compounds by this zzso activates a zzso in zzso cells, resulting in zzso of a number of gut hormones, including zzso zzso 2 zzso This subsequently leads to zzso in the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and increased zzso zzso zzso On the basis of the current information available on the horse zzso zzso it has been proposed that the gene for zzso zzso is absent in the zzso We show here, however, that horses express both the zzso and protein for zzso zzso zzso is most closely zzso to that in the pig and the zzso zzso zzso along with zzso zzso and zzso proteins are zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso administration of zzso in rats and zzso leads to an increase in the expression of zzso in zzso zzso and enhancement in blood zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed in enteric zzso excluding the direct effect of zzso on zzso However, electric stimulation of enteric zzso generates a neural response leading to zzso zzso suggesting that sugar in the zzso activates a zzso increase in the functional expression of zzso zzso possess the ability to zzso zzso expression in response to increased dietary zzso and to enhance the capacity of the gut to absorb zzso The gut sweet zzso provides an accessible target for manipulating the zzso gut to absorb zzso (and zzso allowing greater energy zzso and zzso for hard-working zzso
