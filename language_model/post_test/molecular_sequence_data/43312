The use of zzso acid derivatives in the synthesis of peptides with difficult sequences has already been zzso With these zzso acid derivatives the zzso protecting group zzso zzso for the backbone zzso bonds of zzso chains is introduced, and thus the zzso due to zzso zzso association is zzso This paper describes the synthesis and use of zzso acid derivatives as an alternative means of introducing zzso backbone zzso These new zzso derivatives were obtained in higher yield than the zzso zzso zzso yields to the zzso zzso zzso were the same as those obtained with zzso zzso under the zzso zzso zzso We also compared different zzso of a difficult zzso with the zzso approach zzso zzso zzso use of zzso agents, backbone protection using zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso Both the backbone protection and zzso zzso chemistry approaches gave the desired product in excellent yield and zzso
