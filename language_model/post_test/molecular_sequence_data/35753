DNA zzso analysis of the cloned rat beta zzso zzso gene revealed unexpected restriction zzso zzso sites that suggested the presence of one or more zzso near the end of the coding zzso This region of the rat gene was mapped and zzso and was found to contain two zzso The first zzso occurs 12 zzso acids from the end of the coding block, as deduced by comparison with the beta 3 zzso zzso zzso analysis of the first zzso indicates that it might contain zzso elements that could be important in the zzso zzso expression of this zzso The mouse and human beta 3 zzso genes have been assumed to be zzso however, these genes contain potential zzso sites that are zzso to those present in the rat zzso The relevant regions of the mouse and human beta 3 zzso zzso were cloned and, by comparing them to the respective zzso zzso it was concluded that these genes also contain one or more zzso zzso analysis of the mouse and human beta 3 zzso zzso indicates that they code for proteins that are, respectively, 12 and 6 zzso acids larger than previously deduced from zzso zzso
