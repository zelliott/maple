zzso zzso is a zzso zzso associated with zzso in Atlantic cod zzso zzso zzso Although farmed cod in Norway is routinely vaccinated against the infection, outbreaks of zzso zzso zzso still zzso Here, we describe the structural characterization of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso and show that it is distinct from that previously established for zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure of the zzso zzso was shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies to be a zzso mass linear zzso of zzso repeating units, composed of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso see zzso zzso analysis of the partial zzso zzso confirmed the presence of an zzso group at position zzso of zzso and established that the zzso structure represents the biological repeating unit of the zzso In addition, it was demonstrated that some of zzso in the zzso was present in the form of zzso
