A family of zzso linked cell wall proteins of zzso zzso called zzso zzso are characterized by up to 10 zzso repeating zzso zzso contains only one complete repeating sequence and its deletion caused a release of the protein into the zzso The exchange of each of three zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as one zzso acid zzso within the repeating unit leads to a loss of the protein from the cell zzso zzso acid sequencing revealed that only zzso is zzso zzso of the protein with mild zzso changed zzso to to zzso acid, suggesting that zzso is involved in the zzso Analysis by mass zzso showed that 5 zzso are attached to zzso Sugar analysis revealed zzso as the only zzso It is suggested that zzso proteins form novel, zzso zzso zzso linkages between the zzso group of zzso zzso arising from specific zzso with zzso groups of zzso of zzso zzso This zzso reaction could take place zzso and would energetically proceed on the account of zzso group zzso
