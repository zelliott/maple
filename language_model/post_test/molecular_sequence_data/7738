To investigate the usefulness of zzso chain reaction zzso from zzso fluid zzso for rapid diagnosis and assessing treatment response of zzso meningitis zzso in AIDS zzso 

zzso zzso samples from 10 patients with zzso confirmed by autopsy or by a culture of zzso (41 zzso and from two patients with highly probable zzso (three zzso were zzso zzso specimens were collected before and during standard zzso zzso zzso samples from 24 AIDS patients with autopsy evidence of other zzso diseases were studied as zzso 

A zzso zzso amplifying a 123 zzso zzso of the zzso sequence was zzso zzso to 95 degrees C for 15 zzso was used for zzso treatment of zzso 

zzso limit was zzso zzso units per zzso or 10 zzso zzso zzso tuberculosis zzso zzso DNA was detected in zzso from all the 12 confirmed or highly probable zzso zzso zzso was positive by zzso zzso in 17 of 17 zzso and 18 of 27 zzso samples collected before and during therapy, zzso Clinical and zzso follow-up zzso or zzso 2 weeks was available for seven zzso zzso zzso converted to zzso tuberculosis DNA negative in four patients that showed improvement during treatment, but it remained positive in three patients who died of zzso zzso All the zzso samples from the zzso controls were negative by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso for detection of zzso tuberculosis DNA is specific for diagnosis of zzso and more sensitive than conventional zzso Moreover, zzso zzso could be a useful method for assessing treatment response in AIDS patients with zzso
