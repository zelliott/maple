Investigation of zzso gene structures is a zzso task due to enormous expansions of the zzso zzso great variety of gene forms, and the zzso in sequence zzso A number of available informational systems on various gene characteristics complement each other and are indispensable for many zzso zzso Among them, the zzso Database zzso is a good choice for large-scale zzso examination of zzso structure and zzso It has many internal filters that control for sequence quality, consistency of gene descriptions, accordance to standards, and possible zzso New innovations in zzso are zzso The collection of zzso and zzso has been extended beyond coding regions and current versions of zzso contain data on untranslated regions of gene sequences as zzso zzso genes are included as a special part of zzso For species with entirely zzso zzso zzso databases have been zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso Database zzso has been introduced which includes the full set of zzso that come from zzso genes that have the same positions relative to the reading zzso Examples of statistical analyses of gene sequences using zzso are zzso We present the latest data on our comparison of zzso positions in zzso zzso genes of human, mouse and zzso and find no convincing cases of zzso zzso We discuss relevant zzso issues of zzso zzso In particular, zzso of genes in zzso databases contain internal stop zzso This fact is due to a combination of biological reasons and also to errors in sequence zzso The zzso is freely available at zzso
