The interaction of DNA zzso zzso zzso with zzso DNA replication origins can be detected with zzso precision exploiting the action of zzso poisons specific for type I or type II DNA zzso Using the zzso I poison zzso and the zzso II poison zzso the precise sites of interaction of these zzso around the zzso B2 origin have been identified at different points in the cell zzso The procedure can be applied to any origin for which the sequence has been identified within approximately 1 zzso
