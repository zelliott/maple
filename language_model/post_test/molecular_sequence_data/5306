The zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso motif found in many zzso zzso regulatory zzso Despite the wealth of in zzso data on the mechanism HD proteins use to bind DNA, comparatively little is known about the roles of individual zzso in these zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso protein contains a HD that shares significant sequence identity with the zzso zzso zzso We have used the zzso structure of zzso as a model to predict how zzso might contact DNA and have examined how individual zzso of the zzso HD contribute to zzso zzso in zzso and to DNA binding in zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso and zzso share many similar zzso zzso However, our results also show that some highly zzso zzso which contact the DNA in many HD structures, make relatively small contributions to the zzso affinity and in zzso activity of the zzso zzso We also show that the zzso arm of the zzso HD is a critical component in determining the zzso specificity of the protein and that the requirements for zzso in the zzso arm are zzso for zzso zzso zzso and DNA zzso
