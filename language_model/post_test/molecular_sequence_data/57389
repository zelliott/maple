The zzso zzso at positions zzso and 198 in zzso zzso have been shown to react with a zzso label which is an analog of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso 30, zzso in a manner suggesting that these zzso zzso are involved in zzso zzso The related zzso zzso zzso has a zzso at position zzso which, given the zzso identity between its zzso 330 zzso acids and those of zzso zzso zzso to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to alter zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso kinetic parameters were measured for zzso and zzso zzso zzso No kinetic zzso differed between the zzso and zzso zzso including zzso values, zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso for zzso These results show that zzso is not required for zzso binding to zzso zzso
