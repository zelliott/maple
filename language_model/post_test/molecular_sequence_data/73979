A zzso investigation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed by using zzso zzso gene sequence zzso Comparative sequence analysis showed that the zzso is zzso very zzso zzso species were found to be zzso zzso with members of other zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso The four species of the zzso zzso zzso complex zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were found to be zzso closely related to one another, displaying exceptionally high levels of sequence similarity zzso or zzso zzso These four species formed a natural group that was quite separate from the other zzso and zzso species zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso were found to be zzso almost identical and, along with zzso zzso formed a stable group closely related to, but nevertheless distinct from, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain CBS zzso zzso zzso type zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso displayed a particularly close zzso affinity with each other, as did zzso zzso and zzso zzso Similarly, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain CBS zzso were found to be zzso highly related and to form a zzso distinct zzso The recently reinstated species zzso zzso was found to form a distinct lineage and displayed no specific association with any other zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso formed a very loose association with a group which included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso strain CBS zzso on the other hand, displayed no specific association with any of the other zzso zzso zzso although a zzso analysis did reveal that this strain exhibited a loose zzso affinity with zzso zzso and zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso findings, two new zzso species, zzso zzso (with type strain CBS zzso and zzso zzso (with type strain CBS zzso are zzso
