Two binding zzso which are specific for zzso and zzso were isolated from rat serum to zzso The minor component zzso zzso protein I zzso was indistinguishable from rat liver zzso protein zzso zzso had a molecular mass of about 200 zzso and consisted of about six identical zzso zzso the zzso had a zzso structure, and its properties were identical to those of zzso zzso was also indistinguishable from zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, the sequence of 15 zzso zzso acids of zzso was identical to that of zzso the complete primary structure of which has been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Reynolds, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 101, zzso The major component zzso had a molecular mass of about 650 zzso and consisted of about 20 identical zzso zzso it was zzso distinct from zzso and zzso although the zzso had a zzso structure similar to zzso and zzso zzso studies using zzso showed that zzso is a typical plasma protein turning over with a zzso of zzso zzso zzso was unusual in its late appearance and rapid turnover rate in zzso These results, together with the fact that zzso decayed with zzso curves, suggest that a part of zzso is leaked from liver into plasma in the form of zzso
