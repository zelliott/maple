Acute zzso leukemia zzso is the most frequent cancer encountered in zzso Little is known about the molecular pathology of childhood T cell zzso zzso is a zzso process that involves zzso in zzso and tumor zzso zzso Recently, a zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso was shown to be associated with predisposition to zzso This new mechanism for human zzso is caused by defects in the DNA zzso zzso To study the involvement of some of these zzso events in the development of T cell zzso we have initiated a systematic search for losses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso in children affected with this zzso These patients were zzso by zzso using 56 zzso markers located near known or putative tumor zzso zzso The zzso patterns were altered in more than zzso of the zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two third of the patients were deleted for zzso zzso suggesting the involvement of a tumor zzso zzso probably the zzso zzso The only patient zzso to chemotherapy was shown to be associated with a zzso zzso This is the first documented case of a childhood zzso associated with zzso zzso Our results suggest that defects in DNA zzso components are involved in the development of a subset of childhood T cell zzso
