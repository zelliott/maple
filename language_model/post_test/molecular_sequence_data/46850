Western blots of two-dimensional zzso maps of proteins from zzso zzso were zzso with zzso from 17 zzso patients with zzso inflammatory zzso zzso patterns zzso 28 to 2 spots, average zzso were different for each zzso however, zzso against a zzso due to the zzso zzso outer membrane zzso zzso were observed in all zzso The next most frequent group of zzso zzso zzso recognized the zzso zzso zzso described as zzso in zzso zzso zzso to the major zzso and variable zzso major outer membrane protein zzso was observed at a relatively lower frequency zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein was also frequently recognized zzso zzso in this patient zzso Besides the above zzso findings, the study detected several new zzso zzso with zzso ranging from zzso to zzso Some were characterized also by zzso zzso acid sequencing and zzso zzso zzso these were a novel outer membrane protein zzso and, interestingly, five zzso bacterial zzso four zzso zzso reacted with the zzso zzso zzso five zzso recognized the zzso protein S1, eight zzso the protein zzso factor zzso seven zzso a putative zzso zzso of the zzso family, and seven zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso zzso of the last two proteins were shown to zzso protective immunity in other bacterial zzso The data show that zzso zzso processes commonly thought to play a role in zzso zzso may be sustained not only by the zzso zzso zzso but also by other zzso bacterial zzso some of which may be also considered as potential vaccine zzso
