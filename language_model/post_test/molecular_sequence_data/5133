Critical zzso signals in normal and zzso cells are transmitted by the zzso protein zzso by means of its zzso zzso 2 zzso domain, which binds to zzso zzso zzso generated by the zzso of zzso zzso To understand this important control point and to design zzso previous investigations have focused on the molecular mechanisms by which the zzso zzso domain selectively binds zzso containing zzso In the current study, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso domain can also bind in a zzso independent zzso Using zzso display, an zzso acid zzso zzso zzso has been identified that binds to the zzso zzso domain but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso blocks zzso zzso domain association zzso zzso zzso with a zzso acid zzso zzso derived from the zzso protein zzso These data and zzso acid substitution analysis indicate that zzso interacts in the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso requires a zzso sequence similar to that found in natural zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso increases zzso zzso zzso zzso also requires an internal zzso bond to maintain the active binding zzso Since the zzso zzso does not contain zzso it defines a new type of zzso domain binding motif that may advance the design of zzso zzso
