This protocol describes the application of a zzso chain reaction to allow the cloning and sequencing of new functional zzso light chain zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain zzso The presence of zzso light chain zzso zzso can hinder or even prevent determination of the sequence of functional zzso zzso light chain zzso amplified by zzso from zzso The method described here employs a panel of zzso zzso in the presence of zzso excess of a primer complementary to the complementary determining region zzso 3 of the known zzso chain zzso Analysis of the zzso products reveals two bands for some zzso one the functional, full-length zzso chain zzso zzso 400 zzso and another shorter zzso 100 zzso band corresponding to short zzso chain zzso zzso zzso The full-length product is gel zzso and cloned prior to sequencing and aligned with zzso zzso sequences available in zzso and zzso zzso This method is used routinely in our laboratory and demonstrates consistency and reliability for sequence determination of zzso light chain zzso zzso of zzso to diverse zzso This protocol is a rapid and convenient method for determining the sequence of zzso V zzso region genes from zzso expressing zzso zzso chain zzso
