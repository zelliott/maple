zzso of zzso initiation by zzso zzso II requires zzso a zzso complex composed of the zzso binding protein zzso and at least seven tightly associated factors zzso Some zzso act as direct targets or zzso for zzso zzso while others serve as zzso for zzso zzso Here, we report the molecular zzso expression and characterization of zzso zzso and its human zzso zzso zzso zzso binds zzso to zzso and tightly to the largest zzso of zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso and zzso a stable zzso complex is zzso Both the human and zzso proteins directly interact with another zzso zzso zzso Our findings reveal that zzso zzso and human zzso share a high degree of structural similarity and that their interactions with other zzso of zzso are zzso
