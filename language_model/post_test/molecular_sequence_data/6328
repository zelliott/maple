The expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was studied in 22 zzso zzso and 2 normal anterior zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso were expressed in all 14 zzso zzso 1 of 3 zzso zzso the 1 zzso zzso 2 of 4 zzso zzso and the 2 normal anterior zzso Their expression levels varied among zzso zzso and were relatively low in zzso zzso In addition to the major transcript with a molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso the transcripts were identified at zzso and zzso zzso in some zzso zzso To examine the structural variations in zzso zzso in zzso zzso we amplified the complementary DNA zzso encompassing the region from the third zzso loop to the sixth zzso domain of zzso This region was selected because this region of the G zzso zzso has been known to interact with G zzso Two amplified fragments with the molecular masses of 250 and 810 base pairs were identified by the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso sequence of a smaller fragment, which was the expected size, revealed that no zzso were found in this region in 10 zzso zzso zzso However, a larger zzso contained the currently unidentified zzso Compared with the zzso DNA zzso this zzso was found to be generated through alternative zzso In addition, this zzso form contained the premature stop zzso zzso indicating that it encodes the truncated zzso This zzso probe could zzso with zzso and zzso species of zzso zzso on Northern zzso analysis, and these transcripts were expressed mainly in zzso zzso Finally, study of cell zzso and zzso measurement revealed that this truncated zzso was unable to transmit zzso zzso These results suggest that some zzso zzso zzso express the truncated zzso as a zzso zzso through alternative zzso
