The zzso position of a zzso zzso designated strain zzso zzso isolated from activated sludge foam was determined by using a zzso zzso Based on its cellular zzso and the results of zzso tests, strain zzso zzso was identified tentatively as a member of the zzso zzso Comparative zzso zzso gene sequence analysis showed that levels of similarity between strain zzso zzso and the type strains of recognized zzso species ranged from zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso studies showed that strain zzso zzso displayed less than zzso % zzso to the type strains of recognized zzso zzso The zzso fingerprints revealed that strain zzso zzso was well separated from reference zzso zzso The combined zzso and zzso data indicate that strain zzso zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
