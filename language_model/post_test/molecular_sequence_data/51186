zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to study the effects of the bee zzso zzso zzso on aligned zzso of zzso zzso and zzso above the gel to zzso transition temperature, zzso Both zzso zzso from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the zzso zzso chain zzso groups indicate that the zzso does not affect the mosaic spread of the zzso molecules at zzso zzso ratios of zzso or zzso None of the samples prepared above zzso showed any evidence of the formation of zzso or zzso zzso zzso changes in the chemical shift zzso of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso groups, and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso show that the zzso has effects on the zzso order and on the molecular organization in the sections of the zzso chains nearest to the zzso zzso The zzso relaxation time for the zzso zzso chain zzso zzso was found to increase and the zzso zzso relaxation time to markedly decrease with the addition of zzso suggesting that motions on the zzso time scale are zzso whereas the zzso collective motions are enhanced in the presence of the zzso
