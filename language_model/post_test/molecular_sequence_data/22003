zzso initiation factor zzso and the functional zzso domain of zzso initiation factor zzso maintain the zzso of initiation zzso selection in zzso and zzso respectively, and bind to the same regions of small zzso zzso between the platform and zzso zzso Here we report that these zzso factors can bind to the same regions of zzso zzso and perform their functions in zzso systems in a zzso manner, discriminating against the formation of initiation complexes containing zzso zzso We also show that like zzso zzso can influence zzso zzso selection, which occurs at the stage of zzso zzso joining after zzso zzso of zzso zzso The mechanisms of initiation zzso and zzso zzso selection in zzso and zzso are therefore unexpectedly zzso and likely involve related zzso changes induced in the small zzso zzso by factor zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso could perform some of zzso functions, which justifies the possibility that zzso and zzso might have a common evolutionary origin as initiation factors, and that zzso functionally replaced zzso in zzso
