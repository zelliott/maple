Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso structures revealed several distinct elements that may perform partial functions of the zzso One such element, the zzso is formed by an zzso zzso segment of the zzso largest zzso zzso in bacterial zzso The zzso lid contacts the nascent zzso at the upstream edge of the zzso hybrid, where the zzso gets separated from the DNA zzso and zzso upstream DNA is zzso To test the zzso lid functions, we generated bacterial zzso lacking the lid and studied the zzso zzso properties in zzso Our results demonstrate that removal of the lid has minimal consequences on zzso zzso from zzso zzso On zzso DNA, the zzso zzso generates zzso transcripts that remain zzso to the DNA throughout their zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso produces short, zzso zzso transcripts that remain part of the zzso complex but cannot be further zzso The zzso of zzso is apparently triggered by a clash between the lid and the nascent zzso zzso zzso The results show that the zzso function is redundant in the presence of the zzso DNA zzso which alone can control the proper geometry of zzso acids at the upstream edge of the zzso zzso zzso considerations suggest that in the absence of the zzso strand and the zzso a new channel opens within the zzso zzso that allows continuous zzso hybrid to exit zzso
