zzso which encodes a small zzso zzso was recently identified as a gene in which zzso caused human zzso syndrome zzso zzso and zzso mice, which exhibit defects in zzso transport as well as in regulated zzso zzso in zzso T zzso However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of zzso membrane trafficking or the specific zzso molecules of zzso In this study, we discovered that the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso and zzso specifically and directly binds the zzso form of zzso both in zzso and in intact cells but not of the other zzso tested zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso (or zzso zzso with zzso in the zzso of melanoma zzso zzso and zzso were distributed to the periphery of the cells (especially at the zzso zzso in the zzso melanoma cells, whereas they accumulated in the zzso region in the zzso zzso cells zzso These results strongly indicated that the zzso of zzso and zzso functions as an in zzso zzso binding zzso
