Using a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso we have identified, zzso and characterized a novel zzso protein of the clawed zzso zzso zzso that is accumulated in the zzso of zzso and various other zzso This protein comprises zzso zzso zzso with a total molecular mass of 125 zzso and a zzso of zzso It is zzso by a zzso of approximately 4 zzso and zzso in addition to clusters of zzso zzso zzso two hallmark zzso the zzso part zzso seven consecutive zzso which are sequence motifs of about 40 zzso acids that are characteristic of a large group of regulatory proteins involved in diverse cellular functions, while the zzso terminal portion possesses a zzso zzso which is typical of a family of zzso proteins involved in regulation of zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso capability of the protein was demonstrated by DNA affinity zzso and zzso mobility shift zzso using zzso junction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso appears as an zzso probably a zzso and has been localized throughout the entire zzso space of the zzso zzso whereas during zzso it is zzso dispersed over the zzso We also identified a closely zzso perhaps zzso protein in zzso The unique features of protein zzso which is a zzso zzso combining properties of the zzso and the zzso families of zzso are discussed in relation to its possible nuclear zzso
