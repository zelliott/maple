The specific recognition by zzso coli zzso zzso zzso of zzso is zzso by extensive zzso contacts and changes in the zzso of zzso when zzso with zzso In zzso accuracy of zzso depends on two factors: competition between zzso and the context and recognition of identity elements in the zzso The structure of the zzso complex supports studies from amber and zzso zzso zzso zzso by in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso that the zzso identity elements are located in the zzso and zzso stem of zzso zzso of individual functional groups in zzso for example the zzso group of zzso is also evident from the result with zzso zzso Communication between zzso and zzso stem recognition is indicated by zzso in zzso isolated by genetic selection with zzso zzso zzso which are altered in interactions with the inside of the L-shaped zzso We have also used genetic selection to obtain zzso of zzso altered in zzso stem recognition with relaxed specificity for amber zzso zzso and a more extensive zzso analysis shows the importance of the zzso binding domain to accurate recognition of zzso
