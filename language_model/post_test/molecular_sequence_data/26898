To screen and identify the serum zzso of zzso dysfunctional zzso bleeding zzso to determine the expression of zzso protein in zzso of zzso patients, and to investigate the relation between zzso and the zzso zzso 

zzso included 128 zzso patients and 93 zzso zzso zzso Their serum and zzso of zzso were collected and stored for use at zzso zzso The differential proteins in the serum of the 2 groups were detected by zzso and analyzed by zzso Wizard zzso zzso Then, the differential proteins were identified by zzso gel zzso zzso zzso and zzso The expression of the protein identified above in the zzso was tested by zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso was applied for statistical analysis and chart zzso 

Five differential protein zzso were screened and their peak values were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The intensity of protein peak zzso zzso which was identified as serum zzso protein A zzso of zzso was significantly higher than that of the controls zzso While the intensity of protein peak zzso zzso ) which was identified as vascular zzso growth factor zzso of zzso was obviously lower than that of the controls zzso The intensity of protein peak zzso zzso and zzso was not different between the cases and zzso zzso expressed highly in the zzso of zzso but low in that of the zzso zzso zzso expressed highly in the zzso of the control but low in that of the zzso 

Two zzso which might be related with zzso have been correctly screened and identified as zzso and zzso It needs further study whether the increased expression of zzso and reduced expression of zzso are the cause or result of zzso
