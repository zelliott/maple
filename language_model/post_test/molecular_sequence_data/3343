zzso zzso is a versatile and dangerous pathogen and one of the major causes of zzso and zzso zzso The rise of zzso strains of zzso zzso requires the development of new antibiotics with previously zzso mechanisms of action, such as zzso of the zzso carrier protein zzso zzso III zzso This zzso zzso fatty acid zzso in a bacterial type II fatty acid zzso catalyzing a zzso zzso between zzso and an zzso zzso A zzso zzso and is essential for zzso We have identified only one zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso and have shown that it encodes a protein with 57, 40, and zzso zzso acid sequence identity with the zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso coli zzso and zzso tuberculosis zzso Additional zzso sequence analysis revealed that this zzso zzso zzso zzso is not zzso in certain zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli with an zzso zzso tag and subsequently zzso by metal zzso and size exclusion zzso Analysis by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso revealed a molecular mass of 37 zzso while gel zzso demonstrated a mass of zzso zzso suggesting a zzso zzso structure for zzso The apparent zzso for zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was active with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso inhibited by zzso zzso zzso concentration zzso zzso zzso yet was efficiently inhibited by two new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
