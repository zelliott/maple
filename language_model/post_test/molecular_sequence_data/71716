The zzso acid zzso zzso has previously been described as having potent zzso activity, and zzso efficacy against zzso B and human zzso in zzso Although the exact mechanism of zzso activity was unknown, it was zzso that the zzso zzso inhibited zzso by interfering with one or more of the zzso processes of reverse transcription, integration, and/or viral gene zzso We performed a series of experiments to identify and characterize the zzso zzso and to determine whether zzso expression of the zzso zzso would zzso its zzso efficacy in zzso Surprisingly, our results revealed that the zzso activity of the zzso zzso could be explained without implicating zzso zzso of zzso zzso The activity appeared to be due to an extraordinary capacity of the zzso zzso to zzso viral and zzso proteins in zzso The zzso capacity of the zzso zzso was sequence specific and a scrambled version of the zzso acid zzso did not retain the zzso Although the unusual zzso properties of the zzso zzso probably zzso a number of potential therapeutic applications, they do merit further zzso Moreover, these findings provide a plausible explanation of the mechanism by which the zzso zzso can inhibit replication of viruses from families as genetically and functionally diverse as zzso zzso and zzso
