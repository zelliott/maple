Diversity of bacterial zzso associated with zzso leaf zzso was analyzed by zzso and zzso zzso In order to identify bacterial zzso directly from zzso a protocol for bacteria enrichment and DNA extraction was zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene libraries underscored five diverse zzso zzso Units zzso showing best sequence matches with zzso family zzso with a dominance of the zzso zzso zzso isolation through zzso revealed the presence of six zzso showing best sequence matches with zzso zzso zzso and with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from single bacterial clones were used to setup a database representing the bacterial zzso identified in association with zzso zzso Analysis of healthy and zzso zzso plants showed that zzso could be a useful complementary tool for examining the diversity of bacterial zzso especially for diversity survey on a large number of zzso
