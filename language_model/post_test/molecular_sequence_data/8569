In recent years, remarkable progress has been made in the zzso of cereal protein structure and its relation to zzso zzso zzso proteins of wheat can be classified according to their primary structure into zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Each of these groups contains two or three different protein types having partly zzso partly unique, structural zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso group), omega 5 and omega zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Numerous proteins from the same type do exist with only a few modifications of the zzso zzso The structure of the zzso and zzso group proteins can be divided into three and five zzso zzso Most typical for each type and unique for zzso are the zzso and zzso zzso containing repetitive sequences zzso group: domain zzso zzso group: domain zzso zzso zzso consist almost entirely of repetitive zzso Rye and zzso closely related to zzso have protein types zzso to those of zzso Early investigations showed that wheat zzso and, in particular, the zzso zzso fraction contained the factor toxic for zzso zzso zzso protein zzso of zzso barley and probably zzso were also considered to be zzso The effects of toxic proteins were not destroyed by zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso testing established the toxicity of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso testing of zzso peptides demonstrated that the zzso region zzso I) of zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso The longest sequences common for toxic peptides were found to be zzso and zzso Various zzso tests and two zzso studies on synthetic peptides support the importance of one or both of these zzso They do not occur in zzso food proteins and are characterized by their ability to form a zzso zzso Although these sequences are probably not sufficient for toxicity in themselves, and other zzso zzso are additionally required, they could serve as the starting point for further zzso
