We have used the zzso method to isolate zzso zzso that bind with high affinity to zzso zzso zzso an important zzso zzso Two random libraries, each zzso approximately zzso random zzso were transcribed into zzso and translated in zzso zzso were panned by affinity selection of the nascent peptides against immobilized zzso Over zzso of the selected species had significant affinity for zzso the zzso constant of the complex formed by the best isolate with zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso of selected peptides improved their affinities and, in one case, virtually eliminated zzso zzso The zzso method can be used to produce zzso zzso zzso of potential use in diagnostic and therapeutic zzso
