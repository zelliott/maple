The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso suggests evasion of the zzso response against zzso Two important features of this tumor have been previously suggested to explain this immune zzso zzso zzso expression of cellular zzso molecules and zzso restricted expression of zzso zzso zzso To determine the relative importance of these features in relation to evasion of zzso zzso a group of zzso cell lines with variable expression of the aforementioned zzso characteristics were zzso for specific zzso zzso after zzso addition of zzso zzso zzso In spite of zzso expression of the zzso molecules zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso cells were recognized and zzso by zzso zzso Moreover, there was no significant difference between the zzso zzso of the zzso cells and that of zzso zzso control cells over a wide range of zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso to individual zzso molecules suggested that zzso zzso recognition of zzso cell lines was dependent on an intact zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso recognition of zzso zzso cells was critically dependent on the zzso pathway, with an insignificant contribution by zzso The consistently high expression of zzso on all zzso cell lines suggests that the accessory function in zzso recognition of these cells is zzso by the zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso zzso and/or zzso expression on zzso cells does not provide an absolute barrier to tumor cell recognition by zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso to recognize zzso zzso zzso cells as efficiently as normal cells has demonstrated the importance of zzso zzso expression in the zzso control of zzso zzso
