We used the surface protein expression zzso system to express an anchored and a zzso form of zzso zzso A zzso from zzso zzso zzso is a small ( approximately 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso A deletion of zzso acids zzso causes zzso zzso to form zzso The DNA sequence zzso either zzso or deletion zzso zzso was cloned via zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso strains expressing either anchored or zzso zzso or zzso zzso were isolated and tested for zzso activity using a novel zzso zzso zzso We show that active zzso and zzso zzso zzso can be expressed either anchored on the cell surface or zzso into the culture zzso The activity of the zzso zzso was approximately zzso less than the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso migrated on zzso gels at approximately 18 or approximately 30 zzso zzso In addition, similar to zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was dependent on zzso and was heat zzso In contrast, however, the zzso zzso activity was zzso at pH zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso was zzso at pH zzso These results show, for the first time, expression of active zzso and zzso protein in zzso and anchored forms using zzso This further demonstrates the utility of this zzso surface protein expression system as a potential zzso bacterial delivery system for active, therapeutic zzso zzso or zzso
