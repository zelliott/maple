The zzso family zzso contains both the research model zzso zzso zzso and the agricultural zzso zzso Comparative zzso in the zzso has largely focused on direct comparisons between zzso and the species of zzso However, the reduced zzso size and zzso number zzso zzso 5) of zzso zzso zzso zzso shows extensive zzso and zzso zzso compared to its close relatives zzso zzso and zzso zzso both with zzso zzso zzso To facilitate comparative zzso across the zzso we recently outlined a system of 24 zzso zzso blocks based on their positions in an ancestral zzso of zzso zzso 8, rather than by their position in zzso In this report we use this system as a tool to understand zzso structure and evolution in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and highly zzso species occurring in mostly zzso regions of western North zzso We have created an zzso genetic map of zzso zzso based on 192 individuals scored at 196 zzso and candidate gene zzso zzso zzso zzso of 94 of the zzso was done simultaneously using an zzso zzso zzso The total map length is zzso zzso with an average marker spacing of zzso zzso There are no gaps greater than zzso zzso The zzso reduction from zzso zzso 8 to zzso zzso 7 and other zzso changes in zzso zzso likely involved a zzso zzso a zzso fusion, and two zzso zzso that are easily zzso using the zzso zzso Our genetic map will facilitate the analysis of ecologically relevant quantitative variation in zzso zzso data from this article can be found in the zzso data libraries under zzso numbers zzso zzso to zzso zzso
