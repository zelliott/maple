In the present study we sought to identify genetic variation in the zzso zzso gene which through zzso of protein function or level of expression might contribute to the genetic predisposition to zzso zzso zzso DNA samples from 159 unrelated subjects (including 45 zzso 46 bipolar zzso and 43 patients with Tourette's syndrome, as well as 25 healthy zzso were investigated by zzso zzso zzso Overlapping zzso zzso chain zzso fragments covered the whole coding sequence as well as the zzso untranslated region of the zzso zzso The region upstream to the coding sequence we investigated contains a functional zzso We found two rare zzso sequence zzso Both zzso are located in the coding region of the zzso a coding zzso zzso in zzso position 82 which leads to an zzso acid exchange zzso in position 28 of the zzso protein and a silent zzso zzso in zzso position zzso The occurrence of the zzso substitution was studied in an extended sample of patients zzso zzso zzso and controls zzso zzso zzso but was found in similar zzso in all zzso Thus, this zzso is unlikely to play a significant role in the genetic predisposition to the diseases zzso In conclusion, our study does not provide evidence that the zzso gene plays either a major or a minor role in the genetic predisposition to zzso bipolar affective disorder, or Tourette's zzso
