Various zzso changes may be present in zzso in which also cellular zzso may often be zzso zzso zzso and zzso changes zzso occur in both zzso and zzso zzso This may cause confusion in the zzso This study was zzso to investigate the possible help of zzso and zzso study in the diagnostic and zzso assessment of zzso zzso In zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso A, the material consists of 40 cases of zzso zzso examined by direct sampling of the zzso cavity zzso 30 cases of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso breakdown zzso and 10 cases of zzso zzso zzso After zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso A was performed on multiple zzso slides from each single case to evaluate the zzso intensity of nuclear zzso and nuclear labeling index zzso The intensity of nuclear zzso was scored as negative zzso weak zzso moderate zzso or strong zzso and the zzso was scored as less than zzso zzso from zzso to zzso zzso from zzso to 50% zzso or more than 50% zzso and the final score was calculated by adding both partial zzso A statistical significance test was performed by using zzso U test, and the result was judged as significant when the P value was less than zzso For genetic zzso analysis of zzso the material comprised 6 cases of zzso in which a high score was measured with zzso for zzso zzso and the presence of zzso was confirmed on the zzso and zzso The zzso cells on zzso specimens were captured using laser capture zzso zzso zzso in zzso gene zzso zzso were examined using DNA sequencing zzso In zzso for zzso zzso zzso and zzso A, the proportions of zzso cells for zzso were statistically higher in zzso compared with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso The proportions of the zzso cells for zzso and zzso A were statistically higher in zzso compared with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In genetic zzso analysis of zzso DNA sequencing of zzso in 6 cases revealed no zzso The percentage of zzso cells for zzso protein were higher in zzso than in zzso but the zzso point was not confirmed in genetic zzso zzso The differential expression of these zzso parameters in zzso cells could be considered of possible relevance to the zzso diagnosis in the zzso
