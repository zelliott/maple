The zzso regions zzso of the three zzso of alfalfa mosaic virus zzso contain a specific binding site for coat protein zzso and act as a promoter for zzso zzso synthesis by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso of zzso to the viral zzso is required to initiate zzso The sequence of the zzso 39 zzso of zzso zzso 3 can be folded into two zzso structures flanked by three zzso zzso sequences and represents a zzso binding zzso zzso in this sequence that are known to interfere with zzso binding in zzso were introduced into an infectious clone of zzso 3, and zzso zzso transcripts were used as templates in the in zzso zzso zzso and to zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso motif 2 or disruption of the stem of the zzso hairpin 1 zzso with zzso binding in zzso but not with zzso promoter activity in zzso or replication of zzso 3 in zzso However, hairpin 1 appeared to be essential for zzso of zzso zzso zzso of three zzso base pairs in hairpin 1 had no effect on zzso binding but zzso with zzso promoter activity in zzso and with zzso 3 replication in zzso It is concluded that the viral zzso and zzso recognize different elements in the zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, several zzso that zzso with zzso binding in zzso zzso with the zzso in zzso of zzso 4, the zzso zzso for zzso but not with the zzso of zzso zzso
