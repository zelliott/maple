From a large series of experiments involving transfer of high molecular weight total zzso DNA from highly zzso human and mouse zzso cell lines to other mouse zzso cell lines we have derived a few cell lines with greatly zzso zzso zzso In one of these experiments the zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso not only zzso the lungs but also formed secondary zzso colonies in several zzso sites including the skin, skeletal muscles, bone, liver zzso zzso and zzso There were no qualitative and quantitative effects of this magnitude when we used DNA from several zzso or zzso zzso Secondary zzso of zzso capability with DNA obtained from a zzso formed by one of the primary zzso lines zzso zzso has also been zzso zzso transfer of human DNA through both zzso cycles in this experiment was confirmed by a variety of methods including Southern zzso analysis, in zzso zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of DNA using zzso zzso zzso zzso repeat zzso The findings offer opportunities for the isolation of sequences programming zzso zzso and we have cloned and zzso a zzso of human DNA, which has not been previously zzso from the zzso zzso
