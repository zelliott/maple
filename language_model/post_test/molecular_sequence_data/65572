zzso is an important component of the zzso signal zzso pathway, the zzso involved in the initiation of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies showed that zzso of zzso zzso has evolved from zzso zzso During the course of evolution, zzso has retained the characteristic zzso zzso boxes zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and has acquired zzso zzso Walker A and Walker B, of zzso zzso to the presence of these zzso zzso and zzso activity was observed in zzso of zzso zzso zzso studies showed that among the six zzso zzso zzso of the zzso is involved in the zzso activity of zzso whereas zzso of the Walker A domain is associated with the zzso activity of the zzso zzso and binding studies of the binding of zzso to zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested that the binding is driven by favorable zzso changes and that the reaction is zzso with an apparent zzso constant zzso equal to zzso zzso The value of the zzso constant zzso zzso zzso zzso determined by the intrinsic zzso of zzso of zzso was similar to that obtained by zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso also showed zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso transfer from zzso zzso to zzso zzso This is the first evidence for zzso of zzso zzso as an zzso with zzso zzso and zzso activities, which may have important roles to play in zzso and zzso
