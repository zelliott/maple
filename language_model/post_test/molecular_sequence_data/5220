zzso proteins and most membrane proteins are zzso with a signal sequence that is usually zzso from the nascent zzso during transport into the zzso of the zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we have followed the fate of the signal sequence of zzso in a zzso zzso This signal sequence has an unusually long zzso zzso containing several positively charged zzso acid zzso We found that after zzso by signal zzso the signal sequence is in contact with lipids and zzso of the signal zzso zzso The zzso signal sequence is processed further and an zzso zzso is released into the zzso This signal zzso zzso was found to interact efficiently with zzso Similar to zzso the signal sequence of the zzso envelope protein zzso has the characteristic feature for zzso binding in its zzso We found that a signal zzso zzso of zzso was released into the zzso and interacts with zzso Our results suggest that signal zzso fragments of some cellular and viral proteins can interact with zzso target zzso The functional consequences of such interactions remain to be zzso However, our data suggest that signal sequences may be functionally more versatile than anticipated up to zzso
