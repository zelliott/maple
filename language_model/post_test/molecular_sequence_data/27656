The genes for two new zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been identified in zzso A comparison of the deduced sequences of the zzso proteins with other known zzso pumps showed that both proteins are very similar to zzso zzso zzso is identical to zzso a gene previously identified by its effect on zzso of some foreign proteins from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso lack the outer chain zzso that normally results from passage through the zzso Loss of zzso function suppresses the zzso of zzso a zzso that blocks the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso functions as a zzso pump affecting transit through the zzso zzso
