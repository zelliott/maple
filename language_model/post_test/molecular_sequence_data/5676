The I zzso alpha protein is a key molecular target involved in the control of zzso zzso factors during viral infection or inflammatory zzso This zzso factor is regulated by zzso zzso and zzso of its zzso signal response domain that targets I zzso alpha for rapid zzso by the zzso zzso In an attempt to identify regulators of the I zzso alpha zzso activity, we undertook a zzso zzso genetic screen, using the zzso end of I zzso alpha as zzso and identified 12 independent interacting zzso zzso analysis identified some of these zzso clones as zzso a sequence zzso a small, zzso human zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso zzso also zzso with full-length I zzso alpha protein but not with zzso versions of I zzso zzso I zzso alpha zzso in zzso with a zzso zzso fusion zzso and zzso did not zzso this association, demonstrating that zzso and zzso contact different protein motifs of I zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells, zzso and zzso I zzso alpha zzso with zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso analyzed by zzso zzso indicated that zzso and I zzso alpha zzso with both nuclear and zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and I zzso alpha were found to associate with the zzso organizing center, a zzso region from which zzso zzso Likewise, I zzso alpha zzso with zzso zzso Taken together, these results highlight an intriguing interaction between the I zzso alpha protein and the human zzso of a member of the zzso family of motor proteins and provide a potential link between zzso dynamics and gene zzso
