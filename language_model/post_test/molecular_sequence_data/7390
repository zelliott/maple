zzso zzso zzso is a common genetic disorder caused by zzso of the zzso zzso In the present study, we investigated four Japanese FH zzso and identified five point zzso a zzso site zzso in zzso 12 (the zzso + 2 zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso 7 (the zzso zzso a nonsense zzso in zzso 17 (the zzso zzso a zzso zzso in zzso 14 (the zzso zzso and a zzso zzso in zzso 4 (the zzso zzso We developed simple methods for detecting these zzso When we examined the presence of these zzso in 24 unrelated FH zzso the zzso + 2 zzso zzso was found in 7 of them, and the other four zzso were unique for each zzso We also screened 120 unrelated FH zzso for these zzso and found that the zzso of the zzso + 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These zzso were found in more than zzso of unrelated Japanese FH zzso By using the detection methods developed in this study, the diagnosis of more than zzso of the genetic bases of Japanese FH zzso is zzso
