Aurora B is an important regulator of zzso and its zzso and protein levels are tightly regulated during the cell zzso In this study, we cloned the zzso zzso region of the human aurora B gene and characterized its promoter zzso Two major zzso initiation sites were identified by primer zzso aurora B promoter activity was zzso during M phase, and its cell zzso element zzso and cell zzso zzso region zzso upstream of the zzso initiation sites regulated the cell zzso promoter zzso Several zzso protein complexes were identified using the zzso mobility shift zzso Using the zzso pull-down zzso binding of zzso zzso and zzso but not of zzso to the zzso was zzso These results demonstrate that aurora B zzso level is regulated by zzso and that a subset of zzso family proteins binds to the zzso
