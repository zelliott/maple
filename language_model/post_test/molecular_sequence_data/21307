Human zzso zzso is the main zzso agent of cervical cancer, particularly high risk strains such us zzso zzso and zzso The viral zzso zzso protein acts as a zzso zzso and exerts a key role in viral DNA zzso Thus, zzso constitutes an attractive target for developing zzso zzso zzso is a zzso protein that interacts with the DNA target through an zzso of each zzso However, a zzso corresponding to the DNA recognition zzso of zzso zzso binds DNA with lower affinity than its full-length DNA binding zzso zzso in an attempt to promote the DNA binding of the isolated zzso we have designed a zzso compound of the zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of the zzso zzso which involves simultaneous zzso and zzso zzso 

An zzso zzso zzso zzso was designed and zzso It was characterized by zzso and CD zzso and its DNA binding properties were investigated by CD, DNA melting and gel shift zzso The zzso of zzso zzso with zzso does not affect its structural zzso The zzso improves significantly the affinity of the zzso for specific zzso In addition, zzso amounts of specific DNA increase zzso the zzso population of the zzso The zzso enhances the DNA binding constant zzso maintaining its zzso 

These results demonstrate that zzso zzso are a promising tool to obtain compounds that bind the zzso target zzso with remarkable affinity and suggest that a zzso zzso groove binding scaffold can be a useful approach for therapeutic treatment of zzso zzso
