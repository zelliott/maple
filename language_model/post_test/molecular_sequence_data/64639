The zzso zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso zzso exists with zzso zzso equivalent to zzso zzso zzso in a predominantly zzso zzso Thus, unlike the zzso zzso the primary regulation of zzso may occur at a different step from zzso 231 zzso Although zzso expressed zzso bound zzso element sites, protein from zzso extracts was unable to do so unless treated with zzso zzso of zzso protein by zzso zzso zzso I or II, but not zzso zzso II or protein zzso A, inhibited DNA zzso Up to four zzso zzso sites likely to be zzso in zzso were responsible for this effect, and these sites were zzso by a zzso present in zzso cell extracts that zzso resembles zzso We propose that the relative importance of different signaling pathways in regulating zzso activity may differ between zzso and zzso In zzso the zzso of zzso sites appears to be the major regulatory step, while zzso of zzso 231 is necessary but zzso
