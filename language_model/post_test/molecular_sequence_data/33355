Currently, clinical and experimental evidence point to an essential role of zzso and zzso receptors in male zzso The expression of zzso zzso alpha zzso and beta zzso in human zzso has been zzso However, some studies were unable to detect zzso while others report the expression of both zzso with zzso presenting a wide distribution within zzso and zzso zzso zzso This has suggested that zzso may exert their zzso effects exclusively through zzso The present work aims to study the expression of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso of men with zzso and disrupted zzso in order to better clarify the positive cell zzso Human zzso tissue was obtained from 10 men undergoing zzso biopsy for zzso relief due to zzso two patients had secondary zzso zzso with zzso zzso five had zzso zzso syndrome, two had zzso and one had zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso allowed the detection of both zzso and zzso zzso in all zzso zzso revealed that zzso was present in zzso cells, zzso cells, zzso zzso round zzso and zzso zzso while zzso was present in the same cell types except zzso and zzso zzso This study demonstrates zzso zzso expression in human zzso and describes its zzso in zzso and germ cell zzso These findings suggest that both zzso zzso are involved in the control of zzso zzso
