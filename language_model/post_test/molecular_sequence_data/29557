The zzso hormone zzso belongs to a zzso family zzso and released in a zzso complex of zzso zzso The zzso is involved in zzso maturation and plays a more complex role in the control of reproduction and zzso With a combination of reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and rapid amplification of zzso ends approaches we determined the zzso sequence of the Norway lobster zzso zzso zzso zzso The open reading frame of 339 zzso codes for a zzso of 112 zzso acids showing zzso identity with the other known zzso of zzso zzso The precursor zzso consists of a putative signal zzso of 31 zzso acids and a putative mature zzso region of zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso zzso is expressed mainly in zzso both in female and zzso the expression of zzso zzso also in zzso zzso suggests the existence of additional zzso zzso besides those of zzso A specific zzso zzso was raised against a portion of the mature zzso region obtained through expression in zzso coli fused to zzso zzso studies were carried out by using this zzso in zzso zzso and in other zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso these locate zzso in superficial zzso terminals of the releasing organ, the zzso zzso The identification of a second zzso sequence in crustaceans allows to zzso the zzso within the zzso family, of three zzso probably involved in different zzso zzso zzso hormones, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
