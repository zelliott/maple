zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso in the zzso zzso cell line zzso increases the expression of surface zzso and zzso the response to other zzso such as zzso or zzso In the present study we investigated whether zzso B zzso was related to the zzso zzso zzso In a gel shift zzso our results confirmed that zzso but not zzso an zzso zzso could induce a zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso The zzso or zzso induced zzso B binding activity was increased in the presence of zzso but not of zzso A zzso of the cell line called zzso defective in zzso B zzso by zzso did not respond to zzso The enhanced surface zzso expression induced in the wild type zzso cells by zzso alone or combined to zzso zzso or zzso gamma was not obtained in this zzso The ability of various treatments to activate the zzso gene zzso was zzso evaluated in cells zzso with a zzso expression zzso Treatment of zzso zzso cells with zzso resulted in a zzso enhancement of zzso activity, an additive effect to that induced by zzso or zzso Treatment of the defective zzso zzso with the same construct did not result in zzso expression after stimulation with the various zzso The transient zzso zzso were used to compare the effectiveness of some zzso zzso Two zzso compounds unable to enhance zzso light chain expression did not increase the zzso response in the zzso zzso cells, indicating that zzso B zzso was not related to the zzso potency of zzso but correlated with the zzso zzso
