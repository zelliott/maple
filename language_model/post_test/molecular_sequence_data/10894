The zzso sequences of the zzso zzso in 17 strains of 16 zzso of the zzso zzso were zzso The sequences were compared zzso together with the gene sequences of 10 (including 7 other zzso zzso species retrieved from the DNA Data Bank of zzso Although the primary and secondary structures of most of zzso species were very similar zzso values zzso or more) except for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values zzso or zzso the 23 zzso species were divided into 10 groups based on zzso evolutionary distance and zzso tree zzso zzso stretches in several variable zzso in the zzso zzso sequences appeared to be specific for the bacterial groups or the zzso By comparing such characteristics in the sequence and zzso of 5 zzso clinical zzso from bovine zzso canine and zzso zzso and zzso zzso syndrome with the information obtained in this study, the species level of each zzso was zzso
