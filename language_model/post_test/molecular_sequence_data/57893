zzso bearing the gamma delta form of the zzso make up only zzso of T cells in the adult zzso zzso and peripheral zzso zzso Evidence from studies of nude mice suggests that the development of at least some gamma delta T cells is zzso zzso however, until now it has not been directly demonstrated that gamma delta cells are exported from the zzso In this paper we have used the technique of zzso zzso in zzso with zzso followed by flow zzso analysis to trace cells zzso from the zzso to the zzso Using this approach we have been able to demonstrate for the first time that gamma delta T cells are exported from the adult zzso zzso to the zzso We also demonstrate that the cells zzso to the zzso are a selected subset of gamma delta zzso being heat stable zzso positive, zzso and expressing low levels of zzso zzso In addition, investigation of zzso V gamma gene usage among adult gamma delta + zzso recent zzso and zzso cells, indicated a selective zzso of gamma delta cells expressing certain V gamma zzso
