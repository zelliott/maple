zzso and zzso evolve in zzso restricted to zzso We describe four new species in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso whose evolution has entailed zzso shifts in body zzso We zzso that zzso of zzso resulted in zzso and zzso in habitat islands fragmented across eastern and southern zzso zzso and nuclear DNA sequences recovered two zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which are zzso with respect to a third lineage zzso zzso zzso differ by zzso to zzso in zzso b zzso zzso 1 includes zzso zzso zzso zzso from the east African zzso and three additional zzso that zzso across an zzso zzso through the zzso extending from the Kenyan zzso through the Eastern zzso northern zzso and the zzso zzso to the eastern Great zzso of South zzso zzso 2 comprises one species confined to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso A third zzso comprises zzso zzso from East zzso zzso within zzso 1 is associated with fixed differences in zzso call frequency, and zzso shape and size in populations isolated since the late zzso zzso zzso zzso Relative to the zzso zzso population zzso zzso these zzso within zzso 1 are zzso by either zzso (South African eastern Great zzso and zzso zzso and zzso in zzso or zzso zzso zzso Zimbabwe and zzso zzso South zzso zzso between divergent zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2) at zzso Gorge zzso zzso is attributed to recent range zzso We propose an zzso zzso zzso which attributes the evolution of this species complex of bats to divergence in constant frequency zzso zzso zzso The origin of zzso peak zzso zzso range zzso 32 to 46 zzso represents the zzso effect of zzso divergence in skull size, represented in the evolution of zzso and zzso in habitat zzso
