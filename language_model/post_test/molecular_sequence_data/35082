zzso in trio zzso elements are composed of three adjacent zzso based zzso zzso that commonly occur in bacterial zzso In this study, we examine zzso elements found in the zzso of strains from 63 different zzso across 7 zzso of zzso and examine the specific organization of these zzso their zzso and environmental distribution, and their potential for zzso We have found that each zzso in this zzso arrangement is associated with a distinct zzso of the zzso zzso and that the order and orientation of these zzso is consistently zzso We have determined that the distribution of these elements suggests that they are an ancient feature of bacterial zzso but identical copies found within individual strains indicates that they are capable of zzso zzso The occurrence of identical elements on both the main zzso and one or more plasmids within individual zzso coupled with the finding that in some cases related zzso are carrying highly similar zzso elements indicates that horizontal transfer has in some cases proceeded through a zzso zzso
