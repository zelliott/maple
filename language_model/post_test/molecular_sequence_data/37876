We have developed a procedure to predict the zzso binding specificity of an zzso domain from its zzso The procedure zzso information extracted from zzso contacts derived from six zzso or zzso complexes of known zzso The framework of zzso contacts defined on the structure of the complexes is used to build a zzso interaction database derived from zzso obtained by panning zzso libraries displayed on zzso zzso The zzso interaction database is a zzso array containing zzso of zzso zzso As zzso zzso requires the sequence of an zzso domain and of a query zzso zzso The zzso that we call the zzso zzso is then used to evaluate the probability that the zzso would bind the given zzso zzso This procedure is fast enough to be applied to the entire protein sequence zzso zzso experiments were performed to search putative specific zzso of different zzso zzso in a database of zzso or in a database of protein zzso The procedure ranked some of the natural partners of interaction of a number of zzso zzso among the best zzso of the approximately zzso zzso different zzso in the zzso zzso We expect the zzso power of the method to increase with the enrichment of the zzso zzso by interaction data derived from new complex structures or from the characterization of new zzso The procedure was developed using the zzso domain family as test case but its application can easily be extended to other families of protein zzso (such as, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
