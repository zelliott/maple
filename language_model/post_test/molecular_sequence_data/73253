Our rapid method of zzso zzso for preparing zzso from their parent zzso was also able to prepare zzso or modified zzso which were identified by delayed extraction zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso zzso and zzso isolated from adult human brain zzso were subjected to the zzso zzso was found to give rise to only zzso containing zzso acid zzso zzso whereas the zzso produced both zzso and the zzso compound, and zzso also gave both zzso and the zzso zzso In the zzso of zzso and zzso isolated from rat brain zzso zzso similarly produced both zzso and the zzso compound, but zzso was found to give rise to both dehydrated zzso and dehydrated zzso zzso However, the zzso of the zzso fraction isolated from zzso brain zzso gave rise not only to both zzso and the zzso compound, but also unexpectedly to both zzso zzso and its zzso zzso The zzso zzso fraction was examined by TLC and DE zzso mass zzso and proved to contain zzso The DE zzso zzso analysis of the prepared zzso showed that their long chain bases consisted of zzso and zzso zzso in various ratios reflecting those of the different zzso brain zzso
