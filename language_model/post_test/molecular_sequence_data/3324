zzso of barley zzso zzso B zzso in zzso zzso was studied with zzso in zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso The inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso first detected in zzso cells, was zzso processed in a zzso manner to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso and thereafter, to zzso of zzso zzso and 32 zzso exhibiting zzso activity both in the zzso and culture zzso The sizes of the different forms of zzso zzso were in accordance with molecular masses calculated from the deduced zzso acid zzso assuming zzso at four putative zzso sites present in the zzso zzso Both the liquid and the zzso zzso activity zzso indicated that the zzso zzso produced in zzso zzso in zzso was 2 zzso larger and four times less active than the zzso zzso zzso A treatment prevented the last zzso processing step of zzso from a zzso to a zzso zzso This coincided with a significant increase in the zzso label for zzso and in modified zzso bodies, which suggests that the processing step probably took place in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso was observed when zzso was inhibited by zzso zzso or when zzso was carried out zzso zzso increased the zzso activity zzso which was also indicated by an increased zzso by TM treatment in the zzso zzso activity zzso zzso incubation with TM and zzso produced a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso may inhibit the final processing step of an zzso zzso by an unknown zzso in the zzso In any case, the final zzso zzso product in zzso differs from the mature zzso zzso zzso produced in zzso
