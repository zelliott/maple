A novel isolate of infectious zzso disease virus zzso was designated zzso The zzso zzso was a very virulent infectious zzso disease virus zzso isolated from broiler flocks in zzso province, China, in zzso The zzso zzso caused high zzso zzso low weight gain, and zzso zzso in commercial zzso Here, we report the complete zzso sequence of the zzso zzso a zzso strain with segments A and B derived from very virulent strains and attenuated zzso zzso These findings from this study provide additional insights into the genetic exchange between attenuated and very virulent strains of zzso and continuous monitoring of the spread of the virus in zzso
