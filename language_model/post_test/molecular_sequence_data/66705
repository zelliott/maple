zzso zzso and zzso zzso are closely related zzso box genes that are partially redundant during zzso zzso floral zzso zzso zzso is able to fully substitute for zzso functions, but not vice versa, and zzso has unique zzso and zzso identity zzso zzso In this study, the unique and redundant functions of these two genes has been mapped to the four protein zzso that characterize zzso zzso proteins by expressing all 15 zzso combinations of zzso and zzso zzso regions under control of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso function of these zzso genes was zzso in zzso plants by expressing the zzso zzso of flower zzso and zzso identities was scored in single and multiple insert zzso transgenic zzso Using these zzso lines, it was found that distinct zzso of the zzso K domain not shared by the same zzso domain are necessary and sufficient for complete recovery of floral zzso identity, in the context of the zzso protein zzso while both zzso zzso and K zzso are indispensable for complete rescue of zzso zzso By contrast, either one of these two zzso zzso is necessary and sufficient for complete zzso identity zzso It was also found that there were positive and negative synergies among protein zzso and their combinations, and that zzso lines showed relatively better rescue than equivalent zzso zzso Finally, several lines had flowers with extra zzso and petals suggesting that zzso proteins yield abnormal zzso complexes that may alter the expression or regulation of genes that control floral organ number under normal zzso
