zzso cell zzso has been reported to be modulated by transforming growth zzso zzso zzso and its zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth factor zzso In this report, we studied whether zzso alpha or zzso zzso is produced by zzso cells, examined the zzso effects of zzso alpha or zzso on zzso cell cultures, and measured the changes in zzso cell zzso production in cells cultured with zzso alpha or zzso zzso from fresh zzso cells and from those incubated overnight and for 4, 7, and 10 days with zzso was studied with reverse zzso chain reaction for zzso alpha and for zzso Only zzso alpha zzso appeared to be present in the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the combination of zzso plus zzso alpha or zzso resulted in cell shape changes and an increase in zzso droplets in the zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso zzso increased in the zzso cells incubated with either zzso or zzso plus zzso zzso of zzso cells incubated with growth factors possessed zzso features consistent with those found in zzso zzso zzso Culture of the zzso cells with zzso plus zzso alpha or with zzso plus zzso resulted in significantly elevated zzso and 20 zzso zzso The highest level of zzso production was on the eighth day of zzso We conclude that zzso alpha zzso is produced by zzso cells and that zzso cell zzso as defined by zzso and zzso criteria, is significantly zzso in zzso by the combination of zzso and zzso zzso
