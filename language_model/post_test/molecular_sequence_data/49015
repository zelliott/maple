The generation and stabilization of spontaneous zzso are affected by many factors, including the accuracy of DNA zzso the generation of spontaneous DNA zzso and the capacity of zzso zzso However, little is known about the causes of spontaneous zzso in cells with fully active zzso zzso Using the zzso forward zzso zzso we previously found that the zzso of replication fork movement significantly affects spontaneous zzso in zzso zzso In particular, sequence zzso and a hotspot type of zzso zzso both of which are caused by zzso zzso appeared to depend on the zzso of the replication zzso These zzso are also resistant to zzso mismatch zzso Here, we show that the level of zzso of the zzso gene strongly affects spontaneous zzso at two zzso hotspot sites in the target zzso one for a zzso base substitution and the other for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the hotspot sites were below a zzso level when the zzso of the target sequence was tightly zzso but were dramatically increased when the target sequence was highly zzso Both of the hotspot zzso were also dependent on the zzso of the replication fork and were caused by zzso zzso The zzso of the hotspot zzso were unchanged in a zzso deficient strain, indicating that the hotspot zzso are resistant to the mismatch zzso Based on these findings, we propose a novel zzso process for these hotspot zzso that depends on zzso and involves zzso mechanisms induced by spontaneous DNA zzso
