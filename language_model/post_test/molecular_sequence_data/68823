In view of its central role in zzso and zzso and its zzso genetic zzso the zzso 1 zzso gene in man has been the target of protein structural studies and genetic analysis for more than 25 zzso We have now isolated zzso clones containing the complete zzso gene and have shown that it spans over 65 zzso and contains 11 zzso We have also shown that the sites of the two zzso which form the molecular basis for the common zzso protein zzso lie in zzso 4 and 8 and are 18 zzso zzso Within this region there is a site of zzso zzso We have discovered two alternatively spliced first zzso one of which, zzso zzso is transcribed in a wide variety of cell zzso the other, zzso zzso is transcribed in fast zzso zzso zzso is transcribed from a promoter which has the structural hallmarks of a zzso promoter but lies more than 35 zzso upstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso lies 6 zzso upstream of zzso 2 within the large first zzso of the zzso expressed zzso zzso The zzso form of zzso is characterized by 18 extra zzso acid zzso at its zzso zzso zzso comparisons show that zzso zzso and zzso are structurally related and have arisen by zzso
