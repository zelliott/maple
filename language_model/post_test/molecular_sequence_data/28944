Human zzso is responsible for zzso zzso and is zzso in particular, in reproduction and zzso tumor zzso The molecular structure model is largely derived from the X-ray structure of bacterial zzso sharing only zzso identities with zzso In the present study, site directed zzso experiments were performed to examine the role of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso in zzso and for zzso zzso The zzso properties of zzso zzso in zzso cells, were evaluated using zzso testosterone or zzso as zzso In addition, zzso profiles for these zzso with zzso or zzso derivatives were zzso Our results, together with computer zzso show that zzso properties of zzso vary in accordance with the zzso used, suggesting possible differences in zzso positioning within the active zzso In this respect, importance of zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso These results allow us to zzso that zzso could be involved in the zzso mechanism with zzso whereas zzso remains involved in zzso zzso This study highlights the flexibility of the zzso complex zzso and thus sheds new light on zzso that may be responsible for zzso specificity between species or zzso zzso
