To isolate zzso that were bound to the zzso segment of zzso zzso II zzso and evaluate their effect on the zzso zzso of zzso 

zzso zzso were screened by zzso Evolution of zzso by zzso zzso zzso from a single stranded DNA zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso were cultured and treated with zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis was performed to determine levels of zzso muscle zzso zzso and the signaling protein zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso distribution and zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso were evaluated by zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso was assessed in collagen gel contraction zzso 

zzso sequences were obtained after eight rounds of zzso Two preferential zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated and used in the following zzso zzso zzso significantly inhibited zzso expression and incorporation into zzso stress zzso as induced by zzso zzso zzso also suppressed zzso cell zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso and nuclear zzso of zzso However, we did not find any effect of zzso zzso on zzso activity in zzso 

Our study revealed that a novel zzso binding zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso in zzso
