To understand the biological function of zzso of zzso we have isolated and characterized the gene for zzso zzso from zzso zzso Two approaches were taken to analyze the function of the zzso zzso The first is analysis of the zzso of the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso from zzso different zzso namely human, zzso zzso chicken, zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso acid sequences that appear to be important for the function of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso which had truncated or zzso motifs expressed in E coli would confirm the importance of the zzso zzso acid zzso The interaction of zzso zzso with other proteins involved in DNA repair, zzso zzso and zzso will clarify the function of zzso The second approach is to get the zzso which have disruption in the zzso zzso gene and to zzso the zzso of these zzso The characterization of these zzso will be zzso
