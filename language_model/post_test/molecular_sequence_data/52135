A method for the zzso of organ zzso from abdominal zzso zzso of virgin mice has been zzso In a zzso medium containing zzso zzso insulin, and cortisol zzso zzso zzso zzso development was documented by zzso zzso The hormonal requirements for in zzso expression of zzso and of the zzso growth inhibitor zzso were zzso To this end, a full length zzso coding for mouse zzso was prepared displaying strong zzso to a mouse heart fatty acid binding zzso which is also expressed in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were found to be absent in the zzso tissue from primed virgin mice, and were induced upon culture of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso An zzso analysis with specific zzso against zzso and zzso revealed a different pattern of expression for the two zzso In the zzso zzso zzso was expressed mainly in zzso zzso cells of the zzso structures, whereas zzso was present in both zzso and zzso The relationship between functional differentiation and zzso expression was further studied in zzso from zzso of zzso zzso At this stage of development, zzso is found both in ducts and in zzso If zzso were cultured with zzso growth factor zzso and insulin, the zzso structure was still present, whereas zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression was achieved by subsequent zzso zzso Independent on zzso stage, zzso strongly zzso zzso zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso is associated with functional differentiation in the normal zzso
