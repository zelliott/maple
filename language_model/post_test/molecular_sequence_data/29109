zzso for rapidly identifying cellular protein interactions resulting in zzso modification of one of the partners are zzso Here, we select for zzso of the zzso zzso zzso from two protein display libraries in which the protein is zzso linked to its zzso zzso zzso selection cycles from a zzso zzso library identified a consensus sequence closely matching that previously reported for the zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso library derived from cellular zzso identified several novel targets of zzso including a new member of a class of zzso zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso several of the zzso obtained in these selections were found to be effective zzso of zzso zzso activity in zzso These experiments establish a novel method for identifying the zzso of zzso zzso from synthetic and cellular protein zzso
