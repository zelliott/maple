In this report the effects of single doses of zzso radiation on the zzso expression of several proteins involved in multiple drug resistance were zzso zzso zzso zzso cells treated with single doses of 5, 10 and 20 zzso during the time zzso from zzso to 72 h after zzso were compared with their corresponding controls at the same points of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso level was elevated in cells treated with 10 or 20 zzso from 24 to 72 h after zzso compared with the zzso zzso II alpha and zzso zzso were decreased in zzso cells zzso h after zzso These zzso were associated with cellular zzso determined by zzso expression of the proliferation marker zzso zzso zzso cells exhibited no zzso in the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The finding that zzso zzso zzso was zzso after zzso was validated by investigations on a human lung zzso cell line zzso zzso on the zzso and protein zzso Thus, our results indicate that zzso alters the expression of proteins involved in zzso resistance and may, therefore, play a role in clinical drug zzso
