The structural and functional effects of zzso binding to zzso zzso factor zzso were zzso zzso changes with a zzso around zzso zzso zzso zzso the intrinsic protein zzso of a zzso of factor zzso zzso only the light chain and this coincided with an increase in factor zzso zzso activity in the absence of tissue zzso zzso binding to sites in factor zzso and in the zzso with an apparent zzso constant of zzso zzso induced binding to zzso A similar zzso dependency was not observed with factor zzso lacking the zzso 38 or 44 zzso of the light chain and the observed effects could thus be attributed to zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared to bind to the zzso of relatively higher affinity since, although it was less efficient than zzso it zzso the zzso activity and induced zzso of the intrinsic zzso In contrast, zzso did not induce expression of the zzso zzso The binding properties of two zzso zzso that recognized zzso in the zzso domain of factor zzso zzso the occurrence of two zzso sequential structural changes and only one of the zzso recognized the zzso zzso Thus zzso binding to the zzso domain appeared to result in at least two distinct structural transitions with different functional zzso The two zzso zzso sites responsible for the observed effects could be distinguished based upon differences in zzso affinity and metal zzso zzso The interaction between factor zzso and tissue factor was monitored by means of a direct binding zzso and an zzso zzso In both systems, zzso zzso enhancement was observed at zzso zzso This coincided with a zzso zzso change in factor zzso associated with zzso zzso The same effect on zzso activity was observed with the two zzso truncated forms of factor zzso and it is presumably zzso by zzso binding to a site located in the zzso zzso zzso
