Like the zzso which are characterized by a limiting distance between zzso two positions apart zzso zzso a distance criterion zzso zzso at positions i and zzso is used here to identify zzso from a database of known protein zzso At least 15 classes of zzso have been zzso based on the location in the zzso space of the three central zzso zzso to zzso of the major being the class zzso where the zzso occupy the conventional zzso backbone zzso zzso However, moving towards the zzso end of the turn, there is a shift in the zzso angles towards more negative zzso such that the zzso zzso between two consecutive zzso oxygen atoms is zzso Except for the last position zzso there is not much similarity in zzso composition at different positions of hydrogen and zzso bonded AAA zzso The presence or absence of Pro at zzso position of zzso and zzso has a bearing on whether the turn is zzso or without a hydrogen zzso In the zzso structure, zzso are more likely to be found in zzso zzso The zzso composition at the beginning of the hydrogen bonded AAA zzso has similarity with type I zzso and zzso positions of zzso but the last position matches with the zzso capping position of zzso suggesting that the existence of a zzso cap zzso at zzso position prevents zzso from growing into zzso Our results also provide new insights into zzso nucleation and zzso
