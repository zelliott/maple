A zzso library derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was constructed in the zzso zzso Using the information of the zzso zzso acid sequences of two zzso of zzso synthetic zzso zzso were employed as a screening probe for colony zzso Separate zzso clones zzso for the alpha and beta chains of zzso were isolated and zzso The results revealed that mature alpha and beta chains contain 136 and 123 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso show high degrees of identity with respective zzso zzso for zzso zzso for zzso of zzso zzso snake zzso The identity to zzso zzso is relatively lower zzso 39 and zzso All zzso zzso in each chain of zzso are well zzso and located at the positions corresponding to those of zzso zzso Thus, three zzso zzso bridges and an zzso zzso bond between zzso and zzso may be zzso This is the first report regarding the entire sequence of zzso zzso zzso According to the alignment of zzso acid zzso zzso regions among these zzso zzso proteins were zzso These zzso regions are proposed to be the counterparts directly interacting with different receptors or different zzso of a zzso on the surface of zzso
