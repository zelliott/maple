Live, attenuated vaccines have prevented morbidity and mortality associated with myriad viral zzso Development of live, attenuated vaccines has traditionally relied on empirical methods, such as growth in nonhuman zzso These approaches require substantial time and expense to identify vaccine candidates and to determine their mechanisms of zzso With these constraints, at least a decade is required for approval of a live, attenuated vaccine for use in zzso We recently reported the discovery of an active site zzso zzso that contributes to the zzso efficiency of all zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Cameron, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 16, zzso Here we use a model zzso virus and its zzso to show that zzso of this zzso from zzso to zzso produces an attenuated virus that is genetically stable and elicits a protective immune zzso Given the conservation of this zzso in all viral zzso this study suggests that a universal, zzso strategy may exist for viral zzso and vaccine zzso
