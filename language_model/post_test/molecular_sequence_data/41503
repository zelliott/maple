zzso acid plays major role in the zzso by zzso zzso it lowers the pH of nearby environment and creates the favorable condition for the zzso In this study we examined the degradation of zzso acid through zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso A survey was conducted to collect the zzso soil samples from zzso Plains of India to isolate the efficient zzso strains able to tolerate zzso zzso A total of 120 zzso strains were isolated from root adhering zzso of different vegetable zzso Out of 120 strains a total of 80 zzso were able to grow at zzso of zzso acid whereas only 15 zzso were grow at zzso of zzso acid zzso Then we examined the zzso activity of the 15 zzso against zzso zzso These strains potentially inhibit the growth of the test zzso A total of three potential strains and two standard cultures of zzso were tested for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso showed the maximum degradation of zzso acid zzso after zzso of incubation with zzso extract having zzso zzso zzso zzso observation and ITS zzso transcribed zzso sequencing zzso the potential zzso strains into the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are well studied zzso agent and interestingly we also found the zzso zzso type activity in these strains which further strengthens the zzso of these zzso zzso
