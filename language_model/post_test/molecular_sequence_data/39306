We have identified a novel zzso zzso of the human zzso acute regulatory zzso gene promoter located 3 zzso downstream of the zzso zzso zzso site and 9 zzso upstream of the zzso box zzso zzso of this zzso have a high prevalence of primary zzso In zzso experiments, zzso zzso promoter activity was zzso by the zzso in zzso zzso cells and human zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso significantly increased zzso promoter activity to zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso increased zzso promoter activity only to zzso with a significant zzso reduction compared to wild type zzso zzso In zzso cells, zzso II zzso 10 zzso increased zzso zzso promoter activity to zzso zzso zzso while zzso zzso promoter activity in response to zzso only reached zzso of controls zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso show the formation of two additional complexes with the zzso promoter: one with the zzso zzso zzso and another with a yet unidentified factor, which strongly binds the zzso response zzso Thus, this novel zzso in the human zzso promoter is critically involved in the regulation of zzso gene expression and is associated with reduced promoter activity, a finding relevant for adrenal steroid response to zzso zzso
