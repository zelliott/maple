As a basis for comparative studies in the family zzso zzso zzso a zzso hypothesis for major groups was established based on molecular data, focusing on the zzso of the New zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and nuclear zzso zzso were zzso for a total of zzso zzso and 30 zzso All zzso were zzso to be a zzso group by the presence of a segment in the zzso region of the zzso zzso which is predicted to fold into a single zzso structure not present in the zzso The total number of variable and potentially zzso positions was smaller in the zzso data set, but their higher internal consistency resulted in a strong zzso zzso zzso relationships were stable over a wide range of alignment zzso but the inclusion of zzso positions and zzso gap characters added substantially to the resolution and overall support of the zzso Both data sets were in general zzso The combined evidence suggests that relationships in zzso as currently recognized have to be zzso No convincing evidence could be found for the traditional subdivision into two zzso zzso and zzso The latter is embedded within the zzso and clearly not the sister to all other zzso Most of the current tribes and zzso particularly in the zzso are zzso groups, whereas zzso of the large tribe zzso is well supported by the molecular zzso
