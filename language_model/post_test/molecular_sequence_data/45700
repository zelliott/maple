The dynamic turnover of tight junctions zzso is essential for zzso transitions and/or zzso transitions during zzso zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso specifically mediates the zzso recycling of zzso Here, we identified zzso zzso interacting with zzso 2) as a novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso specifically bound to the zzso form of zzso via its C zzso which contained a zzso domain, and localized at zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that a zzso zzso lacking the zzso domain zzso specifically inhibited the zzso recycling of zzso but not zzso zzso zzso switch zzso further revealed that zzso as well as zzso zzso inhibited the recruitment of zzso to the plasma zzso the development of zzso electrical resistance, and the formation of a zzso diffusion zzso zzso was displaced from zzso upon zzso zzso and was distributed along radiating zzso cables and stress fibers in zzso zzso and zzso zzso cells, zzso These results suggest that zzso mediates the zzso recycling of zzso and the formation of functional zzso by linking zzso to zzso zzso We zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso
