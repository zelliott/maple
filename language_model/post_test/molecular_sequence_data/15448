zzso studies on model peptides have led to a good understanding of the rules behind the formation and stability of regular zzso To test their zzso to the successful design of irregular zzso with long zzso and/or zzso at the zzso we zzso loop 3 of zzso a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso The most zzso zzso pairs, zzso bonds zzso zzso pairs, were incorporated at zzso sites in peptides spanning the zzso region of zzso According to zzso data, these modified peptides adopt zzso zzso as intended by zzso The zzso peptides reproduce even the unusual positive zzso angle for the zzso zzso with the zzso rings in the preferred zzso zzso For the first time the zzso capacities of a zzso bond and a zzso pair are compared in the same model zzso We found that the contribution to stability of the zzso zzso interaction is larger than that of the zzso zzso bond, and that their combination gives rise to an even more stable zzso
