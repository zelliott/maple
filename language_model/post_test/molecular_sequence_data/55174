zzso zzso of a novel zzso system of zzso zzso contain a zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso that is essential for their zzso and attachment to the cell zzso The zzso itself has not been detected in mature zzso suggesting that it may be removed by a novel signal zzso More than 10 proteins have been shown to be essential for the proper functioning of the zzso system, and one of these, zzso is a predicted zzso zzso that also contains a zzso suggesting that it may be a zzso component of the zzso system and a candidate for being the zzso signal zzso A zzso deletion zzso was constructed along with a zzso targeted zzso zzso an altered zzso zzso zzso Analysis of clarified culture fluid zzso by zzso and mass zzso revealed that the zzso was released intact into the surrounding medium in the wild type strain, but not in the zzso zzso zzso Western zzso experiments revealed that the maturation of a model zzso was stalled at the zzso step specifically in the zzso zzso and whole cell zzso experiments demonstrated partial zzso of zzso to the cell zzso The zzso was also shown to be accessible at the cell surface in the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso was zzso but could not be zzso The data indicate that zzso is responsible for the zzso of the zzso signal after zzso are zzso across the zzso
