Tomato zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso zzso of these two zzso were cloned following amplification by the zzso chain reaction of a portion of their relatively well zzso zzso coding zzso zzso zzso by these gene fragments exhibit zzso sequence zzso These two zzso are independently expressed in zzso zzso In mature plants, zzso zzso is most abundant in fruit and zzso zzso in expanded zzso A zzso analysis fails to establish which tomato zzso is zzso to either zzso zzso or zzso the latter being a second zzso zzso Instead, this analysis indicates that following the divergence of the zzso and zzso from one another, a zzso gene duplicated independently in each zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cannot be considered strictly equivalent to the tomato zzso zzso which appear to be zzso at the zzso zzso Similarly, other putative zzso zzso might not be equivalent to those described for zzso and zzso This situation zzso efforts to determine zzso zzso because there might be no one answer to this zzso
