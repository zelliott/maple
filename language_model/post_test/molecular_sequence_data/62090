zzso zzso use an array of zzso including members of the zzso zzso Like zzso zzso of invasion zzso to identify and invade zzso zzso family members are large Type I membrane anchored proteins expressed at the invasive end of zzso that share zzso with the zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and 2) of zzso zzso zzso species vary widely both in the number and sequence of their zzso zzso with the recently completed zzso zzso zzso containing five zzso zzso Of these, three zzso proteins shown to be involved in zzso invasion, a fourth is a zzso and the role of the fifth is as yet zzso In order to identify sequence similarities and differences that may have functional implications for zzso invasion as well as to gain insights into the recent evolutionary history of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we have zzso all five corresponding zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the closest zzso relative of zzso zzso yet is unable to invade human zzso Two of the five zzso zzso zzso genes have highly zzso complete open reading frames in both species, while the other three genes show evidence of gene conversion and rapid zzso The zzso zzso therefore, appears to be surprisingly dynamic and zzso zzso that it is involved in zzso aspects of zzso recognition and zzso
