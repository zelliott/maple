zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso is a rare and genetically zzso cerebral white matter zzso zzso it is characterized by zzso zzso zzso and zzso We explore the clinical spectrum, zzso zzso and gene involvement in the first patients with zzso zzso with zzso zzso described from zzso 

Six patients were enrolled from three unrelated zzso Patient inclusion criteria were zzso zzso zzso normal urinary organic zzso and brain imaging of diffuse cerebral white matter zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso gene in patients' families and zzso in one questionable case was performed using zzso zzso cycle zzso 

Clinical zzso both zzso and zzso was clearly zzso zzso delays ranged from globally severe or moderate to mild delay in achieving walking or zzso Head circumference above the zzso zzso was a constant zzso zzso featured zzso in white matter involvement and zzso zzso However, findings of zzso zzso changes and brain stem zzso were frequently zzso identified in these Egyptian zzso zzso between severe brain involvement and normal mental functions was zzso particularly in patients from the third zzso zzso zzso were confirmed in all zzso zzso zzso in zzso 11 zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in two families, whereas a zzso zzso in zzso 10 zzso C zzso zzso zzso was identified in the third zzso 

This report extends our knowledge of the clinical and zzso features of zzso zzso with zzso zzso It confirms the apparent lack of selective disadvantage of zzso zzso on zzso conception and transmission as supported by the presence of multiple affected siblings in Egyptian zzso
