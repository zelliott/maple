zzso to DNA are important markers of various zzso diseases and can be zzso however, their generation is not zzso We previously reported that zzso zzso could be induced in mice by zzso zzso to zzso an zzso to a zzso domain of zzso We now report that two zzso zzso of moderate affinity zzso zzso equal to zzso raised from zzso mice, specifically recognized both zzso and zzso These zzso feature multiple zzso zzso in the zzso site, a unique characteristic of zzso zzso zzso zzso these zzso zzso show specific zzso to zzso by competing with zzso for zzso binding and recognize defined zzso with a specificity similar to that of zzso To study the structural basis for the zzso of zzso and DNA by the zzso zzso we constructed computer models zzso by zzso zzso of zzso and one of the zzso zzso zzso The modeled structures zzso structural zzso Most notably, the modeled structure of zzso resembled the structure of DNA by the positions of zzso charged groups and aromatic side zzso Thus, a protein zzso may mimic the structure of DNA and the elusive generation of zzso zzso could be explained by zzso immunity to a zzso zzso like zzso
