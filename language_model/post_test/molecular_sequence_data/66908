Numerous bacterial pathogens use type III zzso systems zzso or zzso to inject or zzso zzso proteins into zzso zzso Several different reporter systems have been developed to measure the zzso of these zzso In this study, a zzso zzso reporter system was developed and used to monitor the injection of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso tag is a zzso zzso zzso tag derived from the human zzso zzso zzso of a zzso protein into a zzso cell results in host cell protein zzso zzso of the tag, which can be detected with zzso zzso zzso A series of expression plasmids zzso zzso fusion proteins were constructed to evaluate the ability of the zzso tag to measure the injection of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were efficiently zzso when zzso into zzso zzso Similarly, the injection of zzso by the zzso zzso zzso into different cell types was measured via zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso tag provides a simple method to monitor the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso
