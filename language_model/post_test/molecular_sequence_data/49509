A few zzso B virus zzso infections are characterized by the presence of zzso DNA in serum or liver zzso or both, in the absence of zzso zzso B surface zzso zzso in zzso However, such infections have rarely been described previously in North American zzso In the present study, 31 zzso zzso zzso patients from the United States and Canada who had no zzso zzso in their serum were zzso In these 31 zzso zzso patients, zzso DNA was detected in zzso and/or in adjacent zzso liver tissue using zzso zzso chain reaction zzso in zzso zzso patients from the United States and in zzso zzso from zzso The 17 zzso zzso patients from the United States and Canada included 9 without any zzso markers for zzso and 8 with zzso zzso to zzso B core zzso In these patients, zzso zzso C was the most prevalent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have not been previously reported in zzso patients from North zzso zzso intermediate forms of zzso zzso closed circular zzso zzso were detected in zzso zzso zzso zzso patients, indicating that at least two of these patients had actively replicating zzso zzso The use of tests to detect zzso DNA permitted the identification of zzso infections in zzso zzso patients from North zzso Among these patients, those with zzso to zzso C virus zzso would otherwise have been designated zzso zzso based on zzso tests zzso These findings provide a new perspective on determining the possible viral zzso of zzso in North zzso
