We are investigating the expression and linkage of major zzso complex zzso class I genes in the duck ( zzso zzso with a view toward understanding the zzso of ducks to two medically important zzso influenza A and zzso zzso In zzso there are multiple zzso class I zzso and zzso at a locus are zzso and zzso zzso In contrast, in lower zzso the expression of one locus zzso zzso analysis and amplification of zzso sequences suggested that ducks have at least four zzso zzso zzso class zzso To identify expressed zzso zzso we constructed an unamplified zzso library from the zzso of a single duck and screened for zzso class zzso We zzso 44 positive clones and identified four zzso class I zzso each sharing approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to a Northern zzso indicated that only two of these sequences were abundantly zzso In zzso the zzso expressed zzso class I gene lies adjacent to the zzso of zzso processing ( zzso zzso To investigate whether this organization is also found in zzso we cloned the gene zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso amplification from zzso DNA allowed us to determine that the zzso expressed zzso class I gene was adjacent to zzso Furthermore, we amplified two zzso of the zzso gene from this duck that have significant and clustered zzso acid differences that may influence the peptides zzso This organization has implications for the ability of ducks to eliminate viral zzso
