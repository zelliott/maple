A rice PAL zzso zzso gene sequence ( zzso which is highly similar to and likely the same as a previously described rice zzso zzso including the zzso and zzso I coding regions of zzso was isolated using zzso zzso The expression of several zzso including zzso was strongly induced following zzso with zzso zzso or treatment with a zzso zzso zzso To identify the promoter region induced by the zzso zzso zzso we constructed and subsequently transformed zzso promoter deletion series into rice zzso using particle zzso zzso from both zzso reporter gene and gel mobility shift zzso demonstrated that the sequence zzso to zzso of the zzso promoter includes a zzso involved in the induction of zzso zzso
