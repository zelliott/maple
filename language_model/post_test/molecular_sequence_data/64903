The zzso zzso and zzso contain zzso zzso found in a wide range of zzso zzso to amplify the internal transcribed zzso zzso region of the nuclear zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso also allow detecting members of this zzso zzso Here we report the results of a sequence analysis using maximum zzso on a set of 50 ITS sequences of zzso associated with zzso structures zzso of 26 plant species, AM zzso from six field sites in Central zzso Among 10 separated zzso respectively five in the zzso and two in the zzso had unknown zzso Therefore it was not possible to assign these sequences to any known zzso The study indicates that exploring the diversity of zzso and zzso in soil zzso with molecular methods might enlarge the actually estimated zzso of the zzso
