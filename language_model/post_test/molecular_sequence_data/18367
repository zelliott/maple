Previous studies have shown that a collagen binding domain of human von zzso factor zzso resides on a zzso named zzso obtained by zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso of the mature plasma zzso zzso We have zzso a zzso of a full-length zzso zzso zzso into an expression zzso which uses an zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted product expressed by this zzso is a fusion protein consisting of 16 zzso acids zzso of the zzso zzso protein and zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso This fusion protein was shown to be expressed as zzso inclusion bodies by induced zzso coli zzso the zzso zzso and was partially zzso from bacterial debris and zzso zzso zzso bacterial extract run on zzso gels contained a major band representing zzso of the zzso proteins and corresponded to the predicted fusion zzso This band reacted with both zzso zzso against human zzso and zzso zzso zzso which recognize the zzso zzso of plasma zzso The zzso partially zzso bacterial extract was shown to bind specifically to human zzso collagen types I and zzso This zzso which was a function of zzso zzso and collagen zzso did not occur on zzso zzso zzso It was inhibited by both zzso bacterial extract and plasma zzso and also by a zzso against zzso zzso which has the property of zzso zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that this zzso zzso zzso fragment, which can be obtained in large zzso is a useful model for zzso the zzso of zzso zzso and then for studying the mechanism of zzso zzso
