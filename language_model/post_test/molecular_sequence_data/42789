To clarify the mechanism of the inability of zzso heavy zzso chain production in zzso zzso type myeloma cells, we examined the zzso of the zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso and the presence of functional nuclear factors that bind to the zzso gene zzso in myeloma cells from 6 cases of zzso zzso and three myeloma cell lines and one zzso zzso B cell line having no zzso chain zzso All zzso myeloma cells we examined showed rearranged bands by Southern zzso using the zzso probe, and the zzso of zzso segments in these cells was confirmed by zzso amplification of zzso segments with consensus zzso and zzso zzso However, the expressions of zzso zzso were not detected by Northern zzso in any of the zzso myeloma cells or the three zzso myeloma cell zzso These findings suggested that the zzso of the zzso gene ceased in these cells, and zzso of this zzso apparatus may explain this zzso The functional nuclear factors that bind to zzso gene enhancers zzso and zzso were absent in the myeloma cells from one case of zzso zzso among these zzso myeloma cells and myeloma cell zzso This suggests that zzso of the zzso binding factors may be one of the reasons why zzso myeloma cells are unable to produce the zzso zzso
