zzso zzso protein zzso is an zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso zzso involved in zzso processing, whose abnormal cellular distribution and zzso modification are key markers of certain neurodegenerative diseases, such as zzso lateral sclerosis and zzso zzso zzso We generated human cell lines expressing zzso forms of zzso and zzso zzso and observed that zzso controls its own expression through a negative feedback zzso The zzso properties of zzso are essential for the zzso activity through binding to 3' zzso sequences in its own zzso Our analysis indicated that the zzso region of zzso which mediates zzso zzso is also required for zzso zzso binding to its 3' zzso does not significantly change the zzso zzso pattern but promotes zzso zzso Moreover, blocking zzso degradation partially recovers zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that cellular zzso levels are under tight control and it is likely that zzso zzso zzso disrupt zzso zzso thus contributing to zzso
