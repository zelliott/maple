zzso mechanics has been used to predict the structure of the zzso DNA triple zzso in which a second zzso strand binds zzso to the zzso strand of a zzso stretch of duplex zzso From calculations on the sequence zzso two likely structures zzso One has the zzso zzso of the third strand bases in the zzso and zzso zzso to the zzso strand of the duplex, the other has the third strand zzso in the zzso orientation and uses a zzso zzso zzso Despite the large structural differences between these two types of zzso calculations performed in zzso with a zzso zzso constant to mimic the shielding effect of zzso show them to be energetically very similar, with the latter zzso slightly zzso However, if explicit zzso molecules are included in the zzso the anti zzso is found to be much zzso This difference in the results seems to stem from an zzso of short-range zzso interactions in the in zzso zzso When zzso or zzso base zzso are zzso for the sixth zzso triple in the zzso it is found that, for the zzso model, the third strand base of the zzso triple prefers the zzso orientation while that in the zzso triple retains a zzso though reduced, for the anti zzso
