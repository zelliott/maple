In this study, a zzso gene zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso was knocked out in an effort to metabolically engineer this strain as a model system for the production of zzso zzso of the zzso knockout zzso led to the discovery of a second zzso gene zzso in this zzso The new zzso gene was cloned and zzso The coding region of the zzso gene contains zzso zzso zzso and the deduced protein consists of 265 zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso proteins in different organisms revealed the presence of a highly zzso signature zzso which is nearly the same as the reported zzso consensus zzso The zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso shows a high sequence similarity to that of zzso coli, zzso the zzso gene resembles more its relatives in the zzso suggesting that they evolve from different zzso The zzso of the zzso gene restores the growth zzso of zzso knockout zzso on the minimal medium containing zzso or zzso Furthermore, the zzso activity of this new zzso zzso zzso was confirmed in both zzso knockout zzso and zzso zzso strain by zzso zzso For the first time, the zzso of two zzso genes in an enteric zzso is zzso zzso
