zzso DNA zzso zzso the zzso removal of zzso from the zzso zzso base pair in zzso The general features of DNA recognition by an zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso zzso have previously been revealed via the X-ray structure of a zzso inactive zzso protein bound to an zzso DNA zzso Although the structure revealed the zzso zzso to be, as expected, zzso from the DNA zzso and inserted into an zzso active site pocket on the zzso the zzso zzso engaged in no direct contacts with active site zzso This feature was zzso because other zzso have been observed to engage their zzso primarily through direct zzso The lack of direct contacts in the case of zzso suggested that either zzso uses a distinctive logic for zzso recognition or that the X-ray structure had captured a zzso competent state in zzso zzso To gain further insight into this issue, we zzso zzso zzso bound to DNA containing a zzso inactive analog of zzso in which a single zzso atom was replaced by zzso The structure of this fluorinated zzso complex zzso reveals the zzso zzso buried more deeply into the active site pocket than in the prior structure and now engaged in multiple direct hydrogen bonding and zzso zzso This structure appears to capture the zzso competent state of zzso DNA zzso and it suggests a zzso mechanism for this class of zzso one in which general zzso zzso of the zzso promotes zzso bond zzso
