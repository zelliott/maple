In population studies of individuals given the zzso drug zzso two distinct zzso have been zzso extensive zzso zzso zzso times more of the urinary zzso zzso than poor zzso In family studies the zzso zzso behaves as an zzso zzso trait with an zzso between zzso and zzso in the white population of Europe and North America, and extends to the deficient metabolism of more than 20 commonly prescribed zzso Clinical studies have shown that such individuals are at high risk for the development of adverse side effects from these and probably many other zzso Here we show that poor zzso have negligible amounts of the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have cloned the human zzso complementary DNA and expressed it in zzso cell zzso Furthermore, by directly cloning and sequencing zzso from several zzso zzso we have identified three zzso zzso zzso that are products of zzso genes producing incorrectly spliced zzso zzso providing a molecular explanation for one of man's most commonly defective genes zzso of zzso zzso zzso
