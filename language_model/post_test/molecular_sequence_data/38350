The zzso zzso zzso zzso has a gene zzso which encodes a zzso zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso group of the zzso zzso Based on secondary structure predictions and a secondary zzso multiple sequence alignment with remote zzso proteins of known three-dimensional structure, we previously hypothesized for this zzso the zzso fold typical of several zzso and zzso and identified zzso zzso 255 and zzso as the putative members of the zzso zzso In this paper we report the building of a zzso model for this zzso based on the structure of the zzso zzso A zzso from zzso zzso whose structure has been recently zzso The model reveals the zzso organization of the fold corroborating our zzso As regarding the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located close each other at hydrogen bond zzso The zzso role of zzso as the zzso member of the zzso is demonstrated by the zzso zzso zzso labeling and sequencing of a radioactive zzso containing the signature sequence zzso
