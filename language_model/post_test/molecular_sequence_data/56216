To evaluate the effects of bilateral zzso obstruction zzso on the levels of zzso zzso in zzso we examined the types and amounts of zzso zzso in zzso zzso from zzso control zzso rats and rats with zzso of 24 hours duration utilizing bacterial zzso zzso and specific zzso zzso zzso by zzso or zzso toxin demonstrated the presence of zzso and zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso further revealed the existence of two types of G alpha s zzso and 52 zzso as well as G alpha zzso (40 zzso G alpha zzso (41 zzso G alpha zzso zzso zzso and G beta (35 to 36 zzso in zzso zzso The zzso subspecies of G alpha s was the 52 zzso zzso zzso amounts of G alpha o were not found in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso were not detected in zzso extracts of zzso Both forms of G alpha s and G alpha zzso were significantly reduced in zzso zzso from rats with zzso when compared to zzso zzso No significant difference in total G alpha zzso G alpha zzso and G alpha zzso and G beta content was observed between the two groups of zzso In zzso zzso of rats with simultaneous administration of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso maintained the amount of G alpha s and G alpha zzso in rats with zzso at the levels seen in zzso zzso The two drugs did not affect the amounts of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
