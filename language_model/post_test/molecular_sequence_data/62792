The crystal structure of a zzso zzso from the seeds of the zzso tree zzso zzso a zzso plant from central Africa, has been determined in complex with zzso and five zzso The zzso contains a classical zzso loop, but its zzso loop resembles that of zzso of unrelated specificity from zzso zzso and zzso zzso As a consequence, the interactions with zzso in the primary binding site are zzso but details of zzso outside the primary binding site differ from those seen in the equivalent zzso complexes of zzso zzso These observations explain the differences in their respective fine specificity profiles for zzso While zzso and zzso bind to PAL in low-energy zzso identical with that of zzso zzso is required to adopt a different zzso zzso can bind only in a single binding mode, in sharp contrast to zzso which creates a higher affinity for this zzso by allowing two binding zzso
