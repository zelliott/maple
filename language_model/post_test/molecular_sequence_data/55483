The essential processing of zzso zzso precursors requires concerted and sequential zzso by different zzso and zzso Despite long lasting investigations of these processes the exact order of steps remained zzso Many bacteria perform additional zzso processing steps by removing intervening sequences within the zzso zzso This leads to disintegration of the zzso zzso and zzso assembled fragments within the zzso The maturation of these fragments also requires successive zzso events by different zzso Our study reveals that the zzso zzso zzso J is responsible for the final zzso maturation of all three zzso zzso fragments in the zzso zzso zzso zzso the results show that zzso and zzso steps are closely zzso mature zzso are a strict prerequisite for the final zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
