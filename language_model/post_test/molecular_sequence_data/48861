Two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso isolated respectively from the healthy and diseased part of zzso zzso zzso zzso were characterized using a zzso zzso zzso characterization supported the inclusion of the two strains in the zzso zzso with zzso DNA zzso contents zzso zzso within the range observed for this zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso : 0, zzso zzso and summed feature 3 zzso zzso : zzso : zzso zzso zzso as major fatty zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequences revealed that strains zzso and zzso did not cluster with any species with zzso published names, and formed a distinct cluster with zzso % zzso support on three zzso trees within the zzso zzso Acid was not produced from zzso and zzso was not observed on zzso media supplemented with sheep zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso the two strains are considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
