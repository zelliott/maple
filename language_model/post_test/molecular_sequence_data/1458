The replication of zzso leukemia virus zzso requires the capture of a cellular zzso as a primer for reverse zzso To further study the specificity of primer selection, we have zzso a defective zzso in which the zzso site (PBS) has been altered to be complementary to a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the defective zzso is dependent upon zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso have been constructed in which the PBS was altered to be complementary to zzso that also zzso the zzso for zzso zzso of these defective zzso zzso into cells resulted in the production of infectious zzso as determined by a zzso zzso The amount of infectious virus produced using this zzso system, though, was approximately zzso lower than that produced following zzso of defective zzso zzso with a zzso PBS complementary to zzso The lower zzso was not due to reduced expression of zzso in the zzso cells as compared to zzso zzso or zzso zzso passage of the zzso zzso with a PBS complementary to zzso that zzso zzso resulted in amplification of the zzso Using this rescue system, we have zzso the virus for four serial passages, after which time a zzso zzso in which the PBS was altered to be complementary to zzso was detected that grew to high zzso following subsequent serial zzso The results of these studies suggest that zzso has preferences for the zzso primer used in reverse zzso and are discussed with respect to the mechanism of primer zzso
