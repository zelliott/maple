The envelope zzso zzso of the human zzso virus zzso zzso the virus to the cellular zzso zzso and mediates virus entry into the zzso In addition to being required for formation of infectious zzso expression of zzso at the plasma membrane causes the zzso fusion of cells carrying the zzso zzso The expression of zzso is therefore an ideal target for therapeutic strategies designed to combat zzso Here we show that expression of a soluble zzso zzso zzso to contain a specific retention signal for the zzso zzso blocks zzso of zzso and surface expression of zzso but does not interfere with transport of zzso zzso By blocking transport of the zzso zzso this retained zzso zzso prevents the fusion of zzso cells that is normally caused by the zzso zzso zzso of the retained zzso zzso in human T cells might therefore be useful in the zzso zzso procedure suggested by zzso
