One of the signatures of Alzheimer's disease is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso arises from zzso of the zzso zzso protein by beta and gamma zzso which present attractive candidates for therapeutic zzso Two zzso candidates, zzso and zzso were identified as zzso zzso both of which cleave the zzso precursor at the zzso These are produced as immature zzso proteins containing a zzso 

zzso expressed in zzso zzso the Swedish zzso zzso precursor at different zzso at different zzso in zzso Recent reports show that zzso zzso the zzso of zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso zzso zzso its own zzso at zzso 5 but not pH zzso as seen by mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

We suggest that zzso processing as well as activity are influenced by zzso and hence the cellular zzso of the protein may have profound effects on the production of zzso These factors should be taken into consideration in the design of potential zzso for these zzso
