zzso chain reaction zzso techniques based on amplification and identification of zzso DNA sequences provide a sensitive diagnostic method for detection of minimal residual disease zzso with a detection limit of zzso to zzso zzso zzso cells in zzso normal zzso To date, the main zzso DNA sequences used as zzso targets in detection of zzso are zzso fusion regions of zzso zzso and zzso regions of rearranged zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The recently identified zzso deletions involving the zzso and zzso zzso provide a potential zzso zzso zzso deletions are zzso because they are zzso via zzso signal sequences zzso to zzso zzso In line with this zzso zzso deletions also show random zzso and deletion of zzso at their zzso resulting in highly variable zzso fusion zzso The fusion region diversity can be applied to design zzso zzso zzso Our Southern zzso analyses of a large series of 313 acute zzso with a specific zzso deletion probe zzso demonstrated that zzso deletions exclusively occur in zzso acute zzso leukemia zzso and not in precursor zzso or acute zzso zzso In addition, we did not detect zzso deletions in normal blood cells and normal zzso by zzso zzso The diversity observed in zzso deletion fusion regions with an average zzso and deletion of approximately 7 and approximately 6 zzso respectively, allowed us to design zzso zzso The specificity of the zzso zzso was proven and the detection limit of the zzso technique was tested in a series of dilution zzso The observed detection limit of zzso indicates that zzso deletions in zzso represent ideal zzso zzso targets for detection of zzso
