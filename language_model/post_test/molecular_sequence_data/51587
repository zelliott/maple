zzso zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso that has been identified and characterized in several laboratories by virtue of a number of different biological zzso zzso is zzso by a unique gene located at zzso in the mouse and at zzso in zzso However, zzso related to sequences in the 3' untranslated region of the zzso have been detected and located elsewhere in the zzso The zzso gene from four zzso species has been cloned and zzso the sequences are highly zzso within the coding regions and largely zzso within the zzso zzso However, a number of zzso segments displaying high zzso similarity are zzso these are candidate control zzso zzso an zzso corresponding to the zzso end of a zzso zzso transcript in the mouse that encodes a potentially zzso form of zzso is not zzso in the human, zzso and zzso zzso The promoter region of the zzso gene contains four zzso zzso zzso and two start sites of zzso have been zzso Three regions within the zzso zzso region have been identified as important for the function of the zzso promoter, including a candidate zzso zzso The zzso gene is transcribed at only very low levels in normal zzso but its expression can be increased by various zzso
