The zzso zzso consists of several differentiated cell types that are distinguished by their selective expression of zzso hormones such as insulin, zzso and zzso Although a number of zzso factors have been proposed as key regulators of individual zzso genes in the zzso their cellular distribution and relative abundance remain zzso Also, their overlapping DNA binding zzso have further obscured the regulatory functions these factors perform during zzso In this report we characterize a novel zzso zzso zzso factor termed zzso which is zzso expressed in cells of the zzso zzso and small zzso The zzso acid zzso protein binds to zzso elements within the zzso promoter and stimulates zzso gene expression both in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso comprises the zzso zzso zzso activity in nuclear extracts from zzso pancreatic zzso cells, suggesting that this protein may have a primary role in regulating zzso hormone expression and specifying zzso cell lineage in the developing zzso
