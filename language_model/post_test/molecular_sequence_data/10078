We have zzso the zzso chain reaction zzso differential display methodology zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1992) Science zzso zzso to identify a novel transcript whose expression levels increased in zzso zzso zzso during zzso induction by zzso growth zzso The zzso product was used to clone a zzso pair zzso representing this transcript, which we have named zzso zzso response zzso The zzso zzso contained a single open reading frame predicted to zzso a protein of 493 zzso acid zzso A data base zzso search revealed that the predicted zzso zzso acid sequence contains three regions of similarity to the rat and human proteins zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and two regions of similarity to the zzso zzso sequence that is similar to zzso The zzso growth zzso increase in zzso zzso levels was not dependent on de zzso protein zzso demonstrating that zzso is an zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed a single zzso pair zzso that was observed predominantly during the initial zzso and zzso stages of zzso development, with little or no zzso zzso during subsequent zzso zzso zzso analysis of early zzso stages showed that zzso peaked during late zzso zzso analysis of the predicted zzso zzso acid sequence revealed two putative nuclear zzso signals, four highly zzso regions clustered at the N zzso and a zzso region located near the C zzso zzso zzso by zzso revealed that the zzso protein was targeted exclusively to the zzso zzso zzso using various regions of zzso fused to the DNA binding domain of zzso demonstrated that the zzso zzso region is a potent zzso These data suggest that zzso may function as a zzso zzso
