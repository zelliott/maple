The zzso N and zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso fold with excesses of zzso zzso zzso into zzso structures with distinct zzso zzso despite their identical zzso sequence zzso An additional main difference is the zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and the trans zzso of this zzso in the zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso folding revealed for the zzso domain a fast and highly cooperative formation of a single zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain proceeds mainly via an intermediate that results from the fast zzso zzso formation according to the proximity zzso The rate of conversion of the zzso zzso into the zzso zzso is largely dominated by the zzso zzso of the critical zzso zzso as well assessed by its replacement with zzso and zzso known to exhibit distinct zzso for the trans and zzso zzso zzso zzso whether the trans or zzso zzso is favored by these zzso both zzso retain sufficient zzso information to fold almost zzso into the identical zzso framework and thus spatial structure of the parent zzso with the critical zzso zzso as zzso zzso but at rates significantly lower for the zzso than for the zzso zzso zzso other zzso structural elements have to act as a driving force for these zzso folding pathways despite the rather simple sequence composition consisting only of zzso zzso some zzso and only one aromatic zzso zzso in the core parts of the C and zzso zzso The two zzso zzso of zzso may well represent ideal targets for zzso zzso structure calculations in order to learn more about the elementary information zzso in such primordial zzso
