Human zzso 2 zzso genetic zzso is associated with drug toxicity and/or zzso in various zzso zzso of zzso gene structure and expression is critical for understanding these zzso Previous findings suggest that human zzso expression is highest in liver and gut but expressed at functional levels in other zzso A sensitive and specific zzso reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso with zzso zzso was developed and used, together with a second zzso zzso zzso based on amplification of a zzso open reading frame zzso zzso segment, to measure zzso zzso in 29 different human zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso and review of public database information were done to more precisely define the zzso zzso and to validate the quantitative zzso zzso zzso The great majority zzso of zzso liver zzso had zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso upstream of the zzso zzso zzso and 34 of 40 zzso zzso were at the zzso and zzso zzso All 59 zzso zzso with zzso zzso in this vicinity, including 40 of the liver zzso and 19 zzso in public databases from liver and other sources, showed direct zzso to the zzso zzso with no other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was highest in liver, small zzso and colon and was readily detected in most other zzso albeit at much lower zzso zzso expression in diverse human zzso provides further zzso support underlying associations between zzso genetic zzso drug zzso and/or chemical zzso
