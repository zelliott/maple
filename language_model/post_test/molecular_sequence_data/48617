The protein zzso is found in an zzso zzso state in the zzso paired zzso filament deposits characteristic of Alzheimer's disease and other related zzso and zzso in zzso protein and zzso cause zzso zzso zzso zzso include a zzso domain containing either three or four imperfect tandem zzso binding repeats that also form the core of zzso filaments and contain zzso motifs that are critical for zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain can also engage in direct interactions with detergents, fatty zzso or zzso which can greatly facilitate zzso zzso and may also mediate some zzso zzso Here, we show that the alternatively spliced second zzso repeat exhibits significantly different structural characteristics compared with the other three repeats in the context of the intact repeat zzso Most notably, the zzso zzso motif located at the zzso of repeat 2 has a lower propensity to form zzso structure than the corresponding zzso motif in repeat 3, and unlike zzso converts to partially zzso structure in the zzso zzso Interestingly, the behavior of the zzso zzso located at the beginning of repeat 4, resembles that of zzso rather than zzso Our zzso combined with previous results showing that zzso and zzso are both less effective than zzso in zzso zzso zzso suggest a hierarchy in the efficacy of these motifs in zzso zzso zzso that originates in differences in their intrinsic zzso for extended zzso structure and the resistance of these zzso to changes in zzso zzso
