zzso zzso zzso signal zzso which consists of 33 zzso zzso is functional in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso acid, zzso zzso or zzso was inserted between positions 28 and 29 of the zzso signal zzso using site directed zzso zzso zzso the zzso and modified signal peptides were then fused zzso to zzso zzso the mature regions of the zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso in zzso coli cells was more inhibited by the modified signal peptides than that in zzso zzso cells, although the degree of zzso varied and the zzso effect of each signal zzso was found to be similar in the two zzso In contrast, the difference in the zzso effect of each modified signal zzso was no longer detected in the case of the production of zzso zzso except for the zzso of zzso zzso Nearly 50% of zzso zzso in the precursor form was accumulated in the zzso fraction of zzso coli cells containing the zzso for the modified signal zzso The zzso of zzso acid inhibited the zzso of the two zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso
