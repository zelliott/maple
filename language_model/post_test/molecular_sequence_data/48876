The zzso zzso zzso zzso originally contained more than 90 zzso microscopic zzso zzso causing specific infections in different vascular zzso Although species have mainly been identified historically according to their host and zzso and zzso traits, they can be studied and preserved in the form of zzso arising from zzso zzso Due to low DNA sequence divergence and the lack of available zzso the number of accepted zzso species has currently been reduced to zzso The aim of this study is the description of three previously accepted zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso CBS zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso CBS zzso and zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso CBS zzso which have been omitted from a recent zzso The host range, the divergence of the zzso zzso gene zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso and the zzso small zzso zzso zzso sequence strongly support their zzso as zzso
