The complete primary structure of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 5, an zzso zzso implicated in food poisoning, was zzso The zzso was isolated from zzso zzso zzso 5 cells, after zzso by ethanol zzso and by zzso zzso The zzso was comprised of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid, in zzso zzso zzso and linkage assignments of the zzso zzso were obtained by zzso zzso specifically by the combination of two-dimensional zzso zzso and zzso experiments and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Thus, the envelope zzso of zzso zzso zzso 5 was found to be a zzso composed of a zzso repeating unit with the following zzso zzso see zzso This structure is novel among bacterial zzso zzso and it is the first of many zzso distinct zzso zzso of zzso zzso to be zzso
