zzso zzso were developed in zzso zzso zzso zzso a shrub that inhabits the Atlantic zzso to investigate the zzso genetic structure of the zzso 

Nine pairs of zzso zzso were designed that were based on a simple sequence repeat zzso zzso Seven zzso were amplified zzso Two populations of zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and all zzso were zzso with two to five zzso per locus per population zzso zzso amplification was achieved in other members of the zzso and members of the sister zzso zzso 

The development of these zzso markers will contribute to future population genetic studies in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso among other species in the zzso and in the sister zzso zzso might be a useful tool to establish patterns of genetic zzso within the Atlantic zzso
