From a human zzso zzso library, we isolated and characterized a novel gene zzso zzso a protein highly zzso to certain nuclear transport proteins of zzso and zzso The complete zzso zzso designated zzso alpha 3, contained an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso 521 zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence showed zzso zzso and zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso The similarities among these proteins suggest that zzso alpha 3 may be involved in the nuclear transport zzso Eight repeats of the arm motif were well zzso among these zzso The zzso region of the predicted zzso alpha 3 product was highly basic and the zzso region was strongly zzso A zzso transcript was expressed in all adult human zzso examined by Northern zzso The zzso clone was assigned to zzso band zzso by zzso in zzso zzso
