The highly zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso are believed to participate in zzso zzso but only recently have some of the critical zzso in the zzso sequence involved in zzso binding been zzso Here we describe two highly zzso zzso acids in the zzso domain of rat zzso that are involved in binding zzso zzso zzso was used to produce two zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Relative to zzso zzso an zzso reduction in affinity for human zzso was found for zzso zzso protein in both zzso zzso blots and solution phase zzso binding zzso and a zzso zzso reduction for zzso zzso This shows that zzso and zzso in zzso are important zzso in binding zzso and due to their complete conservation in all zzso zzso we suggest that they are likely to be involved in binding zzso in all six binding zzso In addition, these two zzso zzso lie within the zzso binding region zzso of zzso demonstrating that the zzso contains partially overlapping zzso and zzso binding zzso We therefore propose that zzso binding to basic zzso acids in zzso between zzso may physically zzso subsequent interaction between zzso and zzso and that this may explain previous work of others showing reduced affinity of zzso bound zzso for zzso
