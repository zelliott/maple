Seven zzso zzso and zzso zzso containing zzso zzso bond replacement by a zzso double and single bond were zzso zzso zzso studies of the zzso in zzso indicate the presence of extended zzso with stacking of the side chains in the zzso part and an inverse zzso around zzso in the zzso zzso The binding data show that the affinity of the zzso for the zzso is only slightly diminished in the zzso series and is more affected in the zzso zzso Since the zzso is not present in these compounds we conclude that this zzso is not required to stabilize the zzso zzso nor is it directly involved in binding to the zzso
