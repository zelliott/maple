To amplify and sequence the partial gene coding for zzso protein from Chinese zzso of zzso zzso zzso 

The zzso zzso of zzso were predicted by zzso software and specific zzso zzso were designed and zzso Total zzso was isolated from adult worms of zzso zzso using zzso zzso and the coding region gene of zzso was amplified by zzso zzso 

The coding region of zzso gene was specifically amplified by zzso and the size of amplified zzso was zzso base zzso The DNA sequence analysis result indicated that the coding sequence of the zzso was highly zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

The amplified zzso is consistent to the predicted one, providing a basis for cloning and further study on DNA zzso
