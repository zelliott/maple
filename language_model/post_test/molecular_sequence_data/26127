A set of zzso promoter deletions from zzso a zzso clone of a zzso gene of zzso has been zzso fused to a zzso zzso reporter gene in the zzso zzso zzso zzso leaf disks were transformed and mature plants analyzed for zzso activity directed by the zzso promoter zzso zzso plants containing the 375 zzso zzso sequence from zzso to zzso relative to the zzso start site transcribed zzso zzso and expressed active zzso zzso in mature zzso but not in zzso Plants transformed with a zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion expressed zzso zzso in leaves but not in zzso Neither zzso zzso or active zzso could be detected in zzso or leaves from plants containing a 124 zzso zzso zzso fusion missing the putative zzso zzso zzso No zzso zzso or zzso expression was not detected in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of the zzso generation confirmed that the zzso expression pattern of zzso zzso in tobacco followed that of the native gene in zzso and that the zzso promoter sequences from the zzso gene are able correctly to direct genetically stable, zzso gene expression in transgenic tobacco zzso
