The abundance of a zzso zzso at position 185 zzso of the human zzso factor zzso type 2 alpha zzso zzso was zzso zzso has only been reported in zzso zzso proteins from other species and all zzso receptors zzso an zzso zzso at the corresponding zzso Cloning of partial and full-length zzso zzso from a variety of zzso and peripheral zzso revealed the existence of zzso molecules zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso gene verified the existence of zzso also on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso either the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso of zzso were zzso expressed in zzso cells and tested for zzso binding zzso In displacement studies zzso and zzso displayed a similar zzso zzso human and rat zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were bound with high affinity whereas human and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso differences were observed for zzso and zzso I, which bound with zzso zzso and zzso zzso I) higher affinity to zzso These data indicate that zzso like all zzso zzso and zzso proteins encodes an zzso zzso at the junction between zzso domain 2 and zzso domain 3 and that this zzso acid plays a role for the discrimination of some zzso zzso zzso
