A novel zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from bovine hoof zzso zzso into composting bovine zzso from southern Alberta, Canada, and subjected to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso produced zzso zzso and extensively zzso zzso within zzso and aerial zzso from which zzso spores possessing zzso cell zzso were produced in primarily zzso or straight zzso The cell wall contained zzso acid, zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the major zzso were zzso zzso zzso and zzso These characteristics suggested that the zzso belonged to the zzso zzso and a comparative analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences indicated that it formed a distinct zzso within the zzso zzso zzso could be differentiated from other species of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso characteristics and the predominance of zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso zzso : zzso fatty zzso The broad range of zzso and genetic characters supported the suggestion that this zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
