zzso zzso C zzso plays a critical role in signal zzso controlling T zzso zzso Both positive and negative regulation of signal zzso is needed for proper control of T zzso zzso We have found that a zzso product of the zzso basic protein zzso gene can serve as a negative regulator of signaling pathways in the T zzso particularly the zzso zzso Increased expression of zzso zzso in zzso T cells strongly zzso zzso zzso activity, an indicator of T zzso zzso zzso zzso can be zzso by zzso in zzso and its zzso increases in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso increase in zzso or zzso zzso consistent with zzso acting in a zzso cellular zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is not due to a direct action on zzso zzso but in the cascade following zzso zzso since zzso neither reduces zzso zzso activity nor blocks the membrane association of zzso brought on by T zzso zzso The zzso function of zzso is independent of its zzso by zzso because a zzso zzso in which the zzso sites have been zzso is as effective as the wild type zzso in zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso activity resides in the zzso domain rather than in zzso domain of the zzso These results reveal a novel role for zzso gene products in T zzso within the immune zzso
