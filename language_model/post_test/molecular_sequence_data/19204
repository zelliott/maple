The primary stored and circulating form of zzso in humans, human zzso zzso zzso has potent zzso properties with rapidly occurring zzso However, when administered to experimental models of fibrosis, zzso zzso can only be applied over short-term zzso week) zzso due to zzso mounting an zzso response to the zzso human zzso resulting in delayed clearance and, zzso increased and variable circulating zzso To overcome this problem, the current study investigated the therapeutic potential of mouse zzso over long-term exposure in zzso Mouse zzso is unique among the known zzso in that it possesses an extra zzso within the zzso region of its zzso To enable a detailed assessment of its zzso interaction and biological properties, it was chemically zzso in good overall yield by the separate preparation of each of its A- and zzso followed by zzso formation of each of the zzso and two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to bind with high affinity to the human, zzso and rat zzso zzso zzso zzso but with a slightly lower affinity to that of zzso zzso When administered to zzso mice (which undergo an zzso progression of organ zzso over a 4 month treatment period, mouse zzso was able to significantly inhibit the progression of collagen zzso in several zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and skin (all p zzso zzso vs zzso group), consistent with the actions of zzso zzso These combined data demonstrate that mouse zzso can effectively inhibit collagen deposition and zzso zzso over long-term treatment zzso
