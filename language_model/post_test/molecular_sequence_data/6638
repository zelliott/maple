zzso oral zzso zzso were recovered from 60 zzso and three zzso zzso These organisms were zzso and produced abundant zzso which were frequently arranged in triplets or in zzso zzso They belonged to zzso zzso zzso A and had zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso DNA of a selection of these organisms with the zzso zzso probe zzso and five separate zzso zzso to zzso zzso repeat zzso demonstrated that they had a very distinct zzso organization compared to zzso zzso and zzso zzso This was further established by random amplified zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso of 500 zzso of the zzso variable region of the large zzso zzso genes from nine zzso zzso and the corresponding sequences determined from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso showed that they zzso organisms formed a homogeneous cluster zzso zzso that was significantly different from the other zzso species zzso but was most closely related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso These genetic data combined with the zzso characteristics of these zzso organisms strongly suggest that they constitute a novel species within the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso is zzso
