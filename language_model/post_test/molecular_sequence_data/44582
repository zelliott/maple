To zzso genetic zzso of insulin resistance, we investigated insulin zzso zzso and insulin zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso function and in zzso insulin sensitivity in a family with Type A zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso found in the zzso resulted in reduction by zzso of insulin binding to zzso decreased zzso zzso and a dramatic reduction of insulin zzso The zzso and mother were zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also carried by zzso brother with no consequence on insulin sensitivity, was inherited from the mother who is diabetic and insulin resistant and zzso was from the zzso We conclude that severity of insulin resistance in the zzso may be explained by the genetic condition of compound zzso for zzso zzso while severe insulin resistance in the mother raises the possibility that other genetic factors, like zzso zzso may contribute to the zzso expression of zzso zzso
