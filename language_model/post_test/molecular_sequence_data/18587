The principles of affinity maturation of zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso are still under zzso It is unclear whether the zzso zzso binding site is a preferred target for zzso and what the role of zzso zzso zzso hotspots is in this zzso Here we report a structural analysis of zzso zzso that have been replaced through zzso zzso zzso in 196 zzso We show that there is no correlation between the propensity of an zzso acid to be in AID hotspot and the probability that it is replaced during the zzso zzso Although AID hotspots may be necessary to enable zzso they are not a major driving force in determining which zzso are zzso We identified zzso positions that are highly zzso and significantly affect zzso The effect of zzso on binding energy is a major factor in determining which structural regions of the zzso are zzso There is a clear preference for zzso at the zzso zzso However, positions outside this region that also affect binding are often preferred targets for zzso As for zzso acid preferences, a general trend during zzso is to make zzso zzso more similar to zzso zzso in zzso In different regions of the zzso there are different sets of preferences for zzso acid zzso This mapping improves our understanding of zzso affinity maturation and may assist in zzso zzso
