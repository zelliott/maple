The transport of zzso across the plasma membrane of zzso cells is zzso by a family of zzso zzso zzso One zzso zzso is zzso zzso and is found in muscle, heart, and fat cells, differentiated cells which are difficult to maintain and study in zzso zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, also are zzso can be easily maintained in culture, and retain the genetic complement of the zzso In this paper, we evaluate zzso isolated from cultured human zzso for the expression of four different zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that human zzso expressed the zzso zzso the fetal skeletal muscle zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso but not the liver zzso zzso zzso To confirm the presence of zzso zzso zzso was zzso from human zzso zzso amplified using zzso specific for zzso by the zzso chain reaction, and zzso The sequence was identical to that of zzso zzso These data indicate that cultured human zzso express at least three genetically distinct zzso zzso zzso
