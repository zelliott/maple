zzso 18 zzso is one of the zzso zzso associated with human diseases and in particular zzso zzso To facilitate studies of the molecular epidemiology of zzso and the evolution of zzso in general, the complete zzso zzso sequence was determined for the zzso 18 zzso strain zzso zzso Excluding the zzso A zzso the zzso consists of zzso zzso divided into a zzso zzso zzso untranslated region zzso zzso a zzso zzso long open reading frame coding for a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso and a 103 zzso 3' zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso showed a typical zzso zzso zzso analysis of the structural and zzso genes revealed a pattern of different relationships to other zzso and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that the Hill strain of zzso 9 is most likely the result of a previous zzso event between ancestors of the zzso 9 strain zzso zzso half of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Using a maximum likelihood approach, the zzso point was mapped to the zzso zzso
