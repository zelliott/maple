Human zzso virus zzso transmitted drug resistance in the zzso population is of growing relevance in Estonia, where the number of zzso zzso zzso subjects has been zzso increasing during the last 10 zzso The aim of this study was to estimate the rate of transmitted drug resistance among newly diagnosed subjects in zzso in zzso zzso resistance testing for viral zzso zzso was conducted for 201 subjects tested zzso between 1 April and 30 November zzso Of 145 zzso viral strains in newly diagnosed patients, 123 were zzso 2 were zzso A1 and 3 were zzso zzso in 17 cases viral sequences revealed zzso structures similar to zzso zzso A1 and zzso Resistance zzso were found in 8 zzso virus zzso and 3 strains were resistant to at least 2 zzso zzso A total of zzso of sequences zzso zzso indicating zzso reverse zzso inhibitor resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso inhibitor resistance zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor resistance zzso zzso These data suggest the need to extend zzso zzso drug resistance testing to newly diagnosed zzso subjects to prevent potential zzso treatment zzso
