zzso performs multiple functions in animal systems, acting in zzso as an zzso export factor and during zzso as a zzso checkpoint and zzso assembly zzso In this study we characterized multiple functions of zzso in zzso zzso gene zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso which encodes a protein with four zzso repeats, resulted in growth arrest and abnormal leaf zzso zzso was mainly associated with the nuclear envelope during zzso and zzso zzso caused zzso of zzso zzso in the zzso of leaf cells, suggesting defective zzso zzso In the shoot zzso depletion of zzso led to reduced zzso activities, accompanied by reduced zzso zzso zzso activity and decreased expression of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso The secondary growth of stem zzso was also zzso indicating reduced zzso zzso zzso leaf cells of zzso plants exhibited elevated zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells showed that zzso protein localized to zzso zzso and the cell zzso zone during zzso and zzso zzso directly bound to zzso in zzso zzso of zzso expression in zzso cells using a zzso zzso system resulted in severe defects in zzso organization and zzso alignment and zzso which correlated with delays in cell cycle zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso plays a dual role in zzso export in zzso and in zzso assembly in zzso
