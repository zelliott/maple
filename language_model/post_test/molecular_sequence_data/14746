As there are four major molecular types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and four molecular types of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso it is important to identify the specific groups causing zzso in different geographical zzso Here, we investigated the molecular types of 57 zzso zzso from patients in a zzso care hospital in the state of zzso Brazil, between 2006 and zzso The zzso were zzso by zzso zzso using the zzso zzso and confirmed by zzso analysis, and the presence of specific genes from the mating type locus zzso and zzso of these species was zzso by zzso Most of the patients were male zzso between 16 and 30 years of age zzso and zzso zzso Most zzso were collected from zzso fluid samples zzso Most of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso as members of the zzso molecular group zzso a unique isolate was zzso as zzso whereas all zzso of zzso zzso zzso were members of the zzso molecular zzso With regard to mating types, 55 zzso were type zzso and only two were type zzso This study revealed the prevalence of the zzso molecular group and provides the first reported observation of the zzso molecular group in the northern region of zzso
