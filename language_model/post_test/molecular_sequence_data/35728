Human zzso zzso zzso has been zzso from extracts of fresh and outdated zzso coats and from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso present in the starting material from such preparations can be either zzso or active, or have an approximate molecular weight of 75 or 58 zzso depending upon whether the extraction buffer contains zzso zzso and/or zzso The zzso of these different forms of zzso is described and is made possible by taking appropriate precautions to stabilize the zzso For example, a zzso protocol is described that allows the zzso to zzso of the active and zzso zzso 58 zzso forms of zzso in high yield with specific zzso activities that greatly exceed that of zzso human zzso zzso zzso The pattern of zzso of the zzso 58 and 75 zzso species by zzso zzso and zzso has been zzso zzso is shown to zzso zzso type I over types II and III zzso in zzso The specificity of zzso toward the zzso of 60 zzso has been examined and compared with zzso zzso is shown to be a zzso that contains complex zzso zzso
