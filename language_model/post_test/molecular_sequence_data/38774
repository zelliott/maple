We have isolated and characterized a new repetitive zzso zzso from terminal restriction fragments of zzso zzso zzso DNA by means of a modified zzso zzso The zzso was found directly attached to zzso of zzso zzso and one of its ancestors, zzso zzso and also at inner zzso zzso No association with zzso was detected neither in zzso zzso nor in the second tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso and Southern zzso reveal similarities in the arrangement of zzso on the zzso of 9 species of the zzso zzso zzso its occurrence as a zzso of a zzso complex DNA zzso zzso belongs to the family of dispersed repetitive sequences without features of zzso The copy number of zzso varies widely in the zzso of 8 species analyzed being lowest in zzso zzso with 3300 copies per zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso forms about zzso of the zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso units are about 460 zzso long and show about zzso of mutual zzso but no significant zzso to DNA sequences deposited in zzso and zzso Although zzso clones of zzso contain an open reading frame zzso a zzso protein similar to plant zzso no zzso transcript was zzso zzso is extensively zzso at zzso and zzso sites and its zzso forms zzso phased with a 170 zzso 8 zzso zzso
