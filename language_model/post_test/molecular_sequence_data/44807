Exposure of zzso cells to zzso radiation zzso zzso a complex array of cellular responses including cell cycle arrest and/or zzso zzso zzso arrest has been shown to depend on the presence of the tumor zzso zzso which acts as a zzso zzso of several zzso zzso also plays a role in the induction of zzso in response to DNA damage, and this zzso can be activated by both zzso and zzso zzso Here we report the identification of a novel transcript whose expression is induced in response to zzso in a zzso manner, and that shows zzso to the type zzso protein zzso We have named this novel zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso displayed characteristics of a type zzso zzso including zzso dependence and relative zzso to zzso zzso Studies performed in several cell lines revealed that zzso zzso following zzso zzso with the presence of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso following zzso was rapid and zzso and the protein was localized to the zzso Similar to zzso zzso expression of zzso in human cells suppressed colony zzso These results suggest that zzso might contribute to growth zzso pathways activated in response to DNA damage in a zzso zzso
