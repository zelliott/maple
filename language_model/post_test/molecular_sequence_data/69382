We have successfully limited the level of zzso delta zzso occurring after zzso of zzso infected zzso by prior zzso with the short form of the zzso delta virus zzso expressed by a zzso zzso or zzso zzso This phenomenon occurred in the absence of zzso circulating zzso to zzso delta virus zzso and in the absence of evidence of zzso of the zzso immune response and may reflect the induction of a zzso zzso zzso The latter would control zzso by rapid zzso of delta zzso expressing zzso It is suggested that the zzso zzso involved may be located on the zzso end of the delta protein zzso acids zzso
