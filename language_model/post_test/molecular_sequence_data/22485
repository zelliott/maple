zzso gene related zzso zzso plays an important role in the zzso and in the cardiovascular zzso To identify zzso zzso in competitive binding studies, we identified a novel radioactive zzso zzso zzso which was labeled in solution by a recently developed strategy using zzso protecting groups at zzso side zzso This zzso was shown to be as potent as commercially available zzso for the determination of zzso and to have increased sensitivity for zzso We applied it to investigate the predicted turn structures centered at zzso and zzso The substitution at positions 29 and 34 by zzso zzso acid zzso showed that these turns are highly zzso At position 29, a zzso zzso is preferred that zzso the secondary structure, whereas position 34 is required to stabilize the zzso of the zzso All zzso zzso showed zzso properties with potency similar to zzso zzso
