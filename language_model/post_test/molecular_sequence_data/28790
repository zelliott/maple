We have identified a novel zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso that is first zzso in the milk of the zzso zzso around day 200 of zzso The zzso zzso clone of zzso base pairs encodes a mature protein of 156 zzso zzso zzso shares 65 and zzso zzso and deduced zzso acid identity, respectively, with a previously identified late zzso protein A zzso Both these proteins share significant zzso acid sequence zzso with the zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso gene is induced between days 200 and 240 of zzso in contrast to expression of the zzso zzso which is induced at around 145 days of zzso zzso expression of both genes in zzso zzso from zzso at zzso days of zzso required a combination of zzso insulin and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso were localized to the same cells by in zzso zzso A substantial level of zzso maturation is required for expression of the LLP zzso unlike zzso which is expressed in immature zzso We zzso that the zzso expression of the zzso and zzso genes may be regulated both by zzso stimuli and factors intrinsic to the zzso zzso
