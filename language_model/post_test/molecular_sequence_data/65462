Signal zzso zzso zzso is the zzso responsible for zzso the remnant signal peptides left behind in the membrane following zzso protein zzso zzso activity appears to be present in all cell types, zzso zzso and zzso Here we report the first structure of a signal zzso zzso that of the zzso coli zzso zzso zzso forms a zzso assembly with a novel zzso zzso The bowl has a dramatically zzso interior and contains four separate active sites that zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso Our structural analysis of zzso reveals that while in many zzso bacteria as well as characterized plant zzso a tandem zzso in the protein fold creates an intact active site at the interface between the repeated zzso other species, particularly zzso and zzso organisms, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that could form similar zzso to their duplicated counterparts, but using an zzso arrangement and with the zzso zzso provided by neighboring zzso The structure reveals a similarity in the protein fold between the zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso seen in the zzso zzso zzso zzso We propose that zzso may, in addition to its role in signal zzso zzso have a role in the quality assurance of zzso and zzso zzso similar to the role that zzso plays for zzso zzso
