The interaction between the proteins zzso zzso and zzso is a key step in synaptic zzso zzso and zzso To define the zzso binding domain on zzso we have prepared peptides that span the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso the region previously shown to be important for binding to zzso and then determined the affinities of these peptides for binding to zzso A minimal binding domain was identified within a region of 32 zzso acids zzso zzso Its affinity for zzso is substantially enhanced by zzso extension zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed the presence of substantial zzso in the zzso domain and in the zzso minimal binding domain, but not in zzso peptides that do not bind to zzso At temperatures that zzso the zzso of the minimal binding domain zzso zzso binding is zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso within the minimal binding domain zzso zzso 205 and zzso greatly reduce the affinity for zzso but have no major effect on secondary structure, suggesting that these zzso may interact directly with zzso The zzso domain zzso and the minimal binding domain zzso inhibit zzso release from zzso zzso These results suggest that specific zzso acid zzso in the zzso domain, positioned by the underlying zzso structure, are important for its binding to zzso and support the notion that this interaction is important for zzso zzso zzso
