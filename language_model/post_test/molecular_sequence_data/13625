The chemical stability of zzso zzso containing zzso was zzso zzso all the zzso zzso from zzso zzso support gave a mixture of three compounds at the end of automated synthesis as analyzed by zzso PAGE and zzso On the basis of zzso procedures, these compounds were identified to be zzso and zzso zzso The instability of the zzso protecting group under the synthesis conditions was responsible for this observed zzso In order to evaluate the stability, a comparative study on the chemical stability of the zzso containing zzso groups such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso The results indicate that the zzso group provided the best stability for the synthesis of 3' zzso zzso and the protecting group is zzso and zzso in concentrated ammonium zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso at 56 degrees zzso The zzso zzso zzso were also zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso
