A new zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso and zzso degradation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was isolated from activated zzso A zzso analysis based on zzso zzso sequences indicated that the new isolate is a member of the beta zzso of the zzso and represents a distinct line of descent within the family zzso During zzso growth with zzso zzso or zzso as the sole carbon source, the isolate reduced nitrate to zzso without appreciable zzso of zzso and nitrous oxide as intermediate zzso zzso analyses of the zzso with different grades of zzso indicated that approximately zzso g of zzso was required to reduce 1 g of zzso A high zzso rate (19 zzso zzso removed zzso zzso zzso dry zzso of zzso was found with zzso as the electron zzso
