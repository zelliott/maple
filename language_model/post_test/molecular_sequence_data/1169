zzso is a zzso zzso containing two zzso zzso that has zzso activity against zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene cluster of zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso appeared to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which converts zzso and zzso to zzso and zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli in zzso zzso and the expressed protein was zzso to apparent zzso by ammonium zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso column zzso The specific activity of the zzso increased zzso with a recovery of zzso It migrated as a single band on zzso with a molecular mass of 30 zzso The zzso protein had zzso zzso activity, catalyzing a zzso zzso group transfer zzso In the forward reaction the highest activity was obtained with the combination of zzso and zzso and only zzso of that activity was obtained with zzso in place of zzso In the opposite direction the zzso protein was highly specific for zzso and zzso
