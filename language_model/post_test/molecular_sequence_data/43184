A zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was identified in a clone previously shown to contain the heat shock genes zzso and zzso the zzso is located upstream of zzso and is transcribed in the opposite zzso An analysis of the zzso gene has shown that the deduced zzso acid sequence is that of a zzso zzso which is zzso identical and zzso similar to zzso coli zzso Furthermore, an zzso zzso was constructed by gene disruption and was shown to be highly sensitive to the zzso agent zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso gene of zzso zzso unlike its zzso coli counterpart, is not located downstream of the zzso zzso and its zzso is not induced by zzso zzso In addition, no acquired enhanced resistance to zzso toxicity by treatment with low zzso doses was observed, suggesting that no zzso response occurs in zzso zzso Nevertheless, zzso of the zzso gene is cell cycle controlled, with a pattern of expression similar to that of several zzso genes involved in DNA zzso
