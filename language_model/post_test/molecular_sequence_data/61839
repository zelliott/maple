Studies of zzso zzso of zzso influenza A virus zzso protein have identified two zzso structural zzso zzso An increase in zzso on reduction of pH from 8 to 6 that involves zzso 15 within the zzso domain of the protein and may be associated with zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso 41 within the zzso domain of the channel by zzso 37 below pH 6 which is specifically reversed by drugs that block the zzso zzso The pH dependence of the latter effect, which monitors changes in the zzso of zzso 37, zzso to that of zzso current through the channel and provides evidence for the involvement of zzso 37 in zzso zzso
