A zzso zzso library from Atlantic zzso based on zzso zzso was constructed in zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso were isolated from the library using a specific probe generated by zzso chain reaction zzso between two zzso areas within the variable region zzso and fourth frame zzso Two zzso clones zzso the entire constant region of zzso zzso and one zzso zzso the entire constant region of zzso zzso were zzso revealing messages from two zzso zzso zzso Both genes were shown to be present in zzso zzso and have been isolated from a zzso library, the zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences of which are presented here zzso zzso and zzso The zzso of transcripts zzso the zzso zzso zzso the whole fourth zzso as in other zzso The zzso and zzso acid identity between salmon zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso from Atlantic salmon separated by zzso zzso can be explained by a net exchange of basic zzso in salmon zzso compared to zzso The finding of two closely related salmon zzso genes is in accordance with the zzso state of the Atlantic salmon zzso
