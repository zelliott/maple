zzso zzso has the potential to influence many aspects of target cell zzso The present study has determined the zzso levels of zzso in the pregnant mouse zzso and developing zzso unit with respect to the expression of two key zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To measure zzso levels, zzso extracts were zzso and zzso by zzso liquid zzso detection zzso zzso protein zzso zzso levels were determined to be zzso zzso protein in the zzso zzso however, two statistically significant changes were identified in the pregnant zzso zzso a zzso surge between day 3 zzso zzso zzso and day 5 zzso zzso zzso of gestation zzso day zzso zzso day zzso and zzso an early zzso decline between day 6 zzso zzso zzso and day 7 zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso surge coincided with zzso expression of zzso an zzso which zzso the irreversible zzso of zzso to zzso zzso expression was shown by Northern zzso analysis to peak in the zzso unit on day 5 of gestation and then to decline through day 9; transcripts remained elevated in the zzso between day 9 and day 13 (the latest day examined in this zzso By use of specific zzso zzso most zzso activity was localized to the primary zzso zone on day zzso This expression subsequently declined during zzso of the primary zzso however, zzso appeared on giant zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Other zzso zzso zzso degrading zzso zzso zzso or generating zzso zzso zzso were not detected in the zzso unit suggesting that the net flux of zzso zzso zzso proceeds with zzso as an zzso this being the major zzso of zzso zzso The sharp drop in zzso levels between day 6 and day 7 coincided with a rise in the activity and zzso expression of zzso an zzso which zzso the irreversible zzso of zzso to zzso zzso was previously localized to the secondary zzso zone zzso zzso secondary giant cells zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in the mouse zzso et zzso zzso zzso of zzso Northern zzso analysis demonstrated a direct correlation of relative zzso zzso band intensity to zzso content between day 4 and day 9 of zzso suggesting that the local availability of zzso in the zzso is dependent upon the distribution of these zzso zzso zzso AT 400 zzso
