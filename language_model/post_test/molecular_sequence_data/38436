zzso zzso usually occur in older men and are mostly diffuse large zzso zzso zzso They may be primary manifestation of zzso or represent a zzso of a previous zzso zzso This report details a zzso large cell lymphoma, which was proven to be large cell transformation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 years zzso Initially, a zzso old man was diagnosed with cervical zzso and biopsy was interpreted as zzso zzso zzso no treatment was given, and the zzso resolved zzso Eight years later, the patient underwent surgery for a left zzso mass and zzso for gastric zzso The patient died 7 months later with evidence for zzso and central nervous system zzso after a brief but temporary response to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso biopsy showed diffuse large zzso zzso zzso which infiltrated between zzso zzso in the zzso zzso comparison with 20 zzso zzso without previous zzso showed zzso zzso in all cases, suggesting that the zzso zzso pattern could be a zzso marker for secondary zzso involvement in zzso On zzso the zzso zzso 8 years prior was verified as zzso predominantly small, zzso cell zzso with zzso zzso The earlier zzso zzso and the subsequent diffuse large cell zzso were analyzed using zzso chain reaction and showed identical sequences of the zzso zzso and zzso heavy chain gene zzso Analysis of the zzso sequences from the zzso zzso revealed sequence zzso consistent with ongoing zzso However, the transformed diffuse large cell zzso had no zzso variation, with the sequence matching with one of the zzso from the zzso zzso zzso These results confirm that the large cell transformation of zzso zzso occurs in a single zzso zzso zzso This case also indicates that the selection of the transformed clone can be part of the natural history of disease and can occur without exposure to zzso
