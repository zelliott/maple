zzso transmission of repeating segments in genes is now recognized as a new class of zzso causing human zzso zzso instability observed in disease is termed an zzso zzso when the zzso is an increase in the copy number of a repeated unit, commonly a zzso or zzso While the expansion zzso is well characterized in disease, the mechanism by which expansion occurs is not zzso This article focuses on physical properties of expansion at repeating zzso that may provide clues to the zzso Both zzso and genetic data indicate that DNA structure is part of the mechanism and the underlying cause for zzso
