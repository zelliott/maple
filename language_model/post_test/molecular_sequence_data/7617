Previous work demonstrated that a zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso function zzso beta zzso but not zzso zzso reporter genes driven by the strong zzso virus 40 zzso or zzso zzso regions in both transient zzso and stable cell zzso The different 3' zzso stabilization and zzso signals from these two reporter genes appeared to be primarily responsible for this zzso We now report that the zzso zzso itself is sufficient to stimulate both zzso zzso and increased zzso of beta zzso reporter gene zzso Furthermore, the ability to respond directly to zzso zzso can be transferred to zzso zzso reporter genes by replacement of their zzso zzso and zzso signals with the 3' zzso and zzso zzso signals from the normally highly zzso beta zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed in bacteria bound specifically to in zzso zzso from both the beta zzso and zzso zzso zzso 3' zzso regions, but not to the zzso zzso zzso signal and zzso zzso By zzso zzso we also show that individual zzso zzso zzso acid zzso that are zzso zzso in zzso zzso in other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are critical for zzso zzso zzso several of these positions match zzso that are known to be essential for the role of zzso in the zzso switch during the virus zzso zzso zzso our findings support the notion that zzso zzso zzso gene expression zzso in part by targeting zzso
