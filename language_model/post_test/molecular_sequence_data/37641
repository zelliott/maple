zzso plants have a system to specifically restrict the long-distance movement of tobacco etch zzso zzso without involving either hypersensitive cell death or systemic acquired zzso At least two dominant zzso zzso and zzso are necessary for this zzso Through a series of zzso experiments with zzso zzso the zzso restriction was shown to be highly specific for zzso The zzso gene was isolated by a zzso cloning zzso Isolation of zzso was confirmed by transgenic zzso and sequence analysis of zzso and zzso zzso The zzso gene product is a zzso protein containing an zzso region with high similarity to plant small heat shock proteins zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso small zzso domain is zzso distinct from each of the five known classes of plant small zzso Unlike most other plant genes zzso small zzso expression of the zzso gene was not induced by high temperature and did not contribute to zzso of zzso The zzso gene product was also shown to contain a large zzso region with multiple repeating zzso
