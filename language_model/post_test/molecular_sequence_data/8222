The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA by copying a template sequence in the zzso zzso We studied the functional roles of specific zzso in the zzso zzso zzso template zzso zzso zzso of certain zzso zzso caused dramatic effects on specific aspects of the zzso reaction, including loss of zzso zzso and premature product zzso None of these fundamental changes in zzso action are zzso by altered zzso between the zzso zzso and DNA zzso These influences of specific template bases of the zzso zzso on zzso properties of zzso provide evidence for critical roles of these zzso zzso in two active site zzso and DNA zzso zzso
