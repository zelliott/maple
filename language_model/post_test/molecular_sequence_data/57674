The complete zzso sequence of the P gene of zzso virus 41 zzso was zzso The gene was found to be zzso zzso long and to contain a relatively small open reading frame zzso a zzso V protein with a calculated zzso of zzso We have demonstrated that zzso events occur in zzso P gene transcripts and that the ratio of edited zzso to faithfully copied zzso zzso is about zzso at either 24 or 40 h zzso The zzso with two G insertions was capable of zzso a P protein of 395 zzso acids with a predicted zzso of zzso A kinetic study of P and V proteins by Western zzso analysis showed that in zzso cells the amounts of both proteins were almost equal although the zzso was considerably more abundant than the zzso zzso of the zzso P and V proteins with those of nine other zzso demonstrated that irregular gaps were present around the zzso zzso
