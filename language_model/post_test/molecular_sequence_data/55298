zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a debilitating genetic disorder of zzso cellular differentiation characterized by zzso of the great toes during embryonic skeletal development and by progressive zzso zzso zzso zzso Patients with these classic clinical features of zzso have the identical zzso single zzso substitution zzso zzso in the gene zzso zzso a bone zzso protein zzso type I zzso Gene targeting was used to develop an zzso zzso model for zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso mice revealed that this zzso induced zzso first digits in the hind limbs and zzso zzso bone formation, zzso the human zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed inflammatory zzso and zzso of skeletal muscle followed by robust formation of zzso bone through an zzso pathway, identical to that seen in zzso zzso cells of a zzso lineage participated in each stage of zzso zzso We further determined that both zzso zzso and zzso cells are present within the zzso bone zzso an unexpected finding that indicates that although the zzso is necessary to induce the bone formation process, the zzso is not required for zzso cell contribution to bone and zzso This unique zzso mouse model provides novel insight into the genetic regulation of zzso zzso and establishes the first direct in zzso evidence that the zzso zzso in zzso causes zzso
