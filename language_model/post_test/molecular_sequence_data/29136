zzso channel beta zzso are important molecular zzso of the zzso and zzso dependence of zzso channel zzso Through direct interactions with zzso zzso zzso beta zzso enhance expression levels, accelerate zzso and have variable effects on zzso Four distinct beta zzso genes each zzso five zzso sequence zzso zzso three of which zzso zzso and zzso undergo alternative zzso We have isolated from human spinal zzso a novel alternatively spliced zzso zzso containing a short form of domain D1 zzso that is highly zzso to N zzso of zzso and rat zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to compare the gating properties of various zzso zzso complexes containing zzso with those of complexes containing a zzso zzso with a longer form of domain zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso revealed that, relative to zzso and zzso complexes containing zzso the zzso dependence of zzso and zzso of complexes containing zzso were shifted to more zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso complexes containing zzso zzso at a faster zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso alternative zzso did not influence the gating properties of zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso deletion zzso revealed that both the N and C zzso of the zzso zzso play critical roles in setting zzso gating parameters and that their effects are zzso zzso zzso Our data are best explained by a model in which distinct modes of zzso and zzso result from zzso zzso zzso interactions with an zzso zzso gating zzso
