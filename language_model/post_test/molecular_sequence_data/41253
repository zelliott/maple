zzso zzso coli zzso is responsible for the majority of urinary tract infections zzso To cause a zzso zzso must adhere to the zzso cells of the urinary tract and overcome the zzso flow forces of zzso This function is zzso primarily by zzso zzso which mediate specific attachment to host cell zzso Another group of zzso that contributes to zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso AT proteins possess a range of zzso properties, such as zzso zzso invasion, and zzso zzso One recently characterized AT protein of zzso is zzso a large zzso zzso AT protein that contributes to zzso formation and zzso zzso In this study we characterized a series of naturally occurring zzso of zzso We demonstrate that extensive sequence variation exists within the zzso domain of zzso zzso from different zzso zzso This sequence variation is associated with functional zzso with respect to the ability of zzso to mediate zzso zzso In contrast, all of the zzso zzso examined retained a zzso ability to mediate binding to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso passenger domain identified a zzso region zzso and a zzso region zzso zzso of these zzso reduced zzso formation but not the binding to zzso zzso Despite variation in the zzso zzso the zzso of zzso was zzso by a zzso mechanism involving the global regulator zzso and zzso of the zzso gene relieved this zzso Overall, our findings shed new light on the regulation and functions of the zzso AT zzso
