zzso zzso proteins zzso from zzso species induce local and zzso defense responses specifically in plants of the zzso and zzso Based on zzso zzso acid zzso zzso sequences from zzso zzso were amplified by the zzso chain zzso A zzso clone containing a complete zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso zzso was confirmed to be zzso as a precursor protein containing a zzso acid signal zzso that is processed before zzso zzso expression of the cloned zzso gene as a zzso fusion protein containing zzso zzso yielded a biologically active protein capable of inducing a hypersensitive response in zzso suggesting that zzso zzso modifications of zzso are not required for its zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that zzso genes occur as a zzso family (at least two to 10 zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Some zzso of zzso zzso that did not produce zzso still contained zzso sequences but did not accumulate zzso zzso
