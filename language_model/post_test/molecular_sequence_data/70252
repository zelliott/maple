While studying founder zzso in the fragile X syndrome, we have unexpectedly found linkage equilibrium to zzso an zzso zzso within the defective zzso zzso DNA sequencing of 265 zzso revealed 39 zzso and a complex zzso of form zzso A zzso rate of zzso was observed but only among fragile X zzso derived zzso Finding a second zzso locus within zzso suggests that the target for tandem repeat instability may not be confined to the zzso repeat alone and raises the possibility of an zzso zzso mechanism involving zzso
