Cellular adaptation to environmental stress conditions requires rapid and specific changes in gene zzso During heat zzso most zzso zzso are retained in the nucleus, whereas the export of heat zzso zzso is zzso Although essential zzso export factors are known, the precise mechanism for regulating transport is not fully zzso Here we find that during heat shock in zzso zzso the zzso protein zzso is zzso on zzso 178 and zzso 180 by the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for nuclear zzso zzso zzso upon heat zzso and zzso is decreased in a zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso and zzso zzso in nuclear zzso with zzso a protein involved in zzso zzso zzso nuclear focus formation and zzso zzso are independent, suggesting that heat shock zzso multiple cellular zzso that impinge upon transport zzso Under normal conditions, we find that the zzso export zzso zzso and zzso directly zzso However, upon heat shock stress, zzso does not zzso to the zzso nuclear zzso and its association with zzso complexes is zzso These results reveal a novel mechanism by which the zzso zzso zzso and zzso control zzso export factors during heat shock zzso
