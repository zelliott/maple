A recently discovered new class of 40 zzso zzso forms a major component of the zzso proteins in the dry zzso of zzso zzso These proteins are implicated as protective zzso factors that determine which cells are to survive during the processes of drastic tissue zzso In order to understand its role in the zzso of zzso zzso the detailed three-dimensional structure of the bovine zzso zzso zzso has been determined using X-ray zzso zzso was zzso from bovine dry zzso and zzso using the zzso zzso zzso The zzso belong to the zzso space group zzso with zzso parameters a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso The protein was also cloned in order to determine its complete zzso zzso Its three-dimensional structure has been determined using data to zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence determination of zzso reveals two potential zzso sites at zzso and zzso but electron density for a zzso chain was only present at zzso The protein adopts a zzso with the classical zzso fold of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with the zzso of a small zzso domain zzso zzso similar to that observed in zzso However, the substitution of zzso for zzso in the consensus zzso sequence in zzso caused a loss of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso groove in zzso is considerably distorted zzso to zzso zzso of several zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso Three surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso have exceptionally high B factors, suggesting large-scale zzso Fluorescence studies indicate that various zzso bind to zzso with low zzso
