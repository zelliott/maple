We have isolated several zzso cell lines from zzso cell suspensions of soybean zzso zzso that possessed different levels of zzso resistance, zzso II activity, and zzso zzso zzso We have further studied the zzso zzso which showed the highest level of resistance to zzso as well as a zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso respectively, compared with the wild zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso for the D1 zzso of zzso zzso from this zzso revealed a single change, zzso to zzso in the D1 zzso To our knowledge, this substitution has not previously been described in any zzso zzso In addition to affecting zzso resistance, this single zzso acid change caused a decrease in the electron transfer rate between the secondary zzso zzso and QB and a stabilization of the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso also showed a larger antenna size, an increase in zzso centers, and a higher sensitivity to light zzso The unusual stability of the zzso and zzso states indicates that zzso belongs to a new class of zzso zzso
