The control of zzso infectious anemia virus zzso infections of horses has been over the past 20 years based primarily on the identification and elimination of zzso horses, predominantly by a standardized zzso gel zzso zzso zzso in zzso reference zzso This screening for zzso horses has been to date hindered by the lack of a rapid diagnostic format that can be easily employed in the zzso We describe here the development of a rapid zzso zzso for the presence of serum zzso to zzso based on zzso polarization zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso regions of zzso core and envelope proteins were initially screened for their utility as zzso in an zzso zzso to select the best zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was zzso to detect the presence of zzso zzso by a change in the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso diagnostic zzso The most sensitive and specific zzso probe was a zzso corresponding to the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso This probe was tested for its zzso in the zzso zzso zzso with 151 zzso horse zzso and 106 zzso serum zzso The results of these studies demonstrated that the zzso zzso zzso correlated with reported zzso results in 106 of 106 negative serum samples zzso zzso and in 135 of 151 positive serum samples zzso zzso The zzso zzso was also found to have a very low background zzso and to readily detect zzso produced early in infection zzso weeks zzso The developed zzso zzso zzso is rapid (5 to 20 zzso and simple to perform and is equally suitable for use both in the field and in the diagnostic laboratory, thus providing the basis of an improved commercial diagnostic zzso for zzso infection of zzso
