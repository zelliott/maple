zzso zzso influenza viruses have caused many zzso and even a few zzso in humans, pigs and zzso including 1918 human zzso pandemic, which killed zzso million people and the current avian H5N1 pandemic in the Eastern zzso which has caused great economic losses and posed a severe threat to human public zzso To zzso the whole diversity of zzso influenza viruses from a dynamic view, 202 zzso zzso sequences of zzso zzso influenza zzso were selected and analyzed in this zzso Our results showed that zzso influenza zzso could be divided into three distinct lineages zzso Classic zzso and zzso which largely circulated in the humans, pigs and zzso respectively, though viruses in the Avian lineage could zzso zzso and even there was a zzso in the Avian lineage wholly isolated from zzso The Avian lineage and the Human zzso which have existed at least for decades, possibly began divergence around in 1890 through zzso zzso Both of the Human and Avian lineages could be further divided into some zzso and the correlation between these lineages (or zzso and their isolation places, isolation time, zzso zzso zzso host species, zzso or zzso were zzso The panorama of the diversity of zzso influenza viruses presented in this study provided a framework for the studies on the evolution and epidemiology of zzso influenza zzso
