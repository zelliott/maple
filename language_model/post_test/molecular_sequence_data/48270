Development of root zzso specifically induction of cortical cell division for zzso zzso requires expression of specific genes in the host and zzso A full-length zzso clone and the corresponding zzso clone zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from alfalfa zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso protein with zzso identity to zzso a previously characterized zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso is unique among the known plant zzso zzso primarily due to a 230 zzso acid zzso zzso The putative zzso zzso zzso zzso also differs from the previously reported zzso zzso motif in plant zzso zzso zzso messages were found predominantly in root zzso roots, and root zzso zzso alfalfa and zzso zzso containing a zzso gene consisting of zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequence of the zzso gene fused to the zzso zzso coding sequence exhibited zzso expression primarily in the zzso zzso zzso and vascular zzso root tips, and root vascular zzso Stem zzso stained intensely in cortical zzso zzso cells, and primary zzso zzso activity was observed in leaf zzso surrounding areas of mechanical wounding and pathogen zzso The promoter was also active in root tips and zzso zzso of transgenic zzso zzso patterns suggest a possible role for zzso in initiation and development of zzso and roots, and in localized responses to zzso
