zzso is a prion disease affecting sheep and zzso zzso to this neurodegenerative disease shows zzso zzso The involvement of the zzso zzso zzso in the metabolism and propagation of zzso has previously been zzso In the present work, the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated, zzso and mapped to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a significant decrease in zzso zzso in zzso after zzso zzso zzso no differences were detected in other brain regions such as zzso and zzso zzso Association analysis showed that a zzso reflecting the presence of a zzso zzso was overrepresented in a group of sheep resistant to zzso zzso No zzso acid change in the zzso protein was found in the 126 sheep zzso However, interesting zzso acid positions zzso zzso and zzso which could participate in the species barrier to zzso and maybe to other zzso zzso zzso were identified by comparing zzso sequences from various zzso with variable levels of resistance to zzso
