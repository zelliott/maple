Mouse coding region zzso zzso and human zzso zzso 1 zzso proteins are zzso zzso proteins that recognize zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and regulate their expression zzso Here, we confirm that human zzso binds to zzso zzso and that it is predominantly expressed in fetal zzso Moreover, zzso expression was detected in cell lines of zzso origin and in selected primary zzso In a series of 33 zzso and 10 benign zzso tumors, zzso and zzso respectively, were found to express zzso In particular, expression was significant in 14 Ewing's zzso all of which were zzso The data suggest that zzso plays a role in abnormal cell proliferation in zzso zzso
