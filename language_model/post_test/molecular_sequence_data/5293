zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is regulated by the major surface zzso zzso Previously, transient zzso analysis identified regulatory sequence elements in this promoter located between zzso and zzso which govern the level of zzso from this promoter and appear to bind only ubiquitous zzso factors including zzso zzso and zzso However, in zzso zzso analysis in transgenic mice has demonstrated that the expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is largely restricted to zzso In this study, the presence of a functional zzso zzso factor binding site located between zzso and zzso in the major surface zzso promoter suggests that the in zzso zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso may be governed by this zzso zzso zzso The identification of a functional zzso binding site upstream of the DNA zzso open reading frame also supports the contention that transient zzso analysis may fail to detect all of the zzso regulatory sequence elements involved in modulating the level of zzso from the viral zzso
