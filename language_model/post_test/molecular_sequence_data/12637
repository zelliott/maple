zzso zzso is the repetitive addition of zzso to the 3' end of a nascent transcript due to zzso between the transcript and DNA zzso Recently, we showed that zzso regulation of zzso zzso expression in zzso coli occurs, in part, through a mechanism in which induction of zzso zzso zzso within the initially transcribed region prevents downstream extension of the nascent transcript to include structural gene zzso In this study we demonstrate that zzso regulation of zzso zzso expression in zzso coli also involves zzso zzso zzso during zzso however, the mechanism is different from that of the zzso zzso The initially transcribed region of the zzso promoter contains the sequence zzso zzso zzso Our results show that zzso is initiated primarily at the first two bases designated zzso and A8 zzso from the zzso zzso When transcripts are initiated at position zzso zzso zzso zzso always occurs within the run of T zzso in the initially transcribed zzso The zzso (where zzso zzso 1 to zzso zzso transcripts produced by this reaction are not extended zzso to include downstream zzso zzso In contrast, most transcripts initiated at position zzso do not engage in zzso zzso and can be zzso zzso zzso of a zzso promoter zzso that prevents zzso zzso showed that this reaction is required for virtually all zzso regulation of zzso expression and that zzso levels control the selection of the zzso and A8 zzso start zzso These results suggest a model for regulation in which high zzso levels of zzso favor zzso initiation at position A8 and thus the accompanying zzso transcription, which together zzso initiation at position zzso Low levels of zzso inhibit initiation at position A8 and the associated zzso transcription, thereby allowing high levels of initiation at position zzso and zzso zzso Our results also indicate critical sequence requirements for zzso transcription, which are important for understanding the mechanism of this reaction as well as for identifying other promoters at which this reaction may zzso Of particular interest is the indication that an zzso hybrid forms during zzso initiation and the strength of this hybrid controls the extent of zzso zzso
