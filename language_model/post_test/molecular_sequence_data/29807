The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is host to four different zzso zzso inherited bacteria that kill male hosts during zzso one each of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and two distinct strains of zzso zzso The history of infection with these zzso was explored using host zzso DNA, which is linked with the bacteria due to joint maternal zzso Two variable regions, 610 zzso of zzso zzso zzso I and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso 5, were isolated from 52 zzso zzso with known infection status and different geographic origin from across zzso Two zzso zzso were also zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed that the distribution of zzso zzso is not associated with zzso Rather, it zzso with infection status, confirming linkage zzso between zzso and zzso The data strongly suggest that the zzso zzso invaded the host earlier than the other zzso Further, the zzso zzso is indicated to have undergone a recent and extensive spread through host zzso In general, zzso in zzso zzso seems to represent a highly dynamic system, which should prove useful in future studies on the evolutionary dynamics of this peculiar type of zzso zzso
