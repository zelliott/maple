The interaction of zzso bacteria with host serum and zzso proteins is a common strategy to enhance their zzso zzso zzso zzso the human upper respiratory tract in healthy individuals and is also able to cause invasive zzso Here, we describe a novel zzso surface zzso zzso capable of binding specifically to human zzso zzso A zzso The zzso constant of zzso binding to zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso Free zzso component zzso also binds to zzso pneumoniae, whereas serum zzso does not, suggesting that zzso binding to zzso is zzso by the zzso To our knowledge, this is the first defined interaction of SC with a zzso zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso of 523 zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of 59 151 zzso The zzso or zzso domain is located in the zzso part of zzso and exhibits no significant zzso to any other zzso The zzso zzso domain of zzso could completely inhibit the binding of zzso to zzso zzso was expressed by zzso of the tested zzso zzso zzso and was substantially zzso between different zzso The interaction between zzso zzso and SC via zzso represents a novel biological interaction that might increase zzso by the impairment of bacterial zzso
