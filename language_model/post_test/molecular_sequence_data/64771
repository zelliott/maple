zzso targeting is essential for domain specialization in polarized zzso In zzso three distinct membrane zzso exist in the outer zzso plasma zzso disk zzso and disk zzso zzso zzso slow zzso and zzso are zzso members of the zzso 4 zzso of zzso zzso which participate in disk zzso and zzso to rod outer segment zzso disk zzso We examined the role of their C zzso in targeting by generating transgenic zzso zzso expressing green fluorescent protein zzso fusion zzso A zzso fusion containing zzso zzso of zzso localized zzso to disk zzso A longer fusion zzso zzso also localized to the zzso but exhibited higher affinity for disk rims than disk zzso In contrast, the zzso C zzso did not promote zzso zzso The zzso fusion proteins did not zzso with zzso or zzso suggesting this region does not form zzso interactions and is not involved in zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso correlated with disrupted zzso zzso zzso tips, and membrane zzso These abnormalities may reflect competition of the fusion proteins for other proteins that interact with zzso This work describes novel roles for the C zzso of zzso in targeting and maintaining zzso structure and its potential involvement in inherited retinal zzso
