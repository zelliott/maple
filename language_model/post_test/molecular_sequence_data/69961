The molecular parameters zzso area, surface potential, collapse pressure, zzso moment zzso of zzso derivatives of zzso zzso and of zzso were studied in zzso zzso at the zzso (145 zzso pH zzso interface at 22 zzso zzso degrees zzso The chemical modifications included zzso of the fatty zzso chain zzso linked to the zzso position of the zzso zzso zzso The compounds studied were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso fatty zzso chain and the zzso group on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Relatively small modifications of the chemical structure of zzso introduce dramatic consequences on their surface molecular zzso The absence of the long chain fatty zzso zzso and of the zzso group on the zzso acid in zzso leads to a more condensed behavior and to an increase of the collapse pressure compared with zzso The zzso or zzso at the zzso position in zzso and zzso induce an expansion of the surface zzso zzso and a decrease of the collapse zzso The limiting molecular areas of zzso zzso taken at the collapse pressure point, are consistent with the zzso chain being oriented approximately zzso to the zzso zzso shows a liquid expanded zzso The zzso and successive zzso of the zzso zzso at the zzso position of zzso cause a progressive increase in the limiting molecular zzso The variation of the zzso zzso moment under zzso calculated from the surface potential values, suggests the zzso of selective groups within these molecules that depend on the degree of zzso zzso zzso correlations on the basis of the molecular parameters of these derivatives suggest that small zzso of the zzso group at the zzso position of zzso could have large and amplified consequences on the type, zzso and stability of the possible zzso structure that these lipids may form in zzso zzso
