Genome sequencing revealed that all six zzso zzso contain three zzso genes zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso indicates that these genes are likely to have been present in zzso since the beginning of the zzso zzso of deduced zzso acid sequences of the three zzso genes with those of other organisms showed high zzso only for zzso although comparison of critical zzso acid zzso that are required for zzso binding of the zzso coli zzso zzso revealed substantial conservation in all three zzso zzso This was further supported by three-dimensional structural zzso All three genes are expressed zzso throughout the zzso cycle of zzso zzso although zzso is expressed at much higher levels than are zzso and zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso and zzso was elevated when zzso cells infected with zzso zzso were subjected to heat zzso Western zzso analysis with zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated the presence of the three proteins in zzso zzso elementary bodies, with zzso being present in the largest zzso Only zzso zzso zzso and zzso together zzso a zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso did not occur with zzso or zzso alone or together with zzso The role for each of the three zzso in the zzso zzso cycle and in disease zzso requires further zzso
