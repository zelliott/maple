The novel zzso zzso zzso genes zzso a unique zzso family of zzso regulatory zzso which possess an zzso zzso variable zzso domain and may function in innate zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso have been assembled into a zzso spanning approximately 350 zzso Resolution of the complete zzso gene cluster has led to the identification of eight previously zzso families of zzso and has revealed the presence of zzso zzso within the zzso A maximum zzso of 36 zzso genes zzso gene sequences in total) can be grouped into 12 distinct families, including zzso and zzso zzso An extreme level of zzso zzso is reflected in zzso zzso zzso variation, and zzso zzso zzso In addition, the exceptional diversity of zzso sequences among species suggests divergent evolution of this zzso family with a zzso process of member zzso zzso modeling of zzso zzso structures reveals a significant shift in the spatial orientation of the zzso fold, in the region of highest zzso variation, compared with zzso V zzso These studies resolve a complete immune gene cluster in zzso and indicate that the zzso represent the most complex family of zzso surface receptors thus far zzso
