Assessing the rate of evolution depends on our ability to detect selection at several genes zzso We zzso DNA sequence variation data in three new and six previously published data sets from the left arm of the second zzso of zzso zzso in a population from West Africa, the presumed area of origin of this zzso Four zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were previously found to zzso from a neutral zzso equilibrium as a consequence of one or several selective zzso zzso data from five zzso from intervening regions zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not show the characteristic zzso from neutrality caused by local selective zzso This zzso region is zzso for the zzso zzso Four zzso located near inversion zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed significant structuring between the two arrangements or significant zzso from neutrality in the zzso class, probably as a result of a recent shift in inversion zzso Overall, these patterns of variation suggest that the four selective events were zzso Six zzso were observed with no a zzso knowledge of selection, and independent selective sweeps were detected in three of zzso This suggests that a large part of the zzso zzso zzso has experienced the effect of positive selection in its ancestral African zzso
