The putative first zzso and third zzso zzso are known to play important roles in defining the transport properties of the type zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Forster, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To investigate whether other stretches that link predicted zzso zzso are also involved, the zzso zzso accessibility method zzso was applied to sites in the predicted first and fourth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso based on the zzso zzso zzso with zzso novel zzso were expressed in zzso zzso and their function was zzso by isotope zzso and zzso zzso important sites were identified in both zzso by exposing cells to membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso modification reaction rates for sites in zzso were faster than those in zzso which suggested that the latter were less accessible from the zzso zzso Generally, a finite zzso activity remained at the end of the modification zzso The change in activity was due to altered zzso zzso of the zzso zzso For example, zzso substitution at zzso in zzso resulted in zzso zzso zzso activity for V zzso or zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso exhibited a linear zzso zzso After zzso zzso this zzso displayed a zzso zzso dependency in the same zzso zzso The opposite behavior was documented for zzso substitution at zzso in zzso zzso of zzso at two other sites in zzso zzso and zzso also resulted in zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso Taken together, these findings suggest that zzso and zzso may not directly form part of the transport pathway, but specific sites in these zzso can interact directly or indirectly with parts of zzso that undergo zzso zzso changes and thereby influence the zzso dependency of zzso
