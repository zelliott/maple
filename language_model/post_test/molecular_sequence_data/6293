The present study was undertaken to provide a highly sensitive detection system for the identification and zzso of zzso zzso separated by sodium zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso zzso of high specific activity zzso zzso was prepared zzso by reaction of zzso directly with zzso zzso zzso and zzso by reaction of zzso complex with zzso zzso Both zzso zzso samples were suitable as zzso for the detection of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso G, pancreatic zzso and zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso irreversible zzso zzso zzso zzso used in combination with this detection system enabled respective zzso to be selectively zzso and thus positively zzso The zzso zzso detection system was highly sensitive and could detect as little as zzso zzso zzso zzso of active zzso zzso In zzso a method has been developed for the sensitive detection of zzso zzso separated by zzso The method is more sensitive and convenient to perform than conventional zzso and significantly, when used in conjunction with specific zzso zzso zzso or specific zzso can yield appreciable information on the identity of the respective zzso zzso being zzso zzso the molecular mass of the zzso zzso may be reliably obtained by this zzso This method should find application in identifying the role that zzso zzso play in the zzso of zzso tissue zzso
