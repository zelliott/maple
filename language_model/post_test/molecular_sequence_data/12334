The purpose of this study was to determine the zzso and zzso potential of zzso during zzso by comparing the efficacy of dialysis with zzso to that of dialysis with zzso zzso zzso Eleven patients with chronic zzso failure and on maintenance zzso were included in this open zzso zzso Conventional doses of zzso were administered during the first dialysis of the zzso Two days later zzso at a dose of zzso zzso was given as a zzso at the start of the second zzso The mean decreases in plasma levels of zzso zzso acid and zzso were approximately 50% after dialysis with both zzso zzso was therefore equally zzso However, effective dialysis with zzso was achieved with a shorter activated partial zzso time zzso range 65 to 103 zzso compared to that with zzso zzso 120 zzso thereby decreasing the risk of zzso zzso less zzso zzso accumulated at the inlet of the artificial kidney when zzso was used, suggesting a smaller loss of hollow fiber zzso The results indicate that zzso may be a suitable alternative zzso for use during zzso and it thus warrants further zzso
