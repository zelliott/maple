The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which controls the rate of mouse zzso embryonic zzso division and subsequent survival of the zzso maps to the Q region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Mouse zzso were treated with zzso zzso to zzso for the Q region genes zzso each of which encodes the zzso zzso The reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was used to show that zzso treatment, but not sense treatment, decreased the level of zzso for zzso zzso in zzso zzso Furthermore, both the expression of zzso protein and the rate of embryonic zzso division were decreased by treatment with zzso but not sense zzso These results provide direct evidence that the zzso gene zzso is at least partially zzso by the zzso zzso It is likely that the mouse zzso gene has a human zzso perhaps within zzso Identification of zzso as the zzso zzso affect survival of the zzso may be vitally important for the enhancement of animal and human zzso zzso
