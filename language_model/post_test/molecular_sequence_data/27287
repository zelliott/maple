zzso is an zzso zzso protein that appears in zzso forms in the brains of patients with Parkinson's zzso The conversion from zzso to zzso is complex, and zzso rates are sensitive to changes in zzso acid sequence and environmental zzso It has previously been observed that zzso zzso faster at low pH than at neutral zzso Here, we combine zzso zzso and molecular simulations to characterize zzso zzso ensembles at both neutral and low pH in order to understand how the altered charge distribution at low pH changes the structural properties of these ensembles and leads to an increase in zzso zzso The zzso which has a small positive charge at neutral pH due to a balance of positively and zzso charged zzso acid zzso is very positively charged at low zzso zzso the zzso zzso is highly zzso charged at neutral pH and becomes essentially neutral and zzso at low zzso Our zzso experiments and replica exchange molecular dynamics simulations indicate that there is a significant structural reorganization within the zzso ensemble relative to that at neutral pH in terms of long-range zzso zzso zzso and the amount of zzso within the zzso zzso At neutral zzso there is a very zzso ensemble with transient contacts between the zzso and the zzso beta component zzso however, at low zzso there is a more homogeneous ensemble that exhibits strong contacts between the zzso and the zzso At both pH values, transient contacts between the zzso and zzso are observed, the zzso region shows similar exposure to zzso and the entire protein shows similar zzso to secondary zzso Based on the comparison of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso we propose that exposure of the zzso region to zzso and the zzso propensity are not factors that account for differences in propensity to zzso in this zzso Instead, the comparison of the zzso and zzso ensembles suggests that the change in long-range interactions between the low- and zzso zzso the zzso of the zzso region at low zzso and the uneven distribution of charges across the sequence are key to faster zzso
