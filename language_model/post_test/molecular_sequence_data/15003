To determine the frequency of dual zzso and zzso zzso infection among a cohort of 64 zzso zzso individuals in zzso zzso 

Blood was collected every 3-6 months for up to 36 months and zzso was extracted from zzso zzso zzso zzso location zzso was amplified by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso As zzso in this zzso indicate zzso genetic zzso in the gag fragment, their presence reveals dual zzso zzso were confirmed by zzso zzso 

zzso were generated by specimens of 10 subjects zzso zzso zzso estimate of maintenance of single infection was zzso the zzso of a 2 infection was found to be approximately zzso zzso infection was identified in the final specimens of five subjects, after as much as 18 months zzso while for the remaining five subjects, dual infection was identified in interim specimens within an average of 10 months zzso Analysis of samples obtained after dual infection from each of these latter five subjects revealed two zzso zzso to initial strain, or replacement of initial zzso Four subjects were zzso with zzso strains of the same zzso while 6 were infected with different zzso 

The high prevalence of zzso zzso strains in Cameroon may in part be explained by the high frequency of dual zzso In this zzso zzso zzso dual infections and the zzso viruses they generate are strongly driving viral evolution, complicating vaccine zzso
