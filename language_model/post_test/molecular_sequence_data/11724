Two zzso zzso zzso zzso fragments carrying five zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli as zzso inclusion zzso Their variable heavy zzso and light zzso zzso are derived from the mouse zzso zzso 215 zzso specific for the largest zzso of zzso zzso II of zzso zzso and rat zzso zzso specific for pig brain zzso zzso contains an additional zzso zzso near to its zzso After zzso of inclusion bodies followed by immobilized metal affinity zzso zzso in zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso fragments were separated by size exclusion zzso In addition, a fraction of zzso zzso zzso zzso was also zzso The various zzso forms appear to be in equilibrium after zzso since first peak composed mainly of zzso could be resolved into a similar pattern of zzso zzso and zzso after repeating the zzso zzso All zzso of the zzso zzso demonstrated high zzso activity and specificity as shown by zzso zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso zzso zzso zzso carried out by competitive zzso showed that zzso linked zzso have binding zzso quite close to those of the parental zzso and fourfold higher than zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso through the free zzso group, recognize the corresponding zzso in zzso and Western zzso analysis, thus demonstrating the possibility of using chemically modified zzso zzso for zzso
