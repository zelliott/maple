zzso of many zzso zzso genes has greatly contributed to the understanding of the zzso responses of plant cells to zzso stress at the molecular zzso In this study we constructed a zzso library and generated 15 salt zzso zzso from this library to use as molecular markers that reflect the cellular responses to salt stress responses in zzso The sequence analysis showed that 5 salt zzso zzso were identical to previously identified genes in zzso 6 zzso were zzso to known genes found in plants as well as zzso and 4 zzso were new zzso To confirm that expression of these clones are induced by salt stress, we carried out Northern zzso zzso When we examined for 15 zzso zzso they were indeed induced by zzso zzso The induction level was variable among these genes ranging from approximately zzso to more than zzso Also, Northern zzso analysis revealed that these genes can be divided into three different induction zzso early zzso late zzso and continuous zzso
