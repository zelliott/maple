Major zzso complex zzso genes play an important role in the immune response of zzso zzso zzso and evolutionary mechanism of zzso genes have been investigated in many zzso but much less is known in zzso We examined the zzso gene zzso and balancing selection of the zzso class II zzso gene of the zzso tongue sole zzso zzso 23 zzso were found in this zzso Gene zzso zzso as three to six distinct sequences at each domain in the same zzso zzso zzso occurred at a significantly higher frequency than synonymous zzso in the zzso domain, suggesting balancing selection for maintaining zzso at the zzso II zzso zzso Many positive selection sites were found to act very intensely on zzso sites of zzso class II zzso zzso
