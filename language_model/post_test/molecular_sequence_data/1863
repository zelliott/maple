An zzso was previously described that protects zzso against a wide variety of insults directly and indirectly as a result of interactions (at zzso zzso with supporting zzso zzso The current study set out to identify the zzso binding molecules so as to understand the high affinity mechanisms of cellular zzso Studies utilizing affinity zzso of brain extracts identified zzso the brain major zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis with pure zzso and the zzso zzso verified this zzso When added to cerebral cortical zzso the zzso zzso zzso induced a rapid zzso reorganization into distinct zzso structures that were stained by zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a similar change and was detected in the zzso zzso even when cells were incubated at 4 degrees C or at low zzso In a zzso system, the zzso zzso zzso assembly into zzso Furthermore, treatment of zzso with zinc zzso resulted in zzso zzso and cell death that was protected by the zzso In conclusion, the results suggest that the zzso crosses the plasma membrane and interacts directly with zzso the zzso zzso to induce zzso reorganization and improved zzso Because zzso are the key component of the zzso and zzso zzso that regulates cell division, zzso and protection, this finding may explain the breadth and efficiency of the cellular protective capacities of the zzso
