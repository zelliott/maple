There is now evidence for the existence of two zzso genes in most zzso species, and even three zzso genes in zzso To help clarify the evolutionary relationships between the different zzso zzso currently known, we characterized the zzso zzso in a zzso species, the zzso zzso zzso and compared them with the corresponding regions in the human and zzso zzso The occurrence of three zzso zzso termed zzso zzso and zzso has been previously demonstrated in the zzso zzso hybrid mapping assigned these three genes to linkage groups 15, 23 and 2, zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene and the human zzso gene was revealed by comparative zzso analysis, indicating that zzso zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso In contrast, using a similar approach, it was not possible to identify the evolutionary relationships between the zzso zzso gene of zzso and the other zzso zzso zzso
