The zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso The protein is composed of a zzso ratio of a large zzso zzso with an estimated molecular weight of zzso and a small zzso zzso with an estimated molecular weight of zzso The native molecular weight was zzso indicating that the protein adopts an alpha 3 beta 3 native zzso zzso of iron and zzso zzso gave 2 zzso of each per zzso of alpha beta zzso The zzso spectrum showed zzso at 325 and 450 zzso with a broad shoulder at 550 zzso The spectrum was zzso upon reduction of the protein with zzso in the presence of zzso amounts of zzso and zzso zzso The electron zzso resonance spectrum of the reduced protein showed three signals at zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These properties are characteristic of proteins that contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso was oxidized to zzso by zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was also oxidized to a zzso but only zzso was converted to product under the same conditions that gave zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso zzso is proposed to be the terminal zzso component of zzso zzso where zzso binding and zzso occur via addition of molecular oxygen and two reducing zzso
