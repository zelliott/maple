zzso zzso zzso is an zzso in zzso that zzso the formation of zzso from zzso and couples this reaction with the synthesis of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso + zzso + zzso zzso zzso + zzso + zzso zzso zzso Selig, zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso with a yield of zzso to apparent zzso zzso The zzso zzso had an apparent molecular mass of 145 zzso and was composed of two zzso with apparent molecular masses of 47 zzso and 25 zzso indicating an zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences of both zzso were zzso they do not show significant identity to other proteins in zzso The zzso zzso zzso the zzso conversion of zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso and zzso The apparent zzso value in the direction of zzso formation was 18 zzso (55 degrees zzso the apparent zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso were 17 zzso 60 zzso and 200 zzso zzso zzso and zzso could not be replaced by zzso and zzso defining the zzso as an zzso rather than an zzso zzso zzso The apparent zzso value in the direction of zzso formation was about 40 zzso (55 degrees zzso and the apparent zzso values for zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso 80 zzso and 30 zzso zzso The zzso zzso was not specific for zzso or zzso in addition to zzso zzso the zzso accepts zzso zzso and zzso zzso and in addition to zzso zzso the zzso accepts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso indicating that the zzso functions as an zzso zzso zzso with a broad zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not serve as zzso for the zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were used, and in addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso were not zzso The zzso was dependent on zzso which could be partly zzso by zzso and zzso The pH optimum was pH zzso The zzso has a temperature optimum at 90 degrees C, which is in accordance with its zzso function under zzso zzso The zzso was stabilized against heat zzso by zzso In the presence of zzso (1 zzso which was most effective, the zzso did not loose activity after 2 h incubation at 100 degrees zzso
