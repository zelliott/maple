zzso zzso form a small but zzso group of zzso and it is still unclear whether they should be subdivided into three zzso zzso zzso zzso or remain a single zzso zzso In order to decide whether a new zzso zzso should be established for the species zzso zzso and zzso zzso we have characterized the entire zzso cluster in zzso zzso zzso zzso and compared it with the zzso region from zzso zzso and with complete zzso gene sequences from other zzso zzso From a zzso zzso library a zzso zzso zzso containing the entire zzso repeat unit was zzso In this paper we report the primary sequence of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso coding zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes are zzso zzso 158 zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The two sequences of the larger zzso genes exhibit zzso zzso and zzso zzso similarity with the zzso genes from zzso zzso The differences between the zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso however, are much smaller than the zzso differences within the zzso sequences of other zzso zzso zzso subdivision of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso and zzso does not to seem to be zzso
