A new zzso method zzso zzso has been developed to detect zzso zzso zzso artifacts generated during zzso amplification from mixed bacterial zzso In contrast to other zzso methods zzso zzso that define sequence similarity by zzso matching, the zzso alignment method uses the score from dynamic programming zzso Further, the zzso alignments are displayed to the user to assist in sequence zzso The distribution of improvement scores for 500 authentic, zzso sequences and 300 artificial zzso zzso from authentic zzso was used to study the sensitivity and accuracy of both zzso alignment and zzso At a constant rate of authentic sequence zzso zzso zzso alignment incorrectly classified zzso of the artificial zzso versus zzso for zzso Interestingly, only zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso were zzso by both programs, suggesting that optimum performance is obtained by using the two methods to assign sequences to three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and sequences that need further study by other zzso This study suggests that zzso matching methods are more sensitive than zzso methods when there is significant parental sequence zzso while the opposite becomes true as the sequences become more zzso zzso The software and a World Wide Web-based server are available at zzso zzso
