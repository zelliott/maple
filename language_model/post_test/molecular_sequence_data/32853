zzso zzso acid amplification methods can be extremely useful for the identification and zzso of zzso acid zzso but are more difficult to adapt to protein or other zzso To facilitate the development of real-time rolling circle amplification zzso for protein targets, we have developed a novel type of zzso zzso that can be zzso upon interaction with its protein target, the zzso growth factor zzso Using the zzso zzso real-time RCA can be used to specifically zzso zzso down to the zzso range zzso of zzso zzso zzso even against a background of cellular zzso The zzso can also be adapted to RCA on surfaces, although zzso proved to be more zzso One of the great advantages of the method described zzso is that it can be immediately adapted to almost any zzso and does not require two or more affinity zzso as do sandwich or proximity zzso
