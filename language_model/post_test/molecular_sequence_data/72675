zzso DNA sequencing in the vicinity of the zzso gene from zzso tuberculosis allowed us to zzso sequence and identify a gene zzso a zzso zzso The size of the protein was confirmed by in zzso coupled zzso Its zzso domain shows extensive sequence similarity with the zzso domain of zzso zzso protein zzso and the protein was therefore called zzso zzso protein zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence contains two zzso zzso which flank a highly repetitive region, suggesting a zzso zzso The zzso gene was zzso in zzso coli and the gene product zzso was zzso as a fusion protein with zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to be zzso on zzso zzso and capable of zzso zzso basic proteins from bovine brain and zzso from calf zzso on zzso zzso both in a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso basic proteins by zzso was inhibited by calcium and by zzso a widely used inhibitor of zzso protein zzso zzso A similar gene was found in zzso zzso zzso DNA by Southern zzso zzso Its expression was detected in cultures of zzso zzso zzso by reverse zzso Although its biological role is unknown, it is the first zzso protein zzso characterized in zzso
