We have isolated and zzso zzso clones zzso the entire sequence of the bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid precursor has a calculated molecular mass of 275 zzso Analysis of the sequence indicates that the protein has a zzso zzso signal zzso a zzso zzso region, a single zzso zzso region, and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso region consists of 15 zzso repeating zzso one of which contains a zzso zzso that is similar to the type II repeat of zzso The 15 zzso have an average size of 147 zzso acids and a distinctive pattern of 8 zzso zzso zzso of the 15 zzso and the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso shows that all have sequence similarities and suggests that all are zzso
