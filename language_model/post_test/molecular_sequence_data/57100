We have examined the effects of positively and zzso charged zzso on the zzso of outer membrane protein A precursor zzso across the bacterial inner zzso zzso does not zzso across the membrane when 2 positively charged zzso are inserted immediately after the leader zzso whereas it does insert when 2 neutral or zzso charged zzso are zzso Using a zzso zzso system, we show that the membrane potential zzso the rate of initial zzso of zzso with zzso charged zzso inhibited zzso with positively charged zzso and had no effect on neutral zzso Thus, zzso zzso render zzso zzso for loop formation, which then zzso the zzso zzso
