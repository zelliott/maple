zzso dynamics simulations coupled with functional analyses of the major zzso zzso transfer protein zzso identify structural elements involved in regulating the ability of zzso to execute zzso zzso The molecular dynamics simulations suggest large rigid body motions within the zzso zzso accompany closing and opening of an zzso zzso gate, and that zzso of this zzso gate determines access to the zzso zzso binding zzso The data also project that zzso dynamics of the zzso gate are controlled by a hinge unit zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso that links to the zzso and zzso ends of the zzso gate, and by a novel gating module zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso through which zzso information is zzso to the zzso The zzso motif of zzso plays an important role in that zzso zzso These simulations offer new zzso possibilities for an important zzso of the zzso zzso exchange cycle that occurs on membrane surfaces after zzso has ejected bound zzso and is zzso with another zzso zzso These zzso transitions further suggest structural rationales for known disease zzso zzso that functionally compromise zzso members of the zzso zzso
