A zzso acid zzso zzso zzso released by zzso zzso of zzso zzso domain 1 was tested for its ability to antagonize the zzso and zzso effect of zzso in zzso zzso A single dose of zzso or zzso zzso zzso or 50 zzso zzso given zzso or into the zzso zzso suppressed the zzso induced by 209 zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso to 59% and zzso to zzso zzso None of the doses tested zzso to 432 zzso 5 zzso to 1 zzso modified systemic blood zzso zzso a single IV dose of zzso zzso zzso blocked the action of zzso for more than 3 zzso zzso blockade by zzso was zzso completely by the zzso zzso B2 zzso inhibitor zzso zzso On a zzso basis, zzso is more effective than BK and zzso of 15, 16, and 18 zzso acids for blocking the zzso zzso As with BK and other zzso the zzso effect of zzso on zzso is obtained only within a small range of zzso zzso A single dose of zzso or zzso zzso zzso or 47 zzso zzso zzso BK is ineffective against zzso if injected zzso However, when both substances are administered zzso at these zzso doses, they totally suppress zzso zzso These results raise the question of whether zzso released from zzso domain 1, either alone or associated with zzso may interact with zzso in the regulation of urinary water and zzso zzso in zzso and pathological zzso
