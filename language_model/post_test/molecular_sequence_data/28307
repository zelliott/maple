The feasibility for zzso zzso in neuroendocrine zzso on the basis of the universal property and inherent specificity of their molecular weights was zzso As a model, a comprehensive zzso analysis of zzso peptides from bovine zzso zzso was zzso Two suitable zzso zzso zzso zzso and fast atom zzso zzso zzso and each method could identify more than 20 zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso these peptides account for almost the entire lengths of zzso zzso and zzso Some of the zzso determined molecular weights did not match any known zzso Three of these species were identified as zzso joining zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso by conventional sequence zzso
