zzso are insect zzso with significant importance worldwide for agricultural and zzso zzso The chemical pesticides used to control zzso could result in zzso zzso in agricultural and zzso products as well as in negative effects on the zzso zzso alternative control methods are urgently zzso This study identified a new gene from strain zzso of the symbiotic zzso zzso zzso and expressed the zzso inhibitor protein zzso by the zzso The effects of the protein on the pea zzso zzso zzso were also zzso 

The gene zzso zzso the zzso inhibitor protein against zzso was successfully cloned from zzso The study demonstrated that the protein had adverse effects on pea zzso survival, and that the activity of zzso zzso was significantly inhibited by the zzso 

The results from this study suggest that this gene and the zzso inhibitor protein zzso may offer an alternative method to control zzso in the zzso
