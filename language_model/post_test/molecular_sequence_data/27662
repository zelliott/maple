The zzso zzso like its cellular zzso zzso encodes a short-lived nuclear protein involved in processes affecting growth and differentiation in a number of cell zzso Fusion zzso in which zzso sequences are linked to the DNA binding domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso can activate zzso from a reporter gene linked in zzso to a zzso binding zzso The domain of zzso responsible for zzso zzso is located between zzso 204 and zzso and is both necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso zzso and zzso proteins can also activate transcription, via a zzso binding site linked in zzso to a reporter zzso A zzso protein bearing a deletion in the zzso domain is no longer capable of stimulating zzso
