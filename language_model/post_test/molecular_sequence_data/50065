zzso is often observed in the primary and zzso structures of zzso We are intrigued by the potential role played by zzso in the evolution of proteins and have created artificial zzso proteins from repeats of short DNA sequences zzso In this paper we characterize the zzso properties of six such artificially created zzso which are the translated products of repeats of three zzso Three of the six proteins contain zzso structures and are rather zzso in zzso These proteins form zzso zzso structures in the presence of zzso zzso zzso suggesting they have the capacity to promote strong zzso zzso Of the other three zzso one is comprised of zzso and two have zzso zzso Small angle X-ray scattering analysis indicates that the artificial proteins do not fold as tightly as natural zzso but are more compact than if completely zzso One zzso protein whose zzso unit was designed from coiled zzso proteins was zzso demonstrating that zzso artificial proteins can undergo transition to a more ordered state under appropriate zzso Application of this approach to the development of a novel protein engineering system is zzso
