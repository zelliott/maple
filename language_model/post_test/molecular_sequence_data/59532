Modular zzso zzso govern the synthesis of a number of medically important zzso and there is therefore great interest in understanding how genetic manipulation may be used to produce hybrid zzso that might zzso novel zzso In particular, we aimed to show whether an individual domain can be replaced by a comparable domain from a different zzso zzso to form a functional hybrid zzso To simplify the analysis, we have used our zzso model system zzso consisting of the first two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 

We show here that replacing the entire zzso zzso domain from module 1 of zzso by the AT domain from module 2 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso as predicted, to the synthesis of two novel zzso zzso in good yield, in place of the two zzso produced by zzso Both of the novel products specifically lack a zzso group at zzso of the zzso zzso 

Although the AT domain is a core structural domain of a modular zzso zzso it has been swapped to generate a truly hybrid zzso with a rationally altered specificity of chain zzso zzso zzso carried out on known zzso antibiotics might therefore generate families of potentially useful zzso that are zzso by chemical zzso These results also encourage the belief that other zzso may be similarly zzso
