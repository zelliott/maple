zzso or zzso human zzso zzso factors zzso react with eight zzso sites on the zzso zzso domain, four sites on zzso and two on human beta zzso All 14 of these zzso zzso are linear zzso zzso acid peptides with different primary zzso We questioned whether zzso zzso with such a variety of zzso showing no obvious sequence zzso might result from zzso similarities shared by various zzso zzso Strong support for this concept was obtained using rabbit zzso as well as mouse zzso to individual zzso zzso or beta zzso zzso zzso Major zzso was demonstrated between most of the 14 different zzso zzso or beta zzso zzso peptides using individual zzso zzso zzso zzso studies of these peptides showed striking similarities in three-dimensional shape among many zzso zzso zzso atoms rather than side chains seemed to contribute most directly to zzso zzso zzso simulation studies on control peptides showed no zzso similarities with zzso zzso Our studies indicate that zzso such as zzso recognize zzso zzso of zzso zzso and react with a number of zzso zzso of quite different primary sequence but similar main chain zzso
