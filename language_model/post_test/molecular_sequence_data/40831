The zzso type zzso zzso system zzso is a pivotal zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso more than 100 zzso proteins into host zzso using zzso zzso modulating host cellular functions to establish a zzso niche within host zzso The zzso core complex spanning the inner and outer zzso is thought to be made up of at least five zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is the outer membrane zzso its targeting depends on zzso zzso and zzso However, the core complex structure and assembly mechanism are still zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso at zzso zzso zzso The structure of zzso is distinct from that of zzso the outer membrane zzso of the type zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso domain of zzso is remarkably similar to the zzso zzso of zzso the integral outer membrane proteins that form zzso zzso for the type II and the type III zzso systems zzso and zzso A short zzso in the otherwise zzso zzso region, located on the zzso zzso of the zzso domain, is essential for outer membrane targeting of zzso and zzso zzso core complex zzso These findings uncover an intriguing link between zzso and zzso
