The crystal structure of human zzso zzso a target for zzso drugs, is determined to zzso A resolution and refined to a zzso residual of zzso The structure implicates the zzso in a mechanism for zzso the zzso of zzso into the active zzso This mechanism involves a twist of approximately 180 degrees of the active site loop, zzso around the neighboring zzso 184 and zzso and implicates ordering of zzso zzso specific zzso along with the zzso closure of the active site upon zzso zzso The highly zzso but zzso zzso of twelve zzso zzso zzso and of eight zzso between 156 and 157 zzso are known to be zzso in other zzso and lie close together on the outside of the protein in regions of zzso electron density in this crystal zzso Two zzso zzso 202 zzso and zzso zzso are close enough to form a zzso bond within each zzso and a third zzso zzso 183 zzso is positioned to form a zzso bond with the active site zzso zzso 198 zzso in its zzso zzso The zzso terminal 27 zzso unique to human zzso contains 8 zzso zzso is also in a region of zzso electron density, and is likely to be flexible prior to zzso zzso The drug resistance zzso zzso zzso a zzso reduction in zzso affinity and zzso reduction in zzso for the zzso zzso Though indirectly connected to the active site, the structure suggests a mechanism of resistance that possibly involves a change in zzso This structure offers a unique opportunity for zzso drug design aimed at the zzso form of the human zzso
