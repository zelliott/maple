Multiple zzso occur in zzso of zzso zzso Their development may be caused by the presence of a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso type 2 zzso zzso The zzso gene in patients with zzso associated multiple zzso remains to be zzso Recently, zzso was reported to be a potential zzso gene for multiple zzso in a family with zzso and multiple zzso However, involvement of this gene in the development of the zzso was not zzso 

Five affected members of a large family with multiple zzso were investigated for the presence of zzso in zzso and zzso A zzso zzso was identified in zzso 2 of zzso as the zzso zzso zzso zzso to multiple zzso zzso it was demonstrated that, in accordance with the two-hit hypothesis for zzso the zzso zzso was retained and the zzso zzso lost in all four investigated zzso In addition, independent zzso acquired zzso zzso were identified in two zzso of one patient with zzso losses of the zzso zzso zzso 

It is concluded that, analogous to the genetic events in a subset of zzso associated zzso a zzso mechanism of zzso zzso gene zzso involving zzso and zzso might be operative in familial multiple zzso associated zzso
