The fatty acid zzso zzso of animal tissue is a zzso of two identical zzso each with a Mr of zzso The zzso is a single zzso protein having seven zzso activities and a site for binding of the prosthetic group zzso The zzso coding for the zzso has an estimated size of zzso zzso which is about twice the number of zzso needed to code for the estimated zzso zzso zzso We have isolated a positive zzso zzso zzso containing zzso gene sequences by screening a chicken zzso library with a segment of a 3' untranslated region of goose fatty acid zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso The DNA insert in zzso zzso zzso with synthetic zzso zzso prepared according to the known zzso acid sequence of the zzso component of the chicken liver fatty acid zzso zzso zzso Huang, zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso paper in this zzso Further characterization of the DNA insert shows that the zzso zzso clone contains about a zzso segment from the 3' end of the chicken zzso gene that codes for a portion of the zzso zzso Complete sequence analyses of this segment including zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso clone contains the entire 3' untranslated region of the chicken zzso gene and three zzso that code for 162 zzso acids of the zzso domain from the zzso end of the fatty acid zzso Using the zzso region of the zzso zzso we were able to isolate a zzso clone that codes for the entire zzso domain of chicken liver fatty acid zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
