Basic architecture of ABC zzso includes two zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso Although the transport process takes place in the zzso which provide the zzso zzso zzso across the cell membrane and control its accessibility between the two sides of the zzso the energy required for the process is provided by zzso changes induced in the zzso by binding and zzso of zzso zzso zzso changes in the zzso therefore, need to be coupled to structural changes in the zzso Using molecular dynamics simulations, we have investigated the structural elements involved in the zzso zzso between the zzso and the zzso in the zzso coli zzso zzso an ABC importer for which an intact structure is available both in zzso and zzso zzso The prevailing model of zzso is primarily based on a single structural zzso known as the zzso zzso as the main structural element for the zzso zzso Surprisingly, we find that in the absence of the zzso the zzso zzso can be zzso zzso from the rest of the zzso despite their zzso zzso That is, the structural integrity of the zzso zzso and their tight zzso to the core of the zzso rely on the contacts provided by the zzso Based on the zzso and zzso analysis of the simulation zzso we propose that the core zzso elements in the zzso zzso involve contributions from several structural motifs located at the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso from the zzso and the zzso and the zzso motifs from the zzso These three structural motifs in small ABC zzso show a high degree of correlation in motion and mediate the necessary zzso zzso between the core of zzso and the zzso zzso of zzso A comprehensive analysis of the structurally known ABC zzso shows a high degree of conservation of the identified zzso zzso elements only in the zzso of zzso zzso suggesting a distinct mode of zzso zzso from the other two major ABC zzso zzso namely large ABC zzso and ABC zzso
