Human zzso zzso the zzso maturation of many zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso pathways by zzso at the zzso side of the consensus zzso decreases zzso Both the zzso network zzso concentration and zzso zzso of zzso require sequences in its 56 zzso acid zzso zzso Here, we show that the zzso zzso tail contains multiple trafficking zzso zzso to the zzso requires a cluster of zzso zzso acids that, together with a pair of zzso zzso forms a zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso II efficiently zzso these zzso in zzso and using a zzso cell system we provide evidence that zzso II is the in zzso zzso zzso Analysis by mass zzso shows that, in zzso zzso exists as zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, employing zzso zzso zzso that mimic either zzso or zzso zzso and zzso the zzso inhibitor zzso we show that the zzso state of the zzso zzso tail zzso retrieval of the zzso to the zzso Thus, zzso of zzso is a two-tiered process combining a set of trafficking signals comprised of the primary zzso acid sequence of the tail with its zzso zzso
