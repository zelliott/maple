zzso stem cells zzso are present in a wide variety of zzso during development of the human zzso starting as early as the first zzso Gene expression profiling of these cells has focused primarily on the molecular signs characterizing their potential zzso and their differentiation zzso In contrast, molecular mechanisms participating in the emergence of zzso identity in zzso are still poorly zzso In this study, human embryonic stem cells zzso were differentiated toward zzso zzso to compare the genetic patterns between zzso zzso and zzso zzso by a large zzso expression profiling of zzso and zzso zzso After whole zzso differential zzso analysis, a stringent protocol was used to search for genes zzso expressed between zzso and zzso followed by several validation steps to identify the genes most specifically linked to the zzso zzso A network was obtained that zzso 74 genes in 13 interconnected zzso systems that are likely to contribute to zzso zzso zzso of zzso correlated zzso and zzso which suggest zzso zzso were then extracted and validation was sought with the use of zzso We report here that zzso of zzso and zzso in zzso compared with zzso allows an increase in expression of the zzso zzso zzso domain 1) zzso factor that results in the expression of markers of the zzso zzso zzso
