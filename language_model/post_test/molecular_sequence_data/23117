zzso zzso zzso syndrome is an zzso zzso disorder caused by zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso there may be considerable morbidity from extensive skin zzso and painful fissures on the palms and zzso In the absence of any specific treatment, prenatal diagnosis is an option for couples at zzso risk of zzso In 2000, we developed and applied a single cell zzso zzso chain reaction protocol to test one couple for compound zzso zzso 1 gene zzso by zzso genetic diagnosis zzso Although pregnancy was established, an unrelated zzso 22 led to a spontaneous zzso However, eight zzso of known genetic status were zzso at that stage, and we planned to undertake subsequent frozen zzso replacement cycles that might lead to the birth of an unaffected child in this zzso zzso zzso was carried out in June 2000 using standard protocols in a three-step freezing zzso Four zzso were thawed in March 2003, one of which was viable and was used in a frozen zzso replacement cycle, but pregnancy did not zzso The remaining four zzso were thawed in February 2004, two of which were viable (both carriers of the paternal zzso and these were used in a second frozen zzso replacement cycle, and a singleton pregnancy was zzso The child's zzso 1 zzso was assessed by direct zzso sequencing across the site of both potential zzso Following two frozen zzso replacement cycles, and almost 4 years after the initial zzso biopsy and zzso analysis, a pregnancy was achieved that progressed to term with the birth of a healthy baby zzso zzso sequencing of zzso blood DNA, taken immediately after delivery, showed that the child was a zzso carrier of the paternal zzso but not of the maternal zzso This case demonstrates the value of zzso zzso which can increase the number of zzso replacement procedures and hence the cumulative pregnancy rate per retrieval zzso Moreover, this is the first report of successful zzso pregnancy and birth of a healthy baby following exclusion of a severe zzso by zzso The successful outcome of zzso in this case illustrates what is technically possible for couples at risk of recurrence of a severe inherited skin zzso
