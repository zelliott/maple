zzso belonging to the zzso zzso produce numerous important secondary zzso and undergo a sophisticated zzso differentiation zzso In many instances these processes are under the control of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso produces the secondary zzso aromatic zzso zzso zzso In order to explore the role of zzso regulatory zzso in zzso production and zzso in zzso zzso a gene cluster zzso zzso zzso signaling zzso was identified and zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso in zzso produced elevated levels of zzso and displayed conditional zzso defects reminiscent of defects seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso possesses a zzso zzso predicted to be recognized by zzso zzso zzso produced higher levels of zzso than the zzso strain but to a lesser extent than the levels of zzso seen in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were tested for their abilities to bind predicted zzso zzso element zzso boxes within the zzso zzso zzso did not bind any DNA sequences in this region, while zzso bound an ARE box in the region upstream of zzso zzso reverse zzso analysis revealed higher levels of zzso transcript in zzso zzso than in the zzso strain, suggesting that zzso expression is zzso by zzso Based on these data, we propose that the zzso zzso zzso genes zzso components of a signaling zzso which zzso in the regulation of zzso production and zzso
