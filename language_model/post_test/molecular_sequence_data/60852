The crystal structure of the complex of an zzso zzso with an zzso specific for a zzso zzso zzso has previously been reported zzso et zzso 1994, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso To complement this study, the binding characteristics and zzso properties of this zzso and two others raised with a second zzso zzso were investigated, including quantitative kinetic zzso by surface zzso zzso The affinities of the zzso from the zzso for the zzso were three orders of magnitude greater than those estimated for the zzso but the zzso failed to induce zzso zzso that is, they were of the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso for zzso were however within one order of magnitude of their zzso for zzso Tests of 16 other zzso zzso zzso showed that the two zzso were not present in them, and in confirmation of the lack of a dominant zzso zzso sequencing of their H and L chains showed a wide variety of V genes were employed in the immune response to the zzso zzso The failure of the zzso to induce zzso zzso thus appears to be due to neither intrinsic affinity nor zzso frequency, but arises instead from structural reasons, for example, the incomplete penetration of the zzso into the zzso zzso of the zzso The surface topography of zzso zzso and their zzso thus appears to be especially difficult for zzso to mimic and will restrict their routine use as surrogates for zzso independent zzso zzso
