A human zzso virus zzso was isolated from the brain of a patient with progressive zzso but no obvious zzso This zzso designated as zzso was zzso cloned and zzso and its long terminal repeat zzso and envelope sequences were compared with those of other zzso zzso not uniquely associated with zzso The zzso zzso showed marked zzso with the zzso sequences of the other zzso zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the external zzso zzso of zzso revealed a pattern of zzso and variable regions similar to that of other zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso portion of zzso zzso 41, was highly zzso to the counterpart region of other zzso Further analysis is required to determine whether specific sequence variation can account for neurological manifestations of zzso zzso
