The only complete zzso zzso sequences of zzso virus zzso reported to date have been for the zzso zzso strain and zzso which were isolated decades ago, zzso extensively under laboratory conditions, and appeared to be zzso zzso sequencing of many other strains has identified zzso zzso Most recent zzso including those typically zzso belong to zzso distinct from the zzso zzso zzso the sequence of Ed and related strains may not be representative of those of pathological zzso circulating at that or any time in human zzso Taking into account these issues as well as the fact that so many studies have been based upon zzso zzso we have zzso the entire zzso of a recently isolated zzso strain, zzso Between this recent isolate and the classical Ed strain, there were 465 zzso differences zzso and 114 zzso acid differences zzso zzso of zzso and synonymous zzso in open reading frames as well as direct comparisons of zzso regions of each gene and zzso regulatory regions clearly revealed the regions where changes have been permissible and zzso zzso considerable zzso zzso appeared to be permissible for the P frame to maintain a high degree of sequence conservation for the overlapping C zzso However, the cause and the effect were largely unclear for any zzso indicating that there is a considerable gap between the two strains that cannot be zzso The sequence reported here would be useful as a reference of contemporary zzso zzso
