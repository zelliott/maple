In studies of disease zzso increasing knowledge leads to an increased awareness of the complexity of the underlying zzso The intense research activity in the zzso field has made this acutely zzso Numerous zzso have been discovered through the use of zzso zzso of in zzso cell culture zzso and in zzso zzso from animal models of inflammation and zzso molecular biology zzso Any one zzso can often be produced by a number of different cell types and exert its effects on different target zzso This has been interpreted by some as zzso a high degree of zzso Although this is understandable, in disease processes parallel and sequential mechanisms are possible, and potentially important therapeutic targets have zzso There is compelling evidence from animal and clinical studies that zzso are important zzso cells in zzso but this relationship is as yet unproven in the human zzso Two possible targets to prevent zzso recruitment to the lung are zzso and its zzso which are important in several aspects of zzso biology, and zzso and its zzso zzso The zzso zzso is particularly attractive as a target as it is expressed in high numbers on zzso but not other zzso and appears to be the major detector of the zzso for zzso and other zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso knockout mice are being developed, and animal models will continue to be invaluable when zzso are zzso In the shape of zzso antagonists, the zzso field may yet provide the final proof of concept for the long-established zzso theory of asthma in zzso
