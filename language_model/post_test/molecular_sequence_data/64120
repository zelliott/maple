Ho zzso is a zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso in zzso Ho is zzso by a zzso gene but shows 50% primary sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso Ho is unique among zzso zzso in having a zzso zzso putative zinc finger zzso The crystal structure of zzso revealed a zzso zzso with a zzso domain zzso and intervening zzso zzso We made a zzso model for Ho on the basis of the zzso structure and performed zzso analysis of putative critical zzso using a zzso switch as a zzso for activity and zzso proteins to detect nuclear zzso We found that zzso of the zzso sequence of the Hint domain are important for Ho activity, in particular the DNA recognition zzso zzso zzso of the Hint domain are zzso for Ho zzso however, the zzso putative zinc finger domain is zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso in Ho that are zzso relative to zzso zzso zzso in zzso and other related zzso zzso are essential for Ho zzso Our results indicate that in addition to the zzso zzso zzso Hint domain zzso and the zinc finger domain have evolved a critical role in Ho zzso
