zzso zzso acids against specific sequences of mouse zzso virus zzso were tested for their zzso effects on viral zzso in mouse zzso zzso An zzso zzso containing a sequence complementary to leader zzso was zzso and shown to induce a significant zzso effect on the zzso of zzso A zzso which expressed the zzso or sense zzso of zzso was zzso into zzso zzso A decreased zzso of zzso was observed in both cell zzso The zzso cell line which expressed zzso against the zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso The rate of zzso of zzso and the quantity of zzso zzso zzso in this zzso cell line were the same for both zzso and sense zzso These results show that zzso zzso acids might be eligible for use as zzso agents against zzso zzso
