zzso strains were isolated from the pig colon to screen for zzso and acid zzso zzso Among 93 zzso Colony 88 had the highest activities for both zzso and was identified as an zzso coli zzso Using zzso derived from the zzso coli pH zzso acid zzso zzso sequence zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we cloned a zzso zzso DNA zzso from the zzso In spite of zzso zzso between the zzso gene and the zzso 7 zzso acids were different in their deduced zzso To characterize the properties and functions of the zzso zzso we expressed the coding region of the isolated DNA zzso and zzso in zzso zzso respectively, as zzso and zzso The zzso protein zzso like zzso and the zzso zzso expressed in zzso zzso was able to zzso zzso from sodium zzso and zzso zzso However, there were distinct differences in their pH profiles, zzso and zzso for the zzso specific activities of the zzso zzso and abilities to release zzso zzso in soybean zzso In conclusion, the DNA zzso isolated from zzso coli in pig colon seems to zzso for a new acid zzso and is designated as zzso coli zzso
