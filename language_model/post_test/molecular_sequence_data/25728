zzso A is a zzso produced by the zzso zzso zzso and reported to be a potent competitive inhibitor of rat zzso zzso When tested against a number of other zzso zzso A was inactive toward zzso and zzso and zzso as well as zzso but it was a potent inhibitor of jack zzso zzso zzso and rat liver zzso zzso with estimated zzso of 70 zzso 450 zzso and 160 zzso zzso The type of zzso was competitive in zzso This compound also proved to be an effective competitive inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso II zzso of about zzso zzso with zzso zzso as zzso and about 90 zzso with zzso zzso as zzso However, it was virtually inactive toward zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso A had no zzso zzso In cell culture studies, zzso A also proved to be a potent inhibitor of zzso zzso Thus, in influenza virus infected zzso zzso canine kidney zzso cells, zzso A blocked the normal formation of complex types of zzso on the viral zzso and caused the zzso of hybrid types of zzso This observation is in keeping with other data which indicate that the site of action of zzso A is zzso zzso Thus, zzso A represents the first zzso processing inhibitor and adds to the growing list of chemical structures that can have important biological zzso
