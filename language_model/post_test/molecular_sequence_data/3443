zzso are zzso peptides zzso by zzso cells located at the base of zzso zzso In addition to their zzso function, zzso may also regulate salt and water zzso by zzso zzso zzso Recent work with zzso current zzso indicated that at least one zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso including zzso fibrosis, zzso In the present study, we characterized the zzso zzso zzso channel activity in human embryonic kidney zzso cells with single-channel zzso zzso The patch zzso was filled with solution containing different zzso of zzso 3, and, after zzso formation, the channel activity was recorded with either zzso or zzso patch zzso We found an zzso selective channel with a zzso of 15 zzso and open probability of zzso regardless of zzso 3 zzso The mean open and closed times varied with the zzso 3 zzso For zzso 3 zzso of 10, 4, 1, and zzso zzso in the zzso the corresponding mean open times were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the corresponding mean closed times were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso 3 forms zzso channels on the zzso membrane of zzso cells and that the zzso of one such channel are affected by its interaction with other such zzso
