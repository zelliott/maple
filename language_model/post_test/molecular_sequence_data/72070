zzso plasma homocysteine levels are associated with increased risk for cardiovascular disease and neural tube defects in zzso zzso treatment decreases homocysteine levels and dramatically reduces the zzso of neural tube zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a likely target for these actions of zzso The most common genetic cause of mildly elevated plasma homocysteine in humans is the zzso zzso zzso zzso change zzso The X-ray analysis of zzso coli zzso reported here, provides a model for the zzso domain that is shared by all zzso This domain is a zzso barrel that binds zzso in a novel zzso Ala zzso corresponding to Ala 222 in human zzso is near the bottom of the barrel and distant from the zzso The zzso zzso does not affect zzso or zzso but instead increases the propensity for bacterial zzso to lose its essential zzso zzso zzso derivatives protect zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso against zzso loss, and protect human zzso and the zzso zzso against zzso zzso suggesting a mechanism by which folate treatment reduces homocysteine zzso
