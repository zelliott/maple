The Kit zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is a zzso for stem cell factor zzso Kit proteins of mice and humans are expressed in various kinds of zzso zzso cells and are essential for the growth of these zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso that contained an zzso acid change from zzso to zzso corresponding to that in Kit of the zzso zzso mice were produced in zzso cells zzso with expression plasmids containing the chicken zzso zzso and characterized using two kinds of zzso zzso The zzso zzso Kit has previously been shown to be defective for zzso zzso The zzso of 145 zzso zzso and 130 zzso with varying degrees of zzso zzso were zzso Western zzso analysis using an zzso zzso zzso showed that zzso of zzso was greatly enhanced upon chicken zzso zzso The zzso did not respond to mouse zzso The zzso activity of zzso was abolished by the zzso acid zzso indicating the zzso zzso was essential for the zzso In addition, 145 zzso zzso zzso with zzso acid zzso was detected in chicken brain by zzso using the zzso An in zzso zzso zzso showed the zzso activity of this zzso These structural and functional similarities of zzso to zzso Kit proteins shown in this study zzso a possible role of zzso in chicken zzso zzso
