zzso elements zzso are zzso zzso with highly zzso sequence properties and are widespread in the zzso of animal species living in zzso zzso We describe here the first full-length zzso found in the zzso of a marine zzso species, the zzso zzso crab zzso zzso zzso named zzso A comparison of its sequence features with those of the zzso contained in the zzso of zzso species reveals several distinctive zzso First, zzso elements contains an zzso that may zzso three zzso zzso zzso zzso and 398 zzso acids zzso in zzso The two biggest proteins are due to the presence of a zzso and zzso flag, respectively, at the zzso end of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Their zzso contents are also significantly higher than those found in zzso zzso This feature is mainly due to zzso usage in the zzso zzso and directly interferes with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso acid zzso Such an elevated zzso content may interfere with the ability of zzso 1 to form an zzso complex and, in consequence, with its efficiency to zzso Finally, the origin of these characteristics and their possible consequences on zzso efficiency are zzso
