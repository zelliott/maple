The purpose of the present study was to assess the viral diversity of zzso C virus zzso in six zzso patients during three unsuccessful zzso These patients were treated successively with zzso zzso at a zzso of zzso units zzso three times a week, 10 zzso three times a week, and a combination of zzso (3 zzso plus zzso zzso zzso However, only two chronically infected patients could be included in the study due to the persistence of zzso zzso during the three successive zzso The viral diversity was zzso by cloning and sequencing the zzso zzso The treatment of the two zzso patients was associated with the persistence of a wide diversity in the viral population and with the emergence of new or minor zzso Under the influence of standard doses of zzso a zzso of the zzso present was observed at this time zzso No significant change in viral load or in the complexity of the zzso was zzso A second treatment with a high dose of zzso induced a significant decrease in the associated viral load and, in one case, resulted in a radical change of the viral zzso Administration of a combination of zzso and zzso did not affect the evolution of the zzso but was followed by the emergence of various multiple zzso These results reinforce the hypothesis of the presence of zzso zzso best adapted to the host environment, and therefore resistant to any current zzso
