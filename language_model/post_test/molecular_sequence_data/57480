zzso zzso protein zzso was observed in serum by its zzso binding to zzso and by an zzso of 28 zzso under reducing conditions on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso zzso The zzso was isolated by zzso with zzso zzso affinity zzso on zzso zzso with zzso and zzso on zzso zzso rabbit zzso zzso to remove zzso zzso zzso containing the zzso were zzso to zzso and zzso first with zzso zzso to remove zzso and then with zzso to zzso the 28 zzso zzso Further zzso was achieved by zzso zzso on zzso and by zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso showed three high molecular weight bands under zzso zzso The reduced protein gave a single band of 28 zzso On gel zzso zzso under zzso conditions, the protein emerged at a volume corresponding to zzso approximately 750 zzso zzso acid analysis showed the presence of zzso and zzso and a high zzso content zzso suggesting the presence of a zzso zzso This was supported by the zzso of the protein to zzso zzso The zzso 26 zzso acids showed zzso identity with human zzso when three gaps were allowed in the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
