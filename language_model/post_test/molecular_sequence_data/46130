zzso growth factor 2 zzso is a potent zzso and survival factor involved in the regulation of growth, development and reproduction in zzso Only one zzso gene exists in zzso Recently, two zzso genes have been identified in zzso which presumably resulted from gene zzso However, sequence information of duplicated zzso and their functional regulation in other zzso fish is still zzso Here, we report the identification of two zzso zzso in grass zzso zzso zzso Like their human zzso grass carp zzso and zzso zzso zzso two structurally distinct mature zzso zzso Both of them were detected by zzso throughout zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso was observed in zzso whereas zzso zzso were expressed mainly in the zzso and brain with in zzso zzso In adult fish, zzso zzso were transcribed in multiple zzso whereas zzso zzso were detected mainly in the zzso zzso levels of zzso and zzso transcripts were both zzso by growth hormone zzso Furthermore, the levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso decreased significantly during zzso and were rebounded rapidly after zzso Our results suggest that duplicated zzso genes have evolved divergent yet played an overlapping biological role in regulating grass carp growth and zzso
