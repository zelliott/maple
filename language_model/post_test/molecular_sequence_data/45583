zzso virus zzso zzso zzso family zzso contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso Like all zzso the medium zzso zzso segment encodes a precursor zzso zzso for the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso protein zzso The zzso sequences of the M segment of zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso that show zzso mobility differences in their zzso proteins were zzso Twelve zzso acid differences (2 in zzso 10 in zzso were observed between zzso and zzso zzso of which 9 were maintained in zzso and zzso The M zzso segments of zzso and zzso contained internal zzso resulting in the removal of the zzso 239 zzso of zzso zzso or the zzso two thirds of zzso and the zzso 431 zzso acids of zzso zzso The sequence data were consistent with analyses of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that neither the zzso domain of zzso nor an intact zzso protein is required for the replication of zzso in tissue zzso
