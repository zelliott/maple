zzso from the human T leukemia cells zzso were found to bind to the zzso alpha zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso The analysis of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso the major zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso revealed the presence of mainly zzso alpha zzso with only minor amounts zzso zzso of more complex zzso A comparison between zzso and zzso cell zzso involved in the zzso of zzso carbohydrates showed that a markedly lower activity of zzso alpha zzso beta zzso is apparently responsible for the presence of truncated zzso in the zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso makes zzso cells an ideal model to study the initiation of zzso zzso zzso experiments with zzso zzso showed that the addition of zzso to zzso is responsible for the decreased mobility of the mature zzso on sodium zzso zzso gel zzso Furthermore, no zzso zzso between the zzso precursor and the fully zzso form could be detected either with an zzso zzso or with the zzso zzso zzso the chase temperature to 15 degrees C completely inhibited the transfer of zzso to the zzso core indicating that zzso initiation takes place in the first zzso elements and not in transitional zzso between zzso zzso and zzso In addition, treatment of the cells with zzso did not inhibit zzso transfer to zzso zzso These results indicate that the initiation of zzso in zzso cells starts in the zzso zzso
