The zzso chain reaction zzso is a recently developed method zzso a specific DNA sequence in a complex mixture can be selectively amplified and zzso by zzso zzso zzso after zzso We have been able to perform zzso on DNA zzso from zzso zzso as well as on crude DNA obtained by directly boiling zzso thick zzso With the use of appropriate zzso zzso the presence of zzso DNA in infected zzso can be detected with sensitivity and specificity in as short as 6 zzso without the use of zzso zzso zzso may be a viable adjunct to culture techniques for detection of viral diseases, particularly in cases where fresh tissue is not available for zzso
