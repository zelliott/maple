zzso of transforming growth zzso zzso and zzso growth factor zzso was studied in normal pancreatic tissue and in zzso pancreatic zzso of zzso zzso They were given either a low fat, high fiber zzso zzso diet, to inhibit zzso or a low fat diet combined with injections of the zzso analog zzso to enhance zzso The control groups, maintained on a low fat diet, were injected with zzso or were not treated at zzso zzso was performed at 6 and 15 months after the last zzso zzso After both 6 and 15 months zzso revealed a weak expression of zzso and zzso peptides in the zzso cells, and a stronger expression in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was reduced in both putative zzso and zzso zzso cell zzso but no differences in zzso zzso expression were observed between the various stages of zzso pancreatic zzso After 16 months an increase in zzso zzso due to treatment with zzso was detected by zzso zzso in total pancreatic zzso whereas zzso zzso expression had zzso zzso zzso levels in zzso isolated tumors were significantly lower, but zzso zzso levels were significantly higher, than in total pancreatic zzso from zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso zzso levels in isolated tumors did not differ significantly from zzso levels in zzso zzso Neither with zzso nor with zzso were differences in zzso or zzso expression observed due to either zzso or stimulation of zzso It is concluded that putative zzso zzso cell zzso induced in rat zzso by zzso may develop into zzso zzso independently of zzso and zzso The results suggest involvement of these growth factors at the early stage of the zzso process, during the initiation of normal zzso cells into putative zzso zzso However, zzso of zzso pancreatic zzso by zzso or a low fat, high fiber zzso zzso diet appeared not to be regulated by zzso or zzso
