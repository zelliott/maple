The nine tandem zinc finger repeats in the zzso zzso zzso factor zzso zzso from zzso mediate specific binding to zzso DNA as well as to zzso zzso zzso A comparative functional analysis of a systematic set of zzso zinc finger combinations reveals that most, if not all, participate in both DNA and zzso zzso zzso sets of fingers sufficient for DNA and zzso recognition are zzso In zzso zzso most finger elements are found to be functionally zzso However, the zzso finger 6 exhibits zzso binding characteristics distinct from the other eight zzso The zzso structure of the central domain in zzso zzso not its primary zzso is found to carry the essential structural information for zzso binding in zzso zzso Taken together, our findings suggest that zzso and DNA binding are zzso though zzso functions of the nine zinc finger elements in zzso occurring via fundamentally different molecular zzso
