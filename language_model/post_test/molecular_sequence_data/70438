In response to zzso zzso red blood cells zzso zzso and zzso exhibit increased adherence to the vascular zzso while zzso of zzso through the blood vessel zzso However, the cellular signaling zzso caused by zzso is poorly zzso We zzso zzso as a zzso zzso for zzso to study cellular signaling zzso We found that in human zzso vein zzso cells zzso zzso at 2 zzso concentration induced the surface expression of a subset of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso factor zzso in the nuclear extracts of zzso Furthermore, zzso also caused zzso zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso without significantly affecting zzso indicating zzso is the preferred zzso for upstream zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso or zzso factor zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso led to increased SS zzso zzso zzso by a zzso zzso Additionally, zzso caused a two- to zzso increase in the rate of zzso migration of zzso zzso cells and a zzso increase in zzso of zzso zzso cell zzso molecules zzso The zzso migration of zzso was inhibited by an zzso to zzso Both zzso of zzso and zzso migration of zzso in response to zzso were inhibited by protein zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso by protein zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Our data suggests that zzso cellular signals directing increased expression of zzso in zzso involve downstream zzso of zzso zzso and zzso while the zzso of zzso occurs as a result of zzso of zzso We conclude that zzso zzso zzso the zzso or zzso increase in the zzso of SS zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso migration of zzso
