We have shown that the zzso response of zzso zzso cells and zzso zzso cells to zzso can be modulated by zzso zzso independently of zzso zzso To explore the possibility that these zzso zzso zzso zzso by interfering with cellular protective mechanisms, we evaluated their effects on general zzso synthesis and on zzso expression of two proposed protective zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and heat shock protein 70 zzso We found that zzso zzso could inhibit general zzso synthesis in a zzso fashion to a similar extent in both zzso and zzso cells, although these zzso increased or decreased the sensitivity of the cells to zzso zzso In zzso cells, combination of zzso D with these zzso further inhibited the zzso synthesis rate, and it actually decreased the zzso sensitivity of the zzso zzso Furthermore, the expression of zzso or zzso was not regulated by these zzso Thus, zzso resistance must depend on other mechanisms in addition to the expression of these protective zzso
