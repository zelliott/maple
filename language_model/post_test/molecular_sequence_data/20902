Male zzso zzso and zzso a pair of zzso zzso are transferred to female via zzso to stimulate female blood feeding in the tick zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso animals with zzso zzso and zzso have been shown as highly resistant to the tick zzso In this study, we describe the cloning and characterization of zzso zzso from the tick zzso zzso zzso zzso the major zzso for East Coast fever in Eastern zzso The sequence analysis of the zzso zzso zzso indicated that the deduced zzso acid sequence had high similarity with zzso of the tick zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is zzso in different tick zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso analysis showed that male zzso was predominantly expressed in zzso and its expression was induced by blood zzso zzso zzso zzso was not zzso into the host during tick feeding and was detected in zzso female zzso as measured by Western zzso zzso vaccination of rabbits with zzso zzso the zzso immunity and zzso protective immunity against female zzso resulting in the reduced fed zzso These results suggest that zzso could be a good candidate as zzso zzso
