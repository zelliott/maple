Within zzso coli and other species, a clear zzso bias exists among the 61 zzso acid zzso found within the population of zzso zzso and the level of zzso zzso appears directly zzso to the frequency of zzso zzso Given this situation, one would predict zzso problems with an abundant zzso species containing an excess of rare low zzso zzso Such a situation might arise after the initiation of zzso of a cloned zzso gene in the zzso coli zzso Recent studies suggest clusters of zzso zzso zzso zzso or CCC zzso can reduce both the quantity and quality of the zzso zzso In addition, it is likely that an excess of any of these zzso even without zzso could create zzso zzso
