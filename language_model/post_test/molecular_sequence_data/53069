zzso the only known zzso exchange factor for the Ran zzso is an approximately zzso nuclear protein that can bind zzso An important question concerns how zzso zzso the nuclear zzso We now show that nuclear zzso is not exported readily in zzso cells and that the import of zzso into the zzso is extremely zzso zzso can proceed by at least two distinct zzso The first is a classic import zzso zzso by basic zzso within the zzso domain zzso of zzso This zzso is dependent upon both a zzso Ran zzso and energy, and zzso uses the zzso zzso of zzso The second zzso is not zzso by the zzso of zzso This novel zzso does not require zzso or zzso or the addition of any other soluble factor in zzso however, this zzso is zzso and sensitive only to a subset of zzso of classical import zzso Furthermore, the nuclear import of zzso does not require a zzso Ran zzso or zzso We speculate that this second import zzso evolved to ensure that zzso never accumulates in the zzso
