The expression of heat shock genes is controlled at the level of zzso by members of the heat shock zzso factor family in zzso zzso is a zzso factor characterized by its lack of a suppression domain that zzso formation of zzso zzso Here, we have determined the zzso structure of the human zzso gene and identified a major new zzso zzso derived by alternative zzso zzso events, in addition to a previously reported zzso zzso In mouse zzso zzso zzso was more abundant than zzso as examined by reverse zzso chain reaction, and its protein was detected in the brain and zzso Although both mouse zzso and zzso form zzso in the absence of stress, these two zzso exhibit different zzso zzso zzso acts as an inhibitor of the zzso expression of heat shock zzso and zzso acts as a zzso zzso zzso zzso but not zzso zzso the viability zzso of zzso cells lacking zzso Moreover, heat shock and other stresses stimulate zzso of target genes by zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that differential zzso of zzso zzso gives rise to both an inhibitor and zzso of zzso heat shock gene zzso
