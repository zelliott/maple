zzso zzso zzso zzso and cervical cancer have been shown to be strongly associated with infection by human zzso zzso However, other factors may be zzso in the progression from normal zzso to zzso and cervical cancer, since not all women with zzso infection develop zzso Recently, it was demonstrated that there is a high risk for cervical cancer and zzso in women with zzso zzso * 03 zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso zzso zzso reports have been zzso due to sample size, genetic zzso and differences in the techniques employed for the detection of zzso zzso * zzso 

DNA from cervical zzso of 178 women with zzso and zzso controls with normal cervical zzso was analyzed by zzso chain reaction zzso with zzso zzso for zzso 16, 18, 31, and zzso The DNA from test and control samples were also analyzed by a novel zzso technique, which zzso the first base of zzso 40 zzso zzso from T to G to create an artificial restriction site for an zzso zzso I that distinguish zzso * 03 from other zzso and are confirmed by zzso of amplified DNA with zzso zzso Further analysis of individual zzso * 03 zzso was performed using zzso and zzso zzso 

One hundred zzso zzso out of zzso controls (all zzso 16, 18, 31, or 33 negative and normal zzso zzso zzso of zzso I and zzso zzso of zzso III were positive for zzso * 03 zzso test, p zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso A significant association was observed between zzso * 03 and zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso Of women with zzso zzso zzso had zzso zzso 16, 18, 31, or zzso zzso There was a significant association between zzso * 03 and presence of zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso * 03 was more strongly associated with zzso than zzso zzso ratios zzso and zzso zzso and for the presence of zzso zzso ratio zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso * zzso was the most strongly associated zzso with zzso and zzso zzso ratios zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso zzso * 03 is associated significantly with zzso and may be zzso for zzso zzso Further analysis of class II zzso typing in zzso is necessary to evaluate this zzso
