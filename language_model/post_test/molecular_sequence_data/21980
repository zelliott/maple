Recent investigations have revealed the importance of zzso zzso with its zzso as the major zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 4 zzso has been identified as a protein that interacts with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and is reported to be expressed on zzso To zzso the role of zzso on zzso we examined the expression of zzso and zzso in normal and two different zzso rat models: zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso one model with and one without zzso of zzso foot zzso zzso was detected by zzso at the zzso membrane of normal zzso zzso zzso was zzso increased in the zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso In zzso zzso the expression of zzso was distinct from that of zzso or other slit zzso molecules such as zzso and zzso Close zzso of zzso and zzso was maintained in zzso zzso By zzso zzso the signals for zzso were detected at the free zzso membrane of the zzso with effaced foot zzso Studies with selective zzso extract revealed that the zzso zzso of zzso was altered in zzso zzso Thus the altered expression of zzso appears to be associated with zzso changes in zzso and can be a useful marker of injured zzso zzso may have a different role at the zzso membrane besides the role as a zzso zzso and is likely associated with the unique structure of this zzso
