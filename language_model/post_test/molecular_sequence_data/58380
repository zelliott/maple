zzso zzso contains a single zzso that is zzso once during a defined period in the cell zzso The onset of replication zzso with the stimulation of zzso of several genes involved in the replication zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso which in zzso coli encodes both the gamma and zzso zzso of the DNA zzso III zzso identified the zzso zzso start site and showed that activity from the zzso promoter is zzso fourfold at the onset of DNA zzso We have identified a zzso sequence motif that is present in the promoter of zzso and several other genes involved in the replication of DNA, all of which show an induction of zzso at the onset of zzso zzso Independent zzso in the zzso sequence that lies between the zzso and zzso regions increased transcription, suggesting that a zzso may bind at this zzso We propose that the zzso zzso zzso of several zzso genes at the zzso to stalked cell transition occurs in response to cell cycle regulatory factors, in a manner analogous to the transient zzso regulation of zzso and DNA zzso genes later in the cell zzso
