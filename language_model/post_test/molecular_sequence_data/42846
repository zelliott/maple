The ability to replace zzso zzso DNA sequences in zzso with in zzso zzso has been exploited to study the mechanism by which the zzso zzso zzso protein specifically activates translation of the zzso coded zzso zzso We have generated three zzso in zzso that alter the zzso zzso zzso leader zzso and introduced them into the zzso zzso replacing the zzso zzso None of the zzso significantly affected the zzso level of zzso zzso zzso of a single base at position zzso zzso to the translation initiation zzso in the zzso zzso reduced zzso zzso translation and respiratory growth, whereas zzso of four bases in place of the deleted base zzso and deletion of bases zzso to zzso zzso completely blocked zzso Six spontaneous nuclear zzso were selected as zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso One of these mapped to zzso and was shown to be a zzso zzso that changed zzso zzso from Ala to zzso This zzso zzso failed to suppress the zzso zzso zzso but very zzso suppressed the zzso zzso zzso zzso also enhanced translation of a partially functional zzso zzso with a zzso zzso but a zzso initiation zzso Although zzso of the zzso zzso protein caused weak suppression of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso did not function simply by increasing the level of the zzso These results demonstrate an intimate functional interaction between the zzso zzso protein and the zzso zzso and suggest that they may interact zzso
