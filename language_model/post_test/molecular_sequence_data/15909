zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso the induction of the zzso zzso The F sex factor also carries a zzso gene zzso to that of zzso Yet, it fails to inhibit zzso zzso In order to solve this difference, we characterized the zzso genes of zzso and zzso We found that zzso the sequences of the two zzso genes share extensive zzso the predicted zzso acid sequences of the two proteins differing by 5 zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso is 4 times higher than F zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso a zzso zzso upstream from the zzso gene enhances zzso zzso zzso the F sex factor may be unable to prevent zzso induction for two zzso reasons: zzso F zzso zzso being slightly different from zzso may be less active, zzso the level of synthesis of F zzso protein may be insufficient to prevent zzso zzso
