The zzso status of a zzso bacterial isolate from zzso soil of zzso zzso zzso ex zzso zzso was characterized using a zzso zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence showed that the isolate constituted a distinct branch within the zzso zzso The generic assignment was confirmed by zzso data, which revealed the presence of a fatty acid profile that was characteristic for the zzso zzso consisting of zzso saturated and zzso as well as zzso fatty acids and the lack of zzso fatty zzso zzso with ten zzso units zzso as the zzso respiratory zzso and a polar zzso pattern that consisted of the zzso compounds zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and an unknown zzso zzso was the major zzso zzso The zzso and zzso data zzso and fatty acid and polar zzso zzso showed that the isolate merits zzso as representing a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
