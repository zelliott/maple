To characterize zzso mechanisms of very low density zzso zzso zzso regulation we studied mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso filled zzso cells are formed during a zzso day time course in the presence of insulin, zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso in the form of its approximately 120 and approximately 100 zzso type I and type II zzso as well as binding of zzso was induced zzso during zzso Among the three different constituents added to the culture medium only zzso (1 zzso but not insulin or zzso induced a zzso and zzso increase of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso (10 zzso blocked the zzso effect of zzso on zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region representing the zzso zzso promoter were cloned and zzso and the zzso start site was determined by primer extension to be located zzso bases upstream from the initiating zzso To investigate the functionality of the promoter, zzso reporter gene zzso for the region zzso to zzso bases were assembled and zzso into zzso zzso An increased reporter gene activity was recorded when comparing zzso cells to fully differentiated zzso Between day 0 and day 2 zzso h after zzso reporter gene activity was induced by zzso but not by insulin or zzso zzso inhibited this zzso effect for all zzso zzso No classical zzso zzso zzso response element was found in the zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso Thus, an indirect zzso effect zzso via zzso on zzso zzso gene zzso is the most likely mechanism of zzso zzso gene zzso in zzso zzso zzso
