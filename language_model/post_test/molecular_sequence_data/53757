zzso mass zzso techniques were used to characterize components of the active site in zzso VIII by identifying the zzso acid sequence and the binding site for a zzso zzso derived from zzso VIII in a zzso zzso zzso zzso VIII, a DNA repair zzso with both zzso and zzso activities, was zzso bound to a zzso zzso zzso duplex by converting a transient Schiff base formed during the course of the zzso activity to a stable zzso bond by chemical reduction with sodium zzso After zzso zzso of the initial product, the identification of the zzso zzso was deduced initially from the molecular mass of the zzso product obtained by negative zzso zzso mass zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso analysis of the zzso product zzso the molecular mass of the zzso zzso and verified the point of attachment to the zzso but failed to produce sufficient fragmentation to sequence the zzso zzso zzso evidence for the zzso acid sequence of the zzso was obtained after zzso zzso of the DNA portion of the zzso zzso product and analysis by negative zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso from collision induced fragmentation disclosed that this substance was the zzso zzso zzso of zzso VIII zzso to a portion of the zzso and that the zzso zzso from zzso VIII was zzso bound to the residual zzso zzso at the original location of the zzso zzso in the zzso
