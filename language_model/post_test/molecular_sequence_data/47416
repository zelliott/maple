The tobacco zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids and is a member of the zzso zzso family of zzso zzso zzso of zzso has mainly been observed in zzso and zzso shoot zzso not observed in roots or expanded zzso zzso of zzso in transgenic plants caused abnormal leaf zzso consisting of zzso and zzso Interestingly, the direction of leaf zzso tended to be zzso among almost all of the leaves in any given zzso In transgenic plants exhibiting zzso or zzso zzso leaves curved to the right or left, respectively, when looking from the shoot zzso toward the zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the presence of the shoot zzso is necessary for the development of leaf zzso indicating that the order of formation of leaves on the stem (the zzso zzso affects leaf zzso We found a correlation between the severity of leaf zzso and the value of the zzso ratio, a zzso of zzso zzso with more severe zzso had larger zzso zzso From these findings, we discuss the possibility that an increase in the zzso ratio, caused by zzso of zzso in the shoot zzso may be involved in leaf zzso
