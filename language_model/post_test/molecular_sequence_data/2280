At late times after infection with zzso a prematurely terminated transcript that zzso at the major late promoter zzso and has a zzso about 95 zzso downstream has been identified and termed an attenuated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell 29, zzso The DNA template of the attenuated zzso has two regions of zzso zzso and the attenuated zzso can therefore fold into two hairpin zzso The hairpin element at the zzso of the attenuated zzso is followed by a stretch of Us and resembles a zzso zzso in zzso We have suggested that folding of the zzso into two hairpin elements will lead to a block of zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we created two templates that either strengthened or weakened the proposed hairpin zzso The zzso and zzso templates were cloned downstream from the zzso 2 zzso and zzso patterns were compared between the templates in a zzso zzso We have shown that zzso zzso II recognizes the zzso sequence that leads to a block of zzso zzso even when it is under the control of the zzso of zzso zzso The extent of the block of zzso zzso is directly dependent on the stability of the hairpin structure of the zzso as assessed by a comparison of zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso The addition of zzso and zzso at an elevated temperature during the zzso reaction enhanced the production of the attenuated zzso from all zzso
