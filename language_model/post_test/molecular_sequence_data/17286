zzso zzso are zzso zzso of zzso and represent a relatively new form of cell zzso developed for biological wastewater zzso In this study, both zzso and zzso techniques were used to investigate the bacterial diversity and function in zzso zzso degrading zzso cultivated in a sequencing batch zzso zzso zzso gel zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso genes demonstrated a major shift in the microbial community as the seed sludge developed into zzso Culture isolation and zzso zzso confirmed the dominance of zzso and zzso zzso bacteria in the zzso zzso zzso Of the 10 zzso bacterial strains isolated from the zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso possessed zzso zzso gene sequences that matched the partial sequences of dominant bands in the zzso fingerprint belonging to the zzso zzso The zzso dominance of strain zzso was confirmed by isolation, zzso and in zzso zzso with a zzso probe, and key zzso traits possessed by zzso that allowed it to zzso and dominate other zzso within the zzso were then zzso This strain could be regarded as a functionally dominant strain and may have contributed significantly to zzso degradation in the zzso On the other hand, strain zzso had low specific growth rate and low zzso degradation ability but showed a high propensity to zzso By analyzing the roles played by these two zzso within the zzso zzso a functional model of the microbial community within the zzso zzso was zzso This model has important implications for zzso the engineering of ecological zzso
