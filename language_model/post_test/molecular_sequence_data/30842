zzso zzso is a major early diagnostic of zzso zzso The zzso in zzso zzso of zzso zzso strain zzso zzso reduces the zzso of this zzso A zzso zzso of DNA cloned from the wild type of this zzso zzso was previously shown to complement this zzso We present the zzso sequence of a zzso portion of this zzso containing an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis using deletion derivatives of the zzso zzso showed that the gene zzso in zzso which we designate zzso lies within this zzso zzso of zzso was induced as a result of deprivation for nitrate and yielded a zzso zzso that was present at greatest abundance 7 h after nitrogen zzso At that time, zzso could not be distinguished by light zzso zzso of zzso structural genes of zzso peaked much zzso Situated 3' to zzso are 4 identical repeats of the sequence zzso and 12 repeats (10 zzso of the sequence zzso The 12 repeats, present within and near the zzso end of a second ORF, are almost identical to repeats that have been reported to be present in the region between the zzso and zzso genes of a related zzso
