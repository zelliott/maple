zzso zzso zzso is a zzso integral membrane protein that spans the zzso zzso three times and which is active in some zzso zzso In this work zzso was zzso using metal zzso zzso zzso and its structural properties in zzso and organic zzso zzso studies were zzso primarily to address the question of whether the structure of zzso can be determined using solution zzso zzso zzso studies established that zzso is zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and mixed zzso The zzso zzso molecular mass of zzso in both zzso zzso and zzso zzso was determined to be in the range of zzso zzso larger than the sum of the molecular weights of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In zzso organic zzso zzso zzso complexes were highly soluble and yielded relatively zzso zzso zzso zzso and circular zzso studies indicated that in these zzso the zzso adopts a zzso trapped zzso structure in which it zzso binds several zzso molecules and is primarily zzso but in which its zzso structure is largely zzso Although these results provide new information regarding the native zzso state of zzso and the structural properties of complex membrane proteins in zzso and organic zzso zzso the results discourage the notion that the structure of zzso can be readily determined at high resolution with solution zzso zzso
