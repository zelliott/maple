zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli requires both zzso region 1 and zzso region 2, which are separated by about 40 zzso on the zzso zzso The zzso sequence of region 2 was determined and contains an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso a protein of 265 zzso zzso The protein has no signal sequence and upon sequence analysis appeared to be a zzso zzso A zzso was zzso with a zzso zzso gene preceded by the promoter of region zzso Introduction of a zzso carrying the zzso d zzso into a strain containing this construct enhanced expression of zzso by at least zzso indicating that the zzso d protein was enhancing expression from the promoter of region zzso The zzso d gene sequence differed at 28 positions from the zzso zzso which encodes a protein that is a positive regulator of the expression of zzso or zzso zzso It was shown that the zzso d gene and the zzso gene can functionally substitute each other in regulating zzso zzso
