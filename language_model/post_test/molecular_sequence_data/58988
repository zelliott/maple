The effects of zzso hormones are zzso by a family of five different zzso zzso spanning receptors zzso The expression of the five different zzso zzso displays a complex zzso and zzso zzso To investigate the molecular mechanisms controlling the different expression patterns of the zzso we cloned the zzso region of the human zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter resulted in the identification of a novel zzso element zzso zzso activity of the zzso is dependent on the presence of a binding site zzso for basic zzso zzso zzso zzso By screening a mouse brain zzso expression library we isolated a zzso coding for the zzso zzso factor zzso zzso binds to the zzso present in the zzso both in zzso and in zzso and activates zzso from the zzso A single point zzso within the zzso eliminates binding of zzso and results in a complete loss of zzso activity of the zzso Furthermore, DNA binding studies demonstrate that the zzso zzso factor zzso can be zzso to the zzso through physical interaction with zzso In zzso the zzso represents a novel type of zzso element that zzso gene expression in the absence of a zzso or binding sites for other known zzso factors, like zzso or zzso
