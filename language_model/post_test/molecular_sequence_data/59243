zzso is a zzso zzso regulating the zzso complement, and zzso systems in zzso besides exhibiting zzso zzso zzso zzso has an unusually small molecular mass among the zzso zzso found, which seems to make it hard for it to retain all the known zzso In this study, the complete primary structure of zzso zzso was zzso by cloned zzso and zzso zzso A coding sequence of zzso zzso acids including a signal zzso of 19 zzso acids was deduced from the zzso The coding sequence showed zzso zzso with that of human zzso but zzso zzso lacked 22 zzso acids in the connecting zzso One zzso acid substitution resulted in the loss of a potential zzso site in accordance with the finding on zzso analyses that zzso zzso contained two kinds of zzso zzso while human zzso contained zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso indicated that an 80 zzso acid zzso was completely removed from the zzso end on zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso only exists in a truncated zzso form representing the most compact functional form of zzso which suggests the lack of functional necessity of the truncated zzso zzso
