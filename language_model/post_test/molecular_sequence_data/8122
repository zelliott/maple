zzso acid zzso zzso alpha is required to zzso with zzso X zzso zzso in order to regulate zzso zzso If so, it is expected that zzso of normal zzso alpha may zzso the zzso zzso zzso formation and also the differentiation of zzso zzso We have described here the zzso and the zzso response of human zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso bone zzso cells using a zzso zzso Most of zzso alpha zzso cells displayed zzso like zzso and their proportion of zzso expressing population was increased remarkably compared with the control zzso gene zzso zzso Furthermore, this zzso was observed even after these cells were brought into the zzso culture containing zzso zzso Interestingly, immature zzso alpha zzso cells differentiated into mature zzso under the condition of the high concentration of zzso zzso We did not observe any effect of zzso alpha on zzso These results indicate that zzso of normal zzso alpha is sufficient for inducing maturation arrest of zzso cell lineage that is similar to the zzso found in the acute zzso leukemia bearing zzso alpha zzso
