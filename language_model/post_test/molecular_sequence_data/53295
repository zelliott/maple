The molecular basis of quantitative zzso zzso was investigated in four families predicted to have major zzso gene zzso A zzso zzso deletion and zzso of the sequence zzso zzso zzso was zzso in one zzso zzso surrounding the zzso contained two perfect, and one imperfect, zzso repeats which may have zzso formation of a stem loop structure on one strand during DNA replication zzso the zzso A zzso zzso deletion spanning zzso 2 to 5 was identified in a second zzso The identical 6 zzso sequence was upstream of each zzso and the zzso zzso was located in a sequence of the zzso 3 repeat predicted to be susceptible to strand breakage during zzso This may have promoted zzso and zzso of one of the repeats and the intervening zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was present in DNA zzso from affected members of the third family suggesting a partial zzso gene zzso event while in the remaining family, evidence supporting a complete gene deletion was zzso
