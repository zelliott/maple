In addition to its well-documented effects on gene zzso zzso zzso is a prominent cause of zzso In humans, the zzso rate from zzso zzso to zzso zzso is zzso higher than other transitions and the zzso sequence zzso is consequently zzso Over one-third of zzso point zzso associated with human genetic disease and many zzso zzso leading to cancer involve loss of zzso The primary cause of zzso appears to be zzso zzso zzso zzso produces mismatched zzso zzso which can be removed by zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso generates a G zzso T zzso that cannot be processed by this zzso Correction of zzso zzso zzso zzso may instead be initiated by the zzso DNA zzso zzso Here we show that zzso an unrelated zzso protein that contains a zzso binding domain, can also efficiently remove zzso or zzso from a zzso zzso site in zzso Furthermore, the zzso binding domain of zzso binds zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso primary product of zzso at zzso The combined zzso of binding and zzso indicate that this zzso may function to minimize zzso at zzso
