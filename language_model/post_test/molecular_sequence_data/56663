The zzso zzso is activated by single base zzso occurring in either zzso 12, 13, or zzso These zzso have been described with varying zzso in several human tumor zzso Since zzso zzso were first discovered as the transforming sequences of Harvey and Kirsten zzso zzso viruses (which also contain zzso point zzso compared to the zzso cellular zzso we wished to investigate the possibility that zzso zzso might also occur in human zzso We extracted DNA from six zzso zzso zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso one zzso zzso one zzso zzso and one zzso The DNA from regions zzso zzso zzso and zzso 61 was amplified by the zzso chain reaction and zzso with an automated DNA zzso As controls, we amplified and zzso normal DNA zzso and DNA with known point zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We found three cases with zzso all occurring in zzso zzso One zzso showed a zzso zzso in the second position of zzso 12 zzso for zzso instead of zzso Two zzso showed zzso zzso in the second position of zzso 12 zzso for zzso acid instead of zzso Although a limited number of cases were zzso we conclude that study of zzso zzso may be relevant to zzso and zzso Additional studies of N and zzso zzso as well as more cases investigating zzso will be required before we can ascertain the significance of zzso zzso in the zzso of human soft tissue zzso
