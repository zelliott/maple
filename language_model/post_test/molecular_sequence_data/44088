Basic zzso in the zzso segments of zzso channels and zzso within the zzso repeat motif in the zzso region of Shaker zzso channels have been shown to have important influences on zzso Here we have compared the relative importance for zzso of zzso zzso zzso to neutral or negative zzso in each of the four repeats of a zzso zzso calcium zzso zzso effects on zzso potential and time constant of zzso were produced by zzso in repeats I and III but not in repeats II and zzso zzso or zzso zzso in repeats I and III had the same effect on the zzso dependence of calcium channel zzso as the zzso at equivalent positions in the Shaker channel, indicating that the zzso motif plays a fundamental role in channel zzso
