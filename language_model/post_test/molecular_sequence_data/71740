The zzso era is characterized by the deposition of sequence information for entire zzso in zzso Currently, besides the protein sequences for known human zzso there are partial sequences from thousands more human proteins for which no biological function has been zzso A powerful new tool for the zzso identification and characterization of zzso proteins is accomplished by the combination of mass zzso and sequence database zzso This combination provides the cancer biologist with the ability to zzso identify the potential zzso associations and zzso fully characterize zzso zzso zzso both directly from zzso zzso zzso In this report we describe the application of tandem mass zzso and database searching to two problems which are zzso for cancer research and indeed for biomedical research in zzso The first is the identification of zzso low abundance proteins based on zzso acid sequence composition following zzso with the human zzso inhibitor protein zzso The second is the determination of the precise sites of zzso of the human regulatory protein zzso which controls zzso zzso
