To construct a fused expression zzso of the outer membrane protein gene zzso of zzso zzso express the fusion protein in the zzso system, and obtain a gene zzso zzso for the purpose of preparing the ground for further research on the zzso and immune protective response of zzso 

A pair of zzso were designed according to the known sequence of the zzso zzso and the zzso gene was amplified by zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and cloned into the zzso expression zzso zzso to generate zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was transferred into competent cells zzso coli zzso After confirmed by restriction zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequencing analysis, the zzso protein was induced to express by zzso zzso and examined by zzso and Western zzso 

zzso zzso zzso zzso amplification and DNA sequencing analysis showed that the zzso gene of 1 zzso zzso was amplified from zzso zzso DNA, and the zzso zzso zzso was successfully constructed and highly expressed in zzso zzso 

The zzso expression zzso of zzso was successfully constructed and efficiently expressed in the zzso system, which has provided a basis for further study on the biological activity of the zzso zzso as well as animal immune experiment and detection of zzso zzso and its application as a zzso immune zzso
