zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso technology that enables the procurement of specific cell populations from tissue zzso In this method, zzso sections are first stained for cellular markers via either chemical or zzso methods, placed in close contact with an zzso vinyl zzso zzso film, and exposed to a light zzso The zzso transient heating of the stained cells or zzso structures melts the EVA film selectively to the targets for zzso In this report, we introduce a zzso zzso system that permits consistent and zzso zzso of zzso across an zzso rat brain tissue section in zzso In addition, we present a method to efficiently recover and combine captured proteins from multiple zzso zzso Both light and scanning electron zzso demonstrated captured nuclear zzso zzso zzso analysis of the samples showed a significant enrichment in nuclear localized zzso with an average zzso of recovered proteins localized to the nucleus, versus zzso for whole tissue controls zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso using multiple reaction monitoring zzso showed more impressive data, with a zzso enrichment in zzso and a concurrent depletion of proteins localized to the zzso zzso and zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso technology is zzso to the zzso study of a broad range of targets in molecular zzso
