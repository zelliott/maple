Internal zzso entry site zzso elements consist of highly structured zzso regions that determine internal initiation of zzso We have previously shown that the zzso disease virus zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso spanning zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso interactions dependent on the zzso motif determine the structural organization of the central zzso By using zzso analysis in combination with zzso zzso we have identified distant zzso interactions between the zzso motif and the zzso region zzso termed motif zzso zzso in motif A caused a decrease in zzso activity as severe as the zzso substitution in the zzso zzso zzso in either zzso or motif A sequences induced a common reorganization around the zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the latter contributes to stabilize the zzso A zzso This finding was also consistent with a significant increase in the efficiency of zzso interactions determined in gel shift zzso using as probe the hairpin that contains the zzso motif compared to a transcript encompassing the entire zzso region of the central zzso Thus, we propose that the central domain of the zzso zzso contains a structural zzso essential for zzso activity stabilized by a zzso contact involving zzso in the zzso zzso and motif A zzso zzso
