zzso is frequently associated with zzso and zzso of zzso which makes it an attractive target zzso for T zzso zzso of zzso However, the magnitude and breadth of the zzso zzso repertoire may be restricted due to the ubiquitous expression of zzso zzso in normal zzso zzso In view of the importance of the zzso zzso cell responses in effective zzso zzso we have analyzed and compared the zzso zzso of this T cell subset in zzso and zzso zzso zzso This response was found to be directed against the same three zzso zzso in both mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not affected by zzso zzso of zzso and zzso mice with synthetic zzso vaccines zzso the identified zzso induced equal levels of zzso zzso Our findings imply that the zzso zzso zzso repertoire is not restricted by zzso and is fully available for the targeting of zzso
