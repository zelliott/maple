The effect of zzso on the binding of the zzso zzso zzso DNA binding zzso zzso zzso and zzso to various zzso zzso was examined by zzso gel zzso The results were then compared with those that were obtained with the well characterized zzso protein from zzso coli, zzso In the absence of zzso the results indicated that the zzso protein was able to bind to the zzso zzso in the zzso mode, with only two of the four zzso of the zzso interacting with the zzso zzso In the presence of zzso however, the results indicated that the zzso protein was bound to the zzso zzso in the zzso mode, with all four zzso of the zzso interacting with the zzso zzso The zzso protein behaved similarly to the zzso protein under all conditions, indicating that it zzso zzso zzso changes in its DNA binding modes that are analogous to those of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in contrast, appeared to bind to the zzso zzso in an zzso mode in either the presence or the absence of zzso suggesting that it may not exhibit the pronounced negative zzso zzso in the absence of zzso that is required for the formation of the zzso zzso Additional experiments with a zzso zzso protein indicated that the structural zzso that govern the transitions between the different DNA binding modes may be contained within the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
