The zzso DNA sequence zzso the scorpion toxin zzso VIII was amplified from zzso DNA of the scorpion zzso zzso zzso from Morocco, zzso and zzso An zzso with a high zzso content zzso split a zzso zzso at the end of the precursor signal zzso and the consensus zzso zzso junction was identified in the zzso VIII zzso This zzso of only 166 zzso is the smallest zzso described so far for a zzso scorpion toxin zzso In addition, this study led to the identification of three new zzso zzso From the deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso precursor zzso we found that the mature putative toxins were highly similar to the scorpion toxins zzso zzso zzso IV and zzso zzso zzso
