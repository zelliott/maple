A significant obstacle to zzso vaccine development lies in the remarkable diversity of envelope zzso the major targets of zzso zzso That envelope diversity must be targeted is demonstrated by results from nonhuman zzso studies in which zzso vaccines have protected against zzso but rarely against zzso virus zzso Similarly, in clinical trials, zzso vaccines have failed to prevent zzso infections when challenge viruses were inevitably mismatched with the zzso To protect humans from infection by any isolate of zzso we have prepared vaccine cocktails combining multiple envelopes from distinct viral zzso We have tested several vehicles for vaccine delivery in small animals and have shown that successive zzso with zzso presented first as a DNA zzso then as a zzso virus zzso zzso and finally as zzso protein zzso strong zzso zzso zzso We have also tested the zzso zzso vaccine in zzso zzso of animals received either zzso or zzso zzso zzso vaccines administered by the subcutaneous zzso zzso showed that the zzso vaccine was safe, zzso and superior to the zzso vaccine in zzso zzso zzso measurable in a standard clinical, immune zzso The promise of this system has led to the initiation of clinical trials, with which the hypothesis that cocktail vaccines will prevent human zzso infections may ultimately be zzso
