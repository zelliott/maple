zzso of zzso gene expression plays a central role in the zzso of enteric bacteria as they encounter diverse environmental conditions in the gastrointestinal tract of their zzso In this study, we investigated environmental regulation of two putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso an zzso regulator, from zzso zzso and identified zzso as the environmental signal which induced zzso of zzso and zzso through zzso zzso extension experiments showed that zzso and zzso were zzso transcribed from zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso facilitated and stabilized the binding of zzso to an operator located between the two zzso The interaction of zzso with its DNA target resulted in the formation of a zzso structure, which evidently displaced the zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso and zzso promoter regions, leading to zzso zzso In addition, our results indicated that zzso also behaved as a Class I zzso by directly stimulating zzso initiation by zzso zzso This is the first report to describe the molecular mechanism by which an environmental chemical stimulates zzso of zzso genes of an enteric pathogen through an zzso zzso
