We here zzso the repertoire of zzso zzso isolated from different stages of B cell differentiation in adult zzso The zzso sequence analyses of zzso zzso derived from large zzso cells zzso zzso small zzso cells zzso zzso and mature B cells zzso zzso isolated from adult bone zzso revealed a sequential zzso among functional zzso of D segments of the zzso family and a depletion of D segments using the second and the third reading frame zzso One member zzso of the zzso gene family was zzso in zzso of the zzso of all populations zzso In zzso the majority of the zzso utilizing this gene was found to be zzso In contrast, zzso zzso of the zzso zzso isolated from adult zzso were zzso These data provide evidence for cellular selection of zzso regions acting at different points of the B cell differentiation zzso and at the transition of B cells from the bone zzso to the zzso
