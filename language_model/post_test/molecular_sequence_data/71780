The enhancement of zzso zzso calcium binding activity by an zzso or a recognition site zzso and its diminution by key point zzso at the protein recognition interface zzso zzso which is more than 20 A away from the nearest calcium zzso structure, can be described by an expanded version of the zzso equation for zzso zzso The expanded equation can accurately describe the calcium binding events and their variable linkage to protein recognition events can be extended to other zzso zzso and can potentially be applied to a diverse array of zzso binding systems with zzso regulation of zzso zzso whether by other zzso or protein zzso The zzso A resolution X-ray zzso structure of the complex between zzso and zzso zzso the zzso recognition site zzso from zzso smooth muscle and zzso forms of zzso light chain zzso provides insight into the structural basis of the functional communication between zzso calcium zzso structures and protein recognition zzso The structure reveals that the complex adapts to the effect of the functional zzso by discrete adjustments in the zzso that contains zzso This zzso is on the zzso side of the zzso structural motif that is the first to be occupied in zzso calcium binding zzso The results reported here are consistent with a sequential and cooperative model of zzso calcium binding activity in which the two zzso and flexible central zzso zzso are functionally linked, and provide insight into how zzso calcium binding activity and zzso recognition properties are functionally zzso
