zzso B1 is a member of a new family of zzso isolated from plants, which have a zzso knot structure embedded within an zzso zzso This family of molecules are the largest known zzso zzso and thus, the mechanism of synthesis and folding is of great zzso To provide information about both these phenomena, we have zzso zzso B1 using two distinct zzso In the first, zzso of the zzso zzso of a linear precursor zzso to form the correct zzso bonds results in folding of the three-dimensional structure and zzso of the zzso in close proximity for subsequent zzso The second approach involved zzso prior to zzso In the first method, the correctly folded zzso was produced only in the presence of partially zzso zzso zzso These conditions are presumably required to stabilize the zzso zzso zzso However, in the synthesis involving zzso prior to zzso the zzso reduced zzso folded to a significant degree in the absence of zzso zzso and even more efficiently in the presence of zzso zzso zzso clearly has a major effect on the folding zzso and zzso formation of the correctly zzso form in zzso zzso In addition to zzso folding to a compact stable structure, zzso has an important effect on biological activity as assessed by zzso zzso
