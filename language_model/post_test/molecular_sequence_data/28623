Class B floral zzso genes specify the identity of petals and zzso during the development of zzso zzso Recently, putative zzso of these genes have been identified in different zzso Together, these genes constitute a zzso termed B zzso Here we report that diverse seed plants also contain members of a zzso unknown sister zzso of the B zzso termed zzso zzso zzso We have isolated members of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In addition, zzso genes from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were identified as zzso zzso Comprehensive expression studies revealed that zzso genes are mainly transcribed in female zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This is in clear contrast to the B zzso which are predominantly expressed in male zzso zzso (and in zzso zzso Our data suggest that the zzso genes played an important role during the evolution of the zzso structures in seed zzso The establishment of distinct B and zzso gene lineages after zzso of an ancestral gene may have accompanied the evolution of male zzso and female zzso zzso million years zzso During flower evolution, expression of zzso genes zzso but the focus of expression remained in female zzso zzso Our findings imply that a zzso of highly zzso close relatives of class B floral zzso genes has been completely overlooked until recently and awaits further evaluation of its zzso and evolutionary zzso Electronic supplementary material to this paper can be obtained by using the zzso zzso server located at zzso
