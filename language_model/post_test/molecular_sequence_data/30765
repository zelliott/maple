An effective synthesis of zzso containing a zzso zzso bond in the zzso position of the zzso backbone has been developed by zzso zzso of two zzso One of them containing zzso group to be activated and zzso group of the other being zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso proved to be more efficient in the zzso group zzso than zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso bong is quite stable in neutral zzso zzso zzso conditions of selective zzso of this bond yielding the initial zzso were zzso
