In order to further understand the zzso of zzso growth factors zzso in the development, differentiation and function of the central nervous system, we zzso the expression of the zzso and the presence and tissue distribution of the translated product, of one member of the zzso family, zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso zzso the relative abundance of zzso zzso was zzso in embryonic (between 14 and 17 days of zzso zzso (between 1 and 17 days after zzso and adult rat zzso by quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction amplification using specific zzso zzso The level of expression remained zzso low throughout the embryonic period and until zzso day zzso Therefore the quantity of zzso zzso increased zzso reaching zzso of adult levels by eye opening zzso day zzso Adult levels were zzso higher than at early zzso zzso In zzso zzso of adult rat zzso using specific zzso zzso zzso revealed zzso in all cellular zzso zzso raised against zzso human zzso revealed very little zzso of zzso zzso zzso but by zzso days 8 and 17 zzso zzso was localized mainly within the zzso cell zzso Western blots of retinal extracts derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso and adult zzso zzso with the same zzso revealed a single zzso band of the expected molecular weight (18 zzso in all zzso Thus zzso is mostly transcribed and translated within the zzso subsequent to the major steps of cell birth, migration and zzso and seems to be abundantly expressed by maturing zzso zzso
