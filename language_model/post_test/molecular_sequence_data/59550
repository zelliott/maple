zzso regions were revealed and analyzed within the first zzso of the mouse and human zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected between zzso DNA sequences from the first zzso of the mouse gene zzso zzso and the human gene zzso zzso zzso I hypersensitive sites were revealed within these regions in both mouse and human cell lines tested, thus showing functional significance of the zzso zzso In both the mouse and the human zzso the zzso end of zzso regions is flanked by a DNA sequence similar to a zzso zzso consensus zzso Previously, this sequence was demonstrated to be involved in a complex regulatory element of the mouse zzso zzso In comparison with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and human sequences were found to involve one, two, and three zzso zzso zzso zzso in a spectrum of nuclear proteins bound to various zzso sequences were zzso zzso effects of these zzso on zzso zzso regulation were zzso The possibility of the human zzso sequence to function as positive regulator of zzso initiation was demonstrated in zzso
