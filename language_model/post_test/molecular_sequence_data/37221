zzso growth factor zzso signaling via its zzso the zzso Met, alters cell proliferation and zzso and has been associated with tumor zzso zzso treatment of zzso human zzso zzso cells zzso cell migration zzso with increased levels of the zzso zzso zzso zzso signaling resulted in nuclear export of zzso zzso to the zzso via zzso zzso where it zzso with zzso Introduction of zzso zzso protein zzso was sufficient for zzso zzso zzso and migration of zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis identified a novel zzso zzso domain required for cell migration, distinct from the zzso zzso zzso zzso binding zzso Loss or disruption of the zzso zzso domain abolished both zzso zzso and cell zzso The zzso activity of zzso occurred independently of its cell cycle arrest functions and required zzso zzso of zzso via zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso was necessary for zzso migration but alone was insufficient for zzso cell zzso These results predicted a migration zzso in zzso zzso Indeed, zzso primary zzso failed to zzso and zzso with zzso rescued the zzso zzso These observations define a novel role for zzso in cell zzso that is independent of its function in cell cycle zzso
