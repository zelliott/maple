This zzso prospective study shows that zzso to the zzso block 2 region of the zzso zzso zzso surface protein 1 zzso are associated with protection against clinical malaria in an area of stable but seasonal malaria transmission of zzso zzso to the block 2 region of zzso were measured in a cohort of 280 children before the beginning of the major malaria transmission zzso The cohort was then actively monitored for malaria, clinically and zzso over a period of 17 zzso Evidence is presented for an association between zzso responses to block 2 and a significantly reduced risk of subsequent clinical zzso Furthermore, statistical survival analysis provides new information on the duration of the effect over zzso The results support a conclusion that the block 2 region of zzso is a target of protective immunity against zzso zzso and, thus, a promising new candidate for the development of a malaria zzso
