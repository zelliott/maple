The structure of a zzso zzso zzso zzso gene located within the zzso gene cluster and zzso a putative zzso zzso protein involved in the assembly of type 1 zzso was zzso This zzso named zzso has the ability to zzso a zzso zzso which is similar, at the sequence level, to the zzso zzso zzso zzso the assembly of P zzso of zzso coli, as well as to other zzso zzso proteins involved in the zzso of zzso or zzso structures of various zzso zzso A comprehensive search through the literature and sequence databases identified 31 zzso bacterial proteins that can be included in this protein family on the basis of sequence zzso zzso of a multiple sequence comparison analysis showed that several zzso including most of those known to be critical in maintaining the three-dimensional structure of zzso are either zzso or conservatively zzso in all these zzso suggesting an overall similar folding for all of zzso It was also evident that members of this family are clustered into different zzso according to structural and zzso zzso
