zzso zzso has been previously shown to produce a zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso transfer reactions such as zzso over zzso in the presence of suitable zzso other than water, even in zzso media zzso zzso zzso zzso This zzso has been shown to belong to a new family of zzso The present work describes the cloning of the gene coding for this zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso high-level expression of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso in which the sequence zzso the signal zzso was replaced by that of the zzso of zzso zzso was placed under the control of the methanol zzso promoter of the alcohol zzso 1 gene zzso A transformed zzso zzso zzso containing five copies of the zzso zzso was selected for the production of zzso zzso The zzso culture zzso contained zzso zzso zzso of almost pure zzso zzso displaying the same zzso behavior as the original zzso
