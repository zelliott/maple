zzso beta zzso zzso the principal zzso component of zzso plaques in brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, is derived by zzso zzso of the zzso precursor protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso by a putative zzso within the zzso sequence zzso the formation of the zzso peptides and leads to the release of soluble zzso into the zzso By zzso of a zzso and zzso zzso classified as zzso 10, in zzso zzso cells, zzso and protein zzso zzso zzso activity was increased zzso The zzso activated form of zzso 10 was localized by cell surface zzso in the plasma zzso but the majority of the zzso was found in the zzso These results support the view that zzso is zzso both at the cell surface and along the zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was inhibited by a dominant negative form of zzso 10 with a point zzso in the zinc binding zzso Studies with zzso zzso 10 and zzso fragments confirm the correct zzso zzso site and demonstrate a dependence on the zzso zzso Our results provide evidence that zzso 10 has zzso activity and many properties expected for the zzso processing of zzso zzso of its expression and activity might be beneficial for the treatment of Alzheimer's zzso
