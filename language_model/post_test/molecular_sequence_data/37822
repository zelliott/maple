zzso I is zzso in nerve terminals exclusively in the zzso compartment and in zzso by protein zzso C zzso zzso is required for synaptic zzso zzso suggesting that its zzso affects its zzso zzso An in zzso zzso binding zzso was established that prevents zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso into the zzso zzso I bound the zzso in a zzso and zzso manner, with an apparent affinity of 230 zzso 51 zzso zzso binding occurred with zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso with little binding to zzso or zzso zzso zzso binding was abolished after zzso I zzso by zzso and was restored after zzso by zzso zzso laser zzso of flight mass zzso revealed the zzso site in zzso zzso I as a single site at zzso located near a binding site for the zzso domain of zzso the regulatory zzso of zzso zzso However, zzso had no effect on zzso binding to a zzso expressed zzso zzso Thus, zzso of zzso I on zzso prevents its association with zzso providing a basis for the zzso zzso of the minor pool of zzso I that mediates synaptic zzso retrieval in nerve zzso
