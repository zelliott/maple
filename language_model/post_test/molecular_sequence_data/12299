The bacterial zzso forms a regular structure, composed of a zzso of one zzso on the surfaces of many zzso zzso zzso are reported to zzso different functions, such as attachment structures for zzso zzso and major zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which originates from the human zzso possesses such an zzso No function has yet been assigned to the zzso of this zzso Besides the structural gene zzso for the zzso protein zzso which constitutes this zzso we have identified a silent gene zzso which is almost identical to zzso in two zzso From the deduced zzso acid zzso it appears that the mature zzso zzso zzso is zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso in the zzso and middle parts of the zzso The zzso parts of the two proteins are identical except for one zzso acid zzso The physical properties of the deduced zzso are virtually the zzso Northern zzso zzso analysis shows that only the zzso gene is expressed in zzso cells, in line with the results from sequencing and primer extension zzso which reveal that only the zzso gene harbors a promoter, which is located immediately upstream of the region where the two genes are zzso The occurrence of in zzso zzso zzso between the two zzso genes will be described zzso
