The order of zzso plants zzso is attractive for studies of zzso evolution as it includes three zzso distinct groups with zzso composed of zzso zzso zzso zzso and unknown alternative zzso zzso To analyze the molecular causes of these switches in zzso sequence zzso genes coding for the zzso zzso zzso zzso of representative species in the first two groups have been zzso Multiple alignments of the zzso together with other zzso sequences in databases, suggested candidate zzso acid zzso grouped in the zzso zzso zzso the zzso repeat that could have contributed to the changed zzso zzso Among these, zzso in the C motif are of special interest due to its functional importance in zzso Furthermore, two different modes of initial zzso of the zzso primer were observed in zzso zzso producing zzso repeats, which could be attributed to interactions between the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso
