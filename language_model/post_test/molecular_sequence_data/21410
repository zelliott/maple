The zzso zzso a zzso zzso reminiscent of zzso zzso zzso was identified in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso and the zzso exchange zzso were used for the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso was the preferred zzso while zzso zzso zzso and zzso were turned over at lower rates zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid derivatives were not zzso As the zzso range of zzso is incompatible with the secondary zzso known from the zzso zzso our results imply greater natural product diversity in this zzso This is the first zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso domain, and our results may help refine computer zzso to predict zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso whose genes are discovered through zzso zzso
