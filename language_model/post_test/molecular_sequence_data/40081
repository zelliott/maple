We report here the cloning and characterization of a soybean zzso zzso zzso zzso designated zzso zzso max zzso zzso zzso which is involved in regulating leaf zzso The conceptual protein product of zzso contains typical zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso domain with all the 11 zzso zzso a zzso domain and an zzso domain containing 9 zzso Repeat zzso units that may act as a zzso The expression of zzso in soybean leaves was zzso in all the three tested zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso primary leaf zzso and the natural leaf zzso process after zzso Furthermore, the zzso interference zzso zzso of zzso dramatically retarded soybean leaf zzso A more complex zzso membrane system, higher zzso level of zzso content and a very remarkable delay of zzso disintegration of zzso structure were observed in zzso transgenic zzso A zzso of zzso lethal zzso 1 zzso which has been suggested to zzso a key zzso catalyzing zzso breakdown, was isolated and nominated zzso The expression level of zzso zzso which encodes a key zzso of zzso zzso was also zzso It was found that zzso was zzso and zzso was zzso during zzso in zzso soybean zzso However, both of the zzso of zzso and zzso of zzso were retarded during zzso of zzso transgenic zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso gene greatly accelerated the zzso progression of zzso zzso transgenic zzso Taken together, these results strongly suggested the involvement of this zzso in regulation of soybean leaf zzso maybe via regulating zzso development and zzso zzso Multiple functions of zzso besides its regulation of leaf zzso were also zzso
