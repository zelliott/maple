A shoot zzso zzso zzso is composed of several distinct zzso and lateral zzso are initiated at the peripheral zone during plant zzso zzso and maintenance of boundary between SAM and lateral zzso is an important zzso process, in which many regulators are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso displaying a specific expression pattern corresponding to the boundary of zzso lateral zzso belongs to a large gene zzso domain gene family, which zzso proteins with a zzso zzso domain at the zzso zzso zzso other members of this gene family are also involved in divergent zzso processes in zzso To investigate the functions of zzso genes in the zzso related zzso we isolated zzso from a model zzso plant zzso zzso and conducted zzso in zzso zzso to investigate their expression zzso It was found that zzso and zzso were strongly expressed at the bases of leaflet zzso which coincided with the boundaries between leaflet zzso and compound leaf zzso while zzso was expressed at the boundaries between whorls in the developing floral zzso The different special expression patterns of zzso strongly suggest that their functions in zzso zzso may be zzso zzso and zzso could play important roles in the control of compound leaf development, and zzso may be required during floral zzso
