A zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso zzso expressed at zzso zzso below zzso zzso was zzso and zzso The zzso method involved separation of zzso proteins by zzso and extraction of the protein from zzso or zzso zzso after zzso of proteins to the zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso called zzso did not show zzso to any known zzso and in contrast to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso its mobility in zzso was not affected by zzso zzso An zzso against zzso recognized a protein of M, 55,000 in four other zzso zzso strains among 24 tested strains representing zzso zzso zzso group I, showing zzso zzso within this zzso A method for zzso zzso involving cell zzso was adapted to zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso zzso exposed to limiting amounts of zzso This approach should be useful for further exploration of zzso as a marker to study the availability of zzso to zzso zzso in natural zzso
