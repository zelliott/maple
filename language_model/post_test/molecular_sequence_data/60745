The zzso 5 capsule gene cluster of zzso zzso comprises 16 genes zzso through zzso but little is known about how the putative gene products function in capsule zzso We propose that the zzso acid zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso is zzso from a zzso zzso precursor that is zzso to zzso zzso and then oxidized to zzso We report the zzso and zzso characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso converted approximately zzso of zzso to zzso as detected by gas zzso zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso occurred over a wide pH range and was unaffected by zzso zzso Surprisingly, zzso expression in zzso zzso was unaffected by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso searches of the public zzso zzso zzso databases revealed the presence of another putative zzso zzso on the zzso zzso zzso that showed zzso identity to zzso zzso of zzso zzso function in zzso zzso was demonstrated by cloning the zzso zzso from strain Newman and zzso an zzso coli zzso zzso defective in zzso zzso zzso Our results confirm the putative function of the zzso zzso zzso gene product and demonstrate the presence of a second gene on the zzso zzso with a similar zzso
