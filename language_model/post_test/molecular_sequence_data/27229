zzso partial complementary zzso were cloned from the zzso of five species in four zzso of Indian zzso zzso major carp zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso medium zzso zzso zzso minor zzso zzso zzso subsequent to zzso chain reaction amplification with published zzso zzso or zzso zzso derived from zzso regions of zzso zzso zzso The partial zzso zzso of the five species of zzso had sizes from 624 to zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso an open reading frame consisting of zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso The alignments of carp zzso sequences showed zzso zzso and zzso zzso in deduced zzso acid zzso A zzso tree of zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso from zzso showed that the relationship among the four zzso of Indian zzso is well correlated with that derived from classic zzso zzso The hypothesized zzso site and zzso bridge of zzso zzso were predicted for the above carp species and interestingly the zzso site zzso acid sequence was found to be zzso among all the zzso To study the zzso expression of the zzso zzso various zzso zzso zzso zzso brain, muscle, zzso heart, zzso zzso and zzso from apparently healthy zzso moribund and survived zzso zzso zzso infected with zzso zzso infection were zzso zzso zzso was detected only in liver zzso and to lesser extent in brain tissue out of the 10 zzso analyzed irrespective of bacterial zzso
