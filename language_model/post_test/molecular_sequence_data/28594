It is unclear how zzso selectivity and zzso are regulated within the zzso zzso In previous studies, the zzso zzso was converted into a functional zzso zzso by mutating five zzso acids at three sites to the corresponding zzso zzso across the zzso zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that these sites comprise an zzso binding zzso To examine this hypothesis, the present study examines whether these zzso zzso represent an zzso binding pocket in the context of the zzso zzso zzso does their removal from zzso receptors destroy zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were evaluated in the zzso zzso In terms of zzso zzso there were no changes in affinity for zzso zzso and zzso At zzso zzso zzso binding was zzso but there was a trend toward slightly decreased zzso zzso In contrast, the binding of peptides had a more complex zzso Again, zzso and zzso did not decrease the binding affinity of zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso to zzso decreased affinity for zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is part of a critical zzso recognition zzso In response to zzso zzso zzso activated more zzso than wild type, and similar levels were observed in response to zzso zzso Overall, these results suggest that zzso are capable of achieving zzso binding through interaction with multiple zzso of the zzso These different modes of interaction have different zzso results in terms of zzso zzso and signal zzso
