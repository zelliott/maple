The zzso zzso zzso zzso complex mediates zzso binding to von zzso factor zzso through its largest zzso zzso zzso Of the many zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is of particular interest because it blocks zzso zzso binding induced by 2 zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso to zzso surfaces under zzso We mapped the zzso binding site to a region encompassing zzso to zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso strand defined by the zzso zzso crystal zzso zzso binding absolutely required zzso zzso and zzso We evaluated the ability of cells expressing zzso of this region to bind zzso under zzso conditions in the presence of zzso and to attach to and roll on a zzso zzso under zzso These data indicate that 2 regions within the sequence zzso to zzso have important roles in zzso zzso the zzso zzso has a regulatory role and the beta turn and zzso strand bind zzso zzso Despite this, the only effect of a synthetic zzso corresponding to zzso to zzso was to slightly increase the rolling zzso of zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells on zzso This region thus appears to be more important for maintaining the regional zzso of zzso zzso thereby zzso the interaction with zzso
