zzso analysis of H chain zzso derived from the zzso of an individual zzso has shown that zzso zzso occurs within both the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso targets G and C zzso with approximately balanced zzso resulting in the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso that parallel the zzso zzso zzso zzso exchanges known in zzso The overall zzso rate of A zzso is not significantly different from that expected by zzso zzso and a significant bias exists against zzso occurring in zzso zzso of zzso is dependent upon the sequence of neighboring zzso allowing statistically significant hotspot motifs to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso analyses showed that zzso targets in zzso are restricted when compared with the spectrum of targets known in zzso The preferential targets for G and C zzso are the central zzso positions in both zzso and zzso The zzso zzso recognized as a zzso hotspot for A zzso was not a significant target for zzso zzso The only significant target for A zzso was the terminal position in zzso Lastly, comparisons of zzso located in framework region and zzso zzso coupled with zzso distribution studies found no substantial evidence in either independent or zzso related zzso zzso to indicate that zzso zzso zzso with mechanisms that select B cells based upon zzso zzso within zzso zzso These results suggest that the principal role of zzso zzso early in zzso was to diversify the repertoire by targeting hotspot motifs zzso located within zzso zzso
