zzso a natural zzso compound, is produced by zzso trees at very low zzso causing a worldwide shortage of this important zzso zzso These plants also produce significant amounts of zzso which can be zzso into zzso for the zzso of zzso Some zzso can convert zzso into zzso but the zzso yield needs to be drastically improved for industrial zzso In addition, the related zzso of these organisms have not yet been zzso We set out to discover an efficient zzso for zzso zzso By combining the de zzso sequencing of zzso isolated from zzso zzso with zzso and the rapid amplification of zzso ends, we cloned two zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were previously unknown at the gene and protein zzso Both zzso zzso a specific zzso zzso with an identical zzso length of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso were zzso and their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso each harboring 18 zzso were also zzso zzso zzso binding zzso the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and potential zzso sites of the zzso were zzso zzso analysis of both zzso showed zzso of up to zzso zzso against zzso zzso at zzso zzso of up to 10 zzso zzso the engineered zzso could still robustly convert zzso into zzso with a conversion rate of over zzso and a highest yield of zzso zzso within 24 zzso which is much higher than those reported zzso zzso our discovery might lead to significant progress in the development of new zzso zzso for more efficient use of zzso to zzso zzso and its zzso This work also might lead to further studies on how these zzso act on zzso and contribute to the growing database of zzso zzso
