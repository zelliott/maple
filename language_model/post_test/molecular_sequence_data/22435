Long Interspersed zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso proteins required for their mobility zzso and zzso yet little is known about how zzso zzso is zzso Here, we show that zzso translation generally zzso from the first zzso zzso zzso of zzso and that both zzso and the zzso zzso are zzso for zzso zzso zzso changing the zzso zzso zzso to any other coding zzso is compatible with zzso However, introducing a premature termination zzso in zzso or a zzso hairpin in the zzso zzso reduces zzso translation or zzso zzso to approximately zzso of zzso zzso Similar data obtained from zzso and zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso lead us to propose that zzso is translated by an unconventional zzso zzso
