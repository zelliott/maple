zzso and zzso are a pair of related zzso proteins which have been implicated in zzso We show that chicken zzso cells with both zzso zzso and one zzso zzso disrupted zzso zzso are zzso However, their growth and survival in medium containing low serum levels is significantly reduced compared with zzso zzso The remaining intact zzso zzso in zzso cells can only be disrupted if zzso expression is first restored to the cells by zzso of a zzso expression zzso We conclude that zzso cells require either zzso or zzso for zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells leads to a radical drop in zzso levels, by inducing efficient zzso of two zzso alternative zzso carrying zzso stop zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso transcripts including these zzso can also be zzso These transcripts increase significantly in abundance in zzso cells, suggesting that zzso of the zzso exposes zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso depletion leads to a marked drop in zzso of the zzso The human zzso gene contains a corresponding pair of zzso alternative zzso and we show that there is very high sequence conservation between chickens and humans of the zzso pair and parts of the zzso zzso The zzso responsiveness of these alternative zzso zzso is likely to be of zzso importance for controlling zzso zzso
