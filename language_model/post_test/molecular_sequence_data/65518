zzso genetic studies of chronic zzso over the past decade have highlighted the importance of a tightly regulated balance between zzso and zzso of zzso within the zzso to disease zzso and zzso The recent identification of zzso C zzso as zzso Y, which was proposed to protect the zzso by degrading prematurely activated zzso within the zzso 20 years ago, made zzso an excellent candidate gene for zzso zzso Here, we analyzed all eight zzso of the zzso gene for conventional genetic zzso and copy number variations zzso by direct sequencing and quantitative fluorescent multiplex zzso respectively, in a total of zzso French white patients zzso zzso zzso familial zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso While no zzso were found in any of the zzso subjects, 20 conventional variations including a nonsense zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and nine zzso zzso were found in the 216 patients with idiopathic chronic zzso zzso Except for two common zzso all the remaining 18 zzso events represent rare variations, with a minor zzso frequency of zzso in the control zzso All these rare zzso were always found more frequently in the zzso patients than in the controls, and their combined frequency in the zzso patients zzso zzso is significantly different from that in the controls zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso This genetic finding, when considered in the perceived role of zzso in eliminating prematurely activated zzso indicated that zzso is a new zzso zzso zzso
