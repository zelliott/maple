The phenomenon of zzso zzso accompanied by transfer of the zzso zzso from the northern zzso zzso zzso zzso to the bank zzso zzso zzso in northeastern Europe is well known already for 25 zzso However, the possibility of zzso between zzso segments of maternal and paternal zzso of the zzso during zzso was not previously zzso Analysis of data on zzso of zzso sequences of the zzso gene for zzso b in populations of zzso and bank zzso in the area of their zzso has shown that as a result of zzso zzso the zzso gene pool of bank zzso contains not only zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso but also zzso zzso of bank zzso bearing short zzso tracts of zzso zzso zzso This finding supports the hypothesis that an incomplete elimination of zzso zzso paternal zzso during the zzso zzso between bank zzso females and zzso zzso males leads to the gene conversion of bank zzso maternal zzso tracts by zzso ones of zzso of zzso zzso zzso
