Previously, we have shown that expression of the zzso coli zzso zzso promoter is partially zzso by the zzso protein alone and strongly zzso by the zzso protein in the presence of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso Wang, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we present in zzso results showing that the zzso protein and zzso zzso can bind simultaneously to the zzso zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso protein zzso open complex formation at the zzso promoter, whereas in the absence of any zzso or in the presence of zzso the zzso protein zzso a zzso following the formation of open zzso We also present zzso evidence which implicates the zzso domain of the zzso protein in the repression of zzso zzso The zzso binding site of zzso which includes one weak and one strong zzso box, is located 5 zzso downstream of the zzso start site of zzso zzso from a zzso analysis show that the strong box (which is located more closely to the zzso zzso but not the weak box, plays a critical role in zzso zzso
