zzso has been used on a wide range of weeds present in various crops since zzso Because zzso is a potential hazard to the environment and human health, it is important to remove this zzso from the zzso However, to the best of our knowledge, no report is available in the literature regarding the microbial degradation of zzso by zzso In this study, one strain named zzso which is capable of degrading zzso was isolated from zzso wastewater treatment zzso The isolate was identified as zzso zzso according to its zzso zzso zzso properties, and zzso zzso gene sequences zzso This strain zzso zzso as the sole carbon zzso and degrades 100 zzso zzso zzso to zzso level within 48 zzso Three zzso were identified as zzso zzso and zzso based on the zzso and zzso zzso The first step involved in the degradation of zzso was the zzso of the zzso bond to form zzso zzso was subsequently subjected to zzso for decomposition into zzso and zzso The last step was to form zzso
