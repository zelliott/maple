zzso is a zzso channel expressed in brain that belongs to the zzso zzso channel zzso It is activated by the same zzso which cause zzso in zzso zzso if present in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso shares zzso sequence identity with the recently cloned zzso zzso channel zzso zzso sensing zzso zzso a new member of the family which is present in brain and in sensory zzso We have now identified zzso as a zzso channel with properties different from those of zzso zzso requires more zzso pH values for zzso and has slower zzso zzso In addition, we have cloned from mouse and rat brain a zzso zzso form of the zzso channel which differs in the first 236 zzso zzso including the first zzso zzso This new membrane zzso which has been called zzso is expressed in both brain and sensory zzso zzso is activated neither by zzso that bring zzso once introduced in zzso zzso zzso nor by low zzso However, it can associate both with zzso and another recently cloned zzso channel zzso to form zzso which display different zzso pH zzso and zzso zzso Of particular interest is the zzso combination specific for sensory zzso zzso In response to a drop in zzso it gives rise to a zzso current with a sustained current which discriminates poorly between zzso and zzso like the native zzso current recorded in zzso root zzso zzso This sustained current is thought to be required for the zzso sensation of pain caused by zzso
