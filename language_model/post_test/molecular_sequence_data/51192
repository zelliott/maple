Short peptides that are composed mainly of zzso have recently been shown to form zzso in zzso solution at low temperature zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Robbins, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These peptides are excellent models for probing structure and dynamics in isolated zzso zzso In previous work we have designed and zzso spin labeled zzso of these zzso peptides and we have shown that these zzso retain the folding characteristics of the parent zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using conventional continuous wave electron spin resonance zzso zzso we have further shown that local motion is more pronounced near the zzso zzso zzso than in the central region as the zzso is zzso unfolded zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this present work we use electron spin echo zzso zzso to further refine our understanding of the solution dynamics of the zzso zzso which is a zzso with a zzso spin label attached at position zzso We find that the spin echo zzso are well described by a single exponential function and that the determined correlation times are close to those previously derived from CW zzso zzso concentration zzso experiments have directly revealed zzso spin exchange zzso interactions and we find that the zzso collision rate is near to that expected for a free species in zzso This provides strong evidence that the zzso zzso of these peptides is not stabilized by zzso zzso
