The major zzso extending from zzso zzso to zzso upstream of the zzso initiation site of immediate early zzso genes 1 and 2 in human zzso zzso contains four groups of repeated sequence motifs that consist of 17, 18, 19 or 21 zzso zzso One of these zzso the 19 zzso zzso is a symmetrical zzso that is also part of zzso regulatory sequences of other zzso zzso but not of unrelated members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso representing the 19 zzso repeat unit strongly reduced the activity of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso after transient zzso The zzso zzso can substitute for the 72 zzso repeats of zzso virus 40 zzso zzso deletion zzso of zzso zzso zzso were constructed that contained a single zzso 19 zzso repeat with a central zzso site for zzso If deletions were introduced into the single remaining 19 zzso repeat most of the zzso viruses were still zzso in zzso monkey kidney zzso zzso of two zzso into the single zzso site did not significantly alter transient zzso T zzso zzso zzso of four zzso or more from the single 19 zzso zzso reduced the stimulation of T zzso synthesis by the zzso zzso promoter unit down to about zzso More extended deletions zzso to 80 zzso did not further reduce T zzso zzso All zzso without an intact 19 zzso repeat contained the 18 zzso and/or the 21 zzso sequence zzso zzso I zzso and gel zzso zzso indicated zzso protein binding by the 19 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with reduced zzso activity, lost most of their zzso zzso Thus, the 19 zzso repeat element is one of several zzso sites that contribute to zzso zzso However, the 19 zzso sequence motif can be deleted entirely to leave reduced zzso The zzso zzso upstream sequence appears to be the perfect model of an zzso as a complex of multiple binding sites for zzso proteins in a modular zzso
