Exposure to zzso results in the zzso of zzso zzso this is followed by zzso zzso Previously, we showed that delta zzso receptors undergo rapid zzso zzso and that zzso in the zzso result in a substantial loss of zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the fate of receptors following rapid zzso We found that the majority of the wild type receptors recycled back to the surface after acute zzso zzso The zzso of zzso and recycling of the zzso were virtually identical to the zzso of zzso and recycling of the zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso of zzso and recycling of a zzso zzso zzso were substantially altered, suggesting an involvement of the zzso in the recycling zzso It is possible that in addition to zzso zzso zzso receptors undergo zzso zzso zzso We directly examined this possibility using an zzso zzso The wild type delta zzso receptors exhibited zzso zzso via the zzso pit zzso We also examined the role of zzso zzso and recycling in the zzso of its function by zzso the level of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso under conditions of zzso zzso and zzso We found that zzso treatment caused a rapid increase in the level of zzso zzso that was rapidly zzso The removal of the zzso which results in zzso recycling, led to the zzso of the zzso as evidenced by the zzso ability to zzso zzso zzso zzso receptors that underwent rapid recycling exhibited enhanced zzso suggesting a role for zzso recycling in the zzso zzso Taken together, these results indicate that zzso zzso and recycling zzso zzso zzso function and that the zzso zzso plays an important role in both zzso
