A key element in the regulation of zzso steroid zzso is the 18 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which mediates zzso cholesterol zzso zzso also possess an affinity to the zzso zzso zzso The bacterial zzso to the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown to be involved in the bacterial zzso zzso Looking for a similar zzso import mechanism in plants, protein sequences from zzso and several other plants were found with significant similarities to the zzso zzso and to the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso sequence was cloned and expressed in zzso zzso The zzso gene product showed specific high affinity zzso zzso zzso Moreover, the protein applied to zzso coli zzso caused an equal zzso zzso of cholesterol and zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso like protein is involved in steroid import and is directing zzso IX to the zzso site of zzso zzso
