zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a highly zzso and unique zzso zzso (on zzso coli, zzso in which a zzso motif is repeated twice with two intervening zzso Since previous chemical modification studies suggested the functional importance of zzso zzso the zzso zzso in this region was replaced with zzso and the zzso properties of the resulting zzso zzso zzso were zzso Replacement led to virtual loss of the zzso activity to form zzso The specific activity was 37 zzso which zzso to 2 zzso zzso the activity of the zzso zzso However, the activity of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso appeared for the zzso zzso with a specific activity of zzso zzso In view of the zzso reaction mechanism proposed for zzso this activity can be attributed to impairment of the subsequent partial zzso following the formation of the intermediate zzso The zzso concentration zzso of zzso in zzso was about zzso that in the zzso zzso whereas the respective values for zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso indicative of this zzso participating in the binding of zzso
