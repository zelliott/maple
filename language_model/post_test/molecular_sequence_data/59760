The zzso Rev responsive element zzso zzso binding site was studied by zzso and zzso zzso Two Rev binding element zzso zzso zzso were used as model systems in this zzso zzso which contains the zzso Rev zzso binding site, and zzso which is identical except for the deletion of a zzso zzso The temperature dependence of the two-dimensional zzso of the free zzso indicates that at lower temperatures more than one zzso is zzso However, at higher temperatures a single zzso zzso Model structures of zzso and zzso as well as the zzso zzso with a zzso derived from the zzso binding domain of zzso zzso were calculated using zzso zzso The Rev zzso binding site of the zzso zzso contains a structured internal loop with two zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso of the free and bound zzso structures reveals that upon zzso binding there is a distinct change in the backbone at zzso which is involved in a zzso zzso In the free zzso zzso is in the zzso zzso and the backbone is in a relatively normal zzso zzso to the other zzso In the bound zzso the backbone at zzso has flipped over so that it is parallel to the other zzso zzso in the bound zzso still forms a zzso with zzso but is now in the anti zzso
