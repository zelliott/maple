A zzso zzso zzso library in zzso zzso was screened for sequences zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The candidate gene zzso (for zzso zzso zzso zzso gene 1) zzso zzso base pairs was thus zzso zzso comparison of the zzso clone with zzso followed by comparison of translated regions in six reading frames with protein databases, identified clearly defined tracts corresponding to 12 putative zzso sharing high sequence zzso to other zzso genes and able to code for sequential regions of a putative zzso zzso protein zzso zzso shares sequence similarities with over 40 zzso zzso zzso The highest similarity zzso is with zzso suggesting that zzso sequences from zzso are closely zzso The sequence includes motifs typical of these molecules including adjacent zzso zzso at the zzso binding site and four zzso zzso The DNA sequence presents the longest zzso tract described for this zzso and should prove useful as a probe source in the search for zzso genes from this and other zzso and for studying the molecular mechanism of resistance to zzso a drug which is known to act on zzso of worms and which is widely used for zzso zzso
