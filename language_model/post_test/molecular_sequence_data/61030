zzso zzso has emerged as the most potent zzso of zzso activity on zzso zzso zzso from a library of 32 360 peptides based on zzso zzso A recent report has confirmed our observation that zzso also binds to zzso zzso zzso Here we report the zzso affinities and zzso activities of zzso and 17 selected zzso zzso at the native zzso zzso expressed by zzso zzso melanoma zzso Our intention is to determine the structural requirements for zzso and competitive antagonism of zzso activity at the zzso and to discover more potent zzso zzso was able to inhibit the action of native zzso and the potent synthetic zzso zzso at the zzso zzso However, the Ki of zzso was zzso times higher than that of zzso and zzso times higher than that of zzso too high to allow zzso to be considered as a practical zzso for use in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso X zzso zzso Because zzso is an important component of zzso binding at the zzso we investigated zzso and zzso zzso to produce compounds with higher zzso affinity than zzso The binding affinity of zzso was not significantly different from zzso but it was 232 times lower than zzso zzso of zzso (as an zzso replacement for zzso or zzso to the zzso of zzso raised the binding affinity by a factor of 46, but this and all full-length zzso zzso with Met or zzso in position 4 were full zzso of the zzso A full-length zzso zzso of zzso with zzso did not exhibit significantly greater binding affinity than zzso and appeared to be a partial zzso at the zzso in the zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso is an important zzso of the intrinsic efficacy of zzso as well as their binding affinity at the zzso zzso and zzso (with respect to zzso were found to be the most influential zzso that determined the zzso activity of zzso
