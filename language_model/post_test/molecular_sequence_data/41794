zzso zzso derived from zzso and carrying the zzso zzso gene was found to be unstable in zzso a zzso zzso clinical isolate of zzso coli, and resulted in no change in zzso zzso zzso determined in the presence of zzso to ensure zzso presence, however, resulted in zzso zzso was proved to have a zzso zzso based on the DNA sequence of a zzso zzso of zzso DNA sequencing identified a common zzso zzso zzso as the cause of zzso To identify zzso other than zzso and zzso contributing to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso was zzso into zzso Sixteen percent of the zzso had a fourfold decrease in zzso zzso indicating the presence of a zzso zzso which contributes to zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and none of the zzso zzso zzso with a zzso to zzso increase in zzso zzso In the presence of zzso the resistance of a zzso zzso double zzso zzso zzso zzso (from zzso was fully zzso by zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso tests for zzso may be falsely negative with zzso instability, a difficulty which may be zzso by maintenance of zzso zzso In addition, if zzso zzso occur in zzso clinical zzso a positive test may overestimate the level of resistance attributable to zzso zzso
