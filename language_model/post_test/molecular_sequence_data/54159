zzso zzso zzso channels play an essential role in the visual and zzso sensory systems and are ubiquitous in zzso Details of their underlying zzso selectivity properties are still not fully understood and are a matter of debate in the absence of high-resolution zzso To reveal the structural mechanism of zzso selectivity in zzso channels, particularly their zzso zzso property, we engineered a set of mimics of zzso channel pores for both structural and functional zzso The mimics faithfully represent the zzso channels they are modeled after, zzso zzso and zzso equally well, and exhibit the same zzso zzso and zzso zzso Their high-resolution structures reveal a zzso unseen selectivity filter architecture zzso three zzso zzso binding sites in which zzso and zzso bind with different zzso zzso Our structural analysis reveals that the zzso zzso zzso in the filter is essential for zzso binding but not through direct zzso zzso as in the currently accepted zzso Furthermore, structural insight from our zzso mimics allows us to pinpoint equivalent interactions in zzso channels through zzso zzso that have previously not been predicted using zzso or zzso channel zzso
