The widespread occurrence of zzso zzso in zzso species deserves scrutiny that DNA zzso systems may be zzso by zzso zzso and zzso Here we studied the genes involved in DNA zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso containing S and T zzso inherited from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To determine the inheritance of DNA zzso genes and their expression patterns we examined three major DNA zzso families zzso zzso and zzso from tobacco and the zzso zzso Using Southern zzso zzso and zzso methods zzso zzso we found that the parental zzso of these gene families are retained in zzso zzso expression was found in all zzso examined zzso zzso zzso suggesting that DNA zzso genes were probably not themselves targets of zzso zzso zzso for over thousands of generations of zzso zzso The level of zzso and zzso zzso of selected zzso repeated sequences was similar and high in tobacco and its zzso zzso We speculate that natural selection might favor additive expression of parental DNA zzso genes maintaining high levels of DNA zzso in zzso which has a zzso zzso zzso
