We previously generated a zzso zzso zzso against a putative zzso zzso on native type II collagen zzso for the induction of zzso arthritis in mice zzso and an zzso zzso which appears to possess the internal image of the zzso zzso zzso In the present study, the structural basis of the zzso and zzso interactions was zzso When partially zzso zzso was zzso on Western zzso only fragments containing both heavy zzso and light zzso chains were recognized by zzso When zzso was partially zzso only fragments containing both H and L chains were recognized by zzso H and L chains were separated from zzso in a reduced, zzso condition, and each chain and a mixture of the two were zzso zzso reacted specifically to the zzso whole zzso zzso of zzso but not to the zzso L or to H zzso zzso single chain zzso zzso generated from zzso and zzso had properties of the original zzso whereas genetically constructed zzso zzso consisting of zzso from zzso and an irrelevant zzso or zzso of zzso and an irrelevant zzso did not react either to zzso or to zzso Thus, interactions among zzso zzso and zzso appear to depend on zzso structures containing different protein zzso These observations support the internal image property of the zzso In addition, this dependency on zzso structure for recognition of proteins may also be relevant to other zzso zzso
