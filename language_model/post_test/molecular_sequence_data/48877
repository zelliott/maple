Two novel zzso species were isolated during three independent studies of zzso associated with natural zzso in Brazil and zzso Analysis of the sequences of the zzso zzso of the large zzso zzso gene showed that these novel species belong to the zzso zzso The first was isolated from freshwater and a leaf of sugar cane zzso zzso in Brazil and from leaves of zzso zzso in zzso Described here as zzso zzso zzso zzso it differs by 56 zzso zzso and 19 gaps in the zzso region of the large zzso zzso gene from zzso zzso the least divergent zzso The second species, named zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from leaves and the zzso of sugar cane collected in Rio de Janeiro, zzso The species differs by 54 zzso zzso and nine gaps in the zzso zzso from zzso zzso its least divergent zzso The type strains are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CBS zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso CBS zzso zzso zzso zzso
