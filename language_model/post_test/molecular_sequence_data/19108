zzso half the transcripts zzso zzso proteins in zzso coli include a structured zzso motif that interacts with a specific zzso protein to inhibit gene zzso thus allowing zzso production of zzso zzso However, many of these zzso structures are not widely distributed across bacterial zzso It is increasingly common for zzso motifs associated with zzso protein genes to be identified using comparative zzso methods, yet these are rarely zzso zzso In this work, we characterize one such motif that precedes zzso containing zzso and zzso which zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso This zzso structure is widely distributed across many zzso of bacteria despite differences within the downstream zzso and examples are present in both zzso coli and zzso zzso We demonstrate a direct interaction between an example of the zzso from zzso zzso and an zzso complex using in zzso binding zzso verify our predicted secondary structure, and identify a putative zzso zzso The proposed binding site bears a strong resemblance to the zzso binding site within the zzso zzso suggesting molecular zzso This interaction is a valuable addition to the canon of zzso protein zzso zzso This work shows how experimental zzso translates zzso results into concrete knowledge of biological zzso
