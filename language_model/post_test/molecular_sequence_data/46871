zzso a zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso plasma of the American zzso crab zzso zzso is a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now identified three types of zzso protein in the plasma of the Japanese zzso crab zzso zzso based on different affinities against zzso and zzso determined by quantitative zzso zzso using zzso and an artificial zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences of the isolated zzso proteins identified zzso proteins which were named zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso each of which possibly constitute zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the most abundant zzso protein in the zzso exhibited the highest affinity to the zzso zzso but lacked both zzso and zzso zzso zzso bound to both zzso and zzso and exhibited zzso zzso and zzso activities, suggestive of zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso exhibited a higher affinity to zzso acid, a bacterial zzso zzso By contrast, zzso shows stronger zzso zzso and zzso activities than zzso zzso has no affinity to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This suggests zzso is a novel zzso zzso protein lacking a common characteristic of zzso binding zzso Twenty-two clones of zzso with different deduced zzso acid sequences were obtained by zzso using zzso zzso based on the zzso and zzso sequences of zzso and with templates including zzso DNA and zzso of zzso or zzso derived from one zzso The translation products of the zzso clones possess high molecular diversity which falls into three related groups, consistent with zzso based on their biological zzso Only zzso contained a unique zzso zzso sequence that appears in the zzso domain of a major zzso complex class I heavy chain of rainbow trout, suggesting the importance of the zzso patch to the zzso activity of zzso The structural and functional zzso of zzso provide a good model for studying the properties of innate immunity in zzso which survive without the benefit of acquired zzso
