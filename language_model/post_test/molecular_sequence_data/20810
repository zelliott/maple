Unlike most zzso gulf zzso have the capacity to switch from zzso to zzso as the predominate means of nitrogen zzso during periods of zzso The switch to zzso is a result of increased zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in the liver and muscle, which is initiated by zzso zzso typically affects gene expression through the action of zzso zzso factors, such as zzso zzso which bind to zzso response elements zzso in the upstream regulatory region of zzso The purpose of the present study was to identify the zzso responsible for increased zzso gene expression during zzso in gulf zzso using an in zzso zzso reporter zzso zzso promoter regions for both the ubiquitous and zzso zzso zzso were amplified by zzso Additionally, an zzso was amplified from the ubiquitous zzso zzso that suggested the possibility of two discreet transcripts for the zzso and zzso zzso When tested via in zzso reporter zzso both the zzso and zzso ubiquitous zzso promoters showed increased zzso activity during crowding zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso promoter showed no effects in response to zzso In zzso analysis of the zzso and zzso ubiquitous zzso promoter zzso showed an overlapping section of zzso zzso containing two potential zzso zzso of either site alone had no effect on zzso activity zzso zzso zzso However, when both sites were zzso a significant decrease in zzso activity was zzso We conclude that two functional zzso combine to zzso zzso zzso expression in the liver of gulf zzso
