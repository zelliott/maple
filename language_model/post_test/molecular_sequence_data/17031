zzso zzso are widely implicated in signaling between cellular zzso In zzso coli, zzso of zzso outer membrane zzso zzso in the envelope leads to expression of zzso genes in the zzso cellular zzso A zzso cascade conveys the zzso signal by regulated zzso of zzso a zzso zzso factor whose zzso domain zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso by zzso C zzso the membrane localized zzso zzso zzso zzso in its zzso domain, the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso near the inner zzso and the released zzso zzso zzso is further zzso zzso of zzso degradation by activated zzso makes the system sensitive to a wide range of zzso zzso and unresponsive to variations in the levels of zzso and zzso zzso These features rely on the inability of zzso to cleave intact zzso In the present report, we demonstrate that zzso which binds to the zzso face of zzso and zzso each independently zzso zzso zzso of intact zzso Thus, the function of zzso widely zzso among bacteria using the zzso pathway, and the second role of zzso (in addition to zzso zzso zzso is to improve the performance characteristics of this signal zzso zzso
