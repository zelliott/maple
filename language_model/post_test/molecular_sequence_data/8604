We have zzso zzso as a model compound to examine the zzso behavior of zzso DNA zzso zzso complex zzso zzso We have found that zzso zzso zzso the DNA synthetic capacity of pol alpha zzso in a zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA protects pol alpha zzso from zzso when present during zzso exposure, but zzso DNA, zzso and zzso do zzso zzso the activity of pol alpha zzso is strongly dependent upon the DNA zzso zzso to zzso zzso activity after exposure to the zzso The zzso activity of pol alpha is also zzso by exposure to zzso but the observed rate of zzso is slower than that seen for DNA zzso Competitive labeling studies with zzso zzso suggest that zzso zzso of the zzso is zzso through the modification of protein zzso zzso
