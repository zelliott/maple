We showed earlier that human zzso 15 zzso is zzso in prostate cancer, confirming studies from others that zzso zzso as a prostate cancer zzso In this first report on mouse zzso we show that, unlike in humans, four zzso zzso are present in zzso We used zzso analysis of zzso zzso to show that these four new zzso cluster within the zzso zzso zzso one of these mouse zzso zzso consists of two zzso zzso The existence of such a repeat zzso is so far unique in zzso though common in lower zzso zzso data indicate that zzso zzso sequesters zzso In a cellular context, zzso behaves as a bona fide zzso lowering central stress zzso zzso We reveal that a complex zzso organization zzso zzso expression: zzso results from zzso zzso and alternative zzso of two tandem duplicated mouse zzso zzso zzso profiling of all mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso reveals that two zzso switches occur between embryonic and adult zzso and indicates zzso as the major mouse zzso zzso in adult zzso zzso is present also in mouse prostate cancer cell zzso This insight into the mouse zzso family is fundamental for future studies on zzso in mouse zzso cancer zzso
