The zzso zzso an animal model for zzso retinal zzso has some characteristics similar to human flecked retinal zzso Here we report the identification of a deletion in a zzso nuclear zzso zzso zzso that is responsible for zzso retinal zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a pool of zzso zzso originally created by zzso zzso of zzso from normal and zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso of the gene corresponding to zzso to mouse zzso 9 near the zzso locus made it a candidate for the site of the zzso zzso Northern analysis of total zzso isolated from zzso mouse zzso revealed no zzso signal after zzso with the zzso zzso zzso However, with reverse zzso we were able to amplify different fragments of zzso from zzso retinal zzso and to sequence them zzso We found a zzso deletion in the coding region of the zzso zzso message that creates a frame shift and produces a premature stop zzso This deletion accounts for more than zzso of the normal protein and eliminates a portion of the zzso zzso In addition, it may result in the rapid degradation of the zzso zzso message by the zzso zzso pathway, preventing the synthesis of the corresponding zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso expression is critical for the normal development and function of the zzso zzso
