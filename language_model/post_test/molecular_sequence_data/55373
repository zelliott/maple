With the intensive application of zzso in aquaculture and animal zzso and the increase of zzso discharged into the zzso there is an increasing need to find a way to zzso zzso zzso Two bacterial strains capable of degrading zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from marine zzso zzso and zzso were identified as members of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, based on zzso zzso gene zzso zzso of each zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was characterized using zzso zzso About 66 or zzso of zzso and 45 or zzso of zzso contained in the media was zzso by zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso respectively, after incubation for zzso The zzso from culture of zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso grown in zzso or zzso contained media had much attenuated zzso against zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are new bacterial resources for zzso zzso and indicate the potential of isolated strains for the zzso of zzso zzso
