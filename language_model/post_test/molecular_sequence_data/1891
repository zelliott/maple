A zzso zzso infectious zzso was constructed by exchanging the zzso zzso and envelope zzso genes of the yellow fever virus vaccine strain zzso zzso with the corresponding genes of zzso virus zzso This latter virus belongs to the cluster of the zzso zzso zzso and is, unlike zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso of in zzso zzso from this zzso zzso was shown by zzso labeling and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and E proteins was monitored by zzso and revealed that the zzso proteins were correctly and efficiently produced from the zzso precursor zzso The zzso E protein was shown to be zzso zzso whereas zzso as predicted from the zzso zzso did not contain zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso virus zzso with a similar efficiency as the parental zzso although it formed smaller plaques than zzso and zzso In zzso mice that had been infected zzso with the zzso virus, the viral load increased steadily until zzso The zzso virus, like zzso from which it had acquired the zzso and E structural zzso but unlike zzso proved zzso in zzso zzso Animals developed neurological symptoms about 15 days after zzso and died shortly zzso The distribution of zzso zzso in the brain of infected mice was similar to that observed in zzso zzso The observations provide compelling evidence that the zzso of zzso of zzso are entirely located in the envelope proteins zzso and zzso
