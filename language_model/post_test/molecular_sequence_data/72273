Comparative studies of zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate species differences in the regional expression of zzso zzso receptors in the zzso These species differences have not been observed with other neurotransmitter receptors (except zzso Species differences for OT zzso distribution were also observed in other zzso and zzso species selected as zzso or zzso These chemical zzso differences appear to be functionally relevant, as treatments with selective OT zzso and zzso influence those behaviors that appear critical to pair bonding in the zzso prairie zzso To investigate the mechanism controlling zzso expression of OT zzso we zzso the OT zzso gene in both prairie zzso and zzso zzso The findings are zzso Although both species differ markedly from rat and human in their regulatory (but not their zzso zzso the species show very subtle differences from each zzso zzso studies are investigating the consequences of these subtle differences between prairie and zzso zzso At the same time, several zzso factors that might influence OT zzso expression need to be zzso zzso zzso IN zzso The rat zzso zzso gene zzso cited in zzso 4 and 5, was based on an error published in zzso zzso The corrected sequence has now been published zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA zzso zzso The correct sequence shows greater zzso with the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso but the remaining differences support the argument made zzso for species differences in regional zzso zzso
