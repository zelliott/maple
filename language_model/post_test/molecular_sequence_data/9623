zzso growth factor zzso is an zzso zzso that is essential for the normal growth and development of various zzso such as the zzso To decipher the molecular mechanisms that regulate zzso gene induction at the zzso level, we carried out in zzso and in zzso studies on the mouse zzso gene zzso We have identified a novel regulatory element, located between zzso and zzso zzso (from the zzso start zzso in the zzso zzso promoter region, which binds to zzso zzso factors and dictates responsiveness to zzso stimuli that activate this zzso The core binding sequence for the zzso zzso factors was determined to be zzso zzso to zzso zzso within the zzso zzso Competition and gel mobility zzso zzso showed that these binding complexes are composed of zzso zzso protein zzso and zzso DNA binding analysis also revealed that the binding site for the zzso family of zzso factors in the zzso promoter region zzso that of another binding protein zzso zzso which binds specifically to a novel sequence with a core binding site of zzso located adjacent to the zzso site zzso to zzso zzso C1 binds to this region of the promoter and zzso the zzso zzso by zzso through direct competition for their individual binding zzso zzso zzso which is known to activate zzso gene expression in the liver, increased zzso (especially zzso binding activity to this region of the zzso zzso Thus, our present results provide a zzso explanation for the zzso induction of the zzso gene by zzso signals zzso zzso that induce tissue growth and zzso
