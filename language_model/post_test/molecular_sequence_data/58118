To appreciate point zzso in zzso genes as causes for zzso zzso diseases, the normal variation of these gene sequences in the population must be zzso Because genetic zzso of zzso at the protein level due to zzso variation has been described for the type II zzso 4 and 5, we have analyzed their corresponding genes using zzso zzso zzso gel zzso and sequence analysis of zzso chain reaction amplified zzso zzso Although no sequence variations were found in the zzso and rod zzso we were able to map the molecular differences among the zzso to their zzso zzso In particular, we have identified three zzso of zzso zzso Two zzso differed by a zzso transition causing a neutral zzso acid substitution zzso to zzso and one zzso had a zzso zzso deletion corresponding to 14 zzso acids within the zzso zzso Three zzso were also recognized for the zzso 5 zzso all being zzso by single zzso zzso Of these, only one altered the zzso acid zzso replacing an zzso zzso with a charged zzso zzso zzso acid in the zzso zzso zzso analyses in three families showed the zzso to be inherited as zzso zzso zzso Thus, these normal zzso of zzso 4 and 5 will provide favorable zzso markers for linkage analysis directly within the cluster of type II zzso genes located on zzso zzso to zzso the potential involvement of these and other zzso genes in disorders of zzso cell zzso
