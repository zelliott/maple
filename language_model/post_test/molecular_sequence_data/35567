zzso peptides zzso are a group of short, zzso zzso peptides that represent a zzso technology for delivering zzso and zzso into live zzso In this study, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to be capable of entering zzso zzso were able to efficiently deliver zzso associated with zzso including zzso zzso red fluorescent proteins zzso and semiconductor quantum dots, into zzso The functional reporter gene zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso containing the enhanced green fluorescent protein and zzso coding sequences could be actively expressed in zzso The zzso zzso further confirmed that zzso cargo delivery was not toxic to zzso Thus, these two zzso hold a great potential for the delivery of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso
