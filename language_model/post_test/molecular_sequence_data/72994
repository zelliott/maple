zzso clones zzso two new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been identified by searching the zzso database of expressed sequence tags zzso They represent a novel branch of zzso zzso plant zzso which is only zzso identical in zzso acid sequence to the well characterized group of basic plant zzso represented by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso C, zzso zzso and the similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso However zzso zzso is zzso identical in zzso acid sequence to a zzso zzso by an zzso isolated from cotton zzso zzso As cotton and zzso belong to rather diverse families zzso and zzso respectively), in contrast with zzso and zzso (both zzso the high degree of sequence identity indicates that this novel type of zzso albeit of unknown function, is likely to be widespread in plant zzso The zzso 1 and zzso 2 types of zzso sequences were the most redundant among the 28 different zzso identified among about 200 zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, 8 out of totally 38 zzso sequences coding for zzso 1 showed three identical zzso zzso This zzso form is designated zzso zzso Similarly, six out of totally 16 zzso sequences coding for zzso 2 showed a number of deletions and zzso zzso This zzso form is designated zzso zzso The selected zzso clones are full-length and contain coding regions of zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso for zzso zzso These regions show zzso DNA sequence zzso The predicted mature proteins zzso zzso and zzso zzso are 57% identical in sequence and contain the structurally and functionally important zzso characteristic of the plant zzso zzso However, they do show two differences of importance to zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso linked with the active site zzso zzso via hydrogen bonding is zzso zzso an zzso site is located right at the entrance to the zzso zzso The reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso was used to identify zzso coding for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso seeds, zzso roots, leaves, zzso flowers and cell suspension culture using zzso factor zzso zzso for the first time as a positive zzso Both zzso were transcribed at levels comparable to zzso in all plant zzso investigated which were more than two days old, and in cell suspension zzso In addition, the zzso coding for zzso zzso was found in two day old zzso zzso The abundant zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso is in line with their many entries in zzso and indicates essential roles for these novel zzso
