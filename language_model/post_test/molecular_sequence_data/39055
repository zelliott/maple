Among the three related zzso M, and S envelope proteins of the zzso B virus zzso the L and S zzso are required for zzso zzso Whereas the pivotal function of the zzso region of L in zzso zzso has been established, the contribution of its S domain and the S protein is less zzso In this study, we evaluated the role of the zzso S loop, common to L and zzso in zzso assembly by performing zzso zzso To distinguish between the effect of the zzso on either envelope or zzso formation, we investigated the ability of the zzso to assemble into zzso zzso empty envelopes and to replace the zzso proteins in zzso zzso zzso zzso production was found to be blocked by each of the zzso deletion and substitution zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso while an zzso within the loop is zzso Surprisingly, single zzso of the zzso terminating the loop had an opposite effect: while a conservative exchange of zzso still allowed zzso formation, the same zzso of zzso did zzso The critical sequences and/or structural requirements of the zzso S loop involved in zzso zzso primarily act in the S zzso These findings can be related to a model for a zzso function of both L and S proteins in zzso zzso
