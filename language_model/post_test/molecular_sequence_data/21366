zzso is a zzso regulatory gene which has been shown to positively regulate the zzso zzso and zzso affect the zzso of zzso zzso In this study, we investigate the mechanism of zzso on modulating zzso production in zzso zzso 

The zzso start point of zzso was determined by high-resolution zzso zzso mapping and localized at the zzso T at position 37 zzso upstream of the potential zzso translation start zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhanced its own transcription, but retarded the zzso zzso zzso of zzso enhanced zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso bound to the upstream region of zzso but it did not bind to the upstream region of its zzso gene zzso zzso and the zzso region between zzso and zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso showed that the zzso site upstream of zzso was zzso which was designated as zzso zzso of zzso resulted in the delay of zzso production that was similar to that of zzso disruption zzso 

These results indicated that zzso modulated zzso zzso as an zzso via interaction with the promoter region of zzso and expanded our understanding about regulatory cascade in zzso zzso
