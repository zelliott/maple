The zzso regulation of the human reduced folate carrier zzso involved in cellular zzso of zzso and reduced zzso was studied in childhood acute zzso leukemia zzso The zzso gene is regulated by six zzso zzso zzso and A to zzso and multiple zzso In zzso zzso and zzso are the major transcript zzso 

zzso from 18 ALL zzso specimens and 10 zzso zzso combined zzso ALL zzso were zzso by real-time reverse zzso for zzso and zzso transcripts and for transcripts zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso For the zzso gel shift and zzso zzso zzso assessed zzso factor binding to the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso density within a zzso region, including the core zzso promoter, was established by zzso zzso zzso and zzso promoter zzso were zzso by DNA zzso 

For the 28 zzso zzso and zzso transcripts spanned a zzso zzso By zzso zzso and gel shift zzso binding was confirmed for zzso and zzso for zzso and for zzso zzso and zzso for zzso zzso transcript levels correlated with those for zzso and zzso for zzso and with zzso and zzso transcripts for zzso zzso zzso in ALL did not correlate with zzso zzso In 40 ALL and 17 zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were detected in the zzso zzso none were detected in promoter zzso The zzso zzso only slightly affected promoter zzso 

Our results show a complex regulation of zzso in ALL involving the zzso and zzso promoters and zzso zzso Although zzso zzso and zzso levels are critical zzso of zzso zzso in zzso neither DNA zzso nor promoter zzso contribute to differences in zzso zzso
