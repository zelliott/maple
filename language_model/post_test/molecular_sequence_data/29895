A soluble zzso zzso with zzso Mr of zzso is believed to function by interacting with zzso zzso because it has been detected zzso by zzso This zzso has been questioned, however, since the zzso lacks a zzso signal zzso which challenges the contention that it is zzso We have demonstrated zzso of this zzso from C2 mouse muscle cells by both zzso of metabolically labeled protein and zzso zzso We further show that zzso of the zzso is a zzso regulated process that accompanies zzso differentiation and that the zzso zzso with zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during intermediate stages of zzso suggests that the zzso becomes concentrated in zzso of plasma zzso which pinch off to form zzso zzso zzso zzso This suggests a possible mechanism for zzso export from the zzso to the zzso zzso
