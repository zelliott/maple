zzso zzso is a human specific zzso zzso by zzso zzso In the present study, we performed molecular modeling of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso O, zzso zzso O, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to compare the membrane binding zzso including the zzso zzso region which is thought to be necessary for the zzso activity of zzso 

The molecular models of zzso were constructed using zzso with zzso module with X-ray data of zzso O zzso 

The zzso zzso was long and rod zzso and comprised four zzso zzso was shown to possess zzso surfaces within the zzso and the potential to stack with 8 degrees of zzso leading to a ring cluster of 45 molecules or so in the human zzso cell zzso 

From the molecular zzso calculations and zzso potential analysis, we considered that the zzso zzso region has different features from those of traditional zzso and the zzso domain 4 should be very useful to apply the human zzso targeting zzso
