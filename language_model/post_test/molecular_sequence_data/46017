New repeat sequences were found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso They accounted for approximately zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and were estimated to be more abundant in zzso of its closely related species belonging to the zzso zzso complex, whereas it was entirely absent in the zzso zzso zzso They were zzso throughout zzso regions of the zzso usually as short tandem zzso of unit zzso which were mostly zzso zzso long with two distinct zzso at 180 and 189 zzso in the length zzso The zzso differences among unit sequences within the same array zzso were much smaller than those between separate zzso suggesting zzso concerted zzso The zzso tree of the repeat sequences from different zzso showed that zzso between sequences from different zzso arms occurred only at earlier stages of evolution, while those within the same zzso arm occurred thereafter, resulting in the increase in copy zzso We found zzso zzso III promoter sequences (A box and B zzso which play a critical role in zzso of short zzso zzso We also found zzso zzso structures, which are possibly associated with certain DNA zzso responsible for the increase in copy number within a zzso zzso Such an zzso combination of characteristics zzso wide zzso and tandem zzso may have been generated by these different zzso mechanisms during the course of zzso
