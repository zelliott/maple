zzso zzso regulates zzso zzso levels, and thus zzso protein zzso zzso activity, in response to changes in zzso zzso zzso in any of eight zzso genes inhibit zzso repression of zzso transcription, alter the cell zzso and cause a reduction in the growth zzso The eight zzso genes zzso components of an zzso zzso zzso pathway, zzso zzso itself, and the zzso zzso of zzso Three of these genes have been identified in other studies as regulators of zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso cloned as a high copy number zzso of a zzso in zzso is able to suppress the defects zzso by a zzso in any of these zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that zzso encodes a protein most closely related to the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso that had previously been identified as a high copy number zzso of zzso in zzso zzso that reduce or eliminate zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene causes a significant delay in exit from stationary phase when combined with a disruption of the zzso zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso of zzso However, the zzso disruption by itself has little or no effect upon zzso transcription, zzso or exit from stationary phase, and does not enhance the zzso zzso zzso observed in a zzso zzso zzso zzso appears to function in a redundant fashion to zzso but to varying degrees, in the pathways regulated by zzso
