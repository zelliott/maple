Among bird species, the most studied major zzso complex zzso is the chicken zzso Although the number of studies on zzso in zzso species is zzso the knowledge on zzso variation in species closely related to chicken is required to understand the peculiarities of bird zzso zzso Here we describe the variation of zzso class zzso zzso zzso 2 in a population of the Grey zzso zzso zzso a species of high conservation concern throughout Europe and an emerging zzso model in studies of sexual zzso We found 12 zzso in 108 individuals, but in comparison to other birds surprisingly many sites show signatures of historical positive zzso zzso displayed between two to four zzso both on zzso and complementary DNA, suggesting the presence of two functional zzso zzso zzso and gene conversion appear to be involved in generating zzso diversity in the Grey zzso two zzso zzso and several gene conversion events were zzso In zzso analysis of zzso zzso the Grey zzso zzso do not cluster together, but are scattered through the tree zzso Thus, our results indicate that the Grey zzso zzso is comparable to most other zzso in terms of copy number and population zzso
