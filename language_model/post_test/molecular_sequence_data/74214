The replacement of zzso in zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso by their zzso coli zzso resulted in active zzso as zzso susceptible as the zzso coli zzso This demonstrates that the primary structure of zzso determines intrinsic zzso resistance and was supported by a three-dimensional model of zzso zzso
