zzso comprise a family of zzso proteins that are central to the control of zzso zzso muscle zzso To understand the functional role of zzso zzso differences in cardiac muscle, we generated transgenic mice that zzso zzso zzso zzso in the adult zzso Nine transgenic lines show a zzso increase in zzso zzso expression in the heart, along with a zzso increase in the associated zzso This increase in zzso message and protein causes a zzso decrease in the level of zzso transcripts and their associated zzso There is a preferential formation of the alpha zzso in the transgenic mouse zzso and there are no zzso zzso in the expression of other zzso protein zzso including the zzso zzso zzso When expression from the zzso zzso is zzso zzso expression returns to normal zzso No structural changes were observed in these transgenic hearts nor in the associated zzso Interestingly, zzso analyses of these hearts using a zzso model reveal a significant effect on zzso zzso As such, this study demonstrates that a coordinate regulatory mechanism exists between zzso and zzso gene expression in the zzso heart, which results in a functional correlation between zzso and zzso zzso content and cardiac zzso
