zzso of zzso zzso is required for the zzso of a functional zzso zzso Recently, we used a targeted zzso approach using mass zzso and zzso to identify changes in the zzso profile of wild type and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso characterize novel zzso and assign function to genes to define the zzso acid zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we use a similar approach to further define the zzso and zzso complement of zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso we demonstrate that, in addition to zzso acid, zzso coli zzso also produces two structurally distinct zzso zzso zzso that were observed as negative zzso at zzso zzso and zzso 651 zzso and zzso zzso interaction liquid zzso zzso yielded suitable amounts of the pure sugar zzso for zzso zzso using a cold zzso zzso analysis in conjunction with molecular modeling identified the sugar zzso as zzso and zzso derivatives of zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso analyses of zzso zzso established a role for the zzso genes and defined two new zzso genes in this locus as zzso acid zzso zzso This is the first report of zzso acid in zzso zzso and the first report of zzso acid derivatives as modifications on a zzso
