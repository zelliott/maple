zzso generation and zzso zzso zzso are the ultimate zzso reactions in the blood zzso zzso zzso zzso a protein zzso by the human pathogen zzso zzso activates zzso zzso without zzso The zzso complex recognizes zzso as a specific zzso converting it directly into zzso The crystal structure of a fully active SC zzso containing zzso zzso zzso bound to human zzso 2 showed previously that SC zzso its zzso N zzso into the zzso pocket of zzso 2, inducing a functional active site in the zzso zzso zzso zzso I of zzso the zzso recognition site, and zzso I on zzso are blocked by domain 2 of zzso In the present studies, active zzso fluorescent zzso zzso were used to zzso zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso binding and zzso are zzso by expression of a new zzso zzso on the zzso complex, resulting in formation of an zzso zzso complex with a zzso constant of zzso zzso In both crystal structures, the zzso complexes form zzso with both zzso facing each other over a large zzso zzso through which the zzso zzso could zzso On this basis, a molecular model of the zzso zzso encounter complex was generated, which explains the zzso properties and efficient zzso zzso The results provide new insight into the mechanism that mediates high affinity zzso binding and zzso as a zzso of zzso complexes, a process that is central to the molecular pathology of zzso zzso zzso
