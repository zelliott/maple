The genes zzso zzso chains in zzso are arranged in clusters or zzso an organizational pattern dramatically different from the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso gene arrangements, which have now been found in zzso as well, pose interesting dilemmas for understanding the mechanisms of zzso gene expression and regulation in terms of zzso exclusion and zzso zzso We have zzso five zzso zzso clones zzso complete zzso shark zzso zzso zzso L chain gene zzso While the coding regions among all five clones are highly zzso the zzso regions have significant differences that allowed us to identify two types of zzso L chain zzso The zzso regions are zzso zzso identical between groups, while the three clones belonging to the first group share zzso zzso identity in their zzso zzso The second group is more diverse and may be comprised of several related zzso The two clones in this group share approximately zzso identity in the zzso zzso Variations in the promoter region, including zzso and zzso box orientation and position, are identified between the two groups and may have implications for the molecular regulation of zzso zzso Our results show the zzso shark zzso L chain family to be a complex and diverse zzso
