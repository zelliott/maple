The zzso mode of a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso seeds zzso was investigated by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The crystal structure of zzso in a complex with an zzso zzso zzso , was successfully zzso and revealed the binding mode of the zzso to be an zzso site, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These are the first zzso data showing the zzso mode of a family zzso zzso From zzso analysis of the zzso reaction products, zzso of zzso to zzso was found to affect the product distribution obtained from the zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments confirmed the zzso finding that the zzso side chain interacts with the zzso zzso of the bound zzso To further confirm the zzso data, binding experiments were also conducted in solution using zzso zzso Several signals in the zzso zzso N zzso spectrum of the stable zzso zzso were affected upon addition of zzso zzso Signal assignments revealed that most signals responsive to the addition of zzso are derived from zzso acids located at the surface of the zzso zzso The binding mode deduced from zzso binding experiments in solution was consistent with that from the crystal zzso
