The zzso zzso segments of both zzso hormone zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso bind and activate the same membrane zzso in spite of major differences in their zzso acid zzso The hypothesis was made that they share the same zzso zzso when bound to the zzso A common structural motif in all zzso fragments of the hormone in zzso zzso or in zzso solution containing zzso zzso is the presence of two zzso segments at the zzso and zzso of the zzso In order to stabilize the zzso structures, we have recently zzso and studied the zzso analog zzso zzso which contains zzso zzso side chains at positions zzso zzso This very potent zzso exhibits enhanced zzso stability with respect to the corresponding linear zzso and also two flexible sites at positions 12 and 19 in zzso zzso These structural elements have been suggested to play a critical role in zzso In the present work we have extended our zzso studies on the zzso zzso analog to zzso zzso By CD, zzso and structure calculations we have shown that in water two zzso segments are present in the region of the zzso bridges zzso and zzso with high flexibility around zzso and zzso Thus, the essential structural features observed in the zzso medium are maintained in water even if, in this zzso the overall structure is more zzso Our findings confirm the stabilizing effect of zzso zzso constraints on the zzso zzso
