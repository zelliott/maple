zzso dynamics umbrella sampling simulations are used to compare the relative stability of the active zzso of the zzso domain of zzso zzso while the zzso 416 in the zzso loop zzso is either zzso or zzso When the zzso is zzso there is considerable flexibility of the zzso While the active zzso of the zzso is not forbidden and can be visited zzso it is not the zzso zzso This is consistent with the view that zzso displays some zzso activity even when the zzso is zzso In contrast, zzso of the zzso contributes to stabilize several structural features that are critical for zzso such as the zzso regulatory spine, the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In zzso the zzso landscape calculations demonstrate that zzso of zzso 416 in the zzso essentially zzso the zzso into its zzso competent zzso
