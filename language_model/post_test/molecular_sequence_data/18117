A DNA sequence between two zzso genes in zzso is a member of the zzso class of zzso and represents one member of a zzso and zzso dispersed repeated sequence family in zzso This sequence can be exploited in genetic studies either by zzso analysis where several markers can be scored together, or the segregation of individual elements can be followed after zzso amplification of specific zzso
