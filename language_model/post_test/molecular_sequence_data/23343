zzso zzso sulfur bacteria occur at shallow zzso vents near White Point, zzso There, these filaments are attached densely to diverse zzso and zzso zzso and extend one to several zzso into the surrounding environment, where they are alternately exposed to zzso and zzso zzso zzso of native filaments collected from this location indicate that these filaments possess novel zzso and zzso properties compared to all other zzso bacteria characterized to zzso zzso zzso ranging in diameter from 4 to 100 zzso or more, were composed of zzso cells, each containing a thin zzso of sulfur zzso zzso surrounding a large central zzso A near-complete zzso zzso gene sequence was obtained and confirmed by fluorescent in zzso zzso to be associated only with filaments having a diameter of 10 zzso or zzso zzso analysis indicates that these wider, attached filaments form within the gamma zzso a zzso group that includes all previously described zzso sulfur bacteria (the zzso zzso zzso and zzso and no zzso zzso However, unlike for all previously described zzso bacteria, repeated zzso of cell zzso from samples collected over 2 years indicate that the attached White Point filaments do not store internal zzso It is possible that these zzso are involved in transient storage of oxygen or contribute to the relative zzso of these zzso
