Recently, genetic studies have implicated zzso in zzso zzso the most common of the childhood learning zzso The first functional data indicated that the zzso protein is expressed on the plasma membrane and may be involved in zzso zzso Further analysis of the zzso distribution of the zzso protein in zzso cells indicates that zzso can zzso with the early zzso marker early zzso zzso 1 zzso in large zzso zzso suggesting that it is zzso zzso zzso zzso with full-length zzso and deletion zzso confirmed that zzso is zzso and showed the importance of the zzso zzso region in this zzso The present study has identified the medium zzso zzso of zzso protein 2 zzso as a binding partner of zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Using zzso zzso or depletion of the zzso of zzso or zzso heavy chain by zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso follows a zzso zzso zzso We also identify zzso of zzso as a critical zzso acid required for the interaction with zzso and subsequent zzso These results suggest the surface expression of zzso is regulated by zzso supporting the idea that the zzso and recycling of the protein may be involved in fine tuning its role in zzso zzso
