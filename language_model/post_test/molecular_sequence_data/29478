zzso zzso strain zzso zzso several proteins in response to zzso zzso We have found that one of these zzso designated zzso is a novel zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso was cloned in zzso zzso DNA sequencing analysis revealed that the open reading frame of zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso is a modular zzso consisting of five zzso the signal zzso the zzso zzso the family A zzso region, the zzso kidney disease domain zzso and the zzso domain type 3 zzso zzso plasmids coding for zzso or both zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The zzso but not zzso exhibited strong binding to zzso and zzso Western and Northern analyses demonstrated that zzso was induced in the presence of zzso zzso or zzso Native zzso was zzso to zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso The molecular mass of mature zzso was estimated to be 44 zzso by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The optimum pH and temperature of zzso were pH zzso and 35 degrees C, respectively, and even at 10 degrees C the zzso showed zzso of the maximum zzso zzso of native zzso with zzso significantly promoted zzso zzso
