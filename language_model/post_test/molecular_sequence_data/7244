We generated a zzso zzso zzso specifically recognizing rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso of zzso or at the zzso sites in zzso zzso and zzso Using zzso we demonstrate that a brief exposure of a rat zzso slice to zzso leads to transient zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso cell zzso zzso zzso over 30 zzso was obtained when exposure to zzso was preceded by a 15 zzso zzso of the slice with zzso zzso or zzso A but not zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso of zzso or the corresponding sites in other zzso zzso zzso is a specific site at which zzso takes place when zzso zzso are activated by zzso especially under the influence of certain second zzso zzso
