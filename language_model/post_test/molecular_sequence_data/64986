zzso zzso is involved in the production of zzso zzso zzso We isolated and characterized zzso a gene zzso zzso zzso from the zzso fungus zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso encodes a putative protein that has 185 zzso zzso a molecular weight of 21 zzso and zzso sequence identity to other zzso zzso zzso zzso disruption of zzso showed that this gene is necessary for zzso zzso in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso transcripts are specifically enhanced by zzso zzso zzso zzso
