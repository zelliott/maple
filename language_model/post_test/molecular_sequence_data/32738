zzso zzso zzso channels assemble as zzso zzso and each zzso contributes two structural zzso an zzso zzso domain zzso and a zzso zzso channel zzso Models of zzso zzso include zzso movements of zzso leading to opening of the zzso zzso We tested this idea using zzso zzso accessibility to track zzso changes in the inner beta sheet of the zzso Using a zzso chick zzso background zzso we constructed 18 consecutive zzso replacement zzso zzso to zzso and tested each for expression of zzso zzso currents and functional sensitivity to zzso zzso We measured rates of modification in the presence and absence of zzso to identify zzso changes associated with zzso zzso zzso modification rates of eight zzso zzso in the zzso and zzso strands and the sequence between them zzso 2) varied over several orders of zzso suggesting substantial differences in the accessibility or zzso environment of individual side zzso These differences were in general agreement with structural models of the zzso Eight of 18 zzso replacements displayed zzso changes in modification rates, indicating a change in the accessibility or zzso environment of the introduced zzso during zzso We were surprised that the effects of zzso exposure were difficult to reconcile with zzso models of zzso zzso reduced the modification rate of zzso but increased it at zzso despite the close physical proximity of these zzso Our results suggest that models that depend strictly on zzso rotation of the zzso may provide an incomplete description of zzso zzso
