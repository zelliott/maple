zzso has been known as a cloned zzso expressed selectively in the zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso To determine the molecular identity and function of zzso zzso zzso were raised against a zzso fusion protein zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso inhibited the zzso envelope digesting activity of the medium zzso zzso in which zzso zzso zzso were zzso On Western zzso zzso medium contained 60 zzso and 40 zzso molecules zzso with these zzso zzso zzso showed a specific zzso of zzso protein in the zzso zzso cells which appeared first at stage 20, increased in number and intensity to stage 31 then decreased gradually zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso protein is localized exclusively in the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso A zzso library from the zzso portion of stage 25 zzso was screened with zzso and a zzso zzso insert thus cloned contained additional zzso and zzso at the zzso and 3' ends of zzso zzso This zzso designated zzso contained an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso acids including both signal and zzso zzso The predicted mature zzso zzso 425 zzso acids consists of about 200 zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso family at the zzso followed by two repeats of zzso domain each 110 zzso zzso We conclude that zzso represents an approximately 3/4 zzso portion of the zzso zzso
