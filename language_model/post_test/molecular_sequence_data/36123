The occurrence of zzso and zzso zzso was investigated in zzso tumors produced by treating genetically resistant Copenhagen zzso rats with zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso in both zzso and zzso genes were analyzed by a zzso chain zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso More than half of the zzso analyzed contained an activated zzso zzso This was also the zzso zzso in similar tumors from susceptible zzso rats, suggesting a common mechanism of zzso In contrast, only two of 15 zzso zzso zzso from the Cop rats contained an activated zzso zzso suggesting a different initiation mechanism for most of these zzso zzso zzso was found in none of five and one of five zzso from zzso and Cop rats, respectively, and in none of 13 zzso zzso from Cop zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso does not play a major role in the initiation of the zzso zzso
