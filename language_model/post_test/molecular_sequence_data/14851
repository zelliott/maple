Identification and typing of zzso is very important for zzso zzso testing and diagnostic zzso This paper describes the development and validation of the alternative methods for species identification and typing of zzso based on a zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso there were zzso clinical zzso analyzed which include 348 strains of zzso tuberculosis complex zzso zzso strains of zzso tuberculosis and 6 strains of zzso zzso and 35 strains of zzso zzso zzso represented by 16 different zzso zzso bacterial profiling zzso by means of zzso zzso was carried zzso zzso analysis of zzso mass zzso divided them into two large separate groups corresponding to zzso and zzso and also demonstrated the possibility of isolate identification at the species zzso zzso protocol based on mass zzso was developed and zzso it matched completely to classical zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso has potential as a rapid and zzso platform for the identification and typing of zzso zzso
