We have identified and cloned a novel toxin gene zzso from zzso zzso strain isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The DNA sequence of cloned toxin gene zzso zzso has an open reading frame zzso zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso The toxin sequence shares zzso identical zzso acid zzso with the previously reported zzso cloned from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The toxin gene was successfully expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso toxin protein caused a rapid zzso in mortality of zzso zzso larvae zzso death of larvae within 2 zzso zzso the zzso expression of the novel gene zzso cloned into zzso coli zzso zzso produced zzso toxin with high zzso zzso
