zzso is a potent and selective zzso inhibitor that has been isolated from the zzso of zzso zzso It does not interact with the zzso site of the zzso but binds to both zzso zzso 1 and 2 resulting in a potent zzso of zzso activity towards zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso zzso zzso 32, zzso zzso is a zzso protein composed of two zzso zzso zzso A and B, of 15 zzso and 13 zzso zzso The sequences of A and B chains determined by molecular cloning exhibit a high degree of identity with other snake zzso zzso zzso In contrast to other zzso that interact with zzso zzso 1, the zzso acid sequence of zzso does not contain an zzso sequence similar to the zzso tail of zzso zzso of functional zzso was achieved in zzso cells upon zzso with two zzso zzso containing the complete zzso zzso zzso which was zzso into the zzso was able to bind to and inhibit zzso When expressed alone, the B chain formed inactive zzso that were zzso into the culture zzso In contrast, no zzso protein was detected in zzso media from cells zzso with the A zzso
