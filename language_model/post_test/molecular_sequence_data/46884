zzso is a zzso protein that is zzso from many cells although the protein lacks a signal sequence for transfer into the zzso zzso and zzso compartments and entry into classical zzso zzso Previously it was shown that attachment of the first 120 zzso acid zzso of the zzso sequence of zzso zzso to the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso supported the rapid zzso of the fusion protein from zzso zzso zzso cells under conditions in which zzso protein was not zzso Here we report that progressive zzso zzso gradually reduced zzso of the fusion zzso eventually to very low levels compared with the starting product, but did not totally eliminate zzso until a significant majority of the sequence was zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins containing internal deletions in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence were also zzso to a similar extent to the starting product, but further deletion of zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the sequence zzso in two zzso zzso fusion proteins greatly reduced or abolished their zzso whereas similar zzso of zzso pairings present elsewhere in the zzso zzso segments of these proteins had no zzso The results indicate that this sequence is one essential zzso for zzso of zzso fusion proteins and by zzso zzso at least from zzso zzso zzso However, the short sequence of zzso zzso by itself is insufficient to direct zzso of zzso fusion proteins and appears to be active only in the context of a larger portion of the zzso zzso zzso
