zzso premature zzso failure causes young women to develop zzso symptoms and zzso A similar syndrome appears in mice with zzso zzso premature zzso zzso We demonstrate that these mice develop zzso against a zzso protein located in the zzso zzso zzso By screening a mouse zzso complementary DNA expression library with zzso serum, we have identified a novel mouse gene with a zzso zzso transcript, the expression of which is restricted to the zzso The longest open reading frame zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso designated zzso zzso protein zzso The protein is composed of zzso zzso acids with a predicted molecular mass of zzso zzso Based on its primary structure, it appears to be novel and has no motifs to suggest a zzso other than in the zzso The ability of immune serum from mice with zzso zzso to react specifically with zzso zzso raises the possibility that zzso as an zzso may play a role in zzso zzso premature zzso zzso
