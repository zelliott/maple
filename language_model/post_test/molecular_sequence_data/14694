Recent findings of sequence convergence in the zzso gene among some bats and zzso suggest that parallel adaptations for zzso hearing have taken place during the evolution of zzso To determine if this gene is an exception, or instead similar processes have occurred in other hearing zzso we have examined zzso and zzso both of which are associated with zzso hearing loss in zzso These genes were amplified and zzso from a number of zzso species, including zzso and zzso bats and zzso and were zzso together with published zzso Sections of both genes showed zzso signals that conflicted with accepted species zzso with coding regions uniting zzso zzso bats in a zzso zzso zzso estimates of zzso probabilities of zzso and divergent zzso provided more direct evidence of sequence convergence between the two groups of zzso zzso bats as well as between zzso bats and zzso We found strong evidence of positive selection acting on some zzso bat species and zzso zzso contrasting with zzso selection on zzso zzso zzso of sequence convergence and molecular adaptation in two additional hearing genes suggest that the acquisition of zzso hearing has involved multiple zzso
