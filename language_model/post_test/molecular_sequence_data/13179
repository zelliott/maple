An increase in zzso zzso zzso expression after nerve injury was demonstrated by means of differential display zzso zzso coupled with in zzso zzso zzso was carried out to compare differences in expression of zzso between zzso and normal zzso zzso in the zzso The expression of several gene fragments were found to be increased following nerve zzso the full length zzso corresponding to one zzso was cloned by subsequent rat zzso library zzso The close zzso of zzso zzso with our rat zzso led us to conclude that this clone zzso to the rat zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We speculate that the zzso of this zzso zzso system may increase the resistance of these cells against zzso zzso zzso during the process of nerve zzso
