zzso cell zzso is comprised of zzso membrane regions and zzso regions with zzso zzso While zzso junctions zzso are abundant in zzso regions, their role in the zzso process is largely zzso To explore this issue, a small zzso hairpin zzso directed against zzso has been delivered using zzso infection of zzso cells at early stages of zzso in zzso With strong and specific reduction in zzso levels for over 2 months, zzso the zzso junctions of the infected cells were reduced in size and immature with respect to recruitment of zzso and zzso the formation of zzso zzso was prevented and there was a marked reduction in the thickness of the zzso sheath without a change in zzso zzso These data show that zzso is necessary in the zzso zzso cell for the formation of mature zzso junctions and a normal zzso zzso
