One of the biggest challenges facing evolutionary biologists is to identify and understand zzso that explain fitness variation in natural zzso This review describes how genetic zzso mapping with single zzso zzso zzso markers can lead to great progress in this zzso Strategies for zzso discovery and zzso zzso are described and an overview of how to model zzso zzso information in mapping studies is zzso Finally, the opportunity afforded by new generation sequencing and typing technologies to map fitness genes by zzso association studies is zzso
