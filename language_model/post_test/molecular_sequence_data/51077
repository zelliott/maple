The zzso in zzso coli zzso required for recognition by its zzso zzso have been determined in zzso by measuring the kinetic parameters for zzso using zzso zzso transcripts with zzso zzso coli zzso zzso The substitution of 11 zzso in zzso coli zzso is shown to decrease the zzso by as much as zzso relative to the wild zzso The most important recognition elements are the three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The recognition set also includes zzso in the variable pocket zzso and zzso the zzso end zzso and the zzso central core zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Many of the recognition zzso are also among the zzso zzso the identity set determined in zzso using an amber zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso 202, zzso As could be anticipated from the very different methods used, some zzso in the identity set determined by the zzso method were not among the recognition zzso and vice zzso The zzso coli zzso recognition data can also be compared to the recognition sets for zzso and human zzso determined zzso The results indicate that the mechanism by which zzso zzso recognize their zzso seems to have zzso somewhat among different zzso For example, zzso 20 in the zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso base 73 are important for the recognition by all three zzso However, recognition of the zzso central core zzso is unique to zzso coli zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
