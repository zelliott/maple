zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a bacterial strain that is capable of degrading a wide range of zzso aromatic compounds such as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso even under extremely low oxygen zzso oxygen zzso or zzso zzso zzso conditions zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A major protein fraction carrying zzso degradation activity was zzso Based on its partial zzso acid zzso zzso gene zzso alpha zzso terminal zzso zzso and its zzso region were cloned and zzso A zzso analysis based on the zzso acid sequence demonstrates that zzso is a member of a terminal zzso component of group IV zzso zzso for zzso and zzso aromatic zzso rather than group III zzso for zzso aromatic zzso Gene disruption in zzso abolished almost of the degradation activity against zzso zzso and zzso The gene disruption also impaired degradation activity of the strain under extremely low oxygen conditions zzso or zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso from zzso represents a group IV zzso that is functional even under extremely low oxygen zzso
