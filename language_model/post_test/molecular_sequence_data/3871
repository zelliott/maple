Natural killer zzso cells are important in host defense against viruses and tumors and can induce death of zzso infected cells following engagement of cell surface zzso Human zzso cells express receptors for the zzso portion of zzso which stimulate zzso zzso zzso and induce zzso zzso We have shown that zzso cells from certain individuals can zzso in addition to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso cells is dependent on an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso We analyzed the expression and function of zzso on zzso cells from 31 normal zzso Fourteen of the 31 zzso donors expressed zzso on their zzso zzso zzso characterization of zzso zzso expressed by the zzso donors revealed that the majority of donors expressed the zzso zzso Interestingly, 3 of the 14 positive donors did not express zzso and we identified a novel zzso zzso expressed by these zzso The expression of this zzso was correlated to a second zzso zzso that controls zzso zzso One of the three was found to express zzso on the zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso donors of both types expressed a zzso zzso specifically zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso only individuals expressing the zzso zzso were able to trigger reverse zzso zzso zzso via zzso whereas a zzso individual expressing the zzso zzso was unable to trigger this zzso These results demonstrate that the presence of multiple zzso zzso in the zzso gene determine the expression and function of zzso on zzso zzso
