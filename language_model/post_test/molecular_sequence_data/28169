The abilities of 18 synthetic peptides to target a carrier protein to the nucleus following zzso into the zzso of zzso cells were zzso Eight of the sequences chosen for synthesis were based on published nuclear targeting regions as determined by gene fusion and deletion zzso Six of these sequences were found to be effective when zzso by a synthetic zzso and zzso to a carrier zzso One additional zzso was based on a region of zzso zzso a nuclear protein from zzso zzso in which the nuclear targeting region had not been previously zzso This zzso was also able to target a carrier protein to the zzso Eight other peptides which resemble the known targeting signals had little or no nuclear targeting zzso zzso which were able to target a carrier protein to the nucleus did so within 45 zzso of injection into the zzso Two peptides with little or no apparent nuclear targeting ability after 45 zzso were examined for longer times as zzso No increase in nuclear zzso was observed between 45 zzso and 4 h after zzso zzso zzso of the sequences which were effective at nuclear targeting with those that were not revealed a possible consensus sequence for zzso nuclear zzso
