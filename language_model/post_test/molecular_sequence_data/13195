An zzso zzso zzso form of zzso zzso to zzso zzso was isolated from zzso zzso tissue and zzso Current knowledge about zzso processing sites does not allow zzso prediction of the signal zzso zzso site in zzso but suggests zzso in the region of zzso zzso to zzso counted upstream from the N zzso of the zzso However, the structure of the isolated zzso suggests that the zzso between the signal zzso and the zzso zzso occurs at the zzso side of zzso zzso Moreover, the isolated zzso demonstrates that zzso can be fully processed zzso prior to the final zzso zzso The results from this report, and those from earlier studies, where zzso zzso zzso were isolated, show that the processing of the zzso precursor may proceed by one of two alternative zzso in which either of the two ends is processed zzso The zzso of the zzso extended zzso on zzso pancreatic zzso was lower than that of zzso indicating the importance of the finally processed free N zzso of the hormone for interaction with zzso zzso
