The structural organization of the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso has been determined and its pattern of expression evaluated during zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso gene contains four zzso and three small zzso The zzso initiation site is located 22 zzso upstream from the zzso translation zzso in adults, whereas several initiation sites are found in zzso No consensus zzso or zzso sequences are located at zzso positions, although an zzso sequence was identified zzso the major zzso initiation zzso Northern analyses indicated that the zzso transcript is present at variable levels throughout zzso In zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso deposited zzso zzso is distributed zzso in the early zzso whereas de zzso transcript is produced specifically at an elevated level in the developing zzso zzso zzso in cultured Schneider cells with promoter region deletion zzso revealed that the zzso 230 zzso contain zzso elements required for efficient gene zzso zzso zzso factor binding sites clustered within this region include two zzso DNA zzso elements zzso and a single putative zzso binding zzso zzso and base substitution zzso of the zzso sites demonstrated that they are required for efficient promoter activity, and gel zzso mobility shift analyses showed that zzso binding factor zzso binds to these zzso Our data suggest strongly that the zzso zzso gene is regulated by the zzso zzso This finding represents a first link between nuclear and zzso DNA zzso
