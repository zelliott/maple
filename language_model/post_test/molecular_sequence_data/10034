zzso of zzso zzso possess numerous zzso zzso zzso One of these systems, which has been found in all strains tested, encodes the zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso zzso We cloned two adjacent zzso genes zzso and zzso each zzso proteins whose actions protect DNA from zzso by zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene product is a N zzso zzso that recognizes this zzso We constructed a zzso containing multiple copies of the zzso zzso grew it in the presence of zzso and used the zzso to demonstrate the presence of N zzso in the zzso A second zzso containing overlapping zzso and zzso coli dam recognition sequences in combination with various restriction zzso was used to identify which zzso in the recognition sequence was modified by zzso The predicted zzso gene product is zzso to zzso zzso The products of both the zzso and zzso zzso as well as an open reading frame downstream of the zzso gene are highly similar to the zzso zzso zzso , zzso and zzso gene products, zzso the zzso I Type zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes are flanked by a 97 zzso direct repeat that may be involved in the mobility of this zzso zzso
