We describe a plant zzso transformation method that provides zzso with a simple pattern of integration of a foreign zzso The approach is to deliver into plant zzso by direct gene transfer the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso with or without zzso together with a target zzso containing a gene of interest flanked by zzso zzso border repeat sequences of 25 zzso We present evidence of zzso formation in zzso zzso and its integration into the zzso zzso The frequency of zzso integration events was about zzso of the total number of zzso The addition of zzso doubled the transformation zzso The method described here is of sufficient efficiency and simplicity to be useful for the production of transgenic plants with zzso zzso transgenic zzso
