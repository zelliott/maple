Using zzso and an automated laser fluorescent DNA zzso we amplified and zzso a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene zzso of 28 bacteria belonging to the zzso zzso Comparative sequence analysis showed that most of the spotted fever group zzso zzso belonged to one of two zzso The first zzso included zzso zzso strain Bar 29, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso which have been isolated only from zzso The second zzso was larger and included the majority of the human pathogens and also zzso isolated only from zzso the members of this zzso were strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the Thai tick zzso zzso the Israeli tick zzso zzso the zzso fever zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The sequence analysis also showed that the zzso organisms zzso zzso and zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were associated with the zzso zzso that zzso zzso and zzso zzso two representatives of the zzso group, clustered together, and that zzso zzso zzso zzso and the AB zzso probably represent three new zzso We compared the zzso trees zzso from zzso zzso gene sequences and from zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso For zzso zzso the zzso zzso approach was more zzso as demonstrated by significant zzso values for all of the zzso except those in the larger zzso defined zzso We also compared zzso analysis results obtained in a comparison of the sequences of both genes for all of the representatives of the domain zzso for which the zzso sequence was zzso We believe that comparison of zzso sequences could be a complementary approach to zzso zzso sequencing for zzso bacterial evolution, especially when unstable zzso models are obtained from zzso sequences because of high levels of sequence similarity between the bacteria zzso
