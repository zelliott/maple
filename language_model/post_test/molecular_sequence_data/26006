zzso of the zzso and zzso signals arising from the zzso portion of zzso zzso has been achieved using zzso shift correlation experiments zzso and zzso zzso zzso shift correlation zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso carbon atoms of the eight zzso groups are readily distinguished for solutions in zzso zzso and have been assigned by means of zzso zzso shift correlation studies coupled with measurement of the zzso spectrum of a zzso zzso specifically zzso with zzso in some of the zzso zzso With this assignment, products of partial zzso of the zzso may readily be identified by treatment with excess of zzso zzso followed by measurement of the zzso spectrum of the zzso zzso zzso so prepared, in the zzso zzso
