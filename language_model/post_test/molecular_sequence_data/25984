The binding of the synthetic zzso zzso (10) with two zzso zzso of the zzso zzso has been zzso The zzso 10 was zzso by silver zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso 13, having zzso free, followed by zzso of the formed, fully protected zzso zzso The zzso synthesis of the zzso 13 from readily available zzso and the synthesis of 5 from the corresponding zzso zzso is also zzso zzso 10 binds with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso with essentially the same zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as does the zzso zzso of zzso zzso 14 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Of the series of zzso zzso studied previously zzso through a zzso 14 was found to show the highest affinity of interaction with both these zzso The zzso zzso which forms the bulky zzso of 10, does not appear to bind to these zzso Thus, the observation that the affinity of 10 is the same as that of 14 confirms that these zzso bind internal zzso sequences of the zzso zzso
