Previous studies show that the collagen zzso of the zzso zzso humor are assembled largely from type II collagen with smaller amounts of type IX collagen and either type V or type zzso zzso In this paper, we report the separation of two chains of type zzso zzso collagen from type II collagen by zzso zzso These chains were characterized by sequencing of selected zzso zzso or zzso peptides with subsequent comparison of these sequences with zzso zzso acid sequences of the alpha zzso alpha zzso alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso The results show that zzso zzso are assembled from molecules containing the alpha zzso and alpha zzso zzso These results, together with recent results from other laboratories, indicate that type V and type zzso zzso are not separate collagen types but are part of a larger collagen family in which chains of both type V and type zzso zzso participate in the formation of a variety of native zzso
