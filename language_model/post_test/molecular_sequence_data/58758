When screening a zzso zzso zzso library using the human zzso zzso as probe, a zzso zzso of zzso zzso was isolated which contained four zzso with high sequence similarity to zzso coding for the zzso zzso of the zzso small zzso protein zzso The putative zzso product of 195 zzso acids zzso from the zzso displayed zzso identity to the sequence of zzso Interestingly, three zzso were found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which zzso was identical among all known zzso zzso suggesting that zzso might have different zzso for zzso zzso Additionally, an zzso of 4 zzso was found in the zzso region at the C zzso of zzso
