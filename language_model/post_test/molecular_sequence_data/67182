zzso zzso located at position 55 in zzso is a nearly universally zzso zzso modification found in all three zzso of zzso This modification is zzso by zzso in bacteria and by zzso in zzso but so far the zzso zzso has not been identified in zzso In this work, we report the ability of two distinct zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso to specifically modify zzso in zzso in zzso These zzso are zzso a protein known to play a role in zzso modification of zzso and zzso a previously zzso zzso that is not a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso is zzso renamed zzso Both zzso specifically modify zzso zzso in zzso but exhibit differences in zzso zzso In addition, we find that in a zzso in zzso system, zzso efficiently zzso an zzso coli strain deficient in the bacterial zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that it is probable that zzso or zzso (or zzso is responsible for the introduction of zzso at zzso in zzso in zzso While we cannot unequivocally assign the function from our results, both possibilities represent unexpected functions of these proteins as discussed zzso
