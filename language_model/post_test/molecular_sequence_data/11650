zzso for gene transfer and gene therapy were developed which combine the advantages of the zzso and zzso zzso This was achieved by inserting two zzso sites for specific DNA zzso into an zzso based zzso zzso We show that this zzso lox zzso allows the infection of cells and the expression of transferred zzso In addition, we constructed an efficient zzso expression system for a modified zzso zzso zzso tests for DNA zzso from integrated zzso lox zzso were performed by the use of a negative zzso marker gene zzso zzso zzso expression in cells infected with zzso lox zzso and subsequent zzso selection for cells in which zzso zzso has occurred results in large numbers of independent cell zzso These results were confirmed by detailed molecular zzso In addition we developed zzso suicide zzso in which the zzso elements of both zzso were replaced by lox zzso We show that zzso located in the zzso of zzso zzso are stable during zzso zzso Potential applications of this system would be the establishment of zzso of zzso cells by controlled zzso of nearly the complete zzso zzso
