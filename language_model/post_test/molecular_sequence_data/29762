Two novel alternatively spliced zzso of the human zzso zzso channel zzso were isolated from zzso libraries of human kidney and fetal zzso The zzso of zzso base pairs zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins of 508 zzso acids zzso zzso showed that zzso is strongly expressed in kidney zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso whereas zzso is abundantly expressed in zzso In zzso zzso revealed a very distinct expression pattern of zzso in rat brain which partially overlapped with that of zzso zzso of zzso and zzso in human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells showed that their single-channel characteristics were zzso The slope zzso at negative zzso was zzso zzso 5 zzso for zzso and 179 zzso 17 zzso for zzso The mean open and closed times of zzso at zzso zzso were 133 zzso 16 and 109 zzso 11 zzso zzso Application of zzso decreased the zzso current carried by zzso and zzso The sensitivity to zzso was abolished by mutating a protein zzso A zzso site at position 364 of zzso zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso C zzso by application of zzso zzso also reduced zzso zzso However, removal of the putative zzso zzso zzso site zzso zzso did not affect zzso by zzso Our results suggest that alternative zzso of zzso contributes to the diversity of zzso zzso zzso
