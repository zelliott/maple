The expression of the zzso zzso genes was examined in a series of zzso and growth zzso cell zzso All of the zzso cell lines, but none of the zzso lines, expressed high levels of one or more of the gamma genes but did not express the zzso zzso None of the cell lines expressing the gamma zzso contained zzso zzso gamma gene zzso zzso of zzso clones from two of the cell lines demonstrated that zzso was from zzso gamma zzso based on the presence of sequences in the zzso that are found immediately zzso of the J gamma 4 and J gamma 2 zzso The expression of gamma transcripts was dependent upon zzso and no transcripts were zzso within zzso h after the removal of zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso resulted in the reappearance of gamma transcripts within 30 zzso The results demonstrate that zzso regulates the expression of zzso gamma zzso Since expression is required for zzso it can be hypothesized that zzso may influence the ability of zzso zzso to commit to the T cell zzso
