Recently published evidence for sequence repetition in zzso zzso prompted us to zzso the published complete zzso sequences and coat protein gene sequences of viruses of this family for evidence of replication zzso Five of nine complete zzso sequences and 17 of 32 coat protein genes had significant sequence zzso Most of these were in coat protein zzso although the zzso region of the zzso mosaic virus zzso also showed evidence of zzso The results suggest that replication zzso may be involved in the evolution of zzso as well as zzso and zzso and that zzso can occur in both zzso and DNA when it is being zzso
