In the zzso coli system zzso zzso protein zzso zzso bonds are generated by the cooperation of zzso and zzso and transferred to zzso proteins through zzso The structures solved so far for different forms of zzso lack the zzso zzso zzso that is directly donated to zzso Here, we report the zzso A crystal structure of a zzso complex, in which zzso has this principal zzso Its comparison with the updated structure of the zzso complex as well as with the recently reported zzso structure of a zzso zzso having the rearranged zzso zzso illuminated zzso transitions of zzso induced by the binding and release of zzso zzso studies revealed that the zzso short zzso of zzso has a key function in zzso electron flow, presumably by controlling the positioning of the zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that zzso has developed the elaborate zzso dynamism to zzso zzso for continuous protein zzso bond formation in the zzso
