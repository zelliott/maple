zzso B2 is a regulator of zzso zzso involved in zzso progression of the cell cycle, whose gene is strictly regulated at the zzso level in cycling zzso The mouse promoter was cloned and three zzso zzso boxes were zzso In this study, we zzso the mechanisms leading to zzso of the zzso B2 zzso zzso a combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with single, double and triple zzso zzso zzso with nuclear zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso with an zzso dominant negative zzso established the positive role of the three zzso sequences and proved that zzso plays a crucial role in their zzso zzso an ubiquitous zzso containing zzso fold zzso activates several other promoters regulated during the cell zzso To zzso the levels of zzso zzso in the different zzso of the cycle, we separated zzso cells by zzso obtaining zzso zzso zzso The zzso and protein levels of the zzso containing zzso and zzso were zzso whereas the zzso zzso but not its zzso was zzso in zzso and decreased in zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso activity followed the amount of zzso indicating that this zzso is limiting within the zzso complex, and suggesting that zzso mechanisms regulate zzso zzso Our results support a model zzso fine tuning of this zzso is important for zzso zzso of zzso zzso
