The zzso growth zzso zzso family of zzso growth factors plays a central role in the induction of zzso during early zzso zzso Immediate zzso responses to zzso signals have been zzso but the signal zzso steps leading to these early responses are zzso We describe here the first zzso response to zzso zzso zzso in the early zzso We have identified a cellular factor which binds to a 50 zzso portion of the promoter for an zzso early response zzso This factor is activated within 4 zzso of treatment of embryonic prospective zzso with zzso factors, making it the earliest response to these factors described in early zzso This factor can be activated throughout early zzso and zzso zzso is activated by zzso zzso of the zzso zzso but not the zzso growth factor zzso family, and does not appear to require an zzso zzso signal for zzso zzso of this factor provides a powerful tool for studying the early steps in the induction of zzso by members of the zzso zzso
