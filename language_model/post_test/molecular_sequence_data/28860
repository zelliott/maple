zzso zzso can shift reading frame at specific sites with high efficiency for gene expression zzso The most common type of shift to the zzso frame involves a tandem realignment of two zzso from pairing with zzso sequence of the form X zzso zzso to zzso zzso Z where the spaces indicate the reading zzso The zzso zzso shift site of this type in zzso is A AAA zzso The present work shows that in zzso coli the identity of the 6 zzso 3' of this sequence can be responsible for a zzso variation in zzso zzso The first 3' zzso has the primary effect, with, in order of decreasing efficiency, U zzso C zzso A zzso zzso This effect is independent of other zzso of zzso It is detected with other X zzso zzso zzso but not with several other zzso zzso shift zzso zzso of zzso coli zzso with zzso is especially weak at the third zzso zzso We propose that strong stacking of zzso 3' of zzso zzso pairing of zzso diminishing the chance of zzso zzso that is a prerequisite for the realignment involved in zzso
