In a previous study, zzso zzso zzso zzso was affinity labeled with two zzso derivatives zzso and zzso zzso In both cases, the labeled site was localized to the zzso part of the zzso zzso The potential target zzso zzso of zzso III were mapped to the zzso domain zzso between zzso and zzso In the present work, we have zzso to zzso the five zzso present in domain zzso Three zzso can be zzso individually or zzso without affecting cell growth, and each zzso zzso can still be affinity zzso Hence one or both of the other two zzso zzso zzso and zzso is the target of the affinity zzso These two zzso were each found to be essential for cell zzso zzso VIII labeled another domain in addition to domain zzso zzso by analogous results obtained for zzso coli zzso zzso using zzso VIII zzso we hypothesized that the second domain labeled by this zzso in the zzso zzso was domain zzso zzso of the unique zzso present in domain I demonstrated that zzso zzso was the target of zzso zzso These results indicate that in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso H and I are in close proximity and participate to the active zzso
