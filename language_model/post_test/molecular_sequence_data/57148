We previously reported that zzso growth zzso zzso zzso calcium entry zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and production of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The present study was conducted to determine a role of protein zzso C zzso in the progression activity of zzso To monitor the activity of zzso in intact cells, we measured zzso of a synthetic zzso zzso a zzso of zzso immediately after the zzso of the cells with zzso When 1 zzso zzso was added to primed competent cells, zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso induced more than zzso increase in zzso zzso zzso that was blocked by zzso a zzso of zzso which blocks the activity of the zzso and zzso an inhibitor of zzso The zzso remained elevated for up to 6 zzso To assess the role of zzso in cell cycle zzso zzso nuclear labeling was measured in the presence of zzso zzso reduced the rate of entrance into S phase when added in the first quarter of the zzso phase, but did not affect cell cycle progression when added at the second quarter or zzso In contrast, reduction of zzso calcium completely blocked cell cycle progression when done in the first, second, and third quarter but had no effect in the last zzso These results indicate that zzso persistently activates zzso in primed competent cells, but the zzso is required only for the initiation of zzso We conclude that zzso promotes cell cycle progression by zzso mechanisms that are largely independent of zzso
