zzso zzso zzso capable of zzso zzso pumping and of zzso zzso driven zzso synthesis was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso When the zzso was analyzed by gel zzso in the presence of sodium zzso zzso it showed eight zzso bands of which four were zzso of zzso We also isolated the zzso zzso containing nine genes in the order of zzso which zzso proteins with molecular sizes of 13, 43, 10, 20, 35, 11, 64, 53, and 25 zzso zzso The last four genes were identified as those for zzso zzso zzso B, D, and F zzso the A, B, zzso and delta zzso zzso The first five zzso zzso were identified as genes for the zzso zzso The product of zzso the zzso zzso lacked a zzso acid zzso and, unlike zzso zzso contained two zzso zzso rather than zzso The zzso zzso product of zzso is the smallest member so far found of the zzso zzso zzso zzso Its zzso band overlapped with the band of the A zzso zzso all the gene products were found in our zzso zzso We isolated the zzso zzso zzso from the isolated zzso and the zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso microscopic observation of these zzso revealed that the gamma zzso of zzso filled the central cavity of zzso and might be central zzso similar to the gamma zzso of zzso
