zzso zzso and zzso zzso two key zzso in zzso zzso are zzso by two separate genes in bacteria and plants, but by a single zzso gene in zzso The zzso function has been demonstrated for the products of the genes zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and for zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These three genes are highly similar to zzso from zzso zzso Taking advantage of the high proportion of the final product of the zzso zzso that accumulates zzso when zzso is illuminated at low temperature, we have isolated two zzso with a pale reddish zzso Both zzso are zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and carry zzso in the zzso domain to which zzso activity has been attributed in other zzso The zzso lack zzso and accumulate an unidentified reddish zzso as shown by column zzso and zzso The chemical and zzso properties of this zzso are consistent with the absence of zzso zzso and indicate that the product of zzso is zzso The existence of a single gene responsible for zzso zzso and zzso zzso thus seems to be a widespread trait among zzso zzso as shown by the examples now known in a zzso two zzso and one zzso
