In this study we present a method for determination of zzso sites in zzso based on partial zzso acid zzso in combination with mass zzso zzso zzso acid and zzso acid were used for the zzso of zzso zzso The reaction conditions were zzso for efficient zzso backbone zzso with minimal zzso of zzso zzso The zzso zzso were identified by mass zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso Although zzso bonds are partially zzso under acid zzso the resulting mass zzso allowed zzso determination of the zzso zzso Examples are shown with zzso and zzso zzso Performing the zzso in vapor eliminates the risk for contamination of the sample with zzso from the zzso thus allowing analysis of the reaction products without further zzso both by zzso laser zzso and zzso zzso mass zzso
