In order to determine whether zzso criteria are suitable to affiliate zzso strains to species, a zzso analysis of zzso zzso was performed on 54 zzso strains that represented zzso 21 species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso five invalid species and three zzso zzso The analysis included 12 previously published zzso The branching pattern confirmed the deep zzso of the order zzso One lineage is defined by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The study confirms the zzso status of zzso previously zzso within the family zzso The second lineage contains the zzso zzso and the species zzso zzso zzso while the third lineage is comprised of zzso and a strain identified as zzso zzso With the exception of a small number of strains that did not cluster zzso with members of the zzso to which they were assigned by zzso criteria zzso zzso Pl zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso An zzso the zzso zzso should provide a sound basis for the description of zzso species in those cases where original strain material is not available or is listed as reference zzso
