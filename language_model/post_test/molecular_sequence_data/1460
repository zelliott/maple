zzso forms of human zzso virus zzso can be detected in peripheral blood zzso cell zzso from zzso patients in the absence of zzso viral replication and are thought to be a sign of active but cryptic virus zzso No information, however, are available on whether these forms are also present in animal models for acquired zzso syndrome zzso and on their relation with other methods of detection of virus zzso To this aim, a zzso chain reaction zzso approach was used to detect and analyze zzso circular zzso forms in zzso of zzso human zzso virus zzso infected zzso monkeys with zzso levels ranging between zzso zzso zzso and less than 50 zzso of zzso zzso forms were detected in zzso of zzso samples above 50 zzso of zzso whereas they were present in zzso of zzso samples below 50 zzso of zzso zzso of zzso viral DNA in monkeys with zzso plasma zzso could indicate either stability in zzso cells or ongoing low levels of viral replication in dividing zzso
