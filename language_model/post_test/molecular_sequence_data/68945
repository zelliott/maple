Using zzso p zzso zzso grass zzso extract zzso zzso as zzso we obtained a zzso zzso zzso 4, which recognized proteins of 33, 35, and 37 zzso as determined by Western zzso The zzso zzso with zzso proteins of other grass species in the molecular weight range of 30 to 37 zzso By means of two-dimensional zzso gel zzso zzso of zzso grass zzso zzso we demonstrated at least seven protein zzso two of 37 zzso with zzso points of zzso and zzso four of 35 zzso with zzso points of zzso zzso zzso and zzso and one of 33 zzso with an zzso point of zzso These protein spots were also detected by patients' pooled zzso zzso of the 20 zzso zzso acid zzso revealed structures with sequence identities up to zzso to the well-established zzso zzso p I of zzso zzso zzso Therefore we assume that the zzso zzso zzso 4 recognized the corresponding zzso zzso p I in zzso grass zzso
