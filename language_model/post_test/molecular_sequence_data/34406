In zzso Venezuelan zzso encephalitis and related zzso the zzso is translated as a fusion with other zzso proteins via zzso of a zzso stop zzso Surprisingly, earlier work reported that the signal for efficient zzso comprises a single zzso zzso zzso to the zzso However, analysis of zzso at synonymous sites revealed zzso enhanced conservation within the zzso 150 zzso zzso to the zzso and zzso folding zzso revealed the potential for a zzso zzso zzso structure in the same zzso zzso analysis of the predicted structure demonstrated that the zzso increases zzso by up to zzso The same zzso analysis indicated that similar zzso structures are likely to be relevant to zzso in certain plant virus zzso notably zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as well as the zzso gene zzso These results suggest that 3' zzso zzso structures feature in a much larger proportion of zzso cases than previously anticipated, and provide a new criterion for assessing the large number of cellular zzso candidates that are currently being revealed by comparative sequence zzso
