We have characterized a zzso produced by zzso cells, designated as zzso zzso of mice with zzso induced zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso The induction of these zzso resulted in zzso responses marked by increased serum zzso zzso and zzso levels, blood zzso and pathological changes in the lungs and zzso tract that included zzso zzso increased zzso production, and zzso cell zzso In addition, our studies show that zzso zzso zzso zzso production by accessory cells that are zzso class zzso zzso and zzso These results suggest that zzso derived from zzso T cells, is capable of amplifying allergic type inflammatory responses by its actions on other cell zzso
