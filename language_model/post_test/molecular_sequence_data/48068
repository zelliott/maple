The zzso sites of zzso B chain can be blocked by zzso chemical modification using a zzso zzso derived from zzso containing zzso zzso zzso The terminal zzso zzso of one branch of the zzso zzso is modified to contain a zzso zzso zzso Two separate zzso sites have been clearly established in the zzso B chain by X-ray zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso (1991) zzso 10, zzso and it is necessary to zzso attach two such zzso zzso to the B chain to block its binding to zzso affinity zzso A method was developed using zzso labeling of the zzso combined with subsequent zzso zzso which allowed the isolation of zzso B chain peptides zzso linked to the zzso from zzso zzso of zzso blocked zzso The sites of zzso attachment of the two zzso in blocked zzso were zzso from sequence analysis to be zzso 62 in domain 1 of the B chain and zzso 148 in domain zzso A minor species of blocked zzso contains a third zzso attached zzso From the analysis of peptides derived from blocked zzso enriched in this species, it is zzso that zzso 67 in domain 1 is the specific site on the zzso B chain where a third zzso zzso becomes zzso linked to the zzso These results are interpreted as providing support for the notion that the zzso B chain has three zzso binding zzso
