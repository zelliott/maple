The molecular mechanism and zzso function of zzso by zzso zzso editing is well known, but its evolutionary significance remains a zzso We analyzed the zzso editing of the zzso zzso channel from different insects spanning more than 300 million years of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso editing was detected across all zzso zzso representing the most highly zzso zzso editing event yet reported in zzso Surprisingly, five of these editing sites were zzso in zzso zzso and were possibly of independent origin, suggesting zzso conservation of editing between zzso and zzso Based on this result, we predicted and zzso verified two novel zzso editing sites in zzso zzso I zzso In addition, comparative analysis indicated that zzso editing usually occurred within highly zzso coding regions, but mostly altered zzso coding positions of these zzso Moreover, more than half of these edited zzso acids are zzso zzso in the zzso of other zzso an example of a conversion model of the zzso edited site is zzso zzso these data imply that zzso editing might play dual roles in evolution by extending protein diversity and maintaining zzso zzso
