zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in early zzso zzso requires the zzso of zzso zzso to the anterior pole of the zzso This anterior zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso signal contained within the 3' untranslated region of the zzso zzso Here we use a series of zzso zzso carrying small deletions in the 3' untranslated region to survey for functional elements that constitute the zzso zzso We identify and characterize one essential element, zzso which specifically directs the early steps of zzso In addition, we find that many deletions within the zzso zzso 3' untranslated region impair but do not prevent zzso One such deletion specifically interferes with a later step in zzso Thus the zzso zzso zzso signal appears to consist of multiple different zzso each responsible for different steps in the zzso zzso
