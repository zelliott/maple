zzso possess zzso zzso called zzso rays that extend zzso from their zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso ray zzso like zzso limb zzso is maintained by Sonic zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso elements fail to form in the absence of normal zzso zzso whereas shortened duration of zzso expression zzso with zzso zzso reduction in naturally variable zzso zzso also exhibit natural variation with respect to zzso ray zzso zzso and zzso possess a series of zzso zzso on their zzso and zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso possess a single zzso arch zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso zzso rays of the zzso zzso zzso grow in association with sustained zzso expression within an zzso zzso fold, whereas zzso is only zzso expressed in the zzso zzso zzso with this transient zzso zzso zzso ray outgrowth is initiated in zzso zzso but is not zzso yielding previously zzso vestigial zzso arch zzso zzso This is in contrast to the condition seen in zzso where sustained zzso expression zzso to the presence of fully formed zzso rays on the zzso and zzso zzso zzso in light of current hypotheses of zzso zzso our data suggest that the zzso zzso evolved in concert with zzso arch zzso reduction by zzso of zzso zzso ray zzso and that zzso zzso rays and zzso limbs exhibit parallel zzso mechanisms of evolutionary zzso
