As a regulator of smooth muscle zzso zzso protein zzso zzso appears to zzso the regulatory zzso light chain zzso directly or zzso at zzso and zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso and zzso domain of zzso light chain zzso zzso shares similarity to a sequence found in zzso This similarity in sequence prompted an investigation of the zzso zzso which is derived from the zzso region of zzso as a potential inhibitor of zzso In zzso studies showed that zzso is a competitive inhibitor of a zzso active zzso form of zzso with an apparent zzso value of zzso zzso zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso is also active against full-length zzso In addition, zzso zzso was reduced by zzso zzso activity is independent of zzso however, zzso suppressed the in zzso zzso potential of zzso likely as a result of zzso binding of the zzso to zzso Treatment of zzso smooth muscle with zzso zzso was accompanied by an increase in zzso zzso distinguishing between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Administration of zzso suppressed zzso muscle tension developed by the addition of zzso zzso to zzso rat zzso muscle strips with or without zzso depletion by zzso The decrease in zzso force was associated with decreases in both zzso zzso and zzso In zzso we present the zzso zzso as a novel inhibitor of zzso We also conclude that the zzso zzso which has no effect on zzso can be used to distinguish between zzso and zzso effects in smooth muscle zzso
