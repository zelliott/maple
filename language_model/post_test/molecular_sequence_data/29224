The 102 zzso zzso protein of zzso coli zzso was first described as a host factor required for zzso zzso zzso More recently, zzso was shown to affect the stability of several zzso coli zzso including zzso zzso where it interferes with zzso zzso which in turn results in rapid degradation of the zzso In contrast, zzso is also required for efficient translation of the zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the stationary zzso zzso In this study, the authors have isolated and characterized the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which consists of only 82 zzso The 68 zzso zzso acids of zzso show zzso identity with zzso zzso was shown to functionally replace zzso in terms of its requirement for zzso zzso replication and for zzso zzso In addition, zzso exerted the same negative effect on zzso coli zzso zzso zzso As judged by zzso analysis, the expression of either the zzso zzso or the zzso gene in an zzso coli zzso zzso strain revealed no gross difference in the protein zzso Both zzso and zzso affected the synthesis of approximately 26 zzso zzso coli gene zzso These studies showed that the functional domain of zzso resides within its zzso zzso The observation that a zzso truncated zzso lacking the last 27 zzso zzso can also functionally replace the full-length zzso coli protein lends further support to this zzso
