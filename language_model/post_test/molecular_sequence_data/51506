Plant zzso development is capable of following 1 of 2 distinct zzso zzso zzso in darkness and zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso locus indicate that the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso in darkness and that light reverses this repressive zzso Using a zzso zzso we have cloned the zzso zzso The zzso half of the zzso protein contains a zzso zzso zzso whereas the zzso half contains a domain zzso to the zzso repeat motif of G beta zzso The presence of both a putative zzso motif and a G zzso domain in a single zzso suggests that zzso may be the first of a new class of regulatory zzso This novel structure could zzso zzso with the capacity to function as a negative zzso regulator capable of direct interaction with components of the G protein signaling zzso
