A regulated switch between zzso and zzso gene expression is common to all known zzso However, the effects on host colonization of altering this switch are largely zzso We zzso the zzso of the gene zzso the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso by inserting a new and powerful promoter element in its zzso untranslated zzso In zzso the zzso virus zzso transcribed zzso at a high level and showed more rapid zzso spread in zzso zzso cultures, but in zzso the zzso virus showed a severe deficit in zzso establishment, with no sign of the infectious zzso illness normally associated with zzso zzso Although a low level of zzso viral DNA was zzso by zzso in zzso zzso virus could not be recovered beyond 10 days zzso The zzso virus was also attenuated in zzso zzso Thus a zzso unable to shut off zzso cycle gene expression showed severely restricted host zzso
