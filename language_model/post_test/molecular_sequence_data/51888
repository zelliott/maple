Among zzso zzso zzso the human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso protein is exceptional in that its target site zzso is an zzso rather than a DNA zzso Here, we confirm that fusion of zzso to the zzso domain of the zzso Rev protein permits the efficient zzso of an zzso long terminal repeat zzso promoter in which critical zzso sequences have been replaced by zzso sequences derived from the zzso Rev response element zzso An zzso target sequence as small as 13 zzso is shown to form an effective in zzso target for Rev zzso More important, a fusion protein consisting of Rev attached to the zzso zzso zzso domain was also observed to efficiently activate the zzso zzso from this nascent zzso zzso These data demonstrate that zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso does not require a stable interaction with the promoter DNA and suggest that zzso like zzso can act on steps subsequent to the formation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The finding that the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are functionally interchangeable raises the possibility that these apparently disparate viral zzso may nevertheless act via similar zzso
