zzso C virus infection is a great issue in China; however, there is very little information on zzso investigations based on sequence zzso in the zzso zzso zzso The present study was to define the sequence zzso based on the sequence zzso of the zzso of the zzso 

zzso of 91 zzso from patients with chronic zzso C from zzso southwest China, were zzso and zzso were defined according to the sequence zzso of the zzso of the zzso 

Eighty-six zzso were classified into 3 zzso zzso termed groups or major zzso by the methods proposed by Chan et al in 1992 and zzso analysis based on zzso sequence zzso within the zzso zzso percent of the zzso were classified into zzso 3, zzso into zzso 1, and zzso into zzso zzso New zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso In addition, 3 novel sequences were discovered, respectively with an zzso sequence deletion zzso to zzso position zzso to zzso a zzso sequence zzso and a zzso sequence zzso between zzso and zzso Of these zzso zzso possessed a zzso at position zzso in place of the zzso that is present in all previously reported zzso 

These zzso zzso evolved or remained in this area, may be of great significance in diagnosis and treatment of zzso C zzso
