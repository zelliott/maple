The zzso zzso is the analog of the zzso one of the zzso sites in zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Various zzso zzso were zzso and the zzso zzso of each zzso complex was zzso zzso of the zzso zzso indicated that the zzso side chain of zzso was critical for the binding with zzso but not that of zzso The positive charge and the side chain length of zzso were also zzso The presence of a sulfur atom in the zzso was also zzso The affinity of the zzso zzso part for zzso was influenced by the kind of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Based on these results, the side chains of zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso heavy chain were assigned to be critical for the binding with zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso heavy chain containing these critical zzso for the zzso from zzso number 700 to zzso can be predicted as an analogue of the segment B of the zzso site zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso The zzso zzso possibly shares a part of the zzso site in zzso We discuss the possibility that the zzso is an zzso site of zzso zzso and the so-called zzso of zzso zzso is a zzso induced by transient binding of zzso to the zzso
