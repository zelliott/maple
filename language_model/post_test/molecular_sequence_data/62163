The structure and composition of the cell wall of zzso has so far been studied mainly in zzso zzso It is basically made up of three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso also called zzso Most zzso bound zzso zzso belong to the so-called zzso zzso protein zzso family, zzso proteins that are bound through the remnant of a zzso zzso to zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso shares Generally zzso As Safe zzso status with zzso zzso has some industrial applications and is increasingly being proposed as a host for the production of zzso proteins and as a model in the study of zzso However, very little information on zzso structure and composition is available for this zzso Here is described the isolation and characterization of zzso a zzso of the zzso gene from zzso zzso which encodes a zzso and the identification of its gene zzso zzso encodes a 221 zzso protein that contains a putative signal zzso and a putative zzso zzso It shows zzso % overall identity with zzso of zzso zzso and a zzso profile characteristic of zzso zzso of zzso both in the zzso and in an zzso zzso background, led to the identification of zzso as a 60 zzso zzso present in zzso zzso To the zzso knowledge, this is the first report of a zzso in zzso zzso and it suggests that the zzso organization of zzso zzso is similar to that of zzso zzso
