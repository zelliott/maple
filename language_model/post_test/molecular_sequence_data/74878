In contrast to animals, where zzso zzso zzso efficiently converts zzso zzso to zzso zzso plants have been considered to possess a PA zzso zzso producing zzso zzso the corresponding zzso and hydrogen zzso but unable to zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains at least five putative PA zzso zzso members with zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was recently identified as an zzso similar to the zzso zzso zzso which converts zzso to zzso zzso In this work, we have performed in zzso analysis of the five zzso genes and have identified zzso zzso as a zzso zzso in terms of zzso compared to other known zzso We have expressed the gene zzso and have zzso a protein corresponding to it using the zzso zzso expression system of zzso zzso zzso zzso the sequential zzso of zzso to zzso and of zzso to zzso thus exhibiting functional zzso to the zzso zzso The best zzso for this zzso was zzso whereas the zzso of zzso and zzso were oxidized less zzso On the other hand, no activity was detected when zzso zzso zzso and zzso were used as zzso Moreover, although zzso does not exhibit significant similarity to the other known zzso it is efficiently inhibited by zzso a potent zzso zzso zzso contains a zzso targeting motif at the C zzso and it targets green zzso protein to zzso when fused at the N zzso but not at the C zzso These results reveal that zzso is a zzso protein and that the C zzso of the protein contains the sorting zzso The overall data reinforce the view that plants and zzso possess a similar PA zzso system, concerning both the zzso zzso and the mode of its zzso
