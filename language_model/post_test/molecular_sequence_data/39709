In roughly zzso of cases of acute zzso zzso a zzso zzso leads to expression of the zzso protein zzso The zzso portion of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso is identical in sequence to the corresponding portion of the E proteins zzso and includes zzso zzso zzso The C zzso consists of most of the zzso interacting zzso factor zzso including its zzso zzso zzso zzso experiments have suggested that zzso by zzso requires an zzso domain, called zzso at the extreme N zzso We recently demonstrated that a potentially zzso portion of zzso interacts directly with the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso response zzso protein zzso and that this interaction is essential in the zzso of primary bone zzso cells in tissue zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso motif within zzso is required in the interaction between zzso and the zzso domain of zzso We show by circular zzso zzso that the zzso portion of zzso zzso a zzso transition upon interacting with the zzso domain and that zzso acid zzso that prevent zzso formation prevent both the zzso interaction and cell zzso by zzso Perhaps most zzso substitution of a single, zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso motif zzso leukemia induction in mice after transplantation with zzso bone zzso The zzso domain of zzso mediates zzso interactions with several zzso factors of relevance to leukemia zzso zzso evidence suggests that the side chain of zzso might interact with a deep zzso pocket in the zzso zzso zzso our results serve to identify a potential new drug zzso
