A DNA zzso of zzso zzso with high zzso to the zzso A zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso zzso has been zzso zzso and mapped to zzso zzso It contains an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a predicted gene product of zzso zzso In contrast to its zzso zzso there are no zzso in the coding zzso The first zzso zzso of the open reading frame is in an unusual context for a zzso start site, while the next zzso 24 zzso zzso is in a more conventional zzso zzso implications of two alternative zzso start sites for the cellular zzso of the zzso are zzso A stable zzso of this zzso obtained by the gene disruption technique, had the same low zzso activity of zzso zzso as zzso cells when grown on zzso but completely lacked the strong increase in activity upon entering the stationary phase, providing direct proof that the gene encodes an zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso As expected, the zzso was unable to grow on zzso as sole carbon zzso Nevertheless, it showed normal induction of zzso zzso on zzso media, indicating that activity of zzso zzso is zzso for induction of the zzso cycle in zzso zzso Surprisingly, disruption of the zzso gene did not affect growth on media containing ethanol as the sole carbon source, demonstrating that there are alternative pathways leading to zzso under these zzso
