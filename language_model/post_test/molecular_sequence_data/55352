The zzso zzso 1 gene zzso has been proposed to play a key role in the repression of insect zzso zzso is assumed to be induced by juvenile hormone zzso via a zzso zzso zzso zzso but the mechanism of induction is zzso To zzso the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso we first cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso and Met zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso In a zzso zzso cell line, zzso was rapidly induced by zzso levels of natural zzso zzso zzso identified a zzso response element zzso zzso 141 zzso located zzso zzso upstream from the zzso zzso start zzso The core region of zzso zzso contains a zzso zzso sequence to which Met, a basic zzso zzso zzso zzso factor, is likely to zzso In zzso zzso cells, which lack an intrinsic zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso fused with zzso induced zzso activity of an upstream zzso sequence zzso Meanwhile, the zzso reporter was activated zzso in zzso cells only when zzso with zzso and zzso another zzso family member, suggesting that zzso and zzso jointly interact with zzso We also found that the interaction between zzso and zzso is dependent on zzso zzso we propose the following hypothesis for the mechanism of zzso induction of zzso zzso accepts zzso as a zzso zzso zzso interacts with zzso and the zzso complex activates zzso by interacting with zzso
