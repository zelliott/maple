It has been hypothesized from zzso and zzso studies of zzso species that the Old and New World zzso may be of separate origin of the H zzso in the zzso zzso zzso To test this hypothesis, and estimate the zzso relationships of zzso zzso species within the zzso the second largest zzso of zzso zzso II zzso sequence of 36 zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso zzso was analyzed with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our data indicated that the H zzso in zzso species is differentiated in accordance with geographical origin, and that the zzso and American zzso zzso species have independent zzso origins with different zzso zzso zzso analysis of Y zzso sequences with other zzso donors zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso revealed that W and P zzso are sister to Y zzso with a zzso zzso support, and that zzso and zzso species group might have acquired their zzso St sequences from distinct zzso gene zzso Our data did not support the suggestion that the St and Y zzso have the same origin as put forward in a previous study using ITS zzso Our result provides some insight on the origin of Y zzso and its relationship to other zzso in zzso
