In this study, the CD loop of the zzso protein zzso was replaced by a zzso zzso sequence that was found to reverse the order of fill of the two sites in the zzso A zzso was included at position 7 of this zzso zzso zzso The zzso allowed zzso attachment of zzso to the loop that could subsequently be tested for their ability to sensitize the zzso of zzso or zzso bound in the zzso zzso was the most efficient zzso zzso zzso consistent with a mechanism of energy transfer that involves the zzso state of the zzso zzso acid was the most efficient zzso donor zzso zzso of zzso zzso and labeled zzso as low as 5 zzso zzso zzso could be zzso This protein zzso system has potential to be a useful, flexible complement to the organic zzso currently used in zzso zzso zzso zzso
