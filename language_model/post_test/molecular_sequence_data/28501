The zzso zzso Gov zzso zzso in zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso carried by the zzso zzso protein zzso The recent identification of the human zzso complementary DNA zzso has allowed the molecular nature of the Gov zzso to be zzso By using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify zzso zzso from 6 zzso zzso zzso and zzso individuals, we have determined that the Gov zzso differ by an A to C single zzso zzso zzso at position zzso of the coding region, resulting in a zzso substitution at zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso length zzso and real-time zzso studies of 15 additional donors (5 zzso 5 zzso and 5 zzso confirmed that this zzso zzso with the Gov zzso In addition, Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso expressing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were recognized specifically by zzso Gov zzso indicating that this zzso defines the Gov zzso zzso zzso zzso was then used to zzso 85 additional Gov zzso zzso In all but 3 cases, zzso testing concurred with the Gov zzso Repeat testing corrected 2 of these discrepancies in favor of the zzso zzso The third zzso could not be zzso likely reflecting low-level zzso expression below the sensitivity of the zzso zzso We conclude that the Gov zzso are defined by a zzso zzso zzso that results in a zzso substitution of zzso and that zzso studies are more accurate for Gov zzso determination than are conventional zzso zzso
