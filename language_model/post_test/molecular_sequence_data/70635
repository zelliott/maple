zzso zzso zzso is one of eight zzso dominant neurodegenerative disorders characterized by an abnormal zzso repeat expansion which results in the expression of a protein with a zzso stretch of excessive zzso We have reported recently that four of the gene products zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso associated with these open reading frame zzso repeat expansions are zzso for the zzso zzso cell death executioners, the zzso This led us to zzso that zzso zzso of these proteins may represent a common step in the zzso of each of these four neurodegenerative zzso Here we present evidence that zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso at zzso by zzso is critical for zzso because a zzso zzso that is resistant to zzso zzso is associated with significantly decreased zzso Further, the altered cellular zzso within the nucleus and zzso formation associated with the expanded form of zzso are completely suppressed by zzso of the zzso zzso site at zzso These results provide support for the toxic zzso hypothesis zzso zzso of zzso by zzso may be an important step in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso proteins may be a feasible therapeutic strategy to prevent cell zzso
