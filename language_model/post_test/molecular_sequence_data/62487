zzso in the genes zzso the zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso channel of cone zzso have been associated with zzso zzso zzso Here we analyze the molecular basis of zzso in two siblings with residual cone zzso zzso and zzso analyses show that the light sensitivity of the cone system is zzso and the signal transfer from cones to secondary zzso is zzso Both siblings carry two zzso zzso zzso that give rise to channel zzso with different zzso acid zzso zzso expression revealed that only one zzso forms functional channels, albeit with zzso altered properties, including changes in zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, zzso of this zzso zzso with zzso zzso the channel zzso except for the zzso zzso We argue that these zzso are responsible for the zzso in light sensitivity and synaptic zzso
