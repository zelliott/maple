A zzso with a size of zzso base pairs isolated from the zzso zzso zzso zzso strain # zzso was characterized in respect to its suitability as a basic zzso for cloning zzso The copy number of the zzso was determined to be approximately 14 copies per cell and it was shown to be compatible with zzso with an origin of replication derived from zzso and zzso The replication region of the zzso encodes a primer zzso and zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso containing a zzso resistance gene and the zzso zzso with the multiple cloning site of zzso + were zzso A zzso zzso was successfully introduced into different bacteria belonging to the family zzso To prove the zzso of the novel zzso for cloning purposes, a 13 zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli was inserted into zzso and the resulting zzso zzso was zzso maintained and expressed in zzso coli and zzso zzso
