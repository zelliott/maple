The authors have previously shown the role of human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso protein as a growth inhibitor to zzso T zzso We now report that the zzso zzso is partly expressed on both acutely and persistently infected human T zzso To investigate the cell surface expression of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were prepared by zzso with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso was expressed by a zzso expression system as a truncated zzso protein with 22 zzso containing the middle to the zzso Three clones were found to produce zzso with zzso zzso against zzso protein by zzso with the same truncated zzso All these zzso reacted on zzso with two forms of zzso 25 zzso and 27 zzso in an zzso human zzso line and with the 27 zzso zzso in zzso zzso mouse zzso expressing a full-length zzso zzso zzso zzso and flow zzso with these zzso revealed the zzso zzso to be zzso at least in part, on the surface of these zzso Thus, the zzso form of zzso might play an important role in the selective depletion of zzso cells in zzso zzso
