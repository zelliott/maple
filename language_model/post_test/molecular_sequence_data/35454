zzso zzso zzso catalyze the integration of viral DNA in the zzso DNA of the infected zzso This reaction requires the zzso of IN to coordinate a zzso attack of the 3' ends of viral DNA at two staggered zzso bonds on the recipient zzso Several models indicate that a zzso of IN would be required for zzso concerted zzso zzso zzso have shown that the zzso domain zzso of zzso is essential for concerted integration, contributing to the formation of a zzso through zzso zzso The isolated zzso of zzso zzso behave as a zzso in solution however the structure of the zzso in solution is not zzso 

In this work, zzso and mass zzso were used to identify regions involved in the zzso of the isolated zzso zzso The distances between the zzso zzso within the zzso are in agreement with the structure of the zzso zzso found in zzso The zzso zzso peptides corresponding to zzso zzso 31, zzso zzso 24 and zzso zzso 88 were zzso The zzso coordinates of zzso were used to derive a theoretical structure of the zzso zzso with the suite zzso based on shape and zzso zzso and filtered with the distance restraints determined in the zzso zzso 

The zzso results are consistent with the zzso structure of zzso in zzso but for the zzso in our model both zzso are oriented in parallel with each other and the zzso areas between the zzso would involve the interactions between zzso 1 and zzso 3 and zzso
