The zzso sequence of gene 19 of zzso zzso the structural gene of the tail tube zzso was determined by both the zzso and the zzso zzso The predicted Mr of tube protein gene product 19 is zzso The zzso zzso acid of the tube protein was determined by zzso degradation, and the zzso sequence was confirmed by isolation of the zzso zzso zzso In the zzso region between genes 18 and 19, there are two zzso consensus zzso 51 bases zzso The implication of the two late promoter sequences was examined by an zzso zzso protection zzso Both serve as weak zzso but the bulk of the transcripts arise from further upstream of the two zzso
