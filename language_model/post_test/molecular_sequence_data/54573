zzso binds the zzso complex at zzso and regulates zzso but genetic studies indicate contradictory roles: in flies it predominantly zzso synaptic zzso fusion, whereas in mice it promotes evoked zzso 

Here we characterize the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and reveal bipolar functions in zzso zzso zzso spontaneous fusion of synaptic zzso but is also essential for evoked zzso zzso zzso exhibit a doubling of zzso fusion in the absence of zzso zzso Even more zzso zzso exhibit an almost complete loss of evoked responses, and current zzso are reduced by zzso One possible interpretation is that zzso is required for the stabilization of zzso zzso and that, in its absence, zzso may fuse or zzso from the plasma zzso zzso with this hypothesis, zzso synaptic zzso are reduced by zzso in zzso zzso 

These data suggest that the main function of zzso is to maintain the zzso state both by zzso fusion and by promoting zzso
