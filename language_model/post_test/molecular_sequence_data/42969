Three series of biopsy specimens of zzso and zzso oral zzso together with seven human zzso cultures, previously established from oral zzso cell zzso were zzso for point zzso in zzso 1 and 2 of the zzso zzso and zzso genes by direct zzso sequencing of zzso amplified in the zzso chain reaction zzso Only one out of 12 biopsy samples zzso a zzso zzso which was the latest in a series of floor of mouth zzso from 1 of the 3 patients zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso being zzso at zzso 12 for a zzso zzso One cell line zzso showed zzso in both zzso 1 and 2 of zzso zzso a zzso to zzso zzso over zzso 13 and a zzso to zzso zzso over zzso zzso The remaining six oral zzso cell lines zzso were zzso normal at both zzso 1 and 2 of zzso All cell lines showed normal zzso and zzso zzso We conclude that zzso gene zzso is an zzso occurrence in the zzso progression of oral zzso cells, despite the probable importance of chemical zzso in the zzso of the zzso We zzso the need to search for other cellular sequences which may be targets for chemical or viral zzso
