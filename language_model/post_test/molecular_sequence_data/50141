The zzso translation initiation factor 4A zzso is a zzso member of the zzso zzso zzso family that couples zzso activity to zzso binding and zzso In the crystal form, zzso has a distended zzso structure consisting of two zzso which probably undergo a zzso change, on binding zzso to form a zzso functional structure via the juxtaposition of the two zzso Moreover, additional zzso changes between two zzso may be involved in the zzso and zzso activity of zzso The molecular basis of these zzso changes, however, is not zzso Here, we generated zzso zzso with high affinity for zzso by in zzso zzso zzso On zzso the zzso inhibit zzso zzso One class of zzso contains members that exhibit zzso constant of 27 zzso for zzso and severely inhibit zzso in zzso zzso The binding affinity was increased on zzso substitution in the zzso motif zzso of zzso which probably improves a predicted zzso network to bind zzso zzso zzso zzso however, failed to bind either domain of zzso that had been split at the zzso zzso These findings suggest that the selected zzso interact zzso with both zzso of zzso either in the zzso or the compact form, and zzso it into a dead-end zzso probably by blocking the zzso change of zzso The selected zzso therefore, represent a new class of specific zzso that are suitable for the analysis of zzso zzso and which pose a potential therapeutic against zzso that are caused by zzso zzso zzso
