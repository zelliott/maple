Recent work suggests a role for zzso zzso in the targeting of binding partners to specific sites in the zzso To identify whether the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso can play such a role, we performed affinity zzso of brain extract with the zzso zzso zzso We identified the zzso protein zzso a zzso first identified as a binding partner to zzso zzso as a zzso binding zzso zzso interacts with the zzso domain of zzso and this interaction can be zzso with zzso that binds to the zzso zzso zzso In addition, binding of zzso to zzso is dependent on its zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso between species that fit the zzso sequence for zzso zzso zzso zzso studies show that zzso and zzso associate in the zzso When zzso is expressed in zzso canine kidney cells, its distribution is primarily zzso however, when zzso is zzso with zzso its zzso becomes more zzso This change in zzso zzso does not occur when its zzso zzso zzso binding motif is zzso or when zzso is zzso with zzso density 95, another zzso zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest a new function for zzso as a regulator of zzso nuclear zzso
