Two unusual zzso zzso were recovered from pigs with no clinical signs, no zzso and no history of zzso zzso Two representative strains zzso and zzso analyzed in this study were initially zzso and zzso identified as zzso zzso zzso 1 and 9, respectively, by traditional identification zzso Both strains zzso however, negative results with three zzso zzso zzso tests and revealed in particular the absence of the zzso toxin zzso However, both strains produced and zzso zzso toxin although they only zzso the toxin genes zzso which is an uncommon feature for any of the known zzso zzso zzso Upon experimental zzso of zzso these strains proved to be totally zzso Animals infected with one of the strains produced zzso that zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence analysis revealed that these strains form a separate zzso group that is distinct from other zzso species and is particularly different from zzso zzso
