The diversity of bacteria associated with inflamed zzso was investigated by zzso zzso samples from zzso mice on a selective medium containing zzso Among eight zzso two strains zzso and zzso belonged to bacterial groups not yet cultured from the mouse zzso Whereas strain zzso was identified as a member of the family zzso and is closely related to zzso species and zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was a novel zzso Based on zzso analysis, strain zzso is a member of the family zzso The closest relatives with zzso published names were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso % zzso and zzso species zzso zzso With respect to zzso zzso and zzso the zzso position of strain zzso was confirmed at the zzso level by zzso infrared zzso zzso The major fatty acid of strain zzso is zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso zzso between strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was 28 zzso zzso zzso is a zzso rod that does not form spores and has a high DNA zzso content zzso zzso zzso are zzso but grow only under strictly zzso zzso They are sensitive to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso analysis showed the ability of strain zzso to convert a variety of zzso acid zzso According to these findings, it is proposed to create a novel zzso and species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to accommodate strain zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
