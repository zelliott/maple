Most zzso zzso strains express relatively low levels of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso However, several strains isolated from patients with localized aggressive zzso are zzso and transcribe the zzso zzso at high zzso These strains possess a copy of zzso in the zzso promoter and previous studies have suggested that the presence of the zzso sequence increases zzso zzso by zzso a zzso negative regulator of zzso expression from the zzso elements of the zzso zzso However, we now report that replacing zzso with an equal length of random sequence has little effect on zzso activity of the zzso promoter, suggesting that the physical displacement of the negative regulatory element does not contribute to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Instead, we show that a zzso element upstream of the zzso zzso of zzso is required for increased zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or reversing the orientation of zzso relative to the zzso zzso promoter zzso reduced zzso activity to levels exhibited by the native zzso zzso However, no increase in zzso was observed when zzso was zzso inserted into a zzso promoter that contained a truncated copy of zzso suggesting that an intact zzso may also be required for zzso induction of zzso zzso to determine if zzso functions as a regulator of zzso zzso three independent zzso zzso containing zzso zzso in zzso were zzso Each exhibited significantly lower expression of zzso than the control reporter with intact zzso In addition, zzso protein was zzso by mobility shift zzso to interact with the zzso promoter at or downstream of the zzso zzso These results suggest that a potential zzso promoter and the zzso zzso may zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso zzso strains containing zzso
