zzso is regulated in part by the interaction of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor type 1 zzso Previous investigations suggest that three specific zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso play a critical role in this important regulatory zzso Our earlier studies have demonstrated that conversion of any of these three zzso to a zzso acid zzso reduced the rate of zzso of zzso by zzso by factors varying from zzso In addition, we have reported that the second order rate constant for zzso by zzso of the zzso zzso is reduced by a factor of approximately zzso compared with that of wild type zzso In this study, we have significantly extended our earlier observations by identifying zzso zzso that are substantially more resistant to zzso by zzso than any previously reported zzso of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for example, is inhibited by zzso approximately zzso zzso times less rapidly than zzso wild type zzso We also report the first direct comparison of the effects of charge reversal zzso of zzso zzso and/or zzso on the properties of the zzso and zzso forms of zzso While these zzso zzso extraordinary resistance to zzso by zzso to both forms of the zzso our observations reveal that the zzso zzso is affected to a greater extent than the zzso zzso zzso wild type zzso is inhibited by zzso approximately zzso times more rapidly than zzso zzso The corresponding ratio increases to zzso or zzso respectively, for zzso of zzso containing the zzso zzso or zzso zzso
