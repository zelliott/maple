Progressive zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are neurodegenerative diseases that are characterized by zzso zzso of zzso zzso with four zzso zzso Although zzso and zzso have distinctive pathological features, no zzso difference in zzso zzso has been zzso In this study, we examined the brains of eight patients with zzso six patients with zzso and one zzso case with pathological features of both zzso and zzso On zzso of zzso brain zzso a zzso band predominated in the low molecular weight zzso fragments in zzso whereas two closely related bands of approximately zzso predominated in zzso zzso of the zzso case showed both the zzso band and the zzso zzso zzso sequencing and zzso analyses showed that the zzso band and the zzso zzso consisted of the zzso half of zzso with different zzso zzso These results suggest that, despite the identical composition of zzso zzso different zzso processing of abnormal zzso takes place in these two zzso Such a zzso divergence may be related to the zzso features of these zzso
