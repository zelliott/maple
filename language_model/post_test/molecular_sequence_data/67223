We characterized a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from tomato zzso zzso zzso showed zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence identity with zzso zzso and rice zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso expressed in insect cells revealed that zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso indicating that zzso is a zzso zzso We also isolated a tomato zzso zzso zzso and found that zzso is a zzso zzso as zzso zzso and zzso showed zzso zzso similar to each other toward the zzso intermediate compounds from zzso to zzso zzso was the best zzso and zzso was also zzso to the zzso zzso product to some zzso On the other hand, the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso at a trace level, indicating that the compounds after zzso reduction are poor zzso of zzso and zzso In addition, cholesterol zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were also converted to zzso zzso products by the zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso genes were zzso zzso and their transcript levels were zzso by the zzso application of zzso These findings strongly suggest that zzso and zzso function in the early zzso zzso steps of zzso zzso zzso in zzso
