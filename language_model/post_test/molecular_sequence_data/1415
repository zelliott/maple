zzso enriched in zzso of 15 zzso zzso is an abundant zzso in primary cultures of mouse brain zzso Its capability to interact with members of the zzso and zzso activated protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso We analyzed the in zzso cellular sources of zzso in the normal adult mouse brain using a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed numerous zzso cells throughout the brain of zzso adult mice while no zzso signal was observed in the brain of zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso and double zzso zzso showed that both zzso and zzso could be cellular sources of zzso Closer examination revealed that in a given area only part of the zzso expressed the zzso The zzso was the most striking example of this zzso a spatial segregation restricting zzso positive zzso to the zzso and zzso zzso A zzso zzso signal was also observed in a few cells within the zzso zone and the zzso migratory zzso In zzso analysis of an eventual zzso regulation in zzso was performed using a model of zzso occurring along motor zzso zzso the transgenic mouse expressing the zzso zzso human zzso a model of zzso lateral zzso We observed a marked zzso of zzso in zzso zzso that had developed throughout the zzso horn of the zzso spinal zzso of the transgenic zzso The zzso cellular expression of the protein and its increased expression in pathological situations, combined with the known properties of zzso suggest that zzso expression is associated with a particular zzso status of cells challenged with potentially zzso and/or zzso zzso
