A novel nonsense zzso associated with the skipping of zzso zzso 2 of the zzso zzso gene was found in two patients, from zzso and Morocco, with zzso zzso By reverse zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso was located, at zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso within zzso zzso Two zzso were produced as a result of this nonsense zzso one of the expected size that contains the premature stop zzso zzso and the other with a deletion of 84 zzso corresponding to the whole of zzso zzso This deletion produced the loss of the last seven zzso acids of the leader zzso and the first 21 zzso acids of the mature zzso The nonsense zzso was found in a zzso zzso zzso which is equal to, or similar to, others reported to be zzso zzso enhancers zzso We suggest that the nonsense zzso may affect a possible zzso on zzso 2, which would hinder the zzso site selection and facilitate an zzso zzso with the skipping of this zzso zzso by quantitative zzso shows that the ratio of zzso with the nonsense zzso to the zzso with the deletion is zzso zzso
