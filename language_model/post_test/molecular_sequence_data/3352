zzso is a zzso storage disorder caused by deficient activity of the zzso zzso We report here the sequencing and expression of the zzso zzso zzso from normal and zzso guinea zzso The zzso acid sequence of the guinea pig zzso displayed zzso identity to the zzso zzso in other zzso The zzso of the zzso guinea pig contained a zzso zzso zzso leading to substitution of zzso by zzso at zzso acid position 227 zzso The zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso in the guinea pig colony and introduction of zzso into the zzso sequence eliminated the production of zzso zzso activity in zzso expression zzso Furthermore, the guinea pig zzso has been found in human zzso Our results strongly indicate that the zzso zzso causes zzso and suggest that the guinea pig will be an excellent model for investigation of zzso and evaluation of therapeutic strategies for human zzso
