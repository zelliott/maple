The zzso switch of zzso coli is responsible for zzso expression of type 1 zzso Switching in the zzso and zzso directions is promoted by the zzso zzso while the zzso zzso directs switching predominantly in the zzso zzso The effects of local promoter activity and the zzso zzso protein on inversion of the switch were zzso In contrast to zzso zzso inversion of the switch by the zzso zzso was unaffected by the zzso status of the zzso zzso towards the switch from within a zzso zzso zzso gene was found to bias the switch strongly in the OFF direction, creating a zzso zzso in the absence of the zzso zzso This zzso was zzso dependent and was also contingent on zzso from within the zzso These data show that local zzso and a zzso protein both contribute to the zzso of a zzso zzso event on the bacterial zzso
