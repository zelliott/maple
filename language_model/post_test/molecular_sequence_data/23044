The zzso protein zzso is the first in a chain of translation initiation factors that recruit zzso zzso zzso to the zzso end of zzso zzso During zzso translation, this protein binds to the zzso zzso cap of the zzso as well as to the zzso protein zzso The latter then interacts with small zzso zzso zzso thereby promoting the zzso recruitment zzso Here, we show zzso to be a protein that contains extensive zzso regions, which are induced to fold upon recognition of the cap zzso zzso of zzso to zzso likewise zzso folding of the protein into a state that is similar to, but not identical with, that of zzso zzso At the same time, binding of each of the binding partners of zzso zzso the zzso with which it interacts with the other zzso We present zzso kinetic and zzso data that allow us to deduce some of the detailed folding transitions that take place during the zzso zzso
