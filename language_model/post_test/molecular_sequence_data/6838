Wilson's disease is an zzso zzso inherited disorder of copper zzso In normal individuals, copper zzso is controlled by the balance between zzso zzso of dietary copper and zzso zzso of excess copper in zzso In Wilson's disease, zzso copper is neither zzso in zzso nor incorporated into zzso and copper accumulates to toxic zzso The Wilson's disease gene zzso encodes a putative zzso protein that is expressed almost exclusively in the zzso The predicted structure of the protein product is that of a zzso zzso with striking zzso to bacterial copper zzso and the gene product of another inherited disorder of copper zzso zzso zzso A rat model of Wilson's disease has recently been zzso The zzso Cinnamon zzso rat zzso elevated zzso copper, defective incorporation of copper into zzso and reduced zzso zzso of zzso The rat zzso of the zzso is abnormal in zzso zzso Clinical manifestations of Wilson's disease arise directly from zzso damage to zzso zzso zzso or indirectly after the release of copper from the liver with subsequent damage to the brain zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a single zzso may account for some of the zzso in zzso zzso The diagnosis of Wilson's disease depends on the demonstration of zzso copper zzso zzso as elevated urinary and zzso copper and low zzso zzso However, none of the abnormal findings in Wilson's disease is zzso zzso diagnosis, in the absence of family studies, is likely to be difficult since many different zzso result in the zzso Management of Wilson's disease involves decreasing excess levels of copper accumulated in the liver, brain, and other zzso zzso zzso therapy, to increase urinary zzso of copper, is the mainstay of zzso In addition, oral zinc therapy may be useful at decreasing zzso of dietary copper and rendering tissue copper zzso by increasing the formation of complexes with zzso zzso Liver transplantation can be necessary for individuals with acute zzso failure or complications of zzso Gene therapy may evolve in the zzso however, medical management is effective in most zzso
