Many viral and bacterial pathogens establish infections through zzso surfaces in their initial zzso However, only a few zzso molecules successfully induce strong zzso immune reaction without the addition of zzso by oral zzso To overcome this difficulty, we investigated whether zzso E zzso particles zzso could be zzso as a carrier zzso for foreign zzso zzso and to stimulate zzso immunity without the need for zzso To accomplish this goal, we incorporated a B cell zzso tag, consisting of 11 zzso acids at the zzso of zzso The zzso zzso showed zzso similar to that of the mature zzso zzso and zzso The inserted zzso was zzso with a specific zzso zzso in the zzso form, suggesting that it was exposed on the surface of the zzso After oral administration without zzso this zzso zzso induced significant levels of specific zzso and zzso to both the inserted zzso and zzso in zzso zzso These zzso immune responses were observed as early as 2 weeks after the first zzso These results suggest the potential of zzso as a zzso vaccine carrier vehicle for the presentation of zzso zzso through oral zzso
