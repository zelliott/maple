We have cloned and zzso the zzso gene from Chlorella virus zzso by selecting for the modification zzso The modification gene was cloned on a zzso zzso zzso inserted into the zzso site of the zzso zzso The zzso gene was localized at the 3' end of this zzso zzso of this region revealed a large open reading frame that codes for zzso zzso symbol zzso zzso 260 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence is zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso and not so to zzso zzso zzso and zzso We also describe the use of the zzso chain reaction technique to alter zzso and zzso signals surrounding this gene so as to achieve zzso in zzso zzso This construct yields zzso at zzso of the total cellular zzso The zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and gel zzso zzso Its size by zzso is zzso 28 zzso in good agreement with that predicted from the zzso zzso
