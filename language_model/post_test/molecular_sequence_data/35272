The routinely used zzso methods are robust in accurately typing standard zzso or zzso zzso However, they result in zzso in weak or partial D blood, which requires genetic zzso We have previously used zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso to screen the entire zzso zzso However, zzso is technically challenging, zzso and zzso To overcome these zzso we sought to develop a new zzso zzso 

A total of 430 blood samples with D zzso ambiguity were recruited for this zzso The three most frequent weak D zzso zzso weak D, zzso weak D, zzso and weak D, zzso which altogether account for zzso to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in the Caucasian population, were first identified by zzso zzso The remaining unidentified samples were then subjected to a zzso multiplex zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of all 10 zzso zzso followed by direct zzso 

zzso conditions for efficient and reliable identification of the three most common weak D zzso by zzso zzso were zzso All 10 zzso zzso were successfully amplified in a zzso zzso zzso Employment of the zzso analysis identified zzso zzso in zzso of the 430 studied zzso Two of the nine previously zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found to cause zzso zzso zzso by means of a zzso zzso zzso 

The new zzso analysis proved to be much easier and cheaper than the zzso method and therefore is convenient to be used as a routine, zzso approach for zzso zzso
