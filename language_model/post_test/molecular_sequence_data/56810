A zzso feature of the steroid zzso gene family is the presence of an exceptionally long 3' untranslated region zzso Analysis of this sequence from the human zzso zzso zzso gene showed the presence of a number of zzso regions that included thirteen repeats of the zzso zzso an element known to have a zzso effect in other zzso In the region 3' of the gene there were a further eight copies of this zzso Also located in this sequence were two members of the zzso repetitive family in inverse orientation and in a tandem zzso zzso experiments in which the 3' zzso and 3' zzso sequence were included in zzso zzso expression zzso revealed a large zzso effect with several different zzso This inherent instability appears to be determined by the primary zzso sequence but may act in conjunction with other zzso This zzso regulatory mechanism may contribute to the control of the level of the zzso zzso
