The structure and specificity of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso are zzso This zzso showed an unusual zzso specificity in that it could use zzso and zzso Gal zzso as zzso In addition zzso and zzso terminal Gal served as zzso These properties distinguish the bacterial zzso from the more widely investigated zzso zzso The protein was expressed as a zzso protein in zzso coli at a level of 750 zzso zzso 250 zzso The protein could be extracted with buffers containing zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso using zzso zzso zzso mass zzso of peptides obtained by zzso with zzso zzso and zzso confirmed over zzso of the deduced zzso acid zzso When used for zzso synthesis in coupled reactions with zzso zzso zzso the zzso could zzso fluorescent derivatives of zzso with zzso acid, zzso acid and zzso zzso
