The ability to zzso zzso in single living cells and monitor in real-time the changes of zzso level and zzso can provide unprecedented opportunities for biological and disease zzso However, the zzso detection specificity and sensitivity are critically dependent on the selection of target sequences and their zzso We carried out an extensive study of the target accessibility of zzso zzso using 10 different designs of molecular zzso zzso and identified the optimal beacon zzso Specifically, for zzso design 1 and 8 zzso and zzso the fluorescent zzso from zzso zzso correlated well with the zzso signal after zzso zzso and zzso zzso using zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso using zzso significantly reduced the beacon signals, demonstrating detection zzso The beacon specificity was further confirmed using blocking zzso and in zzso zzso We found that zzso signal from zzso depends critically on target zzso the target sequences corresponding to zzso sites may not be good sites for zzso zzso zzso and vice zzso zzso beacon design rules are identified and approaches for enhancing target accessibility are zzso This has significant implications to zzso design for live cell zzso zzso
