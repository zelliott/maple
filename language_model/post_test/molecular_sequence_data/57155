The zzso at position 13 of zzso growth factor zzso has been implicated as playing a role in zzso binding due to its close proximity to the critical zzso 41 zzso as well as its high degree of conservation in zzso and zzso proteins that can bind to the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso 13 in human zzso zzso was employed to examine the role of this zzso in zzso zzso The removal of the zzso zzso of the zzso by substitution with zzso had little effect on the zzso indicating that it is not involved in any crucial hydrogen bonds with either the zzso or with other regions of the zzso zzso The substitution of the aromatic zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso caused the zzso affinity to decrease only slightly, indicating that zzso of the zzso acid at this site is also not zzso zzso with other zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso resulted in a significant decrease in zzso affinity as a function of decreasing zzso zzso of zzso 13 with the polar zzso zzso and zzso markedly decreased zzso binding zzso and complete removal of the zzso by substitution with zzso dramatically lowered the binding affinity to zzso as compared to wild zzso Analysis of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by circular zzso showed that the major structural features of zzso were not significantly zzso The results demonstrate that the decreased zzso affinities of these zzso zzso are due to disruption of the functional zzso of the zzso 13 zzso rather than zzso in the overall structural zzso Overall, the results suggest that the zzso 13 zzso plays a critical role in zzso binding by contributing to zzso zzso zzso
