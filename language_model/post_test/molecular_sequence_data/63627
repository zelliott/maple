The cardiac zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso also named zzso for its interaction with cardiac zzso I, is both a unique expression and zzso zzso To understand the mechanisms of zzso gene expression and regulation, we first cloned the full-length zzso sequence and mapped the zzso start site of the mouse zzso gene and characterized its promoter zzso Two zzso zzso of the zzso gene were identified in mouse heart zzso zzso analysis of the zzso promoter identified a minimal 151 zzso region that has strong zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed five zzso zzso elements in this zzso long minimal zzso zzso and zzso analysis and zzso studies indicated that zzso binding region is the most critical zzso element in the zzso promoter, and zzso zzso level can be zzso by zzso zzso zzso to the zzso sites by zzso protein was confirmed by zzso mobility shift zzso and competition and zzso zzso mobility shift zzso
