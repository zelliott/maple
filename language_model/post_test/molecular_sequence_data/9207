zzso zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso does not allow the characterization of zzso because of the fragmentation of zzso structures and limited fragmentation of zzso zzso zzso transfer zzso zzso zzso on the other hand, offers a complementary approach, prompting only zzso backbone fragmentation while keeping zzso modifications zzso zzso of zzso using both zzso and zzso is summarized in this zzso While zzso provides information related to the composition of zzso zzso attached to a zzso zzso zzso permits de zzso sequencing of zzso zzso zzso transfer of electrons to the zzso backbone in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso is retained on the zzso zzso largely unaffected by the zzso process, thus allowing the identification of the zzso acid sequence of a zzso and its zzso zzso This unit discusses the use of both zzso and zzso for better characterization of zzso
