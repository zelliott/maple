zzso amplification of zzso ends, done on zzso zzso from human zzso cells, was used to identify zzso zzso of novel zzso sequence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso This identified an open reading frame zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which we term zzso zzso differs from the two known zzso forms by virtue of its unique zzso zzso region, compared with the unique zzso regions of 94 and 39 zzso found in zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells the two long forms, zzso and zzso had molecular masses of zzso 104 and zzso 103 zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells, the three zzso zzso were found in the high-speed zzso zzso fraction as well as both the high-speed zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso All zzso showed similar zzso values for zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activities of the soluble zzso activity of the two long forms were very similar, whereas that of the short form, zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were less active zzso zzso than their zzso forms, whereas particulate zzso was similar in activity to its zzso zzso zzso and zzso forms of zzso and zzso were similarly inhibited by zzso zzso the selective inhibitor of zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso was profoundly zzso zzso more sensitive zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso than its zzso form zzso zzso zzso The various zzso zzso zzso showed very different zzso to zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and high zzso zzso A novel zzso called zzso was obtained by screening a rat zzso lobe zzso zzso This contained an open reading frame zzso a zzso protein that showed zzso zzso zzso acid identity with zzso and is proposed to reflect the rat zzso of this human zzso and is thus called zzso Alternative zzso of zzso generated from both the human and rat zzso genes produces long and short zzso zzso that have unique zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that these alternatively spliced regions determine changes in the zzso zzso activity of the zzso their zzso to zzso by zzso and mode of interaction with particulate zzso
