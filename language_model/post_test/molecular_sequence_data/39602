A zzso zzso human zzso termed zzso demonstrates both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso construct for zzso is comprised of the zzso zzso human zzso hormone zzso The zzso DNA construct for zzso encodes zzso zzso from human zzso zzso zzso with the exceptions that zzso beta zzso acid 88 zzso is zzso for zzso beta zzso acid 94 zzso and zzso beta zzso acids zzso zzso are zzso for zzso beta zzso acids zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso and zzso zzso able to bind and to signal through zzso and zzso receptors in zzso In in zzso zzso zzso to zzso each type of activity, zzso was found to have zzso and zzso zzso at levels similar to those of zzso human zzso and zzso human zzso zzso In immature rats, zzso was sufficient to support the maturation of normal zzso zzso Moreover, a significant portion of zzso matured by zzso zzso in response to an zzso zzso stimulus and gave rise to zzso normal zzso Furthermore, a low dose of zzso promoted weight gain in the zzso zzso suggesting it also supported preparation for zzso without zzso evidence of excessive zzso of the zzso In zzso the biological properties of zzso indicate that its zzso nature has resulted in a fully functional, zzso human zzso
