The zzso gene product forms part of the zzso network zzso essential for the survival of many zzso zzso Among other as yet unidentified roles, zzso functions as a resuscitation promoting factor required for survival and resuscitation of cells in a viable but zzso zzso zzso 

In order to investigate in detail the zzso relationship of this family of proteins we have performed X-ray zzso studies of zzso zzso zzso The zzso structure showed that it has a classic zzso zzso zzso Comparisons of this crystal structure to that of available zzso from zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso zzso revealed two distinctly different modes of zzso zzso In one form, prevalent in the absence of zzso the putative zzso site is incomplete, lacking a binding pocket for a zzso zzso In the second form, zzso from the second zzso complete the zzso zzso This suggests that the two zzso zzso observed in the crystal structures zzso to a free and a zzso form of zzso A multiple sequence alignment of zzso proteins from different bacteria allowed us to identify a large zzso zzso patch on the protein surface that becomes exposed upon zzso zzso zzso We zzso that the transition between two zzso zzso represents the transition between the zzso and zzso states of zzso The effect of this transition is to alternately expose and bury a zzso site for the partner protein zzso 

This paper provides the first structural insight into the putative mechanism of zzso regulation of zzso through zzso zzso Our analysis suggests that zzso binding to zzso may act as a regulator or switch that changes zzso shape, allowing it to switch partners between zzso and zzso
