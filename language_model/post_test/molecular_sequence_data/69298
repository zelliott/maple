Limited zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso generates peptides that remain zzso attached and zzso zzso zzso degradation of the peptides showed that the primary zzso sites for zzso zzso zzso are the zzso bond followed by zzso The zzso site is of particular interest, since it forms part of the hinged lid that closes over the zzso center, and this bond is only zzso A zzso or zzso A zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The higher zzso zzso and zzso values exhibited by the zzso active zzso complex suggest that the zzso is not bound as tightly to the zzso zzso In addition, increased zzso formation by the zzso zzso indicates that the zzso complex is less protected from the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso show that the overall structure of the zzso complex is similar to the native zzso but with local structural zzso around the zzso Also, the zzso complex is more susceptible to zzso by zzso and exhibits lower zzso values, indicating a loose interaction between the zzso zzso zzso and zzso experiments suggest that the fragments have strong inherent secondary structural features and can zzso into zzso active zzso
