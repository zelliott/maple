The diverse lineages of the zzso zzso system including both B and T zzso are derived from a single zzso zzso the zzso bone zzso stem zzso The coordinate zzso regulation of sets of zzso genes is one of the important molecular mechanisms underlying zzso lineage determination and zzso The zzso and T cell zzso zzso genes have been used as model systems to study zzso zzso regulation during zzso zzso This review summarizes our current understanding of the regulation of zzso gene expression during zzso zzso zzso of each of the zzso genes is controlled by T zzso zzso enhancers that bind partially overlapping sets of ubiquitous and zzso zzso zzso These include members of both the zzso family of zzso zzso proteins and the zzso zzso family, as well as the T zzso zinc finger zzso factor, zzso and the T zzso high mobility group proteins zzso and zzso zzso The identification of binding sites for these same zzso factors in a number of additional T zzso genes suggests that they may play important roles in the coordinate regulation of gene expression that specifies the development of the T cell zzso Recent studies of the zzso alpha and gamma genes have suggested that negative regulatory elements of zzso zzso may also play an important role in controlling the zzso expression of these zzso On going studies are designed to clarify the role of each of the zzso zzso binding proteins in regulating T cell development in zzso to more precisely define the interactions between the zzso zzso binding zzso and to zzso the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso zzso zzso
