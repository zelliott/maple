The potential biological effects of electric and/or magnetic fields on cells and zzso must be addressed systematically within a context of zzso in cell cycle zzso Such studies should not be pursued in an isolated manner but as a component of the fundamental relationship between proliferation and zzso the zzso process by which structural and functional properties of specialized cells, zzso and zzso progressively zzso It is necessary to zzso establish the influence of electric and magnetic fields on the integrated zzso mechanisms which zzso regulatory information for 1) control of the zzso process and 2) zzso of proliferation associated with the initiation of gene expression that mediates the development and maintenance of zzso properties characteristic of differentiated zzso We will present an overview of our current understanding of regulatory mechanisms that control proliferation and cell specialization in normal zzso cells with emphasis on rate limiting steps that may be the basis for biological zzso by electric and magnetic zzso Addressing such questions in normal zzso cells is essential since the loss of growth control in transformed and tumor cells is accompanied by an zzso of zzso regulatory mechanisms that are functionally coupled to zzso
