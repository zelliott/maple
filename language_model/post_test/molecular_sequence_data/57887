We have identified a zzso response element zzso in the human skeletal zzso gene between zzso positions zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso that is zzso by the core zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso This sequence zzso appropriate hormonal regulation in a zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso dependent manner to an zzso zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso experiments showed that zzso coli expressed and affinity zzso zzso alpha bound to the skeletal zzso zzso in a sequence specific zzso The zzso zzso bound zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso indicated that the core binding motifs and the gap sequences were the most important for efficient binding to zzso zzso The zzso X zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso in a sequence specific fashion and formed zzso complexes with zzso alpha on the zzso zzso However, increased levels of zzso alpha decreased the binding of zzso alpha to the zzso zzso in contrast to promoting zzso alpha binding to the zzso heavy chain zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso synthetic direct zzso zzso heavy chain, and growth hormone zzso zzso with an identical nuclear factor in zzso in muscle zzso In conclusion, our data suggest that the human skeletal zzso zzso is a target for direct zzso between two different hormonal signals zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
