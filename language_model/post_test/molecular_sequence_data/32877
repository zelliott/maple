For the zzso of the collagen triple zzso with an zzso zzso we investigated various zzso peptides consisting of ideal zzso repeats and containing zzso zzso in various positions for a side zzso chain zzso with a suitable zzso zzso Comparative zzso analysis of these zzso peptides indicated an zzso zzso with two zzso zzso located in the central portion in i and zzso positions and flanked by zzso repeat sequences as the most promising for the zzso zzso In zzso alcoholic solution the zzso zzso formed a stable triple zzso in equilibrium with the zzso species as a zzso zzso whereas zzso to the zzso zzso leads to unfolding of at least part of the triple zzso Furthermore, the residual zzso structure acts like an zzso zzso thus making zzso upon zzso zzso a zzso fast zzso zzso these zzso zzso systems should be well suited for zzso studies of zzso of the collagen triple zzso under variable zzso zzso
