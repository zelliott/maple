zzso has functional similarity to its zzso the zzso structuring protein zzso It binds to zzso zzso bent DNA and zzso DNA zzso In addition, zzso acts as an zzso zzso zzso and zzso also form zzso However, cellular levels of zzso are low due to repression of zzso by zzso and negative zzso Here we show that effective zzso repression of zzso zzso requires a downstream regulator element located within the zzso coding zzso In addition, we show that zzso zzso zzso zzso in an zzso zzso zzso In contrast, repression of the zzso zzso another zzso system, is not achieved by zzso zzso It becomes zzso dependent in the presence of a fusion protein encompassing the zzso 37 zzso acids of zzso which comprise the core of the zzso zzso zzso also effectively zzso zzso a zzso defective in specific DNA zzso in repression of the zzso zzso Thus, zzso zzso zzso proteins defective in DNA binding to repress zzso while in zzso of zzso it acts zzso indicating a difference in the mechanisms of zzso
