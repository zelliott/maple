The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso D contained in the unique short region of the zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso has been zzso Analysis of this sequence revealed five open reading frames zzso four complete and one incomplete, which were zzso by the same sense zzso zzso of the zzso DNA sequence with that zzso zzso of other zzso has revealed no significant zzso zzso at the zzso acid level, however, has demonstrated regions of significant sequence similarity between the three complete zzso zzso 2, 3 and 4, and the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene and the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso The interrupted zzso 5 was found to display partial zzso with the zzso zzso zzso but no zzso was found between the protein zzso by zzso 1 and other zzso The three zzso zzso zzso zzso putative zzso with zzso to the zzso zzso were therefore designated zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Moreover, further similarities were found between zzso zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso virus zzso zzso and between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso genes in the small unique components of their zzso and that the genetic organization of these regions is zzso
