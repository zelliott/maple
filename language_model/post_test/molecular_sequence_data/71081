We have isolated a full-length zzso zzso an zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso The predicted protein is truncated in comparison with zzso from other organisms such that the zzso zzso zzso closely to the end of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso The zzso in the zzso zzso are zzso as are the six zzso which form the three zzso zzso zzso Three of the zzso aromatic zzso which line the active site zzso in the zzso zzso are zzso by zzso zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso High level expression was obtained via zzso from zzso zzso The zzso zzso behaved as a zzso zzso zzso Although of zzso origin and possessing the above zzso in the active site zzso zzso the zzso efficiently zzso zzso and showed minimal activity against zzso It displayed excess zzso zzso with zzso at zzso over zzso 5 zzso and was highly sensitive to both active site and zzso site zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated a progressive increase in zzso for zzso B in zzso isolated from 6 days zzso
