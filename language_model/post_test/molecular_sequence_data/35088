Small zzso zzso zzso are prevalent in North American sheep and a major cause of production losses for the zzso sheep zzso zzso zzso to zzso infection is influenced by genetic variation within the zzso zzso 154 gene zzso Animals with either of two distinct zzso zzso that both zzso zzso at position 35 of the protein zzso are at greater risk of zzso infection than those zzso with a zzso zzso zzso Prior to this study, it was unknown if zzso associations with infection are influenced by zzso genetic zzso zzso our goals were to characterize zzso naturally infecting sheep from a diverse zzso Midwestern flock and test them for associations with zzso zzso zzso Two regions of the zzso zzso were targeted for zzso amplification, zzso sequence analysis, and association testing with zzso zzso zzso gag and the zzso region of zzso Independent analyses of gag and zzso sequences showed that they clustered in two zzso (1 and zzso they were distinct from zzso zzso originating from Europe, and that zzso 1 associated with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 2 with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso in the zzso have adapted to zzso sheep with specific zzso zzso zzso zzso both host and zzso zzso affect the relative risk of zzso infection in zzso
