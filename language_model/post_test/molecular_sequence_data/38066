The regulation of the zzso genes during zzso formation has been investigated in quail zzso The zzso genes are a family zzso three related zinc finger zzso factors, zzso zzso and zzso which are zzso of zzso signaling in responding zzso A quail zzso zzso has been cloned and its expression compared with zzso and zzso These studies show that zzso zzso and zzso are zzso at the time of zzso formation, thus providing a mechanism for regulating the initiation of zzso signaling in zzso zzso surgery and zzso zzso zzso experiments show that each of the zzso genes is regulated by distinct signaling zzso zzso is activated in response to zzso produced by the zzso which also controls the zzso of zzso and zzso following their zzso by zzso signaling from the surface zzso and neural zzso This surface zzso tube zzso signaling has both negative and positive functions in zzso and zzso zzso these signals repress zzso in zzso plate zzso prior to zzso formation and then promote zzso formation and the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso These studies, therefore, establish a role for zzso signaling in the control of zzso signal zzso through the regulation of zzso and zzso and provide a zzso basis for the known synergistic actions of surface zzso tube and zzso signaling in zzso cell zzso
