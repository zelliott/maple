The zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso hormone, which is believed to be related to certain types of cancer, contains three zzso zzso To investigate the role of zzso formation in the early stages of the zzso zzso a zzso zzso with the sequence zzso corresponding to the zzso hairpin zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was studied under various conditions using three optical zzso zzso zzso transform zzso zzso electronic CD, and zzso zzso Environmental conditions are critical factors for formation of secondary structure in this zzso zzso : zzso mixed zzso induced zzso zzso zzso of zzso in this zzso which may be related to the native zzso formation in the intact hormone, was found to be induced only under conditions such as high zzso high temperature, and the presence of zzso sodium zzso zzso zzso These findings support a protein folding mechanism for the zzso zzso in which an initial zzso collapse, which increases zzso interactions in zzso is needed to induce the zzso hairpin zzso
