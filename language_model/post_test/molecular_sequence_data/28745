zzso zzso constitute a large family of zzso catalyzing the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso differ substantially in size and chemical zzso In spite of the appearance of X-ray crystal structures for two members of this family, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the structural zzso of zzso specificity remain to be fully zzso We have determined the zzso and deduced zzso acid sequences for zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso and expressed the zzso in zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso by affinity zzso and showed high capacity for zzso of zzso zzso zzso consist of a small, zzso domain and a much larger domain connected by a zzso zzso A key event in zzso in zzso and zzso and certainly all other zzso zzso is a large zzso change involving involving a rotation of the two zzso and the movement of two highly zzso flexible zzso (one located in the small zzso the other located in the large domain of these zzso which clamp down on the zzso Multiple sequence alignments of zzso zzso with the only other zzso sequence available and zzso AK and zzso zzso zzso confirm the importance of the small flexible loop located in the zzso domain of zzso zzso as one component of the structural zzso of zzso zzso The role of the other flexible loop in the large domain in terms of zzso specificity remains zzso
