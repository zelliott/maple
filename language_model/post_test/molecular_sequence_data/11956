zzso interfering zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to identify the zzso nature of the last zzso sequence of the viral zzso which is required for zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain of both zzso and zzso zzso can be folded into a stable zzso structure composed of three zzso and two short zzso zzso None of the three zzso zzso can be deleted without abolishing the zzso of zzso zzso Similarly, those zzso in which zzso stem regions were disrupted by zzso zzso or zzso zzso were unable to zzso However, when the original structures were reconstructed by zzso zzso the viability of the molecules was also zzso Limited zzso (1 or 2 zzso in the zzso region did not show any significant effect on viral zzso Our results strongly suggest that the proposed structure for the 3' zzso of the viral zzso is very important for viral zzso zzso It is very likely that the function of this structure is to promote the zzso synthesis of zzso zzso zzso Evidence is provided that the proposed zzso structure is relevant not only for zzso zzso but for zzso zzso as zzso
