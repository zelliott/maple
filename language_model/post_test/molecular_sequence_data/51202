zzso theoretical modeling of zzso DNA zzso carried out earlier for the B zzso is now extended to zzso In contrast to the previous results, it is found that zzso shows no zzso of low-energy zzso zzso The possibilities of the zzso zzso are subsequently applied to studying zzso of the zzso Controlled winding and stretching zzso are used to study how the two zzso and different base sequences absorb such external zzso The results help explain the internal mechanics of the DNA double zzso and the extent to which fine structure influences this zzso The results point to some differences between the A and B double zzso but also to many zzso zzso effects on flexibility are relatively limited compared to their impact on optimal energy zzso It is also shown that the zzso zzso detected for zzso zzso are preserved under zzso but have little influence on its zzso
