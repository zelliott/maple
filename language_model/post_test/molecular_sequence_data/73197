zzso such as zzso and human zzso zzso and zzso can establish a persistent infection within the host and have diverse mechanisms as protection from host immune zzso Several zzso genes that are zzso to host immune zzso have been identified, and are implicated in viral evasion of the host immune zzso The discovery of a viral major zzso complex zzso class I zzso zzso by zzso led to speculation that it might function as an immune zzso and disrupt presentation of peptides by zzso class I to zzso T zzso However, there is no evidence concerning the biological significance of this gene during viral zzso Recent analysis of the zzso zzso has also demonstrated the presence of a zzso class I zzso Here we show that a zzso zzso in which the gene zzso the class I zzso has been zzso has severely restricted replication during the acute stage of infection compared with zzso zzso We demonstrate by in zzso depletion studies that natural killer zzso cells are responsible for the attenuated zzso of the zzso Thus the viral zzso class I zzso contributes to immune evasion through interference with zzso zzso zzso
