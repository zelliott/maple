zzso gene zzso was first identified as a target of a zzso zzso in a human zzso zzso Because zzso protein binds to zzso and bone zzso zzso zzso is zzso to be a regulator of these growth zzso However, zzso aspects of zzso are zzso To zzso the physiology of zzso we examined expression of zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso was abundantly expressed in the zzso zzso zzso was also expressed in the zzso zzso zzso zzso adrenal zzso zzso zzso small zzso and zzso During the second half of pregnancy, expression of zzso in the zzso continuously increased, whereas zzso zzso levels decreased from Day 12 to Day 14 and remained low zzso zzso was also expressed in zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso remained low from Day 12 to Day 16 and then noticeably increased until Day zzso In contrast, zzso zzso was highly expressed in the zzso on Day 12, continuously decreased until Day 16, and then remained at relatively low levels zzso During the rat zzso cycle, levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with highest levels during zzso and did not change relative to the day of the zzso zzso The present results suggest that zzso may play a role in the regulation of zzso zzso
