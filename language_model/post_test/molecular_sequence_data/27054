Plant zzso corn 1 zzso gene was amplified from corn zzso DNA with the zzso designed from a corn zzso sequence zzso to a barley zzso zzso The cloned gene contains two zzso and an zzso The deduced zzso zzso zzso has a sequence that is identical to corn zzso and has the typical features of a plant zzso including a signal sequence of 35 zzso zzso followed by a characteristic zzso domain of 47 zzso acids containing 8 zzso The zzso protein was expressed from the cloned zzso introduced into two different expression zzso zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was zzso with a zzso zzso column and was tested for its zzso activities using the pathogen zzso zzso The protein expressed in both zzso coli and zzso zzso had zzso activity, however the protein expressed in zzso zzso was more efficient in zzso growth of zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso protein expressed in the two expression systems showed that expression in zzso zzso gave a product with more zzso and less random zzso structure than when it was expressed in zzso zzso In addition, removal of the zzso used for zzso increased the zzso activity of the zzso zzso The data presented here suggest that the zzso zzso zzso of corn could be effectively used to restrict the disease caused by zzso zzso
