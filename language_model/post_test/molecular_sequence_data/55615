We have examined the attachment and penetration zzso of several zzso zzso zzso of zzso virus zzso and have identified the first one-third of zzso as a region that mediates efficient virus attachment to zzso and zzso zzso This portion of zzso zzso acids 25 through 157 of the zzso zzso appeared to support attachment by binding to zzso molecules on cell zzso zzso containing the first one-third of zzso were sensitive to zzso competition and showed greatly reduced zzso on cells treated with zzso zzso zzso lacking the first one-third of the mature zzso exhibited only residual binding to cells if challenged by vigorous washing with zzso saline at 2 h zzso at 4 degrees zzso This residual binding was resistant to zzso competition, and strains lacking the first one-third of zzso were able to zzso cells treated with zzso as effectively as zzso zzso When we determined the penetration zzso for each strain, we found that zzso virus attachment was necessary for timely penetration of zzso cells but remarkably was not required for efficient virus penetration of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso was actually prohibited from rapid penetration of zzso cells by a zzso zzso zzso Our results indicate that initial virus binding to zzso zzso via zzso zzso is not required for efficient zzso infection of all cell types and may in fact be zzso in some zzso
