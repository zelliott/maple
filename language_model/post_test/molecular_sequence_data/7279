The zzso zzso zzso zzso synaptic zzso transmission and plasticity in central zzso The zzso zzso system was used to show that the zzso tails of zzso zzso zzso interact with a prominent zzso density protein zzso The second zzso domain in zzso binds to the zzso acid, zzso domain containing the terminal zzso motif (where S is zzso X is any zzso acid, and V is zzso common to zzso zzso and certain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are expressed in a pattern similar to that of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso with zzso in cultured rat zzso zzso The interaction of these proteins may affect the plasticity of zzso zzso
