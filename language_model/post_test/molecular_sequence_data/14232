The zzso zzso system of zzso tuberculosis has to be precisely regulated since the zzso zzso although required for a successful virulent infection, are highly zzso and their continued zzso would alert the immune system to the zzso The zzso of a zzso zzso containing zzso which is required for zzso zzso and is essential for zzso was shown to be positively regulated by the zzso zzso zzso Thus, zzso from the start site, found to be located 67 zzso upstream of zzso was dependent upon zzso zzso sequences far upstream (between zzso and zzso zzso which we term the zzso zzso region zzso The zzso contains one of the known binding sites for zzso providing the first in zzso evidence that zzso zzso at the zzso promoter occurs by zzso binding to the zzso and looping out DNA between this site and the zzso zzso of zzso of this zzso thus takes place over long regions of the zzso This regulation may differ in some members of the zzso tuberculosis complex, including zzso zzso since deletions of the zzso region have removed the upstream sequence containing the zzso resulting in lowered zzso zzso zzso differences in expression of zzso in these bacteria may contribute to their various zzso and host zzso The zzso nature of this zzso means that zzso factors controlling its expression are possible drug zzso
