To characterize the complementary DNA zzso and protein sequences of zzso recognized by zzso zzso using zzso zzso proteins for improved zzso zzso 

A zzso expression library was zzso and zzso isolation, zzso and sequence analysis were zzso Northern zzso and in zzso zzso techniques were zzso A zzso protein zzso was zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell proteins and zzso of zzso and natural nuclear proteins were zzso zzso studies were done with zzso positive zzso of zzso zzso patients, and with human or rabbit zzso specific for zzso zzso screening of systemic lupus zzso zzso arthritis, zzso and antinuclear zzso human zzso was performed using an zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso 

A major zzso recognized by zzso positive zzso of zzso patients was found to constitute a zzso nuclear protein zzso zzso zzso on zzso 12 and to belong to the zzso 54 zzso zzso Human and rabbit zzso that were affinity zzso using the zzso protein reacted with and zzso a nuclear protein of similar size, which was also recognized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso detected by zzso protein zzso seemed to be mainly restricted to zzso from patients with zzso 

The molecular characterization of the zzso zzso zzso may contribute to our understanding of zzso phenomena in zzso The use of zzso zzso proteins allows structural and functional studies of the zzso and the development of sensitive and accurate zzso screening zzso
