To address the events that zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the present study was carried zzso It was found that zzso zzso showed different activities in inducing leakage of zzso made of egg zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso had different gross zzso the toxins showed similar binding affinity for zzso zzso zzso contact between toxin molecules and zzso zzso differed for different zzso as evidenced by zzso enhancement of zzso zzso Color transformation of zzso membrane zzso revealed that zzso zzso were absorbed on zzso zzso in different zzso zzso of Met zzso at the tip of loop II indicated that zzso zzso and orientation of zzso played a vital role in damaging zzso and zzso zzso and suggested that an intact loop II was crucial for inducing leakage of zzso zzso rather than that of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso induced markedly zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, our data indicate that, in addition to membrane organization, zzso zzso and zzso mode of zzso determine the potency of their zzso zzso
