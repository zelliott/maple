Bud zzso zzso pole body zzso and DNA replication are all dependent on the zzso of the zzso protein zzso at the Start point in the zzso phase of the cell zzso Bud emergence requires polarization of the zzso and zzso zzso to a specific site on the cell zzso zzso activated by zzso triggers polarization of zzso to the site of bud emergence and favors zzso bud growth zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso We isolated zzso as a zzso that enhances the division zzso of zzso zzso with defects at zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Watanabe, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that zzso zzso exhibit zzso similar to those shown by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso including zzso of zzso deposition and of zzso cortical spots and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso zzso double zzso are zzso We suggest that zzso functions downstream or in parallel with zzso in promoting bud formation and zzso zzso
