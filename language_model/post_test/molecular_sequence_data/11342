We report the zzso sequences of two zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso species zzso zzso These two zzso sequences and a previously published zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to derive the zzso acid sequences which were then compared with their zzso from other zzso This comparison shows that the zzso zzso zzso domain is highly zzso across the species examined with the second half of the domain slightly more zzso than the first zzso The 3' portion of the zzso terminal tail is not very highly zzso The comparison of the zzso portion of zzso shows a high degree of conservation among the zzso zzso and a low degree of conservation in the region that links the third zzso domain with the zzso zzso
