The genetic organization of the M zzso segment of zzso zzso zzso virus, a member of the zzso zzso of the family zzso has been zzso The middle zzso zzso segment has a single open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso zzso We have used zzso and zzso sequencing and synthetic peptides to map proteins within the zzso The order of the proteins translated from the single large open reading frame is zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein extends from zzso acids 14 to zzso The zzso is zzso zzso long, with a zzso zzso molecular weight of zzso zzso It is preceded by a zzso 13 zzso acid signal zzso zzso includes a long highly zzso sequence and contains three potential zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein occupies the zzso end of the open reading frame from zzso acids zzso to zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and has a zzso zzso molecular weight of zzso zzso It has two potential zzso zzso sites, and a potential zzso region followed by a potential zzso domain at the zzso zzso If membrane associated it has an orientation of zzso zzso zzso zzso Limited zzso zzso removes a zzso zzso from the zzso end, leaving a zzso truncated zzso zzso zzso acids zzso to zzso with a single zzso zzso zzso Between the zzso and zzso molecules there are 174 zzso zzso sufficient to code for 19 zzso of zzso Some zzso raised against peptides within this region react with proteins of 11 zzso zzso and 10 zzso present in infected cell zzso but the exact relationship of these proteins to the open reading frame remains to be zzso
