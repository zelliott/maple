zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor 1 zzso is a member of the zzso group of zzso that is initially identified as a bone zzso zzso zzso factor and as a zzso zzso zzso Although most zzso are thought to be zzso inflammatory zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso B zzso bone zzso zzso and cardiac zzso zzso formation, and it has zzso activities on resting zzso and zzso In this paper, we have isolated a zzso that encodes a seven zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence has zzso identity with that of a zzso a human zzso virus 1 zzso entry zzso However, the second zzso region has lower identity zzso compared with zzso zzso is expressed during zzso genesis and in many zzso and T cells of adult zzso zzso zzso induced an increase in zzso free zzso in zzso cells and zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells, suggesting that zzso is a functional zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also induced zzso influx in zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, considering previous results that zzso does not enter zzso T cells that expressed human zzso zzso may not support zzso zzso Thus, zzso will be an important tool for functional mapping of zzso entry zzso zzso and for understanding the function of zzso zzso
