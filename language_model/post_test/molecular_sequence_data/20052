zzso receptors are the major zzso receptors in the zzso zzso and have been implicated in a number of zzso and pathological zzso Previous work has shown that zzso zzso function may be modulated by protein zzso A zzso zzso although the molecular mechanism of this zzso has remained zzso We have investigated the zzso of specific zzso acid zzso in the zzso zzso domain of the rat zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso as a possible mechanism for regulation of zzso zzso The zzso tail of rat zzso can be zzso by zzso on zzso zzso as demonstrated using zzso zzso zzso Whole cell recordings of zzso zzso human embryonic kidney zzso zzso cells showed that zzso by zzso zzso whole cell currents in zzso zzso and that removal of the zzso zzso domain zzso this zzso This suggested that the zzso domain may contain zzso involved in the zzso zzso Single zzso of each zzso zzso in the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a zzso after position zzso which removes all zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the domain, do not abolish zzso zzso However, the zzso zzso but no other double zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso of the zzso tail of zzso by zzso leads to zzso of whole cell response, and the combination of zzso and zzso in the zzso domain is a vital component of the mechanism of zzso zzso by zzso
