The zzso zzso domain zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso specifically recognizes DNA strand breaks induced by various zzso agents in zzso This, in turn, triggers the synthesis of zzso of zzso linked to nuclear proteins during DNA zzso The 46 zzso zzso of human zzso and several derivatives zzso zzso in its first or second zzso were zzso in zzso coli, in zzso monkey cells or in human zzso to study their zzso properties, the zzso zzso of resident zzso activity, and the consequences on DNA repair, zzso A positive correlation was found between the in zzso zzso capacity of the zzso zzso zzso and their zzso effect on zzso activity zzso by the zzso agent zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso blocked unscheduled DNA synthesis induced in living cells by zzso treatment, but not that induced by zzso zzso These results define a critical role for the second zzso of zzso for DNA zzso break binding and zzso underscore the importance for zzso to act as a critical regulatory component in the repair of DNA damage induced by zzso zzso
