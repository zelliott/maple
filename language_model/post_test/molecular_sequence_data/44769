We cloned and zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso as a zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso acid sequence deduced from an open reading frame of zzso bases showed zzso identity to that of the zzso zzso zzso and the putative central zzso interaction domain was zzso as well as the zzso zzso zzso The zzso function on the zzso promoter was examined in zzso coli using a combination of a zzso driver zzso and a zzso reporter zzso in which the zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by the zzso was evaluated with the zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso activated the zzso promoter solely under zzso conditions, while the zzso zzso zzso activated it irrespective of the oxygen zzso These observations suggest that oxygen sensitivity is an intrinsic property of the zzso zzso zzso
