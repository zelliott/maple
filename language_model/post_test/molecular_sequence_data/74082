Three natural zzso avian zzso viruses zzso zzso zzso and zzso expressing a zzso A zzso envelope protein and containing long terminal repeats zzso of zzso zzso viruses were isolated from contaminated commercial zzso disease vaccines, zzso and completely zzso Their full zzso were analyzed and compared with representative strains of zzso The zzso DNA of all three zzso displayed zzso identity to each other, suggesting a possible common zzso even though the zzso viruses were obtained from three separate vaccine serials produced by two different vaccine manufacturing zzso The zzso viruses have a genetic organization typical of zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso and zzso are zzso zzso long, and the zzso is three base pairs shorter because of a deletion of a zzso zzso within the zzso coding zzso The zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso region zzso of the zzso gene of all three viruses displayed high identity to zzso counterpart sequences zzso Only the surface zzso region zzso of the zzso gene displayed high identity with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso analysis for zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso in the chicken zzso zzso used to produce the original vaccine zzso identified the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in all three zzso zzso zzso most likely took place to involve the zzso region of the zzso gene because the zzso viruses only differ in this particular region from the consensus zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso zzso probably emerged by zzso of zzso with zzso virus sequences before vaccine zzso
