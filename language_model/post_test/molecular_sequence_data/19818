zzso zzso are generally recognized as attractive drug targets to treat a variety of human zzso Recent analysis of the zzso zzso zzso identified several zzso that are entirely unique to zzso zzso The specific functions and targets of most of these zzso remain largely zzso Here, we have identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that does not cluster with any of the typical zzso protein zzso zzso protein expression was induced approximately 18 h after red blood cell infection, and was mainly localized to the zzso zzso membrane as well as the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso and specifically zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso indicating that it is zzso zzso zzso mapping studies showed that zzso occurred at three zzso zzso zzso and zzso We identified a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso 13 zzso as an zzso zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso at zzso a highly zzso zzso among zzso zzso and suppressed its zzso zzso Our findings not only describe a previously zzso zzso zzso and its likely in zzso target, but also suggest that zzso of zzso activity by zzso may be a common regulatory mechanism in zzso
