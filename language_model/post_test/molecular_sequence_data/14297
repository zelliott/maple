Studies on viral zzso zzso and coat protein folds have revealed the evolutionary lineages of viruses branching to all three zzso of zzso A widespread group of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso was the first to be zzso A double zzso fold for a single major zzso protein is characteristic of these zzso Similar viruses carrying genes coding for two major zzso proteins with a more complex structure, such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso virus zzso have been zzso Here, we studied the host range, life cycle, zzso zzso and zzso sequence of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso virus 2 zzso which resembles zzso despite being isolated from a different zzso Comparative analysis of these viruses revealed that their overall zzso are very similar except that the genes for the zzso recognition zzso complexes are unrelated even though these viruses zzso the same zzso
