zzso play important roles in local population dynamics and genetic zzso However, due to insufficient diagnostic tools, detailed zzso interactions may remain concealed by hidden zzso diversity in natural zzso zzso examination of 19 European lake zzso populations revealed the presence of three groups of zzso zzso zzso and zzso For most of these zzso no genetic markers have been described so zzso Based on sequence similarities of the nuclear zzso and internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso gene regions, one zzso four zzso and nine zzso zzso were discovered in 147 infected zzso zzso three other zzso zzso Additionally, cloning of zzso gene regions revealed zzso sequence variation within host zzso This was most pronounced in the ITS region of one zzso zzso where the zzso sequence variation ranged from zzso to zzso zzso sites for zzso zzso from 14 different geographical zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso from close locations grouped together based on sequence similarities, suggesting that there was zzso zzso Taken together, the data obtained in this study revealed hidden diversity of zzso communities in zzso lake zzso Moreover, a higher level of resolution for identifying zzso strains makes it possible to test new hypotheses with respect to zzso zzso transmission routes, and zzso
