zzso dynamics calculations demonstrated the zzso change in the prion protein due to zzso zzso which is related to zzso disease, one of the familial prion zzso Three kinds of model structures of human and mouse prion proteins were zzso zzso 1) nuclear magnetic resonance structures of human prion protein zzso zzso and mouse prion protein zzso zzso each having a zzso domain consisting of three zzso and an zzso zzso zzso 2) extra peptides including zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso plus the nuclear magnetic resonance structures of model 1; and zzso 3) extra peptides including zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso plus the nuclear magnetic resonance structures of model zzso The results of molecular dynamics calculations indicated that the zzso zzso of models 1 and 2 were stable and that the extra zzso in model 2 tended to form a new zzso On the other hand, the zzso domain of model 3 was zzso and the zzso region increased especially in zzso
