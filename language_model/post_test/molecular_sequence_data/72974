zzso zzso channels are the main zzso neurotransmitter receptors in the zzso zzso zzso among members of previously described zzso zzso zzso were used to design zzso sense and zzso zzso A zzso product from this amplification was used to isolate a full-length zzso The predicted protein has many of the features shared by other members of the zzso zzso channel zzso This channel zzso has significant zzso acid identity zzso with members of zzso and zzso zzso zzso and thus may represent a new zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Although we cannot rule out that this clone encodes a zzso for an unidentified zzso it was termed zzso zzso This gene is mainly expressed in zzso and in zzso however, zzso appears to express only an zzso zzso In zzso zzso reveals that the zzso zzso zzso zzso is present in the electrical zzso system of the human zzso Our results suggest that novel zzso receptors expressed outside of the zzso may regulate cardiac zzso
