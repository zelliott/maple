zzso zzso zzso factors play important roles in immunity and development in zzso and zzso Their activity is regulated by their cellular zzso zzso and zzso and association with other factors on their target gene zzso zzso from zzso zzso is a member of the zzso family and a close zzso of the zzso zzso which establishes zzso polarity in the zzso zzso 

We present the crystal structure of the zzso specificity domain of zzso bound to zzso This first structure of an insect zzso zzso complex shows that zzso binds a zzso zzso element using a stack of three zzso zzso zzso in affinity to zzso binding sites in target gene promoters are predicted to arise from base changes in these zzso zzso An zzso that is zzso in class II zzso proteins zzso of which contain a zzso zzso zzso contacts the zzso zzso of the DNA zzso This previously unseen specific contact contributes strongly to the zzso affinity and might be responsible for differences in specificity between zzso proteins of class I and zzso 

The zzso complex structure illustrates how differences in zzso affinity to binding sites in zzso gene promoters are zzso zzso with other zzso complex structures leads to a general model for DNA recognition by zzso zzso
