zzso zzso zzso zzso is a bone zzso failure syndrome caused by zzso in the zzso gene located at zzso By 20 years of age, most affected boys develop bone zzso failure, whereas female carriers show a skewed pattern of zzso zzso The gene product, zzso is zzso to a zzso protein involved in zzso zzso zzso providing a unique insight into a cause of zzso zzso Whereas most zzso zzso are single zzso acid zzso and nonsense or zzso zzso have not been observed, we present here a case of DC caused by a zzso deletion that removes the last zzso of the zzso zzso levels of zzso are produced from the deleted zzso with the transcripts using a cryptic zzso site in the zzso strand of the adjacent zzso zzso normally located 1 zzso downstream of zzso in a tail to tail zzso The predicted truncated protein lacks a zzso zzso that is less zzso than the rest of the zzso zzso and is zzso in zzso supporting the contention that it may retain some activity and that zzso zzso at this locus may be zzso The affected boy had an unaffected brother with the same zzso around the zzso gene and a sister who was zzso for the zzso We conclude therefore that the mother must be a zzso mosaic with respect to this zzso Investigation of her blood cells and other zzso zzso showed that a small proportion of these cells also carried the zzso making her a zzso mosaic and indicating that the deletion took place early in zzso
