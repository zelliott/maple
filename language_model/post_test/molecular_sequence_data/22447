zzso gene zzso affecting zzso head and tail zzso are not usually associated with prominent skin blistering and zzso filament zzso Instead, they have been associated with several distinct clinical zzso such as zzso zzso zzso with zzso pigmentation zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with migratory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the V2 domain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in the V2 domain of zzso 1 zzso We have studied a family with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso plaques over the zzso and in zzso and identified a new zzso gene zzso that is predicted to completely alter the zzso tail zzso In addition, a new zzso size zzso has been zzso which is especially prevalent among the African-American zzso These results further emphasize the functional importance of the zzso tail domain in zzso molecules despite the obvious zzso in the number of zzso loop motifs and underscore the broad zzso spectrum of disorders due to dominant zzso tail zzso
