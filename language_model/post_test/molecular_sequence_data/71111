zzso are members of the transforming growth zzso family of growth and differentiation zzso In this paper, we report the results of a zzso analysis of zzso zzso The primary targets for directed zzso were charged, individual zzso acids located in accessible zzso of the zzso concentrating on those that differ from transforming growth zzso the zzso crystal structure of which is zzso Based on the activities of the zzso zzso zzso in two zzso 4 out of 39 zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced in a zzso virus system were selected for further zzso After production in insect cells and zzso of these four zzso to zzso they were studied in zzso and in zzso experiments involving zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has a zzso higher specific zzso and binding affinity to an zzso zzso zzso complex than wild type zzso whereas zzso zzso had no zzso biological activity and did not bind to any of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and wild type zzso bound to all the zzso zzso combinations tested and were zzso in zzso Our results with the zzso zzso indicate that the positive charge of zzso acid 102 is important for biological activity and type II zzso binding of zzso
