Heat shock proteins zzso in the size range of zzso 60,000 are major targets of the immune response in zzso The zzso zzso proteins of zzso zzso are expressed at relatively high levels in infected zzso zzso and zzso 1993, 61, zzso and may be important targets of the host zzso To facilitate further studies concerned with these zzso the zzso gene of zzso major was zzso zzso and zzso A zzso zzso major zzso library was screened with a zzso DNA probe derived from a highly zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso A single clone that zzso strongly was zzso zzso analysis revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso of zzso zzso acids with a predicted size of zzso zzso and with the highest degree of zzso acid sequence similarity zzso to zzso from zzso zzso Less extensive zzso acid sequence similarity zzso was observed between that zzso zzso and the corresponding human zzso zzso significant regions of sequence zzso between the zzso and human proteins were identified principally within the zzso regions of the zzso The entire coding region of the zzso zzso gene was zzso into the zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was used to examine zzso from patients with zzso zzso from Colombia for the presence of zzso to zzso Unlike zzso from healthy, zzso controls, zzso from patients reacted strongly with zzso zzso zzso This recognition had specificity in that these same zzso showed little or no zzso with either zzso zzso zzso or zzso human zzso These findings indicate that patients with zzso forms of zzso have zzso responses to zzso zzso Further studies of this protein will clarify its importance as a target of the immune response and as a potential zzso for zzso
