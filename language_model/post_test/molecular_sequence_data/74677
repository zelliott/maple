The widespread use of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as dry cleaning zzso and zzso agents for military and industrial applications has resulted in significant environmental contamination zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso through reductive zzso frequently lead to the zzso of zzso zzso thus limiting the use of reductive zzso for the zzso of the zzso In this study, seven bacteria indigenous to contaminated sites in Africa were characterized for zzso degradation under zzso zzso The specific growth rate zzso of the bacterial zzso ranged between zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Gas zzso analysis revealed that up to zzso of the compounds were zzso within seven days with the degradation rate zzso ranging between zzso and zzso zzso The two compounds were also observed to be significantly zzso zzso rather than zzso when present as a zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequences of the bacterial zzso revealed their identity as well as their relation to other zzso zzso The observed zzso of zzso may contribute to zzso and zzso removal at the zzso fringe of groundwater zzso undergoing reductive zzso in contaminated zzso
