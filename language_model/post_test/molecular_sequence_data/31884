zzso of zzso including, alternative zzso zzso zzso transport and translation regulation are crucial to zzso gene zzso For example, zzso of the genes in the human zzso are known to undergo alternative zzso thereby expanding the zzso production capacity of a limited number of zzso Similarly, zzso export and translation regulation plays a vital role in regulating protein zzso Thus, it is important to understand how these zzso binding proteins including alternative zzso factors zzso and zzso transport and translation factors regulate these zzso Here we report the expression of an zzso zzso rich zzso factor 10 zzso and a zzso translation regulation factor, zzso zzso like family member 4 zzso in the developing mouse zzso zzso was expressed throughout zzso zzso retinal development and was observed progressively in newly zzso zzso zzso zzso showed zzso in retinal zzso cells zzso at zzso followed by zzso and bipolar cells, and at zzso it was enriched in zzso cone zzso zzso By zzso zzso was observed in rod zzso in a zzso zzso Like zzso zzso expression was also observed in the developing zzso but with two distinct retinal zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed progressive expression of zzso in zzso zzso which was confirmed by IF that showed a dynamic shift in zzso zzso Early in development zzso expression was restricted to the zzso of newly zzso zzso and later zzso zzso it was observed in the initial segments of zzso zzso Later, during zzso development, zzso was observed in zzso and bipolar cells, but here it was predominantly zzso and enriched in the two synaptic zzso Specifically, at zzso zzso was observed in the synaptic zzso of rod bipolar cells marked by zzso Thus, zzso might be regulating AS early in development besides its known role of regulating zzso zzso In all, our data suggests an important role for AS and zzso zzso in retinal zzso zzso
