A zzso zzso has been used to isolate zzso promoters from zzso zzso The virus contains a zzso gene zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of the 3' long terminal repeat zzso When the virus is zzso zzso of zzso places his sequences just 30 zzso from the adjacent cellular zzso As a result, selection for zzso resistance generates cell clones in which his is expressed on transcripts initiating in the zzso cellular zzso zzso cellular zzso cloned after amplification by zzso chain reaction, zzso to zzso from zzso cells, indicating that the adjacent promoters were zzso active prior to virus zzso Two cloned transcribed zzso sequences also contained highly active zzso zzso as estimated by their ability to activate expression of a linked reporter zzso Thus, zzso zzso provide a rapid and efficient means to isolate promoters active in different cell zzso Moreover, by selecting for cell clones containing zzso integrated in expressed zzso the virus may make an effective zzso zzso
