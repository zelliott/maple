zzso acid sequencing of an internal zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein zzso demonstrates high similarity to the corresponding sequence of zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we show that zzso was zzso with zzso and zzso zzso binding zzso By zzso labeling with zzso a zzso site in the zzso was estimated to reside in zzso acid zzso zzso which is distinct from the active site of the zzso but present in the zzso binding zzso The zzso acid sequences deduced from the two isolated zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso identical to each other and very similar to those of zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso proteins exhibit both zzso binding activity and zzso activity converting retinal to zzso acid zzso which are similar to those of zzso The zzso were present abundantly in kidney and zzso of adult female zzso Interestingly, their zzso binding activities were inhibited by zzso and zzso but not by zzso and zzso whereas zzso was required for their zzso zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso is identical to zzso and suggest that this protein might zzso zzso synthesis and zzso level of free zzso
