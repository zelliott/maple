zzso is a member of the zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso clusters receptors and zzso channels at specific sites in the zzso membrane and organizes downstream signaling and zzso zzso We have determined the crystal structures of the zzso and zzso forms to zzso and zzso A resolutions, respectively, of a zzso containing the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso We observe an zzso interaction between the zzso and zzso zzso involving the formation of a beta sheet including zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso Based on zzso acid conservation and zzso data available in the literature, we propose that this zzso interaction is a common feature among zzso zzso
