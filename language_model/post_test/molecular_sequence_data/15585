The zzso of zzso zzso the zzso zzso responsible for zzso disease zzso was analyzed using two complementary zzso zzso coupled with zzso and zzso with zzso This strategy led to the identification of 206 proteins of zzso predicted zzso resolving some questions raised by the zzso sequence of this zzso We successfully identified zzso targets and proteins with predicted zzso signal zzso Additionally, we identified a family of surface proteins zzso as zzso zzso surface proteins zzso which are zzso by a unique group of zzso genes and serve as both coding regions and DNA repeats that promote zzso zzso zzso of the protein expression profiles of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with other zzso zzso zzso and environmental bacteria revealed that zzso zzso shares a zzso expression profile with other zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso this study describes the global protein expression pattern of zzso zzso and reveals some specific features of the zzso zzso zzso
