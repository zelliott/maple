The human zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso is flanked by a repeated sequence zzso that is required for zzso zzso The first 57 zzso of R form a stable zzso structure called the zzso response element zzso that can interact with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to promote high levels of gene zzso Recently, we demonstrated that zzso is also important for efficient zzso reverse transcription, since zzso zzso in the upper zzso of zzso showed a reduced ability both to initiate and to complete reverse zzso We have analyzed a series of zzso zzso viruses to better defined the structural or sequence elements required for natural zzso reverse zzso and packaging of zzso zzso Our results indicate that the requirement for zzso in reverse zzso is zzso dependent, since zzso with zzso that alter the upper zzso orientation are defective for reverse zzso initiation and have minor defects in zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso that allowed the formation of alternative upper zzso structure greatly reduced zzso packaging but did not affect reverse zzso zzso These results are consistent with direct involvement of the upper zzso structure in packaging of zzso zzso and suggest that the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso to zzso interacts with other components of the reverse zzso initiation complex to promote efficient reverse zzso
