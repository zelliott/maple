Two strains of zzso zzso bacteria, designated zzso zzso zzso type zzso and zzso were isolated from bacterial mats in two separate hot springs in zzso These new zzso were zzso similar to zzso zzso in some zzso They were zzso zzso zzso bacteria that grew well at 55 degrees C either zzso as zzso or zzso as zzso They exhibited gliding zzso produced zzso a and zzso contained zzso and required zzso and zzso acid as growth zzso However, zzso zzso and zzso had the ability to rapidly form zzso dense zzso of zzso an ability which has not been observed in any zzso zzso zzso zzso source zzso tests revealed that unlike zzso zzso the new zzso did not zzso zzso zzso ethanol, or zzso An analysis of the zzso components revealed that zzso zzso and zzso contained mainly zzso and zzso zzso fatty acid zzso These zzso also contained only trace amounts of zzso which is a major zzso component zzso of the total zzso in zzso zzso The results of DNA zzso studies suggested that the new strains were genetically distinct from zzso zzso zzso of zzso 9 to zzso and zzso zzso sequence comparisons showed that strain zzso was related to zzso zzso at a similarity level of zzso On the basis of our data, we propose that a new zzso species should be created for our new zzso the name of this new species is zzso zzso and the type strain is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
