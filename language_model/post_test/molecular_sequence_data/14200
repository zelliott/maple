zzso N zzso as zzso expressed membrane zzso exerts important functions in diverse cellular zzso such as zzso migration and zzso Previously, a role of zzso in the zzso of melanoma cells has been demonstrated, but the underlying molecular mechanisms controlling zzso expression are not zzso The present study demonstrates that lack of zzso expression in primary and established melanoma cells was directly associated with a high-grade DNA zzso status of the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso not only induced zzso and zzso zzso protein expression but also resulted in an increased zzso migration of melanoma zzso Furthermore, its zzso expression was zzso correlated to the expression of zzso marker proteins in established as well as in short-term cultured human melanoma zzso zzso of tissue zzso generated from a large series of melanoma samples and control zzso demonstrated a higher zzso expression in primary melanoma zzso when compared with zzso and zzso which was neither associated with zzso parameters nor with the patients' zzso Thus, the zzso zzso expression pattern in melanoma cells is zzso controlled and directly associated with an altered migration capacity but not of clinical significance in our study zzso
