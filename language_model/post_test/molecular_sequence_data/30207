zzso at the mouse zzso locus lead to intrinsic defects in stem cells of the zzso zzso and germ cell zzso W zzso vary in the overall severity of zzso that they zzso and some zzso exhibit an independence of zzso zzso To zzso the molecular basis for these biological differences, we analyzed the zzso locus and the zzso zzso activities in five different W zzso representative of a range of W zzso zzso cell cultures derived from mice or zzso zzso for each W zzso were deficient in zzso zzso activity, the extent of which paralleled the severity of zzso zzso by a given W zzso both in zzso and in an in zzso mast cell zzso zzso The mildly dominant, zzso viable zzso zzso and zzso were found to express reduced levels of an apparently normal zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso defects zzso by the moderately dominant, zzso viable zzso zzso or zzso or the zzso lethal zzso zzso were attributed to zzso zzso within the zzso domain of the zzso zzso which result in point zzso of zzso acid zzso highly zzso in the family of protein zzso zzso The nature and location of these zzso acid zzso account for the relative severity of zzso zzso by these W zzso and demonstrate that the zzso zzso defects associated with the zzso locus arise as the result of dominant zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso
