The zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was shown to produce zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The culture conditions for zzso production were zzso with respect to zzso temperature, zzso and inexpensive zzso waste as zzso zzso yield was enhanced more than four fold in the presence of zzso corn zzso and zzso zzso or feather hydrolysate at pH 11 and zzso zzso was zzso to zzso with zzso yield by using traditional zzso methods whereas the same zzso zzso to zzso with zzso yield by using corn zzso as zzso Its molecular mass was estimated to be zzso by zzso The zzso had zzso activity at pH 11 and zzso The zzso was active over broad range, zzso sodium zzso The zzso was zzso retaining zzso of the original activity at zzso for zzso The apparent K zzso values for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso The deduced internal zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso resembled the sequence of zzso which is member of zzso zzso family zzso
