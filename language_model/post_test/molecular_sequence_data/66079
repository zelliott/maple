The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso constitutes a key target of zzso therapies and zzso zzso zzso zzso actively zzso zzso acids along the terminal zzso via zzso zzso Previously, TM zzso zzso 7 was identified as part of the putative zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso accessibility zzso In the present study, zzso was extended through zzso zzso loop 3; zzso zzso that leads into zzso from the zzso zzso zzso of most zzso zzso was significantly hampered upon zzso zzso whereas ten (out of 31) were functionally inactive zzso zzso Since only zzso lacked plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso acids predominantly fulfill critical functional roles during zzso zzso charged zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso produced mostly similar zzso profiles wherein only middle and descending loop segments zzso zzso displayed significant zzso zzso The presence of zzso acid zzso significantly reduced the rates of zzso modification for all zzso zzso suggesting a functional association between zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso assessments at zzso zzso revealed numerous zzso zzso possibly performing auxiliary functions during transport such as zzso of protein zzso changes during zzso zzso of these data suggests zzso interaction points along zzso via zzso interactions with zzso zzso and probably zzso and a potential zzso interaction with zzso We conclude that zzso zzso acids are essential for zzso activity, probably as primary zzso interaction points using long-range zzso attractive zzso
