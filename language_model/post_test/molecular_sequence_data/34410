In budding zzso the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso recognition zzso binds to a zzso sequence consisting of an 11 zzso zzso element and an adjacent B1 zzso However, the zzso contains many more matches to this consensus than actually bind zzso or function as origins in zzso Although zzso loading of the zzso zzso zzso at origins is enhanced by a zzso B2 element, less is known about this zzso Here, we analyzed four highly active origins zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso scanning zzso and found that sequences adjacent to the zzso contributed substantially to origin activity and zzso zzso Using the sequences of four additional B2 elements we generated a B2 multiple sequence alignment and identified a shared, zzso 8 zzso sequence that was enriched within zzso known zzso In addition, our high-resolution analysis revealed that not all origins exist within zzso free zzso a class of zzso origins has a zzso positioned zzso overlapping or near zzso This study illustrates the zzso yet flexible nature of zzso origin architecture to promote zzso binding and origin activity, and helps explain why a strong match to the zzso binding site is insufficient to identify origins within the zzso
