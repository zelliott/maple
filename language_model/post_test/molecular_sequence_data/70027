DNA coding for the zzso zzso of six strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was directly amplified from zzso host cells using the zzso chain zzso The amplification product was zzso using a zzso procedure and compared with other published zzso zzso zzso The results of this analysis confirm the position of zzso zzso in the gamma zzso of the zzso The data show that all of the zzso zzso strains are highly related zzso zzso on the basis of zzso zzso sequences although they had different geographic origins and zzso zzso The data support a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with only one species which is zzso zzso
