We recently reported the presence of four genes lying between the human zzso gene cluster and the zzso of the short arm of zzso 16 zzso We now report that one of these genes encodes zzso DNA zzso an zzso important in the repair of DNA after damage by zzso zzso The gene comprises five zzso representation of which differs in independently isolated zzso zzso Although the gene is widely zzso the abundance of its zzso is considerably higher in a colon zzso cell line zzso than in other cell lines that were zzso The major positive zzso regulatory element controlling zzso gene expression lies zzso between the promoters of the zzso genes and the zzso DNA zzso zzso Interestingly, in contrast to the zzso zzso expression of the zzso DNA zzso gene is not influenced by the regulatory element in the human zzso cell line zzso
