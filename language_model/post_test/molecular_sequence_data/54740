zzso zzso is an extreme zzso zzso belonging to the zzso domain that was isolated from the Santa zzso solar zzso zzso zzso in zzso The zzso of the proteins involved in nitrogen metabolism is being zzso but the knowledge of their regulation is very scarce at zzso The zzso zzso is constituted by major regulators of nitrogen zzso which are widespread in zzso and zzso zzso These zzso proteins zzso per zzso have in zzso coli long been known to regulate zzso zzso zzso activity via its zzso zzso and, more recently, to be able to interact directly with this zzso in zzso zzso We have tested the possible role of zzso proteins in the regulation of ammonium zzso in our model zzso and the results clearly indicate that the direct influence of zzso by zzso proteins can also take place in zzso zzso starting with the comprehension of nitrogen regulation in those zzso
