Using zzso and a reducing agent such as zzso type 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso both of which are zzso units for the zzso of highly diverse zzso zzso Although the zzso zzso is expected to be zzso involved in zzso its exact role remains zzso Here we report the crystal structures of the zzso and complex forms of type 2 zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso not only in the oxidized state but also in the reduced zzso Based on the zzso structures of the reduced zzso zzso complexes, which are in the active state, and on the data from zzso zzso at highly zzso charged or polar zzso acid zzso around the active site, we demonstrate that only reduced zzso not zzso acid zzso can catalyze zzso zzso required for the zzso zzso This discovery is the first evidence for this long suspected, but previously zzso role of zzso just as a general zzso catalyst without playing any zzso roles, and thereby expands the known functions of these versatile zzso
