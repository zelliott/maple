A zzso complex of human zzso B and zzso zzso has been zzso in a zzso crystal zzso Data to zzso A resolution were collected using the area detector zzso zzso The crystal structure of the complex has been solved by Patterson search techniques using zzso as search zzso Starting from the structure of chicken zzso the zzso structure was zzso through cycles of model building and zzso zzso The current zzso R factor is zzso Like zzso the zzso zzso consists of a five stranded zzso wrapped around a five turn zzso but with an additional zzso terminal strand running along the convex side of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso reveal the previous sequence alignment to be incorrect in part, through deletion of the intermediate zzso The zzso zzso form a zzso wedge, which slots into the zzso active site as proposed through consideration of the zzso structures of the individual components zzso et zzso zzso The main interactions are provided by the zzso terminal zzso zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso and by the first hairpin loop, containing the highly zzso zzso zzso with minor contributions from the second hairpin zzso The zzso zzso of zzso provides an additional interaction region with respect to zzso The interaction is dominated by zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso is fundamentally different to that observed for the zzso zzso zzso
