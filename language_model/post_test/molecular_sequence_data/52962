We have discovered a role for zzso binding to the zzso surface of the vitamin D zzso zzso in its negative effects on gene zzso We tested nine zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in human zzso which, based on zzso to the human zzso hormone zzso would be predicted to lie in or near the zzso zzso zzso of six of these zzso in zzso resulted in loss of both the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso with an zzso zzso functions of the zzso when tested in cultured zzso rat zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso these zzso also suppressed association of zzso with the zzso zzso and steroid zzso zzso 1 in zzso but had little or no effect on zzso zzso zzso with the zzso X zzso or association with a zzso DNA recognition zzso zzso with zzso or steroid zzso zzso 1 amplified both the positive and negative responses to wild type zzso but had little or no effect on the functionally impaired zzso described zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso proved to be heavily dependent upon the integrity of nuclear box III in the latter zzso zzso in this region of zzso impaired its ability to associate with zzso in zzso and to amplify zzso activity in intact zzso These studies establish a role for zzso recruited to the same zzso surface in both the zzso and zzso activity of the zzso zzso
