It has been shown for a Shaker channel zzso that its zzso zzso domain may form a zzso and zzso structure, with the zzso zzso the zzso to the channel while the zzso capable of binding to the channel in its open state and causing zzso zzso structures have not been identified in zzso Shaker zzso We studied the functional role of the zzso region of a zzso zzso K channel, zzso zzso by deleting different zzso in this region and examining the zzso changes in channel properties at whole cell and single channel zzso zzso the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso or the subsequent positive charges zzso I) from zzso greatly slowed the zzso of whole cell zzso suggesting the existence of a zzso structure in zzso similar to that in the Shaker zzso The function of the ball appeared to be abolished by deleting domain A, while modified but maintained by deleting domain zzso In the latter case, the data suggest that the positive charges needed for the function of the ball can be replaced by zzso acids from a following region zzso zzso that has a high positive charge zzso zzso multiple zzso from the zzso zzso of zzso corresponding to the chain in Shaker zzso did not induce expected changes in channel properties that might result from a zzso of a zzso A comparison of single channel zzso of selected zzso channels with those of the zzso channel indicated that these deletion zzso slowed whole cell currents by zzso burst zzso and by increasing the probability of reopening during zzso There were no changes in single channel current zzso or zzso to first zzso In conclusion, our observations indicate that the zzso mechanism of zzso is similar to that of Shaker zzso in that a positively charged zzso domain is important for such a zzso The zzso domain is not involved in channel zzso or zzso zzso zzso
