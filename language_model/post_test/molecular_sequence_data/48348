The zzso region of the zzso Y zzso zzso contains clusters of genes essential for male zzso The highly repetitive and degenerative nature of the Y zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Although the Y zzso sequence is available for the human, zzso and macaque, little is known about the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Here, we investigated the zzso of the zzso in cattle by direct zzso zzso selection and zzso zzso The bovine zzso differs radically from the zzso Y zzso with respect to its structure, gene content, and zzso Among the 28 zzso zzso identified on the bovine zzso (12 zzso and 16 zzso zzso 16 are zzso zzso The zzso genes identified in this study made the bovine zzso gene density the highest in the zzso in comparison, zzso zzso have only zzso zzso Our results, along with the highly zzso activities observed from these zzso genes and 375 additional zzso zzso challenge the widely accepted hypothesis that the zzso is gene poor and zzso zzso The bovine zzso genes are predominantly expressed and are zzso regulated during the zzso zzso zzso substitution rate analyses of the zzso zzso genes indicated that two major periods of expansion occurred during the zzso and zzso contributing to the zzso radiation of zzso The massive amplification and vigorous zzso suggest that the zzso serves as a zzso niche regulating male reproduction during zzso zzso
