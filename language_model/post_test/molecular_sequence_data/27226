The pharmacological effects of zzso and zzso drugs are zzso primarily through the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that differential use of an zzso zzso start zzso in the zzso region of the zzso generates different zzso products in zzso and in zzso The zzso of the zzso gene is necessary for initiating the alternate form and for subsequent degradation of the zzso zzso of zzso at the upstream site decreases the initiation at the main zzso zzso However, alternative initiation of the long form of zzso produces a protein with a short zzso resulting from degradation zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and degradation zzso showed that zzso of this long form at the second and third zzso reduce zzso zzso degradation, stabilizing the zzso The data suggest that zzso expression is controlled in part by initiation of the long form of zzso at the alternate zzso
