Recent studies show that the timeless zzso gene is not an essential component of the zzso clock in some zzso In the present study, we have investigated whether the zzso gene was originally involved in the insect clock or acquired as a clock component later during the course of evolution using an zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso of the clock gene zzso zzso was zzso and its structural analysis showed that zzso includes 4 defined functional zzso that is, 2 regions for zzso with zzso zzso zzso nuclear zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso domain zzso like zzso zzso zzso exhibited rhythmic expression in its zzso levels with a peak during late day to early night in zzso and the rhythm persisted in zzso A single injection of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso into the abdomen of adult zzso effectively knocked down zzso levels of zzso and abolished its rhythmic zzso Most zzso zzso lost their zzso locomotor rhythm in zzso up to 30 days after zzso zzso of cycle zzso and Clock genes also abolished the rhythmic expression of zzso zzso by knocking down zzso zzso to its zzso level of intact zzso suggesting that the underlying molecular clock of zzso resembles that of zzso Interestingly, however, zzso also reduced zzso zzso to its zzso level of intact animals and eliminated its rhythmic zzso suggesting the involvement of zzso in the regulation of zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is an essential component of the zzso clock of the primitive insect zzso zzso thus, it might have been involved in the clock machinery from a very early stage of insect evolution, but its role might be different from that in zzso
