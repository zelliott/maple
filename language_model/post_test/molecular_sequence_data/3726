The upper respiratory zzso including the zzso and oral zzso is the major route of entry of pathogens into the body, and early recognition of bacterial products in this region is critical for host zzso A well-established family of four proteins involved in this process are zzso protein zzso and zzso protein zzso which are central to the host zzso against bacteria, and zzso zzso transfer protein zzso and zzso transfer protein zzso which have also been implicated in this zzso In this paper, we demonstrate the existence of a related family of seven human zzso which we designate zzso zzso The zzso proteins are zzso by adjacent genes found within a 300 zzso region of zzso 20, suggesting that they may be under zzso control of shared zzso zzso and expression data shows that these proteins are found in overlapping regions of the zzso zzso and oral zzso sites where the previously described zzso family members are not zzso Whereas the zzso family are predicted to share very closely similar three-dimensional structures, the zzso family is predicted to have much greater zzso in the zzso domain, corresponding to the active domain of zzso thus creating the notion of a zzso structural zzso We suggest that members of the zzso family may function in the innate immune response in regions of the mouth, nose and zzso which are sites of significant bacterial zzso
