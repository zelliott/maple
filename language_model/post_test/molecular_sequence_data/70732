We describe a novel zzso zzso zzso that was identified after a comparison of DNA and zzso typing revealed a zzso in the zzso zzso zzso was defined by zzso but was not detected by the zzso chain reaction using zzso zzso zzso DNA sequencing indicated the presence of a zzso zzso zzso that differed from zzso by a single base zzso at position zzso This base substitution corresponded to the zzso site of a primer common to the two zzso zzso zzso used in the zzso This provides an explanation for the results and highlights a limitation of zzso methods even where two zzso zzso are used to detect zzso zzso zzso studies suggested that zzso zzso and zzso are unlikely to be differentiated during routine zzso zzso
