zzso in DNA zzso pattern influence gene expression for certain zzso genes in development, zzso zzso and zzso zzso of DNA zzso at the promoter region, which generally zzso zzso activity, is one important element in studying changes in molecular expression with aging and zzso zzso zzso zzso sequencing is a useful method for mapping zzso zzso However, zzso amplification for zzso DNA does not yield a sufficient amount of products that have a sufficient level of zzso especially in the zzso sequences usually seen at the promoter regions of house keeping zzso We present a method for increasing the sensitivity and specificity of zzso amplification in zzso zzso mapping in an extremely zzso promoter region of zzso precursor protein zzso gene from the cerebral zzso of human autopsy zzso The zzso used consists of two cycles using the lower primer alone to amplify the sense zzso and then eight cycles at a theoretical zzso temperature zzso degrees zzso and 30 cycles at a lower zzso temperature zzso degrees zzso using both the upper and lower zzso The present method likely can also be applied to other zzso zzso zzso
