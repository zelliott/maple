zzso zzso F1 zzso zzso zzso by an zzso zzso through zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso the conversion of zzso to zzso is located just upstream of the zzso zzso which encodes the further zzso of zzso and is located, in turn, upstream of the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The sequences of an zzso DNA segment carrying the zzso zzso and a zzso DNA segment completing the sequence of the zzso DNA segment separating the zzso and zzso zzso have been determined and are discussed zzso The zzso zzso contains six genes in the order zzso The gene products have been identified both by functional zzso and by comparing deduced zzso acid sequences to published zzso Thus, zzso and zzso zzso the two components of zzso zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso encodes zzso alcohol zzso zzso encodes zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a putative outer membrane protein related to gene products of other aromatic hydrocarbon zzso zzso but having an unknown function in zzso zzso and zzso encodes an zzso zzso A zzso whose role in this zzso is also zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is a regulatory zzso zzso By using zzso bacteria carrying either the zzso region of the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso upstream of genes zzso readily zzso zzso in the presence or absence of zzso it was demonstrated that zzso encodes a zzso which controls expression of both the zzso and zzso zzso and is zzso by zzso but not zzso Short (less than 350 zzso zzso DNA segments that are located upstream of zzso and between the zzso and zzso zzso may have been involved in zzso events that led to the current arrangement of zzso zzso and zzso genes in zzso zzso zzso
