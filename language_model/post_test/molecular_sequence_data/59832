zzso analysis of the zzso promoter zzso of the zzso fungus zzso zzso was carried out using the zzso coli zzso gene as a zzso An zzso based on zzso on solid medium in zzso plates was developed that allows rapid and reliable zzso analysis of zzso expression of a large number of zzso A series of deletions and specifically designed zzso were made covering zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of sequences upstream of zzso zzso in relation to the zzso zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso of a single zzso sequence zzso at zzso zzso was sufficient for zzso This site is similar to the binding sites of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso site did not affect zzso zzso zzso induction of the promoter was retained even in deletion derivatives lacking sequences upstream of position zzso which retained about 70 zzso upstream of the zzso start point and only 30 zzso upstream of the zzso zzso
