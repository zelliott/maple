zzso zzso at the dilute unconventional zzso heavy chain locus cause diluted coat color, zzso seizures, and zzso The dilute coat color zzso is caused by irregular zzso of zzso in the hair, but amounts of zzso are unchanged from zzso zzso The zzso zzso has been described as zzso since hair bulb and zzso zzso zzso appear to be rounded in tissue zzso These observations do not exclude the possibility that the processes lack zzso since the zzso shape was judged by the distribution of zzso We have tested this hypothesis by zzso primary zzso from dilute zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso do not lack zzso instead, they exhibit a concentrated zzso distribution of zzso while zzso zzso have a very uniform zzso distribution of zzso zzso zzso show no zzso differences in zzso zzso or maturation between dilute and zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that the dilute protein is concentrated in regions of the zzso that contain zzso These experiments show that the dilute zzso is necessary for the zzso of zzso either by active transport or zzso
