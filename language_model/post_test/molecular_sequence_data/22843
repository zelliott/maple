Conventional zzso is a ubiquitous zzso zzso that moves cargo toward the zzso of zzso In addition, several in zzso studies indicated a role of conventional zzso in zzso and sliding zzso but in zzso evidence for such a role is zzso In this study, we show that conventional zzso mediates zzso interactions in the model fungus zzso zzso Live cell imaging and zzso analysis of various zzso in zzso revealed that this zzso motor is required for efficient zzso bundling and zzso in zzso zzso in zzso High levels of zzso led to increased zzso bending, whereas a zzso in the motor head suppressed all zzso zzso and promoted strong zzso zzso indicating that zzso can form zzso between zzso in living zzso This effect required a zzso region in the C zzso of zzso which was shown to bind zzso in zzso In addition, a fusion protein of yellow fluorescent protein and the zzso localized to zzso zzso further supporting the idea that a zzso zzso binding activity in the tail of conventional zzso mediates zzso interactions in zzso
