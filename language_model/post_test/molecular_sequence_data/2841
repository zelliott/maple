A human zzso zzso expression zzso library was zzso for zzso zzso by a combination of zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and plaque zzso using a mouse zzso A chain zzso A total of 36 zzso clones were isolated and zzso Northern zzso zzso with zzso isolated from cultured human skin zzso revealed zzso either to zzso a single 10 zzso transcript consistent with A zzso zzso a single zzso zzso transcript consistent with B1 zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso transcripts consistent with B2 chain of human zzso zzso sequencing of representative zzso clones zzso zzso zzso in zzso confirmed that these three groups of zzso zzso zzso sequences of zzso A, B1 and B2 zzso zzso zzso zzso acid sequences for both B1 and B2 chains contained zzso growth zzso sequences and zzso zzso repeats, as found previously for mouse zzso zzso zzso A chain zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso characterized by several internal zzso This portion of the zzso accounted for a large part of the zzso domain zzso zzso the whole length of a second zzso and portions of a third zzso zzso zzso The human A chain also contained an zzso zzso a potential zzso site, which is not found in the same segment of mouse zzso The newly isolated zzso were also zzso to analyze expression of zzso zzso by cultured human cells and zzso The results demonstrated that the zzso A, zzso and B2 chain genes were expressed in an zzso manner in both cultured cells and zzso with a particularly low level of the A chain zzso being zzso
