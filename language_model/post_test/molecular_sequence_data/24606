zzso of the zzso expressed sequence tag zzso data base with varied human zzso zzso identified two truncated zzso that subsequently were found to zzso overlapping portions of a novel human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso family member 22 zzso The zzso zzso gene resides on zzso zzso within a zzso complex of zzso zzso zzso Although at least 7 of the 14 genes in this complex zzso zzso active zzso only one zzso zzso gene was zzso The trachea and esophagus were found to contain the highest zzso levels of the zzso zzso transcript in adult zzso Although the zzso zzso transcript was scarce in adult human zzso it was present in abundance in fetal zzso Thus, the zzso zzso gene is expressed in the airways in a zzso regulated manner that is different from that of other human zzso zzso At the cellular level, zzso zzso is a major product of normal pulmonary zzso cells, as well as varied transformed zzso cell zzso zzso active zzso zzso is also zzso zzso from these zzso The zzso acid sequence of human zzso zzso is zzso identical to those of human zzso zzso zzso beta I, zzso beta II, zzso beta III, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Nevertheless, comparative protein structure modeling and functional studies using zzso material revealed that zzso zzso has a zzso preference distinct from that of its other family zzso These data indicate that the products of the zzso zzso complex of zzso genes evolved to carry out varied functions in zzso
