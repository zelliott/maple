Human milk zzso zzso zzso ensures efficient zzso of zzso by zzso zzso Cloning and sequencing of zzso have revealed that the zzso chain consists of zzso zzso acid zzso showing only little zzso to typical zzso The sequence is identical to that of pancreatic zzso zzso The zzso part contains 16 zzso repeats of 11 zzso with zzso zzso The only zzso sugar chain is situated close to the zzso zzso Using zzso cells and a bovine zzso virus zzso high and stable expression of full-length zzso and of several zzso obtained by zzso zzso was zzso The produced proteins were zzso and further zzso zzso lacking all, or all but two, repeats were active with similar specific activity and the same zzso salt dependence as the native milk zzso zzso the zzso necessary for zzso gave the same principal zzso Active zzso full-length zzso was also produced in a bacterial zzso We conclude that neither zzso zzso or zzso nor the zzso repeats are essential for zzso activity or zzso salt zzso of human milk zzso zzso zzso
