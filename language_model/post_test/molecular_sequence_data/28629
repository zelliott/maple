zzso zzso is important for regulating zzso structure and gene zzso Three classes of zzso zzso zzso have been zzso Among class II, there are five known members, namely zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Here we describe the identification and characterization of a novel class II member termed zzso It is a zzso zzso zzso with a zzso modular structure consisting of an zzso zzso putative zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely expressed in adult human zzso and cultured zzso zzso It is enriched in the zzso and this enrichment is not sensitive to zzso B, a specific inhibitor known to block the nuclear export of other class II zzso The zzso domain of zzso is responsible for its zzso zzso zzso zzso protein possesses zzso zzso activity, which is sensitive to zzso A, a specific inhibitor for known class I and class II zzso zzso When zzso to a promoter, zzso is able to repress zzso Furthermore, zzso interacts with zzso but not with zzso or zzso These results indicate that zzso is a novel class II zzso zzso possessing a unique zzso zzso
