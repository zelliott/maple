The zzso response zzso proteins zzso are highly expressed in the zzso nervous zzso zzso has been shown to function in zzso and zzso acid induced growth cone zzso zzso the highest levels of zzso protein are found in the zzso portion of growing zzso To understand the role of zzso during embryonic development we have documented its expression pattern in zzso zzso at multiple zzso We find that zzso is expressed in the major neural clusters of the embryonic brain during the primary stages of zzso From 20 zzso through 30 zzso zzso is expressed in the zzso zzso cluster of the zzso the zzso zzso cluster of the zzso the zzso zzso cluster of the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is also expressed in the zzso sensory zzso and the zzso zzso cells of the neural tube from 15 zzso By 48 zzso we find expression of zzso throughout the developing brain, zzso sensory zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is also detected in the retinal zzso cell layer of the eye, and in the zzso zzso Finally, we have compared the expression of zzso to zzso a zzso zzso expressed in sensory zzso and find that their expression partially zzso
