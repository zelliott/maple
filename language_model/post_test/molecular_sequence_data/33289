The main zzso region zzso is a zzso region at the zzso zzso of zzso zzso of muscle zzso zzso zzso zzso that is the target of half or more of the zzso to muscle zzso in human zzso zzso and rat experimental zzso zzso zzso By making zzso of human zzso zzso with zzso zzso both zzso zzso recognized by rat zzso and by the zzso human zzso zzso to the zzso were determined to consist of two zzso zzso which are adjacent only in the native zzso The zzso including loop zzso zzso in combination with the zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binding for most rat zzso to the zzso However, an additional sequence corresponding to zzso zzso was required for zzso binding of human zzso zzso A water soluble zzso of zzso zzso binding protein with the same zzso zzso sequences zzso was recognized by a majority of human, zzso and canine zzso zzso zzso The presence of the zzso zzso sequences in zzso zzso greatly promoted zzso expression and significantly altered the sensitivity to zzso This reveals a structural and functional, as well as zzso significance of the zzso
