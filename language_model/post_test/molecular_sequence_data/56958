The long arm of the human zzso contains about 800 to zzso copies of the zzso repeated DNA sequence zzso A major part of the repeating unit zzso has been cloned and zzso zzso were designed to match a part of this repeat sequence for the amplification of a 154 zzso zzso spanning the zzso restriction site of the zzso Typical dilution experiments showed that this zzso chain reaction zzso method allows the detection of 5 to 10 male cells among 100,000 female cells, or in 500 zzso of zzso fluid containing only one cell per zzso In addition, the quality of the DNA used for the amplification reaction is less critical, thus allowing analysis of long-term stored samples such as bone zzso zzso or dried blood zzso spotted onto filter paper, which might contain partially zzso zzso We applied this technique to detect residual host cells in the clinical setting of human zzso bone zzso transplantation zzso Fourteen patients, receiving zzso because of zzso could be supervised so zzso Throughout the whole period of monitoring zzso zzso until zzso post zzso zzso 160 zzso residual host cells were detected in all but three zzso zzso of host cells in the early phase zzso was mostly transient and probably due to long-term surviving host zzso zzso of host cells several months after zzso is highly suspicious of zzso from the underlying zzso Due to its high sensitivity, zzso is a valuable tool in monitoring the switch from recipient to donor cell zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
