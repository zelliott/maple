Two zzso zzso vaccine viruses zzso and zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso strain of human zzso virus type 3 zzso have been zzso These zzso viruses display the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso data indicate that both zzso and zzso sustained zzso zzso during cold passage and subsequent zzso Fifteen zzso changes were present in zzso and 18 in zzso Of these changes, some were present in the sequence of the zzso zzso strain zzso or were zzso changes present in the open reading frames zzso These were considered unlikely to be of significance in contributing to zzso differences between the zzso and the zzso zzso There were nine remaining changes in zzso and eight in zzso that would most likely contribute to their zzso For zzso two were zzso changes in regulatory regions, one in the 3' zzso leader and one in the zzso gene zzso start zzso The remaining seven changes resulted in zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso For zzso two zzso were in a zzso regulatory region, the 3' zzso zzso The remaining six changes resulted in zzso acid zzso in zzso zzso and zzso Only one zzso acid substitution was zzso between zzso and zzso (a zzso to zzso change at position zzso of the zzso zzso These results should prove useful in the future in understanding the genetic basis of zzso of the zzso zzso candidate vaccine zzso
