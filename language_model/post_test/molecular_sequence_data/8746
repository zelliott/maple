zzso is a protein zzso C zzso protein that fulfills the criteria previously established for a zzso for activated zzso zzso If binding of zzso to zzso anchors the activated zzso near its protein zzso then zzso of this binding should inhibit zzso and function of the zzso in zzso Here, we have identified such zzso that mimic the zzso site on beta zzso We first found that a zzso fragment, but not a zzso zzso of beta zzso bound to zzso and inhibited subsequent beta zzso zzso The zzso site was further zzso peptides beta zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso and beta zzso zzso zzso but not a number of control zzso bound to zzso and inhibited the C2 zzso binding to zzso zzso beta zzso beta zzso and beta zzso specifically inhibited zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso in cardiac zzso and zzso beta zzso zzso and function in zzso zzso zzso peptides corresponding to zzso acids zzso and zzso within the C2 region of the beta zzso are specific zzso for functions zzso by beta zzso
