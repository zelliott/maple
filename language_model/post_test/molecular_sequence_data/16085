A zzso zzso probe is described which has been prepared corresponding to the zzso acid sequence zzso of zzso zzso growth zzso Following zzso separation of rat brain zzso under zzso conditions the probe zzso to a major zzso zzso species of approximately zzso zzso This zzso is the same size as that reported for zzso zzso growth factor zzso The relative abundance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso species increases in rat brain 3 days after cortical zzso indicating increased expression of the gene for zzso zzso growth zzso
