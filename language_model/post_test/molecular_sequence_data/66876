To investigate the role of zzso in the zzso of gastric lymphoma, we analyzed the zzso promoter region for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in 43 gastric zzso including 4 zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 33 diffuse large zzso zzso zzso and 6 composite zzso with residual zzso zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso partners, resulting in its deregulation, were frequently involved in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Two novel zzso zzso partner zzso zzso zzso and zzso and a new zzso zzso zzso in zzso 2 were also zzso zzso zzso were found only in zzso zzso which correlated significantly with high zzso protein zzso zzso high zzso expression correlated strongly with longer overall survival zzso independent of mechanism in gastric zzso and zzso zzso zzso were further zzso into zzso center zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso High zzso expression was detected in all zzso cases, irrespective of zzso genetic zzso In the zzso zzso zzso zzso correlated significantly with high zzso expression zzso No significant correlation was found between the zzso expression level and zzso in the zzso zzso which had significantly poorer prognosis than the zzso zzso
