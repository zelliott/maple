zzso a zinc finger zzso zzso regulates the zzso tumor zzso gene product by binding to it and preventing zzso zzso zzso 

zzso for zzso zzso transcription, repression and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso proteins were used to measure the ability of zzso to block each zzso 

zzso was able to inhibit all three functions of the zzso and zzso zzso activities; zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso and repression by the zzso zzso 

The zzso protein binds to the zzso terminal portion of the zzso protein and, in so doing, blocks the ability of zzso to interact with the zzso machinery of the cell zzso The zzso protein binds to both zzso zzso at zzso acids 22 and 23, from the zzso terminal end of the zzso and in so doing, prevents all zzso zzso The ability of a zzso zzso protein to zzso a zzso zzso gene promoter is blocked by zzso and the ability of the zzso zzso protein to repress zzso of some genes is also blocked by the zzso zzso Thus, all three functions of the zzso zzso zzso repression and zzso protein zzso the zzso zzso terminal domain functions and are regulated by the zzso protein in a zzso When zzso is zzso resulting in a tumor or transformation of a cell, all of the zzso activities are zzso
