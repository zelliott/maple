The zzso of zzso chemical exchange of the zzso zzso has been suggested as one of the tools available for investigating zzso stabilizing interactions in zzso The zzso zzso zzso exchange rates in zzso zzso were studied by zzso zzso on 12 samples prepared following different zzso In samples passed through a sodium salt zzso zzso exchange zzso column prior to being zzso the zzso acid zzso exchange occurred in less than 10 zzso and that of zzso zzso in 30 zzso The zzso zzso zzso exchange was zzso the zzso of the signal ranging from 15 zzso to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso samples with water, through a dialysis process, modified the zzso exchange rate values, the zzso zzso zzso exchange becoming faster than that of zzso zzso and similar to that of zzso acid zzso Our results indicate that the zzso exchange rate strongly depends on sample preparation zzso content and minor zzso present in zzso The three-dimensional model involving the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso acid zzso group zzso which is supported by experimental evidence, cannot be confirmed by zzso zzso
