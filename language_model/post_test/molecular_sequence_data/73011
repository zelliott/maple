Seven zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso have been isolated, and their behaviors in in zzso zzso of zzso and its zzso complex have been zzso Two zzso were selected to address the increased stability of the zzso complex of zzso zzso compared with that of zzso zzso We found that this difference can be largely ascribed to the existence of zzso at position zzso in the zzso (the zzso system used assigns position 0 to the His which provides the zzso zzso to zzso of the former zzso compared to Met in that position in the zzso The amount of energy involved in the increased interaction was zzso zzso which would be consistent with a hydrogen bond involving zzso zzso of the His at position 0 to zzso allows an estimate of the binding energy for zzso formation contributed by coordination of the zzso group of His to the zzso atom of zzso of zzso zzso per zzso Finally, an evaluation of the role of zzso acids in the zzso region of the zzso was zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in which zzso at position zzso was changed to zzso resulted in optimal formation of an zzso complex whose zzso was zzso to zzso zzso the same as observed in the intact zzso harboring this zzso These results provide further confirmation that the environment of zzso in zzso zzso complexes is the same as in zzso and support the assignment of this zzso to a role in hydrogen bonding with the zzso zzso group of zzso Two other zzso of the zzso in which 5 and 14 zzso acids in the zzso were deleted were also zzso These were of interest because the latter zzso unlike the former, resulted in a low level of expression of zzso in intact zzso However, with both of these zzso zzso zzso appeared identical to that of the native zzso In the case of the zzso shortened by 14 zzso zzso a small zzso in zzso to zzso zzso was observed, again zzso the zzso exhibited by the intact zzso Thus, these results suggest that the lowered levels of in zzso expression observed in these two zzso are due to reduced incorporation of the zzso into the membrane or its increased degradation, rather than to decreased stabilization of the zzso zzso
