zzso chain reaction zzso technology was employed to examine peripheral blood and zzso T cells in patients with zzso arthritis zzso for biased zzso of T cell zzso zzso variable region zzso zzso zzso zzso specific for individual zzso V beta gene families were used to amplify zzso gene products in a zzso zzso of their relative zzso in zzso T cell zzso Mean V beta expression in 24 zzso peripheral blood samples was very similar to that in a panel of 15 normal subjects, except for a slight decrease in V beta zzso zzso V beta zzso in 8 zzso zzso tissue samples and 13 zzso fluid samples was compared to simultaneously obtained blood zzso Although zzso patterns of skewed V beta zzso were observed, several significant trends zzso By a number of approaches to data analysis, a statistically significant increase in expression of V beta 6 and V beta 15 in zzso T cells was zzso In addition, increased zzso expression of V beta 14 was found, but only in the zzso fluid zzso zzso expression of V beta 1, V beta 4, V beta zzso V beta 10, V beta 16, and V beta 19 was also observed in zzso T zzso These results indicate that biased V beta gene zzso in different peripheral compartments of zzso patients can be observed in zzso T cell zzso and are consistent with the conclusion that populations of T cells expressing these V beta gene products may be involved in the zzso of the zzso
