The process of zzso in Parkinson's Disease is intimately associated with the zzso of the protein zzso into toxic zzso and zzso Interestingly, many of these protein zzso are found to be zzso modified by zzso at several different zzso zzso However, the inability to generate zzso zzso modified zzso at each site has prevented the understanding of the specific zzso zzso We have used protein zzso to generate nine zzso zzso modified zzso derivatives and have demonstrated that different zzso sites have differential effects on zzso zzso
