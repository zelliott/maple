zzso characterization of zzso zzso is relevant to identify possible mechanisms underlying their zzso The consistent association of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in inducing zzso acute zzso zzso with mixed lineage leukemia zzso gene zzso suggests that zzso zzso are zzso events for zzso Using zzso multiplex zzso strategy followed by direct DNA sequencing, we characterized the zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso genes in two patients who developed zzso with zzso zzso treatment of the primary disease in both patients included zzso II zzso zzso targeting zzso In one case, the zzso zzso was located in zzso 9 at zzso position zzso while the zzso zzso was in zzso 3 at zzso position zzso The zzso junction sequences revealed an zzso of two zzso at the zzso zzso In the other patient, the zzso zzso was located in zzso 11 at zzso position zzso and the zzso break was in zzso 3 at zzso position zzso The zzso zzso found in the latter patient was identical to that of two previously reported cases, strongly suggesting the presence of a preferential site of DNA zzso in the presence of zzso II zzso In addition, zzso at the zzso junctions were indicative of DNA repair by the zzso end joining zzso zzso This study further supports the evidence that zzso zzso in zzso acute leukemia with zzso are clustered in the zzso half of the zzso cluster region that contains zzso II recognition zzso
