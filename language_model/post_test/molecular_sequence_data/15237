The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are gastrointestinal zzso causing many disabilities to humans, particularly zzso The zzso zzso drugs, zzso zzso and zzso zzso are commonly used for mass treatment for zzso Unfortunately, there is concern that increased use of zzso could select for resistant populations of these human zzso In veterinary zzso and lately in zzso zzso a single zzso acid substitution from zzso to zzso known to be associated with zzso resistance, has been found in zzso zzso at position zzso We have developed zzso zzso for zzso 200 zzso or zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso to screen for this single zzso zzso zzso 

zzso zzso were developed and evaluated for detecting the zzso or zzso zzso at zzso 200 in zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA from individual zzso eggs isolated from individual adult worms or from zzso samples with known treatment history and origin, were zzso at zzso by zzso and zzso were confirmed by conventional zzso The zzso were applied to adult worms from a zzso population in zzso Following this, these zzso were applied to individual worms and pooled eggs from people in East Africa zzso and zzso and Central America zzso where mass zzso drug programs had been zzso All zzso zzso samples were zzso However, we found zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso worms from zzso people in Kenya, and zzso of zzso zzso egg pools from treated people in Panama contained only zzso 

Although the zzso 200 zzso zzso was not found in any of the zzso zzso samples zzso a rapid zzso zzso has been developed that can be used to examine larger populations of this zzso and to monitor for possible zzso resistance zzso The zzso zzso at zzso zzso associated with zzso resistance in other zzso does occur in zzso zzso and a rapid zzso has been developed to allow populations of this zzso to be monitored for the frequency of this zzso Sample sizes were small, zzso efficacy was not zzso and treated and zzso samples were from different locations, so these zzso cannot be zzso to other populations of zzso zzso or to a conclusion about resistance to zzso The occurrence of the zzso zzso at zzso 200 of zzso in zzso zzso may explain why zzso zzso are not always highly effective against this species of zzso These zzso will be useful in assessing appropriate treatment in areas of high zzso zzso prevalence and in monitoring for possible resistance development in these zzso
