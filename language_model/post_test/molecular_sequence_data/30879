To evaluate the role of domain I of zzso zzso in the zzso of target zzso a series of zzso zzso was constructed in which domain I zzso zzso zzso was substantially deleted, or was exchanged with the zzso region zzso zzso zzso of cardiac zzso C zzso The proteins are 1) zzso a zzso zzso in which domain I has been zzso 2) zzso first domain of zzso last three zzso of zzso 3) zzso same as zzso except the zzso first zzso domain has been restored by zzso 4) zzso first domain of zzso last three zzso of zzso These proteins were evaluated for zzso binding properties and as zzso of three zzso target zzso zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle zzso light chain zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso proteins containing four zzso bound zzso in the manner expected from the number and nature of zzso zzso In contrast, zzso bound only two zzso suggesting that deletion of domain I may have disrupted binding in one of the remaining three zzso and did not activate the three zzso The zzso of zzso of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso were zzso Although zzso and zzso could zzso activate zzso the zzso for these zzso were greater than 2000 times than for zzso All zzso proteins except zzso were poor zzso of zzso zzso II and this protein activated the zzso to zzso that of zzso with a nearly identical zzso zzso and zzso were poor zzso of zzso zzso of zzso site I in zzso zzso completely prevented zzso of zzso In addition, zzso was a potent competitive inhibitor of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso 66 zzso We conclude 1) a domain I is necessary to activate these target zzso and the substitution of the corresponding region of zzso into zzso leads to differential zzso 2) an active first zzso site is not essential for zzso of zzso and the primary sequence of the first domain of zzso need not be highly zzso 3) for zzso zzso II, zzso in the first domain are critical whereas more flexibility exists for the remaining three zzso 4) since zzso acts as a potent competitive inhibitor of zzso binding of zzso to a target zzso and zzso can be zzso zzso
