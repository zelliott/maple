The intrinsic resistance of the zzso tuberculosis complex zzso to most zzso including zzso is generally attributed to the low zzso of the zzso cell zzso However, zzso zzso zzso are much more sensitive to zzso than members of the zzso A search for zzso resistance zzso within the zzso of zzso tuberculosis revealed the presence of a sequence zzso a putative zzso zzso The deduced protein is similar to zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso resistance by zzso of zzso zzso and was named zzso The corresponding zzso zzso zzso is present in all members of the zzso but is absent in zzso zzso Part of zzso is deleted in some vaccine strains of zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso strain, which lack the zzso zzso The zzso strain was susceptible to zzso zzso whereas zzso species harboring the zzso region were resistant to zzso The expression of zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The resistance patterns and zzso affinity for zzso of zzso host strains expressing zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso zzso were zzso and the ones zzso by zzso were similar to those zzso by zzso corresponding to the zzso type I zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a major role in the intrinsic zzso resistance of members of the zzso and could be the first example of a gene zzso resistance by target modification in zzso
