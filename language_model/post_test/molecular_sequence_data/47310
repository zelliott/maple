A series of zzso and zzso derivatives of zzso zzso zzso zzso and of an engineered zzso zzso of zzso that has had its zzso zzso binding site removed have been examined by electronic zzso and magnetic circular zzso zzso zzso at 4 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso properties that are very similar to those of zzso zzso c zzso zzso and likely exists primarily as a zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso side by a zzso at pH zzso There is also evidence for minority contributions from zzso zzso and zzso species zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso of zzso varies considerably in the electronic zzso and zzso zzso in both the zzso and zzso states when compared with zzso of the zzso zzso The electronic zzso and zzso zzso of the engineered zzso zzso zzso are essentially identical to those of zzso zzso a known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso It therefore appears that the zzso zzso of zzso has undergone a zzso change to yield a zzso coordination structure in both the zzso and zzso zzso states at neutral zzso This zzso change is the result of zzso of the protein to remove the zzso site which is located approximately 8 A from the zzso binding zzso Thus, zzso of protein zzso on the zzso side of the zzso cause changes in iron zzso on the zzso zzso
