A zzso Gram negative, zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from bamboo leaves and identified as a member of the zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed similarity values of zzso % with closely related type strains and showed highest similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso metabolism in this strain was confirmed by zzso amplification and sequencing of the zzso gene coding for the zzso of methanol zzso zzso zzso produced three known zzso sensing signal molecules with similar retention time to zzso zzso and zzso when characterized by zzso The fatty acid profiles contained major amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso and summed feature 3 zzso zzso and/or zzso zzso which supported the grouping of the isolate in the zzso zzso The DNA zzso content was zzso zzso DNA zzso of the strain zzso to its most closely related strains ranged from zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso data, strain zzso is assigned to a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
