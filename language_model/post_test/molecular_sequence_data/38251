zzso was performed on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to isolate zzso corresponding to transcripts which are zzso expressed in leaves borne on zzso and zzso zzso A gene was identified which was more highly expressed in the leaves of zzso zzso and codes for the zzso protein zzso present in the small zzso zzso The zzso leader regions of zzso zzso were found to zzso 8-11 zzso zzso which suggested similarities to regulatory stretches that control the translation of zzso for zzso proteins in zzso The zzso zzso is zzso by two zzso zzso which are both transcribed in zzso active zzso such as developing leaves and zzso In zzso zzso to shoot zzso zzso and the measurement of zzso ratios indicated that zzso expression was confined to areas undergoing active cell zzso The mature zzso zzso was detected as a single species in actively dividing zzso such as zzso tips, developing leaves, zzso zzso zzso developing fruits and zzso In contrast, zzso of a precursor zzso in the presence of the mature product, was found in fully expanded leaves and zzso zzso while only the precursor species was detected in several late-stage zzso This phenomenon suggested that expression of the mature zzso is controlled at the level of zzso and turnover of the precursor zzso This is similar to the mode of regulation of zzso protein genes in zzso
