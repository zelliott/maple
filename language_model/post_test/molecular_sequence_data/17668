zzso mimicry has been considered as a possible way for zzso to escape host immune zzso This work concerns the characterization of protein zzso shared by zzso zzso and its intermediate host zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins were identified and shown to induce in rabbit and zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso studies demonstrated that zzso to zzso specifically bound to muscular structures of zzso and zzso zzso cloning and sequencing indicated that zzso corresponded to a muscular zzso of zzso The zzso sequence showed a zzso zzso with seven different muscular zzso from zzso and zzso zzso The highest score of zzso was observed with zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso could be specific for the zzso and its intermediate zzso In zzso zzso zzso were also shown to be contained in the zzso present in zzso zzso and cellular zzso Such zzso are involved in the formation of a protective zzso around zzso suggesting a possible role of zzso zzso in zzso and/or zzso zzso
