zzso contamination has resulted in abnormal zzso in zzso We isolated a zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso from zzso The strain carried two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso By curing and zzso of the zzso we clarified that zzso has zzso resistant activity, characterized as no zzso zzso zzso has zzso zzso and three zzso zzso zzso and zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso product showed high similarity to those of zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The replication origin zzso was upstream from zzso There was no gene similar to typical zzso resistant genes zzso by known zzso The zzso resistance of zzso zzso zzso may possibly be due to a zzso zzso zzso
