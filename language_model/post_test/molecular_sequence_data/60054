A novel, zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from an zzso zzso of a dairy wastewater treatment zzso zzso zzso stained zzso and was an zzso zzso zzso slightly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which existed zzso or in zzso The DNA zzso content was 43 zzso zzso growth occurred at 35 degrees C and pH zzso on zzso with a generation time of 16 zzso Good growth was obtained on zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso was the zzso formed from all these zzso but in addition, a trace of zzso was detected from zzso and zzso and zzso was produced from zzso zzso zzso grew slowly on zzso and produced zzso carbon dioxide, zzso hydrogen and traces of zzso as the zzso In zzso association with zzso zzso strain zzso oxidized zzso zzso and zzso to give zzso as the major zzso zzso carbon dioxide and methane were also zzso zzso zzso did not degrade zzso and the zzso zzso acids zzso zzso and zzso either in pure culture or in association with zzso zzso The nearest zzso relative of strain zzso was the zzso zzso zzso zzso value of zzso As strain zzso is zzso zzso and zzso different from other zzso zzso it is proposed that it should be designated a new species of a new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
