A full-length zzso of an zzso protein was cloned from a zzso library of the local Egyptian cattle tick zzso zzso zzso raised against zzso zzso zzso proteins were used to screen a zzso expression zzso A zzso cloned zzso was zzso and showed an open reading frame of zzso zzso a protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequence with protein data bank revealed that the sequence is related to a sequence isolated from the hard tick zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso DNA showed that the cloned zzso zzso to double bands per restriction zzso suggesting that the cloned zzso is a double copy zzso zzso acid analysis of the cloned gene revealed the presence of two zzso zzso II zzso sites in the zzso domain suggesting that this zzso may be involved in the signal zzso or gene expression zzso zzso and northern zzso revealed the presence of two zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso The cloned gene without the signal zzso was expressed in zzso coli under zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso under zzso zzso The zzso protein appeared as a single band on zzso zzso with a molecular weight around zzso including the zzso tag of the zzso zzso raised against the zzso zzso were used to detect the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso gene in whole zzso larvae and gut protein zzso zzso revealed the presence of this zzso zzso only in whole tick and zzso protein extracts and not in the gut protein zzso Using the same zzso zzso to the zzso gene were detected in other tick species as zzso zzso and zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso
