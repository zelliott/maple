zzso with zzso zzso were prepared from the visceral mass of zzso zzso in zzso The native PAGE approach showed similar zzso mobility among pig pancreatic zzso liver zzso of zzso zzso and visceral mass zzso of zzso zzso zzso indicated that the zzso zzso visceral zzso zzso consisted of a single zzso type and had a molecular weight zzso of approximately 20 zzso suggesting that the protein shell in zzso was composed of a single zzso In addition, zzso mass zzso and transmission electron zzso were used to identify zzso further, and to observe its molecular zzso We found that the molecular structure in zzso was similar to that of most zzso zzso which are composed of a protein shell and an iron zzso The results of zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso under the assistance of an zzso zzso zzso acid, also showed that zzso was composed of a single zzso type and its zzso zzso was calculated to be zzso Da in the absence of zzso zzso analysis revealed that the complete process of iron release fitted the law of a zzso reaction, which is similar to that of most zzso in zzso Similar to bacterial zzso studies indicated that the shell consisted of a single zzso type and showed similar zzso of iron release, suggesting that this zzso plays two important roles in iron release and storage, and that it shows different stability and intensity of interaction in carrying out its zzso functions in zzso
