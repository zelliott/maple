zzso containing zzso group zzso zzso are zzso into two major zzso Members of one group are identified by the presence of more than one zzso domain that binds to DNA without sequence zzso and they are usually zzso zzso In contrast, members of the other group possess a single zzso domain with high affinity to specific DNA zzso Generally, members of the second group resemble classic zzso zzso zzso In contrast, zzso is a zzso zzso novel protein with a single zzso domain that displays zzso zzso zzso Additionally, as a core zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, zzso is also the first member of the zzso protein family that was reported to contain a zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the zzso as well as the zzso and zzso analysis, of a novel zzso protein that is structurally related to zzso termed zzso zzso The unique arrangement of an zzso with a zzso domain shared with zzso suggests a similar, albeit still unknown, function in zzso assembly as part of a zzso zzso zzso The linkage of a single zzso zzso zzso domain with a zzso domain makes both proteins the founding members of a third group of zzso zzso
