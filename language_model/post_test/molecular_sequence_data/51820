zzso like the zzso are able to replace their limbs and tail following zzso by the formation of a zzso a mass of zzso zzso cells originating from the tissue adjacent to the cut zzso As this capacity may involve genetic control, we investigated in adult zzso the expression of genes controlling embryonic zzso We screened a zzso zzso library with a redundant zzso specific to the highly zzso third zzso of the zzso domain of zzso zzso Five classes of zzso have been zzso We report the zzso sequence and the tissue distribution of two of them, zzso and zzso The zzso acid sequences of both zzso are highly zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso a zzso zzso gene expressed during the development of zzso zzso and zzso express respectively zzso and 2 zzso zzso The pattern of expression of both genes is identical in adult zzso of the zzso zzso transcripts are zzso in the zzso zzso the tail, flank, and brain as well as in limb and tail zzso Analysis of dissected tissue from the zzso indicated that the expression of both genes is restricted to the zzso This work is a first step toward understanding the possible relation between sustained expression of zzso genes in adult zzso zzso and zzso zzso
