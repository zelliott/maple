To develop a novel zzso method able to detect potential zzso zzso zzso and to zzso them exploiting the amplification of the zzso gene zzso and its zzso 

A mixed approach including the combination of zzso zzso zzso and isolation, zzso zzso of zzso zzso through the amplification of the zzso gene using a zzso zzso primer zzso and zzso final zzso identification based on amplification and sequencing of the zzso zzso region of the selected zzso strains was zzso By this approach, it was possible to screen 77 zzso strains belonging to 14 zzso and 26 zzso 

The zzso permitted the discrimination of zzso species, producing typical zzso zzso 

In this study, the zzso gene was used as a preliminary zzso tool able to differentiate among themselves the zzso members isolated from indoor museum items and surrounding zzso Such mixed approach zzso the fast identification of all isolated zzso zzso The zzso method demonstrated its discrimination power, and it can be considered as a new molecular system suitable for the zzso of zzso strains isolated from different zzso
