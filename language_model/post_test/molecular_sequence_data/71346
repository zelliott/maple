zzso mediate the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and many other G zzso receptors zzso Additionally, zzso initiate the zzso of these receptors via zzso zzso and interact directly with zzso zzso it has been proposed that zzso serve as zzso zzso for the zzso family by linking these receptors to zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated to mediate the zzso of many types of plasma membrane proteins other than zzso zzso interacts with the zzso heavy chain and zzso zzso of receptors such as those for zzso growth factor and zzso In the present study we demonstrate the formation of an zzso zzso complex containing a zzso zzso 2, and the zzso zzso of zzso zzso binds zzso 2 in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso and zzso in an zzso manner in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso from the zzso to the plasma membrane in response to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso in zzso zzso Finally, expression of zzso 2 zzso zzso containing the zzso interacting region zzso zzso zzso These findings point to a role for zzso in zzso zzso and they suggest that zzso functions as a zzso zzso for the zzso of diverse classes of membrane zzso
