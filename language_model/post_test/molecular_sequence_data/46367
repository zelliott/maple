zzso sequences are usually the most highly zzso sectors of DNA, but zzso regions controlling the expression pattern of certain genes can also be zzso across diverse zzso In this study, we identify five enhancers capable of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and each contains sequences zzso across at least 11 zzso zzso In addition, the zzso sequences contain reiterated motifs for binding sites of the known zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To understand the molecular basis for the highly zzso zzso zzso within enhancers of the zzso zzso we tested the ability of various motifs to affect zzso zzso both individually and in zzso within synthetic reporter zzso Multiple copies of the binding site for the zzso regulators zzso and Tango can drive expression in zzso zzso however, small changes to the sequences zzso this zzso factor binding site can zzso expression in zzso cells and activate expression in zzso cells zzso For the zzso genes described in this study, the highly zzso sequences appear to zzso positive and negative regulatory factors in a zzso that activates genes specifically in the zzso zzso while maintaining them inactive in other zzso including zzso zzso and zzso zzso
