A zzso unknown single zzso zzso zzso with a unique property was isolated from larvae of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso gene sequences were obtained by zzso with zzso zzso and used for zzso zzso zzso belonged to class II zzso and its zzso sequence was most similar to that of class II zzso of other members of the zzso zzso Further genetic characterization involved the random cloning of zzso fragments into a zzso zzso and analysis by zzso zzso A gene so far unique to zzso was identified, which encodes a putative DNA repair zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso The zzso activity of this gene was demonstrated in both zzso zzso zzso larvae and infected zzso zzso High Five cells by zzso and zzso and 3' zzso zzso The possible role of this gene in the biology of the virus is zzso
