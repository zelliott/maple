zzso is a zzso zzso zzso factor containing zzso and zinc finger zzso as zzso and DNA binding zzso zzso We have identified a small region in the zzso domain indispensable for its zzso activity by zzso experiments using various expression plasmids with point zzso or small deletions in the zzso This region zzso about 10 zzso acids was relatively zzso and rich in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso from a zzso expression system could enhance transcription, depending on the presence of zzso boxes in the promoter region of templates in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso deleted of the zzso region, however, lost the zzso activity, in confirmation of the above zzso Basic zzso factors which possibly interact with zzso were zzso zzso factors, zzso zzso zzso and zzso beta as well as the zzso zzso protein zzso were found to interact with zzso when analyzed by in zzso binding experiments, although these interactions could not be attributed to the zzso zzso We discussed factors which interact with and transmit the zzso activity of the zzso zzso domain to basic zzso zzso
