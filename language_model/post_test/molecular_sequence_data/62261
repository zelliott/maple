zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso messenger, controlling a diverse range of cellular zzso including zzso and development of the zzso One of the key mechanisms involved in triggering zzso calcium release is the generation of the second zzso zzso zzso by the zzso C zzso class of zzso Although five distinct forms of zzso have been identified in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso only one, zzso has thus far been detected in zzso In the present study, we describe the isolation of a zzso zzso a novel zzso zzso of the delta zzso zzso zzso from the egg of the Pacific purple sea zzso zzso zzso We also demonstrate the presence of this zzso within the zzso and in the early zzso The zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso with an open reading frame of zzso and a zzso of zzso All of the characteristic zzso found in zzso zzso zzso zzso domain, zzso hands, an zzso zzso region, and a C2 zzso are present in zzso A zzso search revealed that zzso shares most sequence identity with bovine zzso zzso We present evidence that zzso is expressed in zzso eggs, zzso eggs, and in the early zzso In addition to Northern and zzso chain reaction zzso zzso in zzso zzso experiments further demonstrated that the embryonic regions within which the zzso transcript can be detected during early embryonic development are associated with the highest levels of zzso activity, suggesting a possible involvement with metabolism or cell cycle zzso
