The use of multiple zzso motifs to provide effective gene delivery holds great promise as an elegant, zzso approach to gene zzso The molecular understanding of cell and viral biology provides a strong foundation on which to pursue this zzso zzso peptides containing multiple zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso provide natural zzso for zzso zzso binding of DNA, and for DNA zzso into particles suitable for gene zzso These zzso peptides can incorporate additional functional motifs zzso for zzso DNA into the zzso and they can be linked by zzso bonds to produce high molecular zzso zzso with superior properties for gene zzso Many factors influence the size, surface charge and stability of zzso zzso For in zzso use, zzso particles resistant to disruption by salt and zzso and targeted to zzso membrane zzso will be zzso zzso into the cell is via one of the zzso zzso depending on particle size and (in zzso the target cell surface zzso zzso motifs for zzso escape are based mainly on the zzso zzso zzso of influenza virus zzso and on zzso peptides (where the zzso properties of the zzso group cause zzso swelling and probably zzso of zzso zzso Once in the zzso zzso of DNA plasmids across the nuclear pore complex into the nucleus is a crucial step, because most target cells for gene therapy are either zzso or slowly zzso Nuclear zzso can be achieved by classical nuclear zzso zzso or more simply by zzso and other zzso zzso
