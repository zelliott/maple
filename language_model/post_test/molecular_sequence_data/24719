Opening of the zzso zzso channel requires simultaneous binding of zzso and zzso Although the binding sites for each zzso are in different zzso the presence of one zzso influences the binding of the zzso We have localized regions in the zzso binding domain of both zzso required for the transmission of zzso signals from the zzso binding zzso zzso to the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso modeling indicates that these segments are not directly involved in zzso zzso but likely form zzso zzso protruding out of the binding pocket, making them suitable to relay interactions between adjacent zzso Thus, these segments mediate negative zzso zzso between the two zzso types that form the zzso zzso
