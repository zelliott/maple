The early phase of zzso infection is characterized by the presence of live organisms in the zzso zzso zzso zzso is resistant to the alternative zzso of complement zzso while zzso members of the zzso are zzso zzso with that zzso only zzso zzso bound factor zzso a host zzso regulator of the alternative complement zzso zzso affinity zzso analyses revealed that zzso zzso zzso produces at least two factor zzso zzso Through screening of a zzso zzso expression library, we identified one of these as the novel membrane protein zzso zzso affinity zzso and surface zzso resonance analyses of zzso zzso revealed specific binding of both factor H and factor zzso protein zzso zzso examination of infected humans and horses demonstrated that zzso is expressed by zzso zzso during zzso zzso zzso may therefore contribute to the resistance of zzso zzso to zzso killing during zzso zzso of the zzso
