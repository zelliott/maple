The zzso protein to which about half the zzso from patients with localized juvenile zzso and rapidly progressive zzso reacted strongly was zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of the protein revealed that it was a zzso zzso The DNA zzso containing the zzso gene of zzso zzso was amplified by zzso chain reaction, and the zzso zzso was cloned by using colony zzso with the amplified zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that structures of the zzso and its products were typical in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso protein zzso with approximately zzso proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli and zzso zzso but not with any cellular proteins of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso It is possible that zzso zzso to the zzso protein in zzso patients are induced by the zzso with the zzso proteins of other zzso
