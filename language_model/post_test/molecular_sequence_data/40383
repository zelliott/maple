Two zzso from zzso soil of cotton, designated zzso and zzso which produced large amounts of zzso zzso and possessed zzso traits, were characterized zzso and zzso The strains were zzso and cells were zzso rods that grew zzso at zzso and grew between pH 4 and zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis of strains zzso and zzso placed them in the zzso zzso with zzso sequence similarity between them and type strains from related zzso ranging from zzso to zzso The major fatty acids were zzso zzso and summed feature 3 zzso and/or zzso zzso The strains contained zzso as the major zzso zzso The DNA zzso contents of strains zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso zzso The low zzso zzso value zzso and a number of zzso differences between strains zzso and zzso indicated that they represent two separate zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso analysis revealed that the strains were separated from the species of zzso described to zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso represent novel species of zzso for which we propose the names zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
