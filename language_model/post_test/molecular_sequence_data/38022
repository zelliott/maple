Human zzso virus type 1 zzso resistance to zzso drugs is the main cause of patient treatment zzso Despite the problems associated with interpretation of zzso resistance testing, resistance monitoring should help in the rational design of initial or rescue zzso zzso It has previously been shown that the activity of the zzso zzso can be monitored by using a zzso zzso genetic zzso This genetic screening system is based on the zzso zzso regulatory circuit in which the viral zzso zzso is specifically zzso to initiate the zzso to zzso zzso We have adapted this simple zzso genetic zzso for the analysis of the activities and zzso of different zzso zzso Lambda zzso that zzso zzso zzso either from laboratory strains zzso zzso or from clinical samples are inhibited in a zzso manner by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso to different drugs were also detected among zzso that zzso zzso zzso carrying different resistance zzso further demonstrating the specificity of this zzso zzso in zzso processing activity can also be directly monitored with this genetic screen system since two zzso populations compete in culture with each other until one zzso zzso the zzso In zzso we present here a simple, safe, and rapid genetic screening system that may be used to predict the activities and zzso of zzso zzso in the course of viral infection and zzso zzso This zzso responds appropriately to well-known zzso zzso zzso and can be used to search for new zzso zzso
