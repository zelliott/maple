The primary structure of the zzso zzso from the zzso shows striking zzso from the known sequences of zzso and zzso zzso despite unequivocal zzso in functionally important zzso Thus, the structural similarity between the zzso and zzso zzso is significantly higher than that between the zzso zzso and the zzso and zzso zzso This preferred similarity of zzso and zzso zzso zzso structures does not zzso to the zzso distances among the three zzso as deduced from comparisons of zzso zzso acid zzso zzso will be presented that the closer relationship of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso resulted from a gene transfer from zzso to zzso after the segregation of the three zzso
