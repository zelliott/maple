The zzso channel, zzso recently identified in zzso displays the unusual structural feature of having two putative pore regions, in contrast to all previously cloned K zzso Using the zzso pore regions as zzso we identified a human kidney zzso zzso a zzso acid protein zzso with four zzso segments and two pore regions containing the signature sequence of K zzso zzso acid identity to zzso is only zzso overall but zzso at the zzso Northern analysis indicates high expression of a zzso message in brain zzso kidney zzso zzso zzso segment zzso carried out in rabbit by reverse zzso chain reaction, reveals that zzso is expressed in cortical thick ascending zzso connecting zzso and cortical collecting zzso It was not detected in the zzso zzso zzso thick ascending zzso zzso convoluted zzso and zzso We conclude that zzso is a unique, zzso zzso K channel, zzso related to the zzso channel zzso that is expressed in zzso zzso and is a candidate to participate in zzso K zzso
