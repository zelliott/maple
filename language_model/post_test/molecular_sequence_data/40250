We report the first example of zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso zzso transfer difference nuclear magnetic resonance zzso zzso This method, resulting in dramatically reduced zzso was applied to the interaction of the zzso zzso with a known zzso zzso and highlights novel contact points between the zzso and target zzso
