Though some mechanisms of zzso have been well zzso others remain zzso Presumably, most, if not all, of the major players in zzso functions are present in large amounts in the zzso layer, and a catalog of these proteins will prove a useful tool for vision zzso As a first step toward a complete catalog of zzso cells, we have developed a novel method for zzso the zzso cell zzso from bovine zzso zzso microscopic studies of both the zzso layer and the residual zzso from which the zzso layer had been removed, indicate that the preparation contains the zzso outer segments and the majority of the inner zzso zzso were extracted from the isolated zzso cell layer as well as the rest of the zzso with zzso focusing zzso zzso and the protein components were separated by two-dimensional gel zzso The obtained protein maps reveal several classes of proteins that appear to be expressed more abundantly or specifically in the zzso layer than in the rest of the zzso Four of these protein spots were excised and zzso zzso with zzso and the zzso were extracted with zzso The mixture of peptides zzso from each protein was analyzed by high performance liquid zzso zzso with zzso zzso tandem zzso mass zzso or by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso Some of the peptides were isolated and their sequences were determined by gas phase zzso zzso zzso transcripts extracted from the zzso layer or the whole zzso were subjected to Northern zzso analysis as well as to reverse zzso chain reaction amplification of zzso for the successful selection of zzso zzso These data permit both the identification of virtually any protein zzso on a two-dimensional zzso and also enable the corresponding zzso clone to be zzso We have validated this approach by identifying zzso zzso and zzso zzso from the populations of abundant zzso layer zzso Both zzso zzso and zzso zzso are of zzso origin and are thought to play crucial roles in zzso functions by producing zzso and zzso zzso We also identified two zzso layer specific zzso an zzso and high molecular weight zzso zzso zzso zzso and an zzso and small molecular weight zzso zzso technique presented here will allow vision researchers to discover and identify the proteins that are expressed specifically or abundantly in the zzso cell as well as the proteins that undergo zzso modification or zzso in expression under a defined biological zzso With the use of this technology, we anticipate that a researcher who knows only the zzso gel position of a protein of interest can identify the zzso isolate a zzso zzso and move into molecular genetic zzso Moreover, this streamlined technology will enable one to assemble a catalog of zzso proteins using a minute amount of materials in a short period of zzso We believe that such a catalog will serve as a valuable resource for vision investigators and will accelerate the rate of research zzso
