The diversity of zzso zzso zzso associated with wild zzso plants is scantily zzso In this study, one hundred and thirty one zzso zzso were isolated from ten zzso plant species collected from South Sinai in zzso zzso and zzso investigation of the zzso indicated zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso which have never been previously reported to be zzso were zzso Each plant species zzso between three to eight zzso of zzso and unidentified strains were recovered from seven plant zzso The generic diversity analysis of zzso zzso grouped the plant species into three main zzso representing high, moderate and low zzso zzso The zzso showed high functional diversity, based on zzso four zzso and plant growth promotion zzso providing some evidence that such traits could represent key criteria for successful residence of zzso in the zzso zzso traits were more zzso measure of functional diversity differences between the zzso zzso zzso index, p zzso zzso The results indicate a potential prominent role of zzso for their hosts and emphasize the potency of plant zzso as a habitat for zzso with promising future zzso
