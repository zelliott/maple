The contribution of zzso and host factors to zzso cell depletion associated with human zzso virus zzso type 1 was evaluated in children drawn from a larger efficacy trial of 2 doses of zzso zzso zzso zzso AIDS Clinical Trials Group zzso Thirty children, half with stable zzso cell counts zzso and half with a marked decline in zzso cells zzso were studied during zzso weeks of zzso zzso The children were matched for age and zzso cell counts at study zzso Three viral zzso zzso zzso higher virus load, and zzso in zzso pol zzso the zzso zzso were associated with disease zzso Disease progression was not associated with zzso in the zzso gene previously associated with resistance to zzso zzso zzso or zzso The selection of the zzso zzso in children with zzso disease progression during zzso therapy suggests that this zzso zzso a fitness advantage to the virus that may include resistance to zzso
