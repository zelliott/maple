zzso abnormalities of the triple zzso have been demonstrated in collagen diseases such as osteogenesis imperfecta in which the zzso leads to the substitution of a single zzso in the zzso sequence pattern by a larger zzso Model peptides can be used to clarify the details of normal collagen folding and the consequences of the interruption of that folding by a zzso zzso zzso and CD studies show that placement of a zzso nucleation domain at the N zzso rather than the C zzso of a native collagen sequence allows the formation of a stable triple zzso but alters the folding zzso Although zzso to zzso directional folding occurs when the nucleation domain is at the C zzso there is no preferential folding direction when the nucleation domain is at the N zzso The lack of zzso directional folding does not interfere with zzso formation, and when a zzso zzso is replaced by zzso to model an osteogenesis imperfecta zzso the zzso with the zzso zzso domain can still form a good triple zzso zzso to the zzso zzso These zzso studies raise the possibility that zzso collagen could fold in a C to N direction in a zzso manner up to the zzso site and that completion of the triple zzso zzso to the zzso would involve an alternative zzso
