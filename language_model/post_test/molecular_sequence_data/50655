The extensive zzso sequence zzso among independent zzso of wild zzso permits the systematic design of zzso molecular zzso We have prepared two sets of zzso chain reaction zzso primer pairs specific for the zzso of wild zzso type 3 recently endemic to Mexico and zzso zzso sequences of a representative wild type 3 virus isolated in Mexico in 1989 differed from the corresponding zzso 3 zzso 12 zzso sequences at 167 of 900 positions within the zzso zzso From the sequence data, wild zzso primer pairs were designed to complement regions of high mismatch zzso than zzso with zzso 3 zzso zzso binding sites were spaced along the zzso so that the predicted amplification products zzso zzso and zzso zzso could be easily resolved zzso from the products generated with our zzso zzso zzso zzso 1: 97 zzso zzso zzso 71 zzso zzso zzso 53 zzso zzso of all wild type 3 zzso zzso from Mexico and Guatemala obtained over a zzso period zzso served as efficient templates for amplification of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso templates derived from zzso zzso and most zzso wild zzso were inactive under equivalent reaction zzso zzso generating a zzso product with a broadly reacting primer pair, matching highly zzso sequences in the zzso region, provided a positive control for the presence in samples of zzso (or zzso zzso Selective amplification of wild zzso type 3 zzso sequences was obtained with either primer set in reactions containing large zzso excesses (up to zzso of zzso zzso We have used wild zzso zzso primer sets to facilitate identification of wild zzso present in both clinical and environmental zzso
