zzso is a zzso zzso factor expressed in peripheral sensory zzso and in specific zzso of the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso is regulated by a specific upstream zzso the activity of which is greatly increased in zzso knockout mice, zzso that zzso zzso regulates its own zzso zzso binds to highly zzso sites within this zzso and zzso of these sites zzso zzso regulation of reporter zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso expression levels in the sensory zzso of zzso and zzso mice are similar, demonstrating that zzso can compensate for the loss of one zzso by increasing zzso of the remaining gene zzso zzso transgenic zzso of zzso in the zzso zzso suppresses the expression of the zzso zzso These findings demonstrate that the zzso locus functions as a zzso unit to maintain a constant expression level of this key regulator of neural zzso
