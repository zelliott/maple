zzso zzso zzso zzso functions downstream of zzso and growth factor receptors to promote tumor cell zzso and zzso In zzso cancer, zzso is activated by zzso zzso a zzso zzso However, it is unclear how zzso receives signals from the zzso zzso or other zzso receptors that can promote cell zzso and zzso The zzso zzso exchange factor zzso zzso binds zzso and zzso zzso focal zzso formation on zzso Here we report that zzso zzso and protein expression are significantly increased during zzso tumor zzso In human colon zzso cells, zzso forms a complex with zzso and upon zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso focal zzso where it zzso zzso zzso of zzso short hairpin zzso zzso of zzso or zzso or pharmacological zzso of zzso activity, is sufficient to block zzso zzso zzso cell zzso and zzso formation in a manner dependent upon upstream zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso but not zzso zzso acid zzso lacking the zzso binding zzso disrupted zzso zzso interaction and prevented zzso zzso and cell zzso zzso by zzso zzso cells formed smaller, less invasive tumors with reduced zzso zzso of zzso upon zzso zzso compared with zzso zzso Our studies identify zzso as a novel regulator of colon zzso zzso and invasion, and they show that a zzso linkage promotes colon zzso progression in zzso
