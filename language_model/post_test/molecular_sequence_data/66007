The zzso zzso zzso zzso are a genetically and clinically zzso group of zzso degenerative diseases characterized by selective zzso loss in the zzso tracts and zzso zzso Although numerous mechanisms involving defective zzso transportation, zzso zzso and increased zzso stress have been proposed, the zzso basis underlying the zzso loss is zzso We have performed linkage analysis to refine the extent of the zzso disease locus and conducted sequence analysis of the genes located within this zzso This identified sequence zzso in the zzso zzso zzso associated with this pure form of zzso In the liver, zzso offers an alternative zzso for cholesterol degradation and also provides the primary zzso route for the modification of zzso zzso in the zzso These findings provide the first direct evidence of a pivotal role of altered cholesterol metabolism in the zzso of zzso degenerative disease and identify a potential for therapeutic intervention in this form of zzso
