zzso expressed zzso zzso target zzso is a recently identified gene whose zzso is zzso affected by zzso in zzso human lung cancer cells and who is a new member of the zzso zzso protein zzso Here, we report that mouse zzso zzso contains a zzso open reading frame that encodes a predicted zzso of zzso acids with a relative molecular mass of zzso zzso The mouse and human zzso sequences show zzso and zzso zzso at the zzso and zzso acid level, zzso Mouse zzso is predicted to be a nuclear protein with two nuclear zzso signals zzso two zzso regions, and a domain that shows significant identity to a region that defines the zzso zzso Green fluorescent protein zzso full-length mouse zzso zzso into zzso cells showed zzso predominantly in the zzso zzso zzso chain reaction amplification, Northern zzso and Western zzso analyses showed expression of mouse zzso zzso and protein throughout mouse zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso is expressed in multiple zzso in a defined zzso pattern during mouse zzso The heart and primitive brain were the first zzso of the zzso that showed zzso for the zzso zzso by day 8 of development zzso In the developing mouse brain, the zzso zzso was intensely stained for zzso in all stages of zzso The spinal zzso and zzso root zzso were also positive for zzso zzso beginning in the zzso zzso zzso where homogeneous zzso was observed throughout the developing zzso By day 16 of development zzso only a small subset of the zzso population in the spinal zzso and zzso root zzso was positively stained for zzso zzso zzso increased steadily with maturation as the differentiation of cartilage and zzso proceeded and reached a maximum in the growth plate during zzso zzso zzso expression was also detected in multiple zzso cell types in zzso including mouse zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso acid or sodium zzso to zzso zzso cells showed a rapid decrease in expression of zzso protein occurring by 1 zzso that continued to decrease to almost zzso levels after 24 zzso zzso of full-length mouse zzso expression zzso with zzso or zzso zzso reporter plasmids into zzso zzso cells significantly increased the level of zzso reporter zzso while decreasing the level of zzso reporter transcription, suggesting that zzso may play multiple roles in modulating zzso zzso These findings suggest new roles for the zzso zzso during zzso and zzso
