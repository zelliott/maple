zzso zzso are a group of short zzso 22 zzso zzso zzso that play important regulatory zzso zzso precursors zzso are characterized by their hairpin zzso However, a large amount of similar zzso can be folded in many zzso Almost all current methods for zzso prediction of zzso use comparative zzso approaches to identify putative zzso from candidate zzso zzso zzso method for distinguishing zzso from sequence segments with zzso hairpin structures is zzso Being able to zzso real zzso zzso zzso is important both for understanding of the nature of zzso and for developing zzso zzso prediction methods that can discovery new zzso without known zzso 

A set of novel features of local zzso zzso information is proposed for distinguishing the zzso of real zzso and zzso zzso Support zzso machine zzso is applied on these features to zzso real zzso zzso zzso achieving about zzso accuracy on human zzso zzso the zzso zzso built on human data can correctly identify up to zzso of the zzso from other species, including plants and virus, without utilizing any comparative zzso zzso 

The local zzso features reflect zzso and zzso characteristics of zzso and the successful zzso zzso zzso of real and zzso zzso opens a new approach for discovering new zzso
