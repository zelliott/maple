To construct the zzso expression zzso of the zzso sequence zzso zzso zzso zzso of human zzso protein zzso and express it in zzso zzso 

Total zzso was extracted from human zzso zzso zzso and subjected to reverse transcription, then the human zzso zzso gene was amplified by zzso zzso The zzso product was cloned into zzso zzso and confirmed by restriction zzso zzso and DNA zzso Then the specific zzso zzso zzso was zzso into zzso zzso to form zzso zzso expression zzso zzso cells were zzso with the zzso zzso and the stable clones were selected by zzso The expression of zzso was identified by zzso zzso 

zzso zzso zzso and DNA sequence analysis revealed that the sequence zzso signal zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso had six zzso zzso compared with that of the established human zzso zzso The expression products of the selected zzso positive cell clones were detected by zzso zzso zzso 

The construction of the zzso expression zzso of zzso zzso of human zzso and its successful expression in zzso cells are helpful to further study of the role of zzso
