zzso of human zzso zzso zzso reverse zzso requires formation of a complex containing the viral zzso zzso zzso and reverse zzso zzso The zzso and the primer zzso form several zzso interactions in addition to zzso of the primer 3' end to the primer binding site zzso These interactions are crucial for the efficiency and the specificity of the initiation of reverse zzso However, as they are located upstream of the zzso they must unwind as DNA synthesis zzso Here, the dynamics of the complex during initiation of reverse zzso was followed by zzso zzso Our data revealed zzso effects of the zzso structure of the zzso complex and reverse zzso zzso at a distance from the zzso zzso The structure of the initiation complex allowed zzso to interact with the template strand up to 20 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso zzso zzso addition by zzso modified the zzso structure of the complex at 10-14 zzso from the zzso zzso The viral sequences became exposed at the surface of the complex as they zzso from the zzso following primer zzso However, the counterpart zzso sequences became buried inside the zzso Surprisingly, they became exposed when zzso prevented the zzso interactions in the initial complex, indicating that the fate of the zzso depended on the zzso structure of the initial zzso
