We studied 36 DNA samples of 18 patients affected with chronic zzso leukemia zzso for the presence of zzso in the first zzso of the zzso gene was divided into four regions amplified by zzso chain reaction zzso By single strand zzso zzso analysis zzso and direct sequencing of amplified fragments, we found different zzso profiles in 9 out of 18 patients in the zzso zzso spanning zzso zzso In one patient, sequence analysis revealed the presence of a point zzso at zzso zzso zzso zzso No difference was found between DNA samples collected during the chronic phase and the zzso zzso No different mobility shifts of single stranded zzso products were found in the other amplified zzso The zzso of zzso involves direct interaction between zzso first zzso sequences and the zzso zzso regulatory zzso of zzso In the first zzso zzso and around the zzso sequences two zzso sites, are zzso These zzso are essential for zzso zzso Our results demonstrate the presence of point zzso in this regulatory region, which may suggest a role for the altered zzso sequence in zzso of the zzso zzso
