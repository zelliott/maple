Many zzso zzso drugs act at zzso II zzso zzso by stabilizing zzso complexes with DNA formed by this zzso Several cell lines, selected for resistance to zzso zzso drugs, show decreased expression or activity of zzso II, suggesting that such a decrease may be responsible for drug zzso In the present study, zzso resistance was used as the selection strategy to isolate genetic zzso elements zzso from a zzso library expressing random fragments of human zzso II zzso zzso zzso Twelve zzso were isolated, zzso either peptides corresponding to short segments of the zzso II alpha zzso zzso of the zzso or zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso led to decreased cellular expression of the zzso II alpha zzso Both types of zzso induced resistance to several zzso II poisons but not to drugs that do not act at zzso zzso These results provide direct evidence that zzso of zzso II results in resistance to zzso zzso drugs, indicate structural zzso of zzso II capable of independent functional zzso and demonstrate that expression selection of random fragments constitutes an efficient approach to the generation of zzso in zzso zzso
