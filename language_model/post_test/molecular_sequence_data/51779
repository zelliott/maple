zzso formed by the interaction of zzso charged zzso and beta zzso I zzso zzso are the target of zzso in systemic lupus zzso The highly positively charged fifth zzso domain of human beta zzso was produced as a fusion protein in an zzso coli expression system and was shown to bind to the zzso charged zzso zzso almost as well as the intact zzso In an attempt to define the zzso structure of this domain, the zzso linkage pattern was determined and shown to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3-6 in contradiction to an earlier zzso In the light of this information, the sequence of the fifth domain of beta 2 I zzso zzso is readily aligned with that of the 16th repeat of factor zzso of which the zzso structure is known, and a model of beta zzso has been built by zzso On the basis of the model we suggest zzso that might be the target of profitable zzso zzso in zzso zzso
