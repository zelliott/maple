At the turn of the 19th century the first observations of a zzso sex ratio in zzso and populations of the head zzso zzso zzso zzso had been zzso A study by zzso in 1940 on the sex ratio of zzso on prisoners in zzso is still today the subject of zzso This sex ratio distortion had been detected in ten different zzso In the last sixty years no new data have been collected, especially on scalp zzso under economically and socially more developed zzso 

Here we report a female bias of head zzso in a survey of zzso school children in zzso This bias is independent of the intensity of the zzso which makes local mate competition highly unlikely as the source of the zzso sex zzso however, other possible zzso mechanisms cannot be zzso These zzso as well as zzso from pupils in Britain were carrying several strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the most wide spread zzso sex ratio zzso Similar zzso strains are also present in the pig zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this zzso might have a marked influence on the biology of the whole zzso The presence of a related zzso nutritional zzso in zzso prevents the investigation of a zzso link between sex ratio and zzso 

Regardless of its origin, this sex ratio distortion in head zzso that has been reported world zzso is stable over time and is a remarkable zzso from the stability of zzso selection of zzso sex zzso A female bias first reported in 1898 is still present over a hundred years and a thousand generations zzso
