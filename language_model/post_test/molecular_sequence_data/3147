zzso zzso zzso gel zzso analysis identified two zzso zzso zzso zzso cell wall zzso of 40 and 87 zzso expressed under zzso growth conditions in zzso and in zzso zzso sequencing and subsequent zzso analysis showed that these proteins are zzso by adjacent zzso open reading frames designated zzso and zzso zzso Studies with an zzso zzso fur zzso confirmed that expression of zzso and zzso is regulated by zzso but that there also appears to be differential expression of these proteins in different zzso media in zzso zzso and zzso share some zzso acid sequence zzso with each other and with a putative zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso is the first gene of a zzso zzso zzso four proteins of unknown function zzso zzso zzso and zzso and the binding protein zzso and zzso zzso of a putative iron zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso and zzso are not required for growth of zzso zzso under zzso conditions in zzso and do not appear to be involved in the transport of iron from zzso or in binding of zzso Further zzso analysis suggested that zzso may be involved in zzso of zzso zzso to plastic in zzso zzso of zzso zzso to zzso zzso was found to be iron zzso and zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso but not zzso zzso showed reduced binding compared to zzso construct zzso
