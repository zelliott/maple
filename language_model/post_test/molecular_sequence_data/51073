Each of the two active sites of zzso zzso contains zzso acid zzso contributed by the other zzso For example, zzso of one zzso binds the zzso group of the zzso zzso in the active site of the other zzso zzso et zzso zzso Science zzso zzso zzso zzso of such zzso should combine with zzso of other inactive zzso to form zzso hybrids with one functional active zzso In zzso and in zzso approaches were used to test this zzso In zzso zzso was accomplished by zzso zzso zzso zzso pools of inactive zzso zzso and pools of inactive zzso zzso into a host strain deficient in zzso zzso Individual inactive zzso of zzso were also zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso was detected by selection or screening for zzso which grew in the absence of zzso and hence produced active zzso Many zzso at each position representing a wide variety of size and charge supported zzso zzso In zzso zzso was accomplished by zzso zzso and unfolding of zzso of zzso individual inactive zzso and zzso zzso zzso With the zzso + zzso zzso the zzso values for zzso and zzso were similar to those of the zzso zzso By zzso zzso with zzso under zzso conditions, we were able to calculate the zzso value for the active zzso The zzso efficiency of the single zzso active site of the zzso + zzso zzso approaches that of the zzso zzso
