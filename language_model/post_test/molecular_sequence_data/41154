A zzso zzso zzso zzso designated strain zzso was isolated from samples of tidal flat zzso from the Yellow zzso zzso zzso gene sequence analysis demonstrated that the isolate belonged to the zzso zzso group 2 and was closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso similarities with related species in other zzso including zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso data supported the affiliation of strain zzso with the zzso zzso The major zzso was zzso the zzso zzso were zzso and zzso the zzso zzso type was zzso zzso the major polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso and several unknown zzso and the major fatty acids were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The most closely related species, zzso zzso and zzso zzso were also assigned to this zzso based on zzso analysis and zzso zzso The results of zzso zzso and zzso tests supported the differentiation of all three zzso from species of the zzso zzso with zzso published zzso Thus, strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso It is also proposed that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso be transferred to the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
