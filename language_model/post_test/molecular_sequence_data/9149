zzso are highly specialized zzso zzso that have pivotal roles in numerous biological zzso including zzso sensory zzso zzso in zzso zzso and transport cause zzso human zzso zzso in over 30 different genes can lead to zzso zzso and complex interactions exist among zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein 290 zzso zzso lead to distinct clinical manifestations, including zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso cause of zzso due to zzso zzso Mice zzso for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibit zzso zzso retinal zzso that is caused by an zzso deletion in the zzso zzso Here, we show that the domain deleted in the protein zzso by the zzso zzso directly interacts with another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso identified in patients with the zzso zzso syndrome disrupted this zzso In zzso zzso combined zzso zzso of zzso and zzso produced sensory defects in the eye and inner zzso zzso combinations of zzso and zzso zzso in mice led to improved zzso and sensory functions compared with those of either zzso zzso We propose that altered association of zzso and zzso affects the integrity of zzso complexes at the zzso transition zone and zzso zzso zzso of the sensory zzso caused by specific zzso in one protein by removal of an interacting zzso suggests a possible novel approach for treating human zzso
