zzso zzso is a major cortical zzso zzso of rainbow trout eggs that is characterized by the attachment of a zzso acid structure to its zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that the zzso acid structure is zzso by at least three zzso mostly localized in cortical zzso Here we have cloned a zzso zzso the zzso designated zzso responsible for the transfer of the first zzso acid zzso onto the zzso chain of zzso This zzso belongs to the zzso zzso II family, and is strongly expressed in zzso Of those zzso tested as zzso zzso is the best zzso These results indicate that zzso is the zzso responsible for the zzso of zzso during zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso is expressed throughout zzso is zzso at the late zzso zzso stage zzso and then zzso during zzso (until zzso This zzso profile is highly similar to that of zzso a cortical zzso zzso while it is quite different from that of zzso which is extensively expressed at the zzso zzso stage and zzso at later zzso Thus, not all cortical zzso components are transcribed zzso This is the first description of a zzso change in the zzso of a zzso during zzso
