While zzso coli has one of the most comprehensive zzso of zzso verified zzso regulatory interactions of any zzso it is still far from zzso This presents a problem when trying to combine gene expression and regulatory interactions to model zzso regulatory zzso Using the available regulatory interactions to predict new interactions may lead to better coverage and more accurate zzso Here, we develop zzso zzso zzso Network zzso a zzso learning method that uses a curated database of verified zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence binding zzso and a compendium of gene expression data in order to make thousands of new predictions about zzso zzso zzso including whether the zzso factor activates or zzso the zzso Using zzso binding zzso for several zzso factors, we demonstrate that our zzso zzso strategy improves the prediction of targets for a given zzso zzso To further demonstrate the utility of our zzso zzso we generated a new zzso gene expression zzso for the zzso to zzso shift response in zzso zzso We used our zzso interactions with the verified interactions to reconstruct a dynamic regulatory network for this zzso The network reconstructed when using our zzso interactions was better able to correctly identify known regulators and suggested additional zzso and zzso as having important roles during the zzso shift zzso
