Although many zzso virus proteins have been identified and studied in detail, only a few studies have attempted a comprehensive survey of the protein composition of the zzso zzso These projects have identified the major proteins of the zzso zzso but little has been accomplished to identify the unknown or less abundant zzso zzso a detailed knowledge of the viral zzso of zzso virus will be important for advancing our understanding of zzso biology, and should facilitate the development of effective zzso drugs and zzso of zzso 

In order to accomplish this task, zzso zzso zzso were zzso into a soluble protein enriched fraction zzso proteins and lateral zzso and an zzso protein enriched fraction zzso zzso Each of these zzso was subjected to further zzso by either sodium zzso zzso gel zzso or by reverse phase high performance liquid zzso The soluble and zzso zzso were also analyzed directly with no further zzso The samples were prepared for mass zzso analysis by zzso with zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by using either a zzso assisted laser zzso zzso time of flight tandem mass zzso a zzso zzso trap mass zzso or a zzso of flight mass zzso (the latter two instruments were equipped with zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified by searching zzso tandem mass zzso against a zzso virus protein database created by our lab and a zzso protein zzso 

Sixty three zzso proteins were identified in the zzso zzso The total number of peptides found for each protein ranged from 1 to 62, and the sequence coverage of the proteins ranged from zzso to zzso Interestingly, two zzso open reading frames were confirmed as being expressed as novel zzso zzso and zzso
