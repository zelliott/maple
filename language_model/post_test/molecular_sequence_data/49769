The zzso zzso are a closely related zzso of the zzso zzso Most of the zzso zzso genes form a cluster on zzso 11 in mice and zzso 17 in zzso To date, 11 and 16 functional genes have been localized within the mouse and human zzso zzso zzso some of the genes within these clusters appear to have no counterparts between the two species, and the zzso relationships of some of the genes are difficult to establish solely on the basis of zzso acid zzso In this study, we have taken a comparative zzso approach to reveal some of the features that may be involved in the dynamic evolution of these gene zzso We zzso a zzso region containing five zzso genes of the mouse zzso zzso This mouse sequence was combined with those determined by the Mouse Genome zzso Project, and the entire sequence of the mouse zzso cluster was compared with that of the corresponding cluster in the human zzso by percent identity plot and zzso zzso Although no additional zzso genes have been found in these zzso our analysis has revealed that numerous gene zzso have occurred even after the diversification of zzso and zzso resulting in several zzso zzso genes and zzso In addition, zzso analysis and comparison of the zzso sequences zzso identified the zzso relationships of some of the zzso genes in the mouse and human zzso gene zzso
