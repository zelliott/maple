We report the initial characterization of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain Norma, and its zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso The Norma strain singled out during a zzso outbreak in cattle zzso with zzso from the reference strain zzso zzso By applying a microscopic zzso zzso test zzso to cattle zzso zzso zzso with symptoms of zzso between 2003 and 2007, more than 50% of zzso were found positive for one of the following zzso zzso zzso zzso Norma zzso zzso zzso zzso Mini zzso and zzso zzso In zzso trials using six zzso plus Norma zzso the zzso of zzso in these zzso was observed following 6 months of the initial zzso To provide molecular ground for the high zzso Norma frequency found in these zzso a DNA zzso analysis was conducted by comparing the Norma isolate with reference strains zzso and zzso The zzso analysis in zzso showed five base changes in Norma relative to zzso strain, corresponding to zzso identity, while zzso displayed 49 zzso sites relative to the zzso strain, representing zzso zzso The alignment of zzso translated sequences shows no differences between zzso and Norma, and eight zzso between zzso zzso and strain zzso zzso zzso located these variations within the loop region connecting zzso 7 and 8 from zzso which is less zzso DNA sequencing of zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a single zzso between zzso and Norma, and 13 zzso between strains zzso zzso and zzso The differences between zzso and Norma were confirmed by low stringency zzso primer zzso chain reaction zzso signature experiments with the primer zzso using as template the 285 zzso zzso initially amplified with zzso zzso
