The zzso 18 zzso gene is zzso in cells of zzso clones isolated from the zzso human colon zzso cell line, compared to cells of zzso zzso The isolated minimal promoter zzso box and initiation zzso of the zzso gene has by itself a differential activity in zzso and zzso zzso An zzso binding site located upstream of the zzso box contributes to the high level of expression of the gene in zzso zzso We report here that the zzso gene is not zzso expressed between the two cell types and that this is also the case for genes coding for factors of the zzso complex known to directly interact with the zzso zzso Further, zzso I zzso experiments and zzso analysis indicated that the mechanism responsible for the differential activity of the minimal zzso promoter apparently does not involve the binding of a factor to a specific zzso During the course of these experiments, it was found that the initiation site of the zzso promoter is actually located 11 zzso upstream of the zzso position previously reported and that the zzso box is the only essential element of the minimal zzso Treatment of the cells with zzso zzso zzso was more efficient at stimulating the activity of the zzso promoter in zzso cells than in zzso zzso We propose that zzso of the zzso gene in zzso cells could result from of a high level of zzso of zzso and/or of factors controlling the activity of the zzso zzso
