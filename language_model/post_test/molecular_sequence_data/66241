In protein analysis using mass zzso proteins are usually separated by zzso and zzso within the gel with zzso such as zzso However, analysis of zzso proteins is difficult due to the low recovery of zzso zzso fragments from the gel as well as their low zzso efficiency during mass zzso In this study, we developed a simple extraction method with zzso following zzso extraction that efficiently zzso zzso fragments from zzso This method allowed us to analyze the structure of zzso fragments, suggesting the zzso of the method for analysis of zzso fragments by mass zzso
