Much attention has focused on a small set of zzso factors that maintain human or mouse embryonic stem zzso cells in a zzso zzso To gain a more complete understanding of the regulatory network that maintains this state, we identified target promoters of nine zzso factors, including zzso cell zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso and others zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso on a global scale in mouse zzso zzso We found that target genes fall into two zzso promoters bound by few factors tend to be inactive or zzso whereas promoters bound by more than four factors are largely active in the zzso state and become zzso upon zzso Furthermore, we propose a zzso hierarchy for zzso factors and broadly distinguish targets of zzso versus other zzso Our data provide a resource for exploration of the complex network maintaining zzso
