zzso zzso through a family of zzso called zzso zzso zzso is a major mechanism by which bacteria zzso resistance to zzso zzso Members of the zzso zzso are of particular clinical interest because of their prevalence in zzso strains and their broad zzso zzso zzso zzso display differential preferences between zzso or zzso as the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso being a member that zzso both zzso at comparable zzso We report here four crystal structures of zzso two of the wild type zzso and two of single zzso acid zzso each in complex with either zzso or zzso Together, these structures afford a detailed look at the zzso site architecture for this zzso and reveal key elements that zzso dual zzso zzso including a zzso network in the interior of the zzso pocket and the zzso of an zzso zzso zzso Steady state kinetic studies, as well as sequence and structural comparisons with members of the zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso the different zzso preferences for these zzso Finally, despite poor overall sequence similarity and structural zzso analysis of the zzso pocket of zzso shows a striking resemblance to that of zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso which also exhibits dual zzso zzso These results, in complement with the multitude of existing zzso against zzso can serve as a structural basis for the design of zzso zzso against clinically relevant zzso zzso
