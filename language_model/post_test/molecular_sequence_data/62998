MAD family proteins are zzso zzso that antagonize the functions of zzso zzso In particular, zzso has been demonstrated to interfere with zzso zzso transformation and zzso The zzso gene is expressed in distinct patterns, mainly associated with differentiation and zzso We observed that zzso is directly activated by zzso in zzso cell zzso To investigate the zzso regulation of the human zzso zzso we have cloned and characterized its zzso A region of high zzso between the zzso zzso of human, mouse and rat contains the core promoter, marked by open zzso high zzso content and the lack of a zzso zzso Using deletion zzso we identified two zzso occupied by zzso and beta in the zzso region that mediate responsiveness to zzso zzso zzso The necessary signals include the zzso of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso does not bind directly to promoter DNA, but is recruited by zzso In zzso our studies provide a first analysis of the zzso promoter and suggest zzso functions as a zzso zzso in the regulation of the zzso zzso Our findings provide the base for the characterization of additional signal zzso pathways that control the expression of zzso
