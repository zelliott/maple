Complex I is the most complicated of the zzso zzso that constitute the zzso respiratory zzso It is zzso by both zzso and nuclear zzso We have previously characterized the human zzso gene that encodes the zzso zzso This essential zzso is thought to participate in the electron transfer and zzso pumping activities of complex zzso Here, we have analyzed the zzso regulation of the zzso zzso Using primer extension zzso we have identified two zzso start zzso The zzso promoter was mapped to a 247 zzso sequence upstream from the main zzso start site by reporter gene analysis in zzso cells and in differentiated or zzso zzso zzso Three zzso sites and one zzso site were identified in this minimal zzso Through gel shift analysis, all sites were shown to bind to their zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that the zzso site and two upstream adjacent zzso sites drive most of the promoter zzso This work represents the first promoter analysis for a complex I zzso Together with previous studies, our results indicate that zzso and zzso control the expression of genes zzso proteins that are involved in almost all steps of the zzso zzso zzso
