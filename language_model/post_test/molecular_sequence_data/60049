Twelve proteins from zzso regions and five from flexible regions zzso zzso of the zzso of Cancer zzso have been zzso and zzso One of the proteins from zzso zzso is identical to one of the zzso membrane zzso Several of the proteins from the zzso regions resemble proteins from corresponding regions of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in containing either two or four copies of an zzso sequence zzso which so far has been found only in zzso zzso zzso The proteins obtained from the flexible zzso zzso resemble the proteins from lobster zzso zzso and the similarities are shared with a number of proteins from flexible zzso in insects, indicating that the common features in these proteins may be important for the mechanical properties of the materials in which they zzso
