Many bacterial zzso including zzso zzso harbor zzso zzso a class of transfer factors that carry genes for zzso DNA transfer and, in some cases, zzso zzso zzso zzso are capable of inserting into and zzso other, zzso plasmids and are implicated in the dissemination of zzso zzso This paper presents the isolation and characterization of zzso a new zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso At zzso zzso it is the smallest zzso zzso reported from any bacterial zzso zzso was captured from zzso zzso zzso by using the zzso shuttle zzso zzso The zzso of zzso contain a zzso imperfect zzso zzso and zzso does not result in a target site zzso zzso also demonstrates zzso site sequence preferences characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso in its zzso and two large open reading frames whose predicted protein products exhibit strong sequence similarity to zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, have been zzso The transfer, zzso and zzso properties of zzso have been zzso revealing that zzso zzso plasmids in both zzso zzso and zzso coli at high frequency and also zzso in zzso zzso
