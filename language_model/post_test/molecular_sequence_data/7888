The zzso human zzso stimulating hormone zzso containing zzso terminated with zzso zzso zzso beta 1 showed higher in zzso activity and lower zzso clearance rate zzso than zzso human zzso zzso which contains zzso terminating predominantly in zzso zzso beta zzso To zzso the relative contribution of the zzso and zzso zzso chains of each zzso in the zzso and zzso of the hormone, the alpha and beta zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated, their zzso were zzso and the respective zzso were zzso in various zzso The hybrids containing alpha zzso from zzso or zzso showed higher in zzso activity than those with alpha zzso from zzso indicating that zzso of alpha but not beta zzso zzso the intrinsic activity of zzso In contrast, hybrids with beta zzso from zzso displayed lower zzso compared to those with beta zzso from zzso The zzso zzso beta hybrid had the highest in zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These differences indicated that hybrids with beta zzso from zzso displayed the highest in zzso activity and relatively low zzso probably due to higher zzso more zzso structure, and/or the unique location of the zzso zzso chain in the zzso Thus, the zzso zzso of the beta zzso of zzso hormones have a more pronounced role than those from the alpha zzso in the zzso clearance and thereby in the in zzso zzso In contrast, the terminal zzso of zzso zzso have a major impact on zzso intrinsic zzso
