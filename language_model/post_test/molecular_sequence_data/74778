The zzso sequence analysis of many large zzso viruses is hampered by the lack of enough sample zzso Here, we report a whole zzso amplification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso isolate zzso starting from as few as about 10 zzso of zzso viral DNA by application of zzso DNA zzso and zzso random zzso multiple displacement amplification zzso zzso About 60 zzso of high molecular weight DNA with zzso sizes of up to 25 zzso was zzso A zzso DNA clone library was generated using the product zzso After zzso sequencing coverage, the zzso zzso of zzso whole zzso was zzso zzso The results demonstrate that the zzso whole zzso amplification enables rapid access to zzso information from zzso virus zzso
