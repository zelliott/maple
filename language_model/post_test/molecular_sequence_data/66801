zzso a member of the small zzso zzso is an zzso gene that is expressed in brain, zzso and normal zzso but is zzso in melanoma zzso We demonstrate that in normal zzso zzso zzso with zzso proteins and that a zzso active zzso zzso suppresses their transport to the zzso In the brain, zzso is present throughout the cortex, as well as in the zzso CA zzso A survey of zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso zzso of zzso is an early event that is already prevalent in zzso of giant zzso zzso zzso of zzso DNA revealed that zzso is regulated by DNA zzso of a specific promoter region zzso to the zzso initiation site, and that suppression of zzso in melanoma cells zzso normal processes that control zzso of zzso zzso but not tissue specific gene zzso This information is important for understanding zzso as well as other zzso processes because zzso may have an important role in disorders involving zzso genes associated with zzso zzso
