We previously described the isolation and characterization of the zzso for lung zzso factor zzso a zinc finger zzso factor that is predominately expressed in the lung of adult zzso In this study, we report the complete structure and zzso sequence of the mouse zzso zzso which is comprised of three zzso and two small zzso Moreover, the identification of critical sequence elements required for expression is described using reporter zzso with the zzso promoter zzso into zzso lung zzso zzso from these zzso reveal an important region for zzso activity that lies between the zzso upstream zzso This region contains two zzso zzso binding sites that affect expression levels in a non zzso zzso In addition, using a zzso zzso strategy, a region from zzso was found to be necessary for zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso of the zzso region resulted in approximately zzso loss of promoter zzso This zzso does not appear to zzso to any known zzso factor consensus zzso Moreover, zzso within this zzso disrupt the binding of a protein complex from nuclear extracts of various zzso
