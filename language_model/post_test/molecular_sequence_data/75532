We isolated and characterized zzso zzso in zzso coli that allow zzso zzso zzso zzso protein to function without zzso These zzso defined a region involved in the zzso zzso change of zzso zzso protein that is necessary for zzso of the zzso Currently, we have isolated zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These zzso zzso zzso require zzso for zzso The zzso zzso zzso map in regions which define new sites of changes involved in zzso zzso protein zzso From these results, we suggest that to activate zzso zzso protein zzso brings about zzso a hinge zzso to zzso the zzso F zzso zzso proper alignment between the two zzso and zzso an adjustment between the position of the two zzso zzso zzso fails to effect the last zzso
