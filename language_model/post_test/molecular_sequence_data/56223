zzso sequencing of a zzso zzso DNA zzso from zzso 2 of zzso zzso 2011 revealed the location of the genes zzso zzso and zzso The putative proteins zzso by these genes have molecular weights of 41, 30, and 44 zzso zzso The zzso profile of the zzso zzso acid sequence resembles that of zzso zzso The predicted zzso gene product does not contain zzso regions, indicating a zzso zzso The zzso gene product is characterized by a putative signal zzso and exhibits significant zzso to zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induced pink zzso and zzso a reduced amount of zzso zzso zzso of this zzso showed a delay in the appearance of the zzso white zzso In addition, the formation of the characteristic halo was strongly zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso induced zzso The zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso an zzso that could be zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and also by zzso zzso integration zzso revealed promoter regions preceding zzso zzso and zzso
