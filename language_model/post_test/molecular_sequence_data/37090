The human zzso minor transcript is distinguished from the zzso zzso zzso by an approximately 400 zzso extension of the zzso region, which zzso to the major zzso promoter DNA (its zzso Based on its unusual sequence zzso we hypothesized that the minor transcript zzso might be capable of altering zzso zzso complex assembly at the core promoter, through direct interactions of the zzso with specific regulatory zzso or the promoter DNA zzso We found that the minor transcript zzso selectively sequesters zzso factor zzso and to a lesser extent zzso preventing their binding to the zzso core zzso This allows a third putative zzso regulatory zzso which is relatively resistant to zzso by the minor transcript zzso the opportunity to bind the zzso core zzso The selective zzso of zzso zzso zzso by the minor transcript zzso involves an altered zzso of the zzso and a structural domain of the protein distinct from that required for binding to zzso As a consequence, the minor transcript zzso zzso zzso from the core promoter in zzso (in zzso in a zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso minor transcript may function in zzso (in zzso to regulate the zzso activity of the major zzso zzso
