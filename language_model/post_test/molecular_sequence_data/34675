zzso start sites are critical switches for converting recognition of zzso DNA into active synthesis of zzso Their functional importance suggests that they may be ideal targets for regulating gene zzso Here, we report potent zzso of gene expression by zzso zzso zzso complementary to zzso start sites within human zzso zzso zzso does not require zzso of DNA and differs from all known mechanisms for zzso zzso zzso overlap DNA sequences within the open complex formed by zzso zzso and zzso is acutely sensitive to single base zzso zzso effectively silence both zzso and zzso zzso zzso start sites occur within every zzso providing predictable targets for zzso zzso zzso of multiple genes suggests that zzso may represent a natural mechanism for controlling transcription, may complement zzso and zzso that target zzso and will be valuable agents for zzso gene zzso
