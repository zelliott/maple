The diversity of bacteria in soil is zzso and soil bacterial communities can vary greatly in zzso Here, we employed a zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso gene region to characterize the overall and zzso (A and B zzso bacterial community compositions in nine zzso soils, which covered three different land use zzso The entire data set comprised zzso zzso zzso of which could be classified below the domain zzso The average number of sequences per horizon was zzso The dominant zzso groups present in all samples and horizons were the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Despite these overarching dominant zzso the zzso diversity, and composition of bacterial communities were horizon zzso In almost all cases, the estimated bacterial diversity zzso was higher in the A horizons than in the corresponding B zzso In addition, the zzso was positively correlated with the organic carbon content, the total nitrogen content, and the zzso ratio, which decreased with soil zzso It appeared that lower land use intensity results in higher bacterial zzso The majority of sequences affiliated with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were derived from A zzso whereas the majority of the sequences related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso originated from B zzso The distribution of some bacterial zzso groups and zzso in the different horizons correlated with soil properties such as organic carbon content, total nitrogen content, or microbial zzso
