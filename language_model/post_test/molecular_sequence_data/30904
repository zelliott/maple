An zzso element in the zzso zzso region of the human zzso E zzso known as upstream regulatory element 1 zzso has previously been implicated in the expression of this zzso The zzso element, which spans zzso zzso to zzso of the zzso region of the human zzso E zzso contains two sequences that bind to nuclear zzso as determined by the zzso I zzso zzso In the present study of zzso we have characterized these sequences zzso zzso of one of the footprint zzso at zzso zzso to zzso reduced zzso zzso activity zzso A zzso pair zzso that included this zzso sequence was able, by itself, to act as an zzso This zzso termed the positive element for zzso zzso was demonstrated by gel retention analysis to bind at least two protein factors, one of which is the zzso factor zzso zzso appeared to be the only protein required for the zzso activity of PET to be zzso In zzso zzso zzso showed that the PET sequence was necessary for efficient zzso directed by the zzso promoter and that the PET sequence was the dominant regulatory element in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and PET zzso zzso were used to isolate a second zzso factor, a Mr zzso 55,000 zzso from zzso cell nuclear zzso It appeared to compete with zzso for a common binding site in the PET zzso but it was not required for zzso zzso The second footprint sequence in zzso at zzso zzso to zzso also bound zzso but it was not required for zzso zzso A third zzso region was located at a zzso zzso box element zzso zzso to zzso This region had no zzso activity, but it was required for maximum zzso activity of the zzso zzso Thus, the regulation of zzso gene expression is influenced by different zzso zzso with zzso factor zzso playing major roles in both zzso promoter activity and zzso zzso
