zzso cloning of a zzso zzso from zzso zzso whose zzso oil contains zzso zzso was performed by the zzso method using zzso designed based on zzso zzso The full-length zzso sequence of this zzso consisted of 1978 zzso including a zzso zzso region zzso a deduced protein of zzso zzso zzso which was similar to that of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of this clone in zzso coli yielded an active zzso zzso zzso which converted zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso As for the extraction of reaction products, we performed zzso zzso phase zzso zzso as well as conventional zzso zzso and compared these two extraction zzso
