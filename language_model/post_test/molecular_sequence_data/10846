zzso zzso controls the translation of several maternal zzso during zzso zzso maturation and requires two sequences in the 3' untranslated region zzso the zzso zzso zzso element zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso and translated soon after the induction of zzso and this protein zzso is necessary for a zzso cascade culminating in zzso zzso zzso zzso Other zzso are zzso later, around the time of zzso zzso zzso To determine whether there is a hierarchy in the zzso zzso of maternal zzso we zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso This prevented zzso B4 and zzso A1 and B1 zzso zzso indicating that the zzso of these zzso is zzso zzso To investigate a possible role of zzso zzso in this process, zzso B was injected into zzso lacking zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso but zzso protein zzso was zzso However, zzso of zzso B1 and zzso B4 zzso was still zzso This demonstrates that zzso zzso can induce zzso zzso in the absence of zzso Our data further indicate that although zzso of the zzso binding protein may be involved in the induction of zzso zzso it is not required for zzso zzso We characterized the elements zzso zzso dependence zzso response zzso in the zzso B4 and zzso B1 zzso by zzso zzso For zzso B4 zzso the zzso response elements were in the coding region or zzso zzso For zzso B1 zzso the main zzso response element was a zzso that zzso with the zzso zzso This indicates that the position of the zzso can have a profound influence on the timing of zzso zzso
