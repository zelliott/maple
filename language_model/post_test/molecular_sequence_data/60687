This study was undertaken under the assumption that zzso mimicry plays a role in the zzso of zzso in zzso a unique feature among zzso zzso The zzso protein sequence zzso was scanned using a computer zzso based on an identity zzso algorithm, to identify common zzso acid regions between human zzso and zzso zzso The highlighted motifs were zzso against a database of zzso peptides zzso Of the 28 common sequences between zzso and human zzso zzso only two were found to yield some matches with zzso zzso Both motifs were from zzso The zzso zzso protein was the human protein containing the identified zzso We believe that this theoretical approach can provide a way to predict potentially zzso motifs by search for zzso regions in protein sequence databases without screening a large number of synthetic zzso
