zzso zzso DNA segments containing repetitive sequences were isolated from a zzso zzso library using zzso DNA as a zzso Three fragments containing the repetitive sequences from two of the primary zzso clones were zzso for sequence analysis, which revealed six new zzso repetitive families other than those reported earlier by Singer et zzso zzso zzso Research 15, zzso zzso The frequency of the repetitive sequences in the zzso zzso was estimated at 2 zzso zzso per zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed similarities between these repetitive sequences and that of zzso zzso
