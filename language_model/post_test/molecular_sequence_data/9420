A zzso mild, and versatile method for performing zzso modifications of zzso sequences is zzso It requires only activated molecular zzso in the presence of an zzso zzso in order to zzso zzso side zzso This reaction is fully compatible with most of the zzso zzso discriminates the zzso of differently protected zzso and proceeds in good zzso The mild conditions employed were further proved by performing the zzso of a zzso containing a zzso zzso
