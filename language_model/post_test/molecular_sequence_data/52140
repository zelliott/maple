The regulation of the zzso gene in zzso coli was studied by constructing zzso gene and zzso zzso and analyzing their expression in various zzso strains in response to changes in cell growth zzso zzso of zzso was induced zzso by a shift to zzso growth and a further zzso by the presence of zzso The zzso gene product mediates this zzso response, while nitrate control is zzso by the zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso The zzso and zzso gene products were shown to sense nitrate independently of one another and could each activate zzso expression in a zzso zzso We provide the first evidence that zzso and zzso interact to ensure optimal expression of zzso zzso and zzso proteins are also required for full zzso of zzso zzso and their roles in DNA zzso are zzso Finally, the availability of zzso and iron zzso is necessary for optimal zzso zzso whereas the availability of zzso is zzso Although the role of the zzso gene product in cell metabolism remains uncertain, the pattern of zzso gene expression is consistent with a proposed role of zzso in nitrate zzso by the cell for zzso electron zzso
