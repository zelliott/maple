In the present study, full length of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 genes were zzso and the expression of these zzso were also investigated in zzso zzso The full length zzso sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 genes zzso zzso contained a single open reading frame of 579 zzso coding 193 zzso zzso zzso zzso coding 236 zzso zzso 702 zzso coding 234 zzso acids and zzso zzso coding zzso zzso zzso zzso Number of zzso zzso cells gradually increased after zzso infection and approximately zzso were zzso and zzso were viable in the cells infected with zzso after zzso zzso though approximately zzso were zzso and zzso were dead in zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso in zzso of established cell line was increased by zzso The amounts of zzso of zzso zzso 3 and zzso in zzso cells were not different from those in zzso control zzso
