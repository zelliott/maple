The zzso zzso zzso locus has been widely used as a zzso genetic marker for studies of zzso cell zzso We report here the spontaneous zzso spectrum at the zzso locus in 64 independently isolated zzso of Chinese zzso zzso zzso zzso All nine zzso zzso were simultaneously analyzed via multiplex zzso chain reaction zzso for rapid detection of gene deletions or zzso zzso point zzso were identified by direct sequence analysis of the zzso amplified zzso The molecular nature of zzso zzso errors and insertions was analyzed by zzso direct zzso zzso Single base zzso were found in 24 zzso zzso of which 21 were zzso and 3 were nonsense zzso zzso were about twice as frequent as zzso Fifteen zzso zzso had deletions involving either zzso small fragments zzso single zzso zzso or multiple zzso zzso The majority of deletion zzso zzso were located in regions surrounding zzso 4, 5, and zzso zzso zzso zzso were observed in 15 zzso zzso and affected zzso zzso most zzso resulted in the loss of zzso zzso Two zzso zzso one with a 209 zzso insert in zzso 4 and the other with a 88 zzso insert accompanied by a 24 zzso deletion in zzso 6, represent novel zzso reported for the first time in spontaneous zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
