The zzso end of the zzso monkey virus zzso zzso zzso has been predicted to fold into a complex zzso structure that is thought to play a role in specific zzso zzso In this study, we used a set of zzso that either zzso or recreated the first four stem zzso predicted within the zzso untranslated region zzso zzso for effects on zzso zzso Test of these zzso in our biological zzso revealed that only stem loop 1 zzso was important for the packaging potential of zzso while zzso in none of the other stem zzso affected packaging zzso Interestingly, it was the primary sequence of zzso zzso and not its secondary structure that affected packaging since zzso zzso that reformed zzso were unable to restore the packaging efficiency of the zzso zzso Additionally, our zzso analysis reveals that stem loop 4, predicted to be the major packaging zzso of zzso does not seem to have a significant role in zzso Finally, results of the biological effects of the structural zzso are discussed in relation to their effects on the folding potential of the various stem zzso
