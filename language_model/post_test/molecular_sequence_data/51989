Up to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso consists of a zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso located in the zzso of many if not all zzso zzso repeats from 10 different zzso species representing four zzso were isolated and zzso The zzso sequence variation ranged from zzso to zzso The zzso sequence variation ranged from less than zzso between two species of zzso to approximately zzso between zzso and other zzso The zzso sequences of all 10 zzso species contained several zzso zzso zzso sequence elements at identical locations within the zzso A comparison with zzso repeated DNA sequences in other avian species showed that several of these zzso elements were also present at similar locations within the zzso repeat of the Chilean zzso zzso zzso suggesting a great zzso of the zzso One of the elements was also found in the zzso repeated sequences of the crane zzso and zzso zzso zzso The data were used for the construction of a partial most zzso relationship that supports a regional subdivision of the zzso
