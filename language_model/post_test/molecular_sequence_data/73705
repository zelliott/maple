The clustered zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso factors, control cell fates along the zzso zzso zzso between zzso proteins cause differences between body zzso zzso have 13 zzso subgroups, called zzso groups, which can be correlated with some of the insect and zzso zzso and have remained distinctive for hundreds of millions of zzso We identify characteristic zzso that define the different zzso zzso Some zzso groups can be recognized by the zzso sequence alone; others only by using characteristic zzso outside the zzso zzso characteristic zzso onto the known zzso crystal structure reveals that most of the zzso zzso acids that distinguish zzso groups are oriented away from the DNA, in positions where they might engage in zzso zzso
