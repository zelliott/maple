Group A zzso zzso are the leading cause of viral zzso in children worldwide and zzso zzso is one of the five most common zzso detected in zzso In order to gain insight into the degree of genetic zzso of zzso strains circulating in zzso stool samples were collected during the zzso zzso season in two different geographic regions in Cameroon zzso and Western zzso By zzso 15 zzso strains zzso were identified whose zzso zzso was subsequently determined by complete or partial gene zzso In general, all zzso zzso strains clustered into current zzso zzso of the zzso gene and displayed zzso zzso identity amongst themselves and zzso zzso identity with global zzso zzso The full zzso zzso of all zzso strains was zzso but zzso analysis of each gene revealed that the strains were spread across 4 or more distinct zzso An unusual strain, zzso which shared the zzso constellation of other zzso zzso zzso contained a novel zzso zzso which zzso significantly zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid distance) from previously described zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid alignments revealed that the 3' end of this gene is highly divergent from other zzso zzso genes suggesting that it arose through extensive zzso of point zzso The results of this study demonstrate that diverse zzso strains circulated in Cameroon during zzso
