zzso zzso zzso were treated with zzso and samples enriched with zzso zzso and C fragments zzso zzso et zzso (1984) zzso zzso 95, zzso respectively, were zzso zzso and C fragments were zzso to apparent zzso and an approximately zzso mixture of zzso zzso and zzso fragments free from other zzso was also obtained through gel zzso and zzso zzso in the presence of sodium zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acid sequence analyses of these peptides were carried out in order to identify the zzso zzso sites responsible for the formation of these zzso Both zzso and zzso fragments had the same zzso sequence as A1 zzso Single zzso of A1 at zzso zzso yielded zzso while a zzso between either zzso or zzso zzso designated as zzso resulted in zzso zzso Thus, zzso and zzso fragments differed from A1 zzso only by their loss of short stretches corresponding to the zzso region of the zzso On the other hand, C zzso represented the zzso half of B zzso zzso It had the same zzso sequence as B zzso and was produced by zzso at T4 zzso zzso at zzso and zzso profoundly affected the zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 100, zzso and it was suggested that the segment of the zzso zzso including the region between zzso and zzso is important in zzso the zzso between zzso splitting and zzso
