A minor fraction of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso progress rapidly to AIDS in the absence of zzso immune zzso Common zzso in zzso zzso of zzso in three zzso zzso zzso zzso suggest the evolution of a common viral zzso in zzso zzso The goal of the present study was to analyze the biological properties of these zzso in zzso and in zzso through the derivation of infectious molecular zzso zzso isolated from a zzso zzso macaque, zzso was used to inoculate six zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso dominated in zzso zzso they represented only zzso of the population of the virus stock, suggesting a selective disadvantage in zzso Only one of these zzso zzso progressed rapidly to zzso Plasma virus during primary infection of zzso was similar to the zzso However, zzso zzso were apparently rapidly zzso by 4 to 9 weeks zzso Terminal plasma from zzso was used as a source of viral zzso to generate seven zzso infectious molecular zzso With the exception of one zzso which was similar to zzso clones with zzso zzso zzso with delayed zzso in zzso peripheral blood zzso cells and human zzso zzso None of the clones zzso in zzso or zzso zzso and all used zzso as their major zzso zzso zzso appear to be well adapted to replicate in zzso in zzso zzso but are at a disadvantage in tissue culture compared to their parent, zzso zzso tissue culture may not provide a good surrogate for replication of zzso zzso in zzso These infectious clones will provide a valuable zzso to study the roles of specific viral zzso in rapid progression in zzso
