zzso zzso play an important role in the zzso interactions leading zzso zzso is relevant for dental and zzso zzso as suggested by zzso of zzso zzso in human and zzso zzso zzso Our group showed that zzso gene expression can be regulated by a zzso zzso generating long zzso zzso zzso zzso the expression which is linked to the zzso sense zzso zzso zzso Thus, the aim of the present study was to analyze the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso AS expression analysis showed that zzso the putative promoter sequence but not the transcribed sequence was important and necessary for its zzso zzso 2 different areas of zzso bone can be distinguished depending on zzso S and AS zzso and zzso zzso presence was necessary for zzso AS zzso full zzso In zzso analysis of the zzso AS putative promoter region showed the presence of 4 zzso response elements possibly involved in zzso zzso zzso constitutes an example of a zzso transcribed gene giving rise to an zzso zzso pair included in the big and growing family of AS zzso zzso Our results contribute to defining a link between zzso S and AS zzso resulting in a fine-tuned regulatory loop of zzso zzso The significance of this finding is that zzso of the balance between zzso S and AS zzso status may be associated with tooth zzso and bone zzso
