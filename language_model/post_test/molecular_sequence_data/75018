zzso zzso zzso DNA is a linear zzso with two zzso large zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso near each zzso The DNA sequence of approximately 550 zzso of this region was determined in six species of zzso In three species the zzso beta zzso and zzso genes were not present on one end of the DNA, demonstrating a zzso zzso organization different from that of zzso zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso alpha zzso was used to construct a zzso zzso tree, which was found to be zzso equivalent to a zzso tree based on nuclear small zzso zzso sequences zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 5, zzso The zzso zzso gene was found to accumulate zzso zzso considerably faster than the nuclear zzso zzso the rate difference being similar to that observed for zzso
