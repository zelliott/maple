We have previously defined in the zzso zzso domain of the mouse zzso zzso zzso a critical role for the highly zzso zzso acids zzso zzso in determining zzso pH sensitivity of zzso zzso We have now engineered zzso zzso and individual zzso acid zzso to investigate the importance to zzso regulation of zzso activity of the larger surrounding region of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso was monitored during changes in zzso or zzso in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was profoundly inhibited at low zzso with a zzso value zzso zzso zzso zzso and was zzso up to zzso by zzso zzso Individual zzso of several zzso acid zzso at zzso sites preceding or following the zzso sequence zzso zzso attenuated zzso and/or zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso The largest zzso of pH sensitivity occurred with the zzso zzso zzso This effect was zzso by zzso zzso suggesting a crucial role for zzso zzso modeling of the three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso zzso domain (based on the structure of the corresponding region of human zzso predicts that those zzso shown by zzso to be functionally important define at least one localized surface region necessary for regulation of zzso activity by zzso
