The gene zzso zzso zzso factor X zzso was isolated and characterized from a zzso II library generated from zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence contains zzso zzso that extend from the initiating zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the start zzso were determined and contain putative start sites for the FX zzso as well as sites for binding of putative zzso zzso The sequence extends zzso 3' of the zzso zzso The gene contains 8 zzso and 7 zzso which were determined by comparing the mouse FX zzso and gene zzso The zzso structure of the gene is similar to that of the other zzso vitamin zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These include an zzso zzso the zzso the zzso a short zzso zzso two zzso for the two zzso zzso the zzso zzso and two zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the mouse FX gene zzso with the 3' region of the zzso gene indicating that the zzso zzso and FX gene are arranged in a head to tail arrangement as they are in zzso
