zzso zzso analysis of the DNA extracted zzso virus strain zzso which had been serially zzso in primary bovine zzso cells, revealed a population of zzso that had zzso the zzso zzso At least three distinct zzso forms were identified in which the right end of the zzso had been duplicated and zzso to the left end, accompanied by deletions of sequences at the left zzso zzso of a single zzso isolated from the zzso population revealed that zzso had occurred between zzso zzso In this case, zzso zzso of DNA at the left end of the zzso had been replaced by zzso zzso from the right zzso The zzso resulted in the deletion at the left end of zzso zzso of DNA zzso three genes and the terminal sequences of a fourth zzso The three genes completely deleted were a zzso of zzso a gene that encodes a protein containing zzso repeats and a zzso of the zzso gene of the zzso virus WR zzso Experimental zzso of sheep showed that the genes are also zzso in zzso but that the size of the zzso was reduced, compared with that induced by the zzso and resolved more zzso
