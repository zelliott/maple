The cloning and sequencing of a zzso for human zzso protein zzso is zzso The corresponding zzso has a very short zzso untranslated region initiating with a sequence of 12 zzso characteristic of all zzso zzso protein zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows that human zzso protein zzso has 425 zzso acid zzso and a calculated molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso counterparts of zzso zzso and zzso shows that this protein has a very zzso zzso region and an extremely divergent zzso zzso
