Rather unexpectedly, major zzso complex class zzso mice have a significant population of peripheral zzso T zzso We have investigated these cells at the population and zzso zzso zzso T zzso from class zzso animals are zzso zzso appear early in zzso exhibit the zzso of resting memory cells, are potentially functional by several criteria, and have a diverse T cell zzso zzso They do not include substantially elevated numbers of zzso zzso zzso derived after zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso from class zzso animals include a subset with an unusual zzso pattern, responding to zzso from many mouse strains including the strain of zzso Most members of this subset recognize the major zzso complex class zzso zzso zzso their zzso zzso and T cell zzso usage further suggest the involvement of peptides and/or highly variable zzso zzso
