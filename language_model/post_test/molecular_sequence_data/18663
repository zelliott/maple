Three zzso locations, zzso zzso and zzso were identified in a scanning zzso study of the BK zzso zzso zzso channel zzso zzso where single zzso zzso led to zzso open zzso channels zzso zzso and zzso To understand the mechanisms of the zzso openness of these zzso channels, we individually zzso these three sites into the other 18 zzso zzso We found that charged or polar zzso zzso at each of the sites resulted in zzso open zzso BK channels, with high open probability at negative zzso as well as a loss of zzso and zzso zzso Given the fact that multiple pore zzso in BK displayed zzso zzso zzso openness, we propose that BK channel opening involves structural zzso of the zzso region, where multiple zzso undergo zzso changes that may increase the exposure of their side chains to the polar environment of the zzso
