The zzso accessory protein zzso by zzso from zzso zzso is proposed to bind zzso zzso for transfer to zzso zzso While native zzso possesses a zzso region at its zzso zzso that binds several zzso of zzso the zzso sites associated with zzso zzso are internal to the protein as shown by studies involving truncated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nine potential zzso zzso (five zzso two zzso one zzso and one zzso within zzso were independently zzso by zzso to determine their roles in metal binding and zzso zzso In zzso effects of these zzso on zzso activity were measured in zzso coli strains containing the zzso zzso zzso gene cluster with the zzso zzso zzso Several zzso changes led to reductions in specific activity, with substitution of zzso producing zzso activity below the level obtained from a zzso deletion zzso The zzso properties of zzso zzso zzso proteins were characterized by a combination of equilibrium dialysis and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Ni binding was unaffected for most zzso zzso but zzso proteins zzso at zzso or zzso exhibited greatly reduced affinity for Ni and bound one, rather than two, metal zzso per zzso zzso was identified as the zzso zzso responsible for the previously observed zzso transition at 370 zzso and zzso also was shown to be associated with this zzso zzso zzso zzso provided clear evidence that zzso and zzso serve as zzso to Ni or zzso The results from these and other studies, in combination with prior zzso findings for zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 3, zzso allow us to propose that the zzso protein possesses two zzso zzso sites, each zzso located at the zzso zzso The first equivalent of added Ni or Co binds via zzso and zzso zzso from each zzso of the zzso and two other N or O zzso zzso either functions as a zzso or may affect this site by secondary zzso The second equivalent of Ni or Co binds via the zzso pair of zzso zzso as well as four other N or O zzso In contrast, the first equivalent of zzso binds via the zzso pair and two other zzso donors, while the second equivalent of zzso binds via the zzso pair and at least one zzso zzso zzso sequence comparisons among zzso zzso reveal that zzso zzso and zzso associated with the first site of Ni zzso are highly zzso while the other targeted zzso are missing in many zzso Our data are most compatible with one zzso site per zzso being critical for zzso function as a zzso
