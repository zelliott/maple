Because of their relative zzso synthetic receptors often lack the selectivity observed for zzso zzso such as zzso However, zzso recognition of zzso is limited by the zzso inherent in the four zzso zzso Here, we report the design and selection of a zzso complex in which the specificity of a zzso acid synthetic host zzso that binds to various zzso acids is tuned by a surrounding zzso zzso the synthetic zzso alone has higher selectivity for zzso over zzso the formation of the zzso complex reversed the organic host selectivity to zzso bind zzso The zzso zzso changed upon the introduction of the synthetic host, consistent with an zzso mechanism for zzso
