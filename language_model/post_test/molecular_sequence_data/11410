T cell zzso that produce minor zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed using mixed zzso reaction zzso in zzso or zzso elimination zzso in zzso When zzso zzso T cells from zzso mice were zzso with various T cell zzso from zzso zzso mice in the presence of zzso zzso presenting cells zzso proportions of zzso zzso T cell blasts zzso beta zzso V beta zzso zzso The zzso potency of zzso T cells was higher than that of zzso T zzso Furthermore, among either zzso or zzso T cell zzso zzso T cells appeared to produce larger amounts of zzso zzso than zzso T zzso More marked difference was demonstrated, when zzso zzso T cells were being activated by immobilized zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso Thus, zzso T cells appeared to produce large amounts of zzso zzso on appropriate zzso These findings were confirmed by the zzso analysis of zzso levels of zzso in the zzso T cell zzso When zzso T cells from zzso zzso zzso mice were injected zzso into zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso 1 week after zzso zzso and proportions of V beta zzso T cells were zzso 7 weeks later, significant zzso elimination of V beta zzso T cells was induced among both zzso population and zzso zzso T cell population in a zzso manner of the zzso F1 T zzso zzso of zzso T cells eliminated V beta zzso T cells less efficiently from zzso zzso T cells and zzso of zzso T cells induced no significant zzso elimination of the V beta zzso T zzso The present findings demonstrate clearly that zzso T cells represent the cells producing large amounts of zzso zzso and inducing zzso elimination of V beta zzso T cells in zzso
