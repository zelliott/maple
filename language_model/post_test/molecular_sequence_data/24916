We have identified a gene zzso a novel protein that is zzso regulated by the zzso signaling zzso in zzso This zzso named zzso (for zzso zzso zzso encodes a 114 zzso acid protein that has a unique zzso and a zzso domain containing two zzso zzso A zzso zzso of the zzso gene was previously identified in a large-scale in zzso zzso screen of randomly isolated zzso zzso We demonstrate that in zzso and zzso cell lines expression of the zzso gene is induced by the zzso domain of the zzso zzso and that this induction is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso During mouse zzso the zzso gene is expressed in several zzso in which cellular differentiation is regulated by the zzso signaling zzso zzso of the zzso gene is zzso in zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso indicating that expression of the zzso gene is regulated by the zzso zzso in zzso Thus, zzso transcript levels are regulated by the level of zzso signaling in both cultured cell lines and mouse zzso During zzso the zzso gene is expressed in a pattern that suggests that zzso expression may play a role in the formation of zzso and zzso expression in the zzso zzso is altered in several zzso zzso zzso that exhibit defects in zzso zzso These observations demonstrate that the zzso gene is an zzso zzso zzso target of the zzso signaling zzso
