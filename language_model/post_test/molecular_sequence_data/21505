The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso a member in the zzso family, zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso physically interacts with another zzso zzso protein zzso which is involved in the sorting of zzso zzso to the zzso space as well as zzso zzso protein zzso To zzso the structural basis for their interaction, we determined the crystal structures of zzso and zzso at zzso and zzso zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso adopt a zzso zzso each zzso of zzso displays a zzso zzso fold with a zzso zzso flanked by two zzso on one side, whereas a zzso of zzso consists of a twisted zzso zzso surrounded by five zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso simulation enable us to model a putative complex of zzso which consists of one zzso zzso and two tandem zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The two zzso between the zzso zzso are mainly composed of zzso interactions zzso by complementary zzso and positively charged zzso These results provided the structural insights into the putative function of zzso during zzso protein synthesis via zzso a protein binding to zzso zzso zzso
