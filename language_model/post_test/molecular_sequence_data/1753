Tax protein of human zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso the expression of several cellular genes that are involved in T cell zzso and zzso In this study, it was observed that Tax zzso the expression of human zzso 17 zzso a zzso mainly produced by activated zzso memory T zzso Indeed, zzso zzso was highly expressed in zzso T cells as well as in zzso zzso T cells, whereas it was not zzso in zzso T cell zzso The clinical relevance of these observations was further demonstrated by quantitative assessment of zzso expression in zzso isolated from one zzso zzso To define the zzso zzso of the zzso gene by Tax, the zzso region of this gene was cloned and a reporter gene analysis zzso The presence of a zzso region spanning zzso zzso upstream of the initiation start site was identified, in zzso as well as in zzso cells, zzso with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Finally, Tax zzso were used to show that the zzso zzso of the zzso promoter by Tax was dependent on the zzso zzso As zzso zzso the expression of several zzso zzso these observations provide new insights into the involvement of the Tax protein in the zzso of zzso inflammatory zzso
