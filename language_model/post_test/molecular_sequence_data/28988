zzso is inhibited in the liver by a regulatory protein zzso whose effects are increased by zzso and suppressed by zzso To identify the binding site of these zzso zzso we took advantage of the zzso of zzso to the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso and created 12 different zzso of rat zzso zzso of three zzso predicted to bind to zzso resulted in proteins that were approximately zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso less potent as zzso of zzso and had an at least zzso reduced affinity for the zzso zzso of another zzso of the putative binding site zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in the zzso power and an inversion of the effect of zzso a zzso zzso The replacement of zzso a zzso close to the binding site, by zzso (as in zzso and zzso zzso resulted in a protein that had 20 times more affinity for zzso and 30 times less affinity for zzso These results are consistent with zzso having one single binding site for zzso zzso They also show that a zzso zzso of zzso can lead to a gain of zzso
