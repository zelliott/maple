zzso zzso genes represent a zzso zzso family of zzso factors that play important roles during embryonic zzso zzso family members have been shown to either activate or inhibit gene zzso However, little is known about the zzso within zzso proteins responsible for zzso gene zzso While zzso is known to repress gene zzso the zzso within zzso remains poorly zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso which contains a domain that is highly zzso with zzso and zzso which has been demonstrated to contain a repression domain, only minimally diminishes the ability of zzso to repress gene zzso However, in combination with the zzso zzso deletion of the zzso acids located zzso to the zzso abolished the ability of zzso to repress gene zzso Both of these zzso were capable of zzso gene expression when linked to the zzso DNA binding zzso In contrast to these two repression zzso the zzso was capable of zzso zzso gene expression depending on the promoter zzso zzso analysis of the zzso suggests that this zzso domain is located in the zzso end of the zzso These results reveal a novel zzso repression domain, confirm the presence of a previously implicated domain, and suggest a novel role for the zzso Taken together, these results provide the basis for understanding the molecular mechanism zzso zzso regulates gene expression and subsequently controls embryonic zzso
