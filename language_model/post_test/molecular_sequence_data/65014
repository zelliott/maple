The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso soluble zzso zzso was cloned and characterized from a zzso and partially zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso sequence of the zzso zzso reveals an open reading frame of 1944 zzso zzso a 619 zzso acid zzso mature protein zzso with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso that was estimated to be about 73 zzso including His tag (4 zzso based on zzso zzso zzso zzso activity zzso and the Western zzso using zzso zzso had a sequence similar to other zzso in four zzso regions of the zzso family: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reaction and sequence analysis showed one zzso of 60 zzso in the zzso zzso at positions between zzso and 967 of zzso The cloned zzso zzso showed a maximum activity at pH 6 and optimum temperature of 40 zzso with greater than zzso stability between pH 5 and pH 8 for 16 zzso It was inhibited by zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso zzso activity was not affected by 1 zzso zzso but was inhibited by 1 zzso zzso zzso did not zzso zzso of zzso to zzso yet formed zzso from zzso zzso or zzso from zzso and zzso from zzso zzso did not zzso soluble starch in the present of zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso was carried out by using starch as a zzso and the zzso type of zzso was the mixed zzso type zzso zzso zzso zzso
