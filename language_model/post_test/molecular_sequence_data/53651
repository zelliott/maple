A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso a member of nuclear zzso zzso and its zzso truncated zzso zzso were previously zzso Due to lack of the identity box zzso and zzso function 2 zzso domain, zzso lacks zzso function and fails to zzso with zzso zzso zzso in regulating zzso It was speculated that the zzso might be involved in the zzso zzso In the present study, the function of the zzso was zzso In the absence of the zzso or with an altered zzso 9, the zzso of zzso was not functional, either in the presence or absence of zzso The zzso pull-down zzso showed that zzso and its zzso exerted similar physical contacts with zzso suggesting that the zzso domain zzso is essential for the zzso activity of zzso Moreover, nuclear zzso zzso selectively activated zzso with the zzso but exerted no effect on zzso indicating that the zzso is able to interact with the zzso By deletion study and analysis of the identified zzso in zzso binding domain, other regions of zzso critical for its zzso were also zzso zzso with the zzso analysis, zzso was active only in the presence of the zzso We also identified a novel zzso domain zzso located in the hinge region zzso acids zzso although the activity of zzso was inhibited by its zzso zzso We suggest that the D and E regions of zzso possess both positive and negative zzso functions, and zzso zzso may zzso the full zzso activity of the zzso
