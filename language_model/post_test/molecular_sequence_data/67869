The origin of zzso eyes is still zzso The zzso zzso of zzso our most primitive zzso relative, has long been recognized as a candidate precursor to the zzso zzso However, the zzso frontal eye is composed of simple zzso cells, unlike zzso rods and cones, which display more elaborate, zzso zzso So far, the only evidence that the frontal eye indeed might be sensitive to light has been the presence of a zzso putative sensory cell in the close vicinity of dark zzso zzso We set out to characterize the cell types of the zzso frontal eye zzso to test their possible zzso to the cell types of zzso zzso We show that the cells of the frontal eye specifically zzso a combination of zzso factors and zzso typical of the zzso eye zzso and an zzso zzso alpha zzso of the G zzso indicating an zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the pigmented cells match the retinal pigmented zzso in zzso content and regulatory zzso Finally, we reveal zzso projections of the frontal eye that resemble the basic zzso circuit of the zzso zzso These results support zzso of the zzso frontal eye and the zzso eyes and yield insights into their evolutionary zzso
