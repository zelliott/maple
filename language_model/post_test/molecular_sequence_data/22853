Plants can defend themselves against zzso by attracting natural enemies of the zzso The cues for attraction are often complex zzso of zzso plant zzso making it difficult to demonstrate the role of specific zzso After zzso by zzso larvae, zzso releases a mixture of zzso that is highly attractive to females of various zzso zzso zzso We identified the zzso zzso zzso that forms zzso zzso and other zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso The corresponding gene is expressed in response to zzso attack and is regulated at the transcript zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso resulted in plants emitting high quantities of zzso zzso products identical to those released by zzso Using these transgenic zzso plants as odor sources in zzso zzso showed that females of the zzso zzso zzso learn to exploit the zzso zzso to locate their zzso hosts after prior exposure to these zzso in association with zzso This dissection of the zzso volatile blend demonstrates that a single gene such as zzso can be sufficient to mediate the indirect defense of zzso against zzso zzso
