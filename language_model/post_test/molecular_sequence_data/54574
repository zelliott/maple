zzso transmission can occur in a zzso or graded fashion, depending on whether zzso release is triggered by action zzso or by gradual changes in membrane zzso zzso differences of these two types of fusion events and their differential regulation in a zzso context have yet to be zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso protein that has been proposed to regulate both spontaneous and zzso synaptic zzso zzso zzso 

Here we examine zzso function at a graded zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are viable, although nervous system function is significantly zzso Loss of zzso results in a zzso increase in the rate of zzso synaptic transmission at the zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso fusion is decreased zzso A truncated zzso missing its zzso domain can rescue zzso synaptic zzso zzso but fails to suppress zzso activity, demonstrating that these two modes of zzso can be distinguished at the molecular zzso A zzso zzso with impaired zzso binding also zzso zzso but not zzso neurotransmitter zzso Finally, zzso but not zzso release can be rescued in a zzso point zzso by removing zzso zzso of either form of zzso partially restores zzso behavior, indicating that both types of synaptic transmission are zzso 

These observations suggest a dual role for zzso suppressing zzso zzso driven by low levels of zzso neural activity, while promoting zzso fusion of zzso driven by a zzso zzso Thus, patterns of synaptic activity regulate zzso zzso and zzso roles at a graded zzso
