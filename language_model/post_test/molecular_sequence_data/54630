zzso protein 78 zzso is expressed abundantly in various types of cancer cells and is believed to contribute to zzso zzso In this study, we investigated the effect of a continuous approach for the expression of a short hairpin zzso zzso targeted to zzso with zzso zzso on the sensitivity to the zzso drugs zzso and zzso The reduction of zzso expression failed, and the expression of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso this increase was associated with a mild zzso of the unfolded protein response in zzso cells, which were zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso The zzso cells exhibited similar sensitivity to zzso cell death when compared to control zzso zzso zzso zzso However, sensitivity to zzso cell death was higher in zzso zzso zzso cells compared to control zzso These results demonstrate that the continuous or prolonged approach targeting zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells to zzso independently of the zzso of zzso zzso The role of the unfolded protein response in zzso to zzso is zzso
