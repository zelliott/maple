The members of the zzso like zzso zzso zzso are zzso zzso zzso that play a key role in the control of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso to zzso We report on the isolation of a new zzso member of the family, designated zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso established that zzso is more divergent from known zzso zzso than is zzso zzso based on examination of zzso zzso together with mapping within zzso identified by the zzso Genome Project, placed the gene at zzso on the left arm of the second zzso zzso zzso zzso in this region, including all known relevant zzso zzso were examined and proven not to be zzso in zzso zzso of spatial and zzso expression of zzso and its gene product showed that it zzso itself in patterns which can be consistent with a role in cell cycle zzso
