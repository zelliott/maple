zzso zzso oxide zzso zzso is targeted to the cell membrane via interactions of its extended zzso domain with zzso zzso of zzso proteins including zzso and zzso The formation of zzso between the zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso of zzso proteins requires a stretch of continuous zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso In this work, we show that a zzso zzso zzso the zzso extension of the extended zzso zzso domain is capable of binding to zzso The structure of the zzso zzso in zzso solution was determined using zzso zzso zzso The free zzso adopts a zzso zzso finger structure in zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso extension zzso of the zzso zzso domain may represent a relatively independent structural unit in the mediation of the interaction between zzso and zzso zzso proteins including zzso and zzso
