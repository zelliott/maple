While the highly consistent gene order and zzso zzso patterns of expression seem to be a feature of zzso zzso gene zzso this pattern may be less well zzso across the rest of the zzso We report the first zzso instance of an intact zzso cluster with a unique gene order where the zzso groups are not expressed in a sequential zzso The finished sequence from zzso clones from the zzso of the sea urchin, zzso zzso reveals a gene order wherein the anterior genes zzso zzso and zzso lie nearest the zzso genes in the cluster such that the most 3' gene is zzso (The gene order is zzso 2, 3, zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, 7, 6, zzso The finished sequence result is zzso by restriction mapping evidence and zzso scaffold zzso Comparisons with a putative ancestral zzso zzso gene cluster suggest that the zzso leading to the sea zzso gene order were many and zzso
