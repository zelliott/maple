Bone zzso B cell precursors frequently rearrange the zzso heavy chain variable zzso gene segment zzso It is puzzling, therefore, that mature B cells in adult mice rarely express zzso chains bearing this zzso gene zzso We show in this work in transformed zzso cell lines that two zzso that differ in their zzso joining sequences are not assembled zzso with the B cell zzso surrogate light zzso chain and are not expressed on the cell zzso From these findings, we propose that a B cell precursor zzso expands and proceeds to the next zzso stage only if it expresses a zzso with a zzso domain that, together with the zzso chain, directs the formation of a zzso zzso chain membrane zzso zzso a checkpoint exists early in B cell development, at which zzso chain not only screens B cell precursors for the presence of a full-length zzso but also for a zzso domain that promotes the assembly of a zzso chain zzso
