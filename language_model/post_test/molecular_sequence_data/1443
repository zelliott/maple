Three novel scorpion zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso were shown able to selectively block zzso zzso currents in zzso zzso cells or cultured zzso zzso from rat zzso In zzso experiments, the transient zzso completely disappeared when 1 zzso of the toxins was applied to the external solution whereas the sustained zzso current was zzso The three toxins shared high sequence zzso (more than zzso and constituted a new zzso scorpion toxin zzso zzso zzso of zzso specifically bound to rat brain zzso Under equilibrium binding conditions, maximum binding was 14 zzso of protein and the zzso constant zzso was zzso zzso This zzso value was confirmed by kinetic experiments zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso with zzso bound to its zzso on rat brain zzso showed that they fully inhibited the zzso binding zzso values of 20 and 44 zzso respectively), demonstrating zzso that the three molecules shared the same target in rat zzso A panel of toxins described as specific zzso for different zzso zzso and zzso channels were not able to zzso zzso from its binding zzso Thus, zzso is a new zzso for a still unidentified target in rat zzso In zzso the distribution of zzso binding sites in the adult rat brain indicated a high density of zzso receptors in the zzso zzso superior zzso and zzso
