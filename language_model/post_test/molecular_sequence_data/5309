Treatment of cells with DNA damaging agents leads to induction of a variety of genes involved in different cellular zzso We have applied a zzso gene trap strategy to search for new zzso genes induced by zzso zzso A population of 32 zzso zzso zzso r clones zzso zzso with a gene trap zzso was zzso stained with zzso zzso and analyzed by flow activated cell sorting and replica zzso This strategy allowed isolation of 30 zzso r zzso zzso cell lines expressing zzso only after a DNA damaging zzso For three clones the site of integration and the degree of zzso after zzso treatment were determined by Southern zzso and zzso measurement zzso One cell line zzso zzso showed a single integration site and a zzso zzso induction of zzso activity following zzso zzso zzso transcripts were isolated from induced cells and a portion of the trapped gene was amplified by rapid amplification of zzso zzso zzso analysis and comparison with available gene and protein zzso revealed that the gene was zzso
