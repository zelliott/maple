zzso zzso zzso based on zzso and zzso have the capacity to release zzso zzso over defined lengths of time depending on their composition and to elicit and sustain strong and long-lasting immune responses to protein zzso In the present study, two synthetic multiple zzso peptides zzso zzso and zzso were incorporated into zzso of different zzso zzso and zzso are composed of one or two universal T helper zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and of a B cell zzso derived from the repeat sequence of zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso mice were zzso with these two peptides in different zzso including individual zzso or zzso of zzso with various release properties, zzso zzso zzso zzso or as soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso strong and sustained zzso and zzso responses comparable to those obtained with the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso induced specific zzso zzso zzso similar to those induced by zzso No significant zzso of total serum zzso was detected during this zzso In addition, a boosting effect was obtained when the zzso mice were zzso with a small zzso dose in zzso several months zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso may be a suitable vaccine delivery zzso not only for protein zzso but also for zzso zzso synthetic zzso
