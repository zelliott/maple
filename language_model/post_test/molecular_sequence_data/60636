The cotton rat zzso zzso is a common zzso zzso of the southern United States, Mexico, and Central zzso Using zzso zzso zzso analysis and DNA sequencing techniques, 11 zzso zzso 2 zzso were detected among 180 zzso zzso from zzso County, Oklahoma, zzso The zzso represent a single locus exhibiting a high level of zzso zzso and zzso acid distance values among zzso zzso of zzso zzso were higher than those within zzso zzso and species of zzso Although the distribution of zzso zzso acid zzso among zzso of zzso zzso was zzso to that of zzso and zzso some zzso of the zzso region were more variable in zzso zzso Comparisons of zzso and synonymous zzso indicated a trend toward higher numbers of zzso zzso however, this difference was not significant statistically among zzso zzso zzso To examine evolution of zzso zzso within zzso we performed a zzso analysis that included zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and six Australian species of zzso zzso depicted zzso for each zzso and this zzso between species and gene trees represents a lack of evidence for zzso persistence of zzso among these zzso
