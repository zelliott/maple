We isolated a gene zzso a 218 zzso zzso protein from zzso zzso using a zzso zzso directed against human zzso zzso as a zzso The protein sequence zzso by the zzso gene (for zzso zzso contains extensive stretches of a zzso pattern suggesting that the protein can form coiled coils typical of zzso zzso experiments using zzso zzso raised against a zzso fusion protein showed a zzso structure adjacent to the nucleus in zzso cells bearing the zzso gene on a zzso zzso In mouse zzso cells the zzso zzso zzso stained the zzso zzso bearing disruptions of the zzso gene were viable, but more sensitive to ultraviolet light than zzso zzso suggesting an involvement of zzso in DNA zzso The zzso gene was mapped to zzso 11, 25 zzso from zzso
