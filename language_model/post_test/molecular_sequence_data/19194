The sea zzso zzso zzso is a well-studied model zzso in zzso biology, yet little is known about its associated bacterial zzso In this study, a combination of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reporter zzso in zzso zzso and bacterial culture were used to characterize the bacteria living inside and on the exterior zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequencing data set demonstrated that the tunic bacterial community structure is different from that of the surrounding zzso The observed tunic bacterial consortium contained a shared community of zzso abundant bacterial zzso across three zzso Culture experiments yielded four bacterial strains that were also dominant groups in the zzso sequencing data set, including novel representatives of the classes zzso and zzso The relatively simple bacterial community and availability of dominant community members in culture make zzso zzso a promising system in which to investigate functional interactions between zzso zzso and the development of host innate zzso
