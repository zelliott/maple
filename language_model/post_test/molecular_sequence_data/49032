The internal defense mechanism of the snail zzso zzso during a zzso infection is activated and zzso via the immune zzso cells known as zzso Since resistance and zzso to zzso infection is known to be genetically determined, our interest was to use the zzso approach as a gene discovery tool to examine zzso profiles in zzso of resistant snails zzso and zzso to zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the transcripts suggested that zzso exposure caused an active zzso response in the zzso The most abundant transcripts were those showing zzso similarity to known reverse zzso zzso Further characterization by zzso indicated the zzso transcripts were expressed in normal zzso zzso exposed zzso and the embryonic cell line zzso To determine whether the occurrence of zzso transcripts zzso to the presence of functional zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso were performed from both resistant and susceptible zzso zzso and zzso to zzso using protein extracts from the zzso and zzso region zzso zzso indicated that in the resistant zzso zzso activity was greater in the zzso region than in the zzso After exposure, however, zzso activity increased dramatically in the zzso with peak activity at 24 h zzso The detection of zzso activity in zzso zzso was unexpected and the role of this zzso in the zzso killing of zzso is not yet zzso However, identification of this and other transcripts from these cells by the zzso approach provides a useful resource towards zzso the molecular basis of zzso in this zzso zzso zzso
