We have determined the crystal structure of a complex between the I domain of zzso zzso and a triple zzso collagen zzso containing a critical zzso zzso Three zzso on the upper surface of the I domain that coordinate a metal zzso also engage the zzso with a collagen zzso completing the coordination sphere of the zzso zzso with the zzso I domain reveals a change in metal coordination linked to a reorganization of the upper surface that together create a complementary surface for binding zzso zzso changes zzso from the upper surface to the opposite pole of the domain, suggesting both a basis for affinity regulation and a zzso for signal zzso The structural features observed here may represent a general mechanism for zzso zzso
