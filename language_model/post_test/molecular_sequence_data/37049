zzso zzso develops as a consequence of zzso cartilage zzso possibly initiated by excessive or abnormal loading of the joint, and potentially zzso through a zzso inhibitor zzso We have shown previously that zzso loads zzso zzso 1 zzso 3 zzso elicit increased expression and zzso of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso cartilage zzso in zzso The objective of this study was to identify zzso genes involved in the observed induction of zzso expression and enhanced zzso zzso zzso Display zzso was used to identify zzso genes by comparing zzso products derived from loaded and unloaded zzso One gene zzso in cartilage after 10, 30 and 60 minute loading revealed zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso which is known to induce zzso gene zzso The identification of mechanically regulated genes will greatly enhance our understanding of zzso turnover providing an exciting future in zzso the role of zzso genes in the development of zzso
