zzso zzso are known for the production of valuable zzso but information on the zzso production capacity of this group is zzso We isolated 9 zzso zzso from the roots of zzso soybean plants and screened them on zzso rice, in order to identify plant growth promoting zzso zzso The zzso isolate zzso 2-4 gave maximum plant length zzso zzso promotion in comparison with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In a separate experiment, zzso of zzso promoted plant length and biomass of soybean zzso zzso The zzso culture zzso was analyzed for the presence of zzso and it was found that all zzso active zzso especially zzso and zzso were present in higher amounts zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in conjunction with zzso inactive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso isolate zzso was later identified as a new strain of zzso zzso through the zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso
