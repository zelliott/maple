The zzso fly zzso zzso zzso is responsible for the transmission of approximately zzso of cases of human African zzso zzso or sleeping zzso Three zzso zzso subspecies have been zzso primarily based upon subtle differences in the zzso of their zzso Here we describe a study conducted across the range of this important zzso to determine whether molecular evidence generated from nuclear DNA zzso and gene sequence zzso zzso DNA and zzso DNA support the existence of these zzso as discrete zzso zzso 

The nuclear zzso Internal transcribed zzso 1 zzso provided support for the three zzso However nuclear and zzso sequence data did not support the zzso of the zzso subspecies zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso Instead, the most strongly supported zzso group was comprised of flies sampled from zzso zzso inherited zzso zzso and zzso also suggested zzso of a group from Lake Victoria basin and Tanzania, but this group was not supported by nuclear zzso suggesting different histories of these zzso zzso data confirmed strong structuring across the range of zzso zzso zzso and was useful for zzso the zzso of closely related zzso 

We propose that the zzso zzso alone is not used to zzso populations of zzso zzso for control zzso The Ethiopian population, which is scheduled to be the target of a sterile insect release zzso zzso was notably zzso From a zzso perspective this may be both positive, given that it may reflect limited migration into the area or negative if the high levels of differentiation are also reflected in zzso isolation between this population and the flies to be used in the release zzso
