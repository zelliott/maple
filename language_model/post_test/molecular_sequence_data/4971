A genetically controlled zzso bacterial reporter zzso the zzso zzso test, was developed for rapid detection of environmental zzso The zzso is based on the zzso zzso zzso which was constructed as a zzso of zzso carrying the zzso zzso genes of zzso zzso downstream of a truncated zzso gene from zzso with a strong zzso zzso zzso coli zzso strains containing this construction are zzso to high levels of light production in the presence of substances or agents that cause damage to the DNA of the zzso The light zzso reflecting the zzso zzso is recorded from the growing culture within 1 zzso and the test results are available within 1 to 2 zzso zzso of zzso was demonstrated by treatment of zzso coli zzso with 6 zzso chemicals zzso C, zzso zzso acid, zzso hydrogen zzso and zzso and with zzso and gamma zzso A clear zzso relationship was established for all eight zzso The sensitivity of the zzso zzso test is similar to that of other zzso for zzso or zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso test, and Ames zzso These results indicate that the zzso zzso test is potentially useful for the in zzso and continuous detection of zzso
