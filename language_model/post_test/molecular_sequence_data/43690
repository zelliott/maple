The zzso zzso zzso is the plasma membrane protein that zzso active zzso transport in the zzso the first step in zzso hormone zzso The zzso zzso zzso was recently cloned in our laboratory and a secondary structure model proposed, suggesting that zzso is an intrinsic membrane protein zzso zzso zzso approximately zzso zzso predicted molecular zzso with 12 putative zzso zzso Here we report the generation of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso with a approximately 87 zzso present in membrane zzso from a rat zzso cell line zzso The zzso zzso location of the zzso zzso was confirmed by indirect zzso experiments using zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso was competitively blocked by the presence of excess synthetic zzso Treatment of membrane zzso from zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells expressing zzso with zzso zzso F converted the approximately 87 zzso into a approximately 50 zzso the same relative molecular weight exhibited by zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both the zzso precursor zzso zzso 56 zzso and the mature approximately 87 zzso zzso Furthermore, a direct correlation between circulating levels of zzso hormone and zzso expression in zzso was zzso
