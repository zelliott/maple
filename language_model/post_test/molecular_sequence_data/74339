A zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso plasma from an zzso fish, the little skate, zzso zzso after incubation with zzso pancreatic zzso The primary structure of the zzso zzso skate zzso shows limited structural similarity to the zzso B1 zzso zzso zzso The zzso activities of synthetic skate zzso and the analog skate zzso were examined in isolated skate vascular and zzso smooth muscle zzso Skate BK produced a zzso zzso of the zzso artery zzso maximum zzso of the response to zzso zzso but the response to skate zzso was appreciably weaker zzso to zzso of the response to zzso zzso Neither the first zzso zzso arch nor the zzso zzso responded to either zzso zzso Skate BK also produced a zzso zzso of zzso smooth muscle preparations zzso maximum response zzso of the response to zzso zzso Skate zzso was without effect on the zzso zzso The data provide evidence for the existence of the zzso system in a zzso ancient zzso group and the greater potency of skate BK compared with the analog skate zzso suggests that the zzso zzso vascular responses resembles the zzso B1 zzso more closely than the B2 zzso
