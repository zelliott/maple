zzso is an insect G zzso zzso cloned from the stable fly zzso zzso It displays sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression of the cloned zzso zzso was obtained in cultured zzso zzso Schneider 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides or zzso such as zzso zzso zzso III, produced zzso calcium responses in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (or zzso did not evoke any effect at zzso up to zzso M, but an zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso II, inhibited the zzso zzso calcium zzso Further analysis showed that the zzso zzso release of calcium zzso was not affected by zzso of the cells with zzso zzso The calcium rise was blocked by the zzso C inhibitor zzso In addition, zzso III was shown to have a zzso effect on the zzso of both zzso zzso and zzso zzso These are the same second zzso that are induced in zzso zzso signaling zzso
