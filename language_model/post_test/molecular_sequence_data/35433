zzso and zzso proteins are cell zzso molecules that mediate the formation of cell zzso junctions by forming zzso or zzso Some members of this protein family can also be used by immune receptors to mediate immune zzso For instance, zzso 2 zzso is used as a zzso for the immune system by interaction with the immune zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associated zzso which is mainly expressed on the surface of zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso binding mode and its relationship to cell zzso are not zzso Here, we report a zzso complex structure, demonstrating that zzso binding to zzso competes with the zzso of zzso and possibly zzso zzso occupies the zzso zzso zzso making zzso zzso zzso and functional analyses identified key zzso acids zzso zzso responsible for the zzso Our work illustrates how the cell zzso zzso zzso competitively binds the immune zzso zzso
