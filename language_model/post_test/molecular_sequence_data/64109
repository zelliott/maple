zzso zzso in zzso zzso has identified key components of the zzso signaling zzso Here, we describe a genetic and molecular characterization of the zzso gene zzso We show that reducing or eliminating zzso activity suppresses the effects of zzso zzso activity, enhances the effects of partially reduced zzso activity, and causes a synthetic zzso zzso when combined with a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso is a positive regulator of zzso zzso We also show that zzso encodes a novel nuclear zzso Through zzso zzso zzso we identified an apparent interaction partner, zzso that also interacts with zzso a known component of the nuclear complex that forms upon zzso zzso Our data suggest potential roles for zzso in the assembly or function of this nuclear zzso
