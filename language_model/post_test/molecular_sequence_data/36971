zzso zzso zzso can be determined using zzso zzso to their complementary zzso target zzso To perform zzso zzso routinely for donors and recipients of bone zzso zzso a zzso zzso technique has been developed that consists in the zzso of labeled zzso target DNA to zzso that have been first attached to zzso zzso The 15 zzso chosen enabled the following zzso zzso zzso to be zzso zzso zzso 2, 3, 4, 11, 11 zzso 12, 13, 13 zzso 14, 7, 8, 9, zzso The zzso DNA was amplified by zzso zzso with incorporation of zzso zzso predominantly to generate labeled zzso zzso zzso between specific immobilized zzso and target DNA was zzso detected by a zzso reaction using alkaline zzso The reverse zzso methodology was successfully tested, first, for the determination of zzso zzso and then the procedure was routinely applied to the generic zzso zzso of bone-marrow donors and zzso
