zzso factor zzso protein forms the zzso complex with zzso and regulates the expression of diverse target genes during early development and zzso We have selected previously an zzso zzso that binds to the zzso domain of zzso and have shown that it zzso with binding of zzso to its specific DNA recognition sequences in zzso As an approach to zzso the zzso by zzso complex in the cells, we have developed the zzso expression zzso for stable expression of zzso zzso inside of the zzso zzso High level of zzso was expressed as an zzso in the fusion with the stable zzso zzso The zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso activity as shown by zzso zzso It also modulated the expression of zzso target zzso such as zzso D1 and zzso zzso as predicted to be as an effective inhibitor of the zzso zzso In addition, it efficiently reduced the growth rate and zzso potential of zzso colon cancer zzso Such zzso zzso could lead to valuable gene zzso for zzso zzso
