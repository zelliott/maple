The DNA damage checkpoint zzso zzso promotes growth arrest or zzso through zzso targets such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso occur in human zzso the former linked to the zzso syndrome, and the latter found in diverse types of sporadic zzso Here we examined the status of zzso by genetic and zzso analyses in 53 breast zzso previously characterized for zzso zzso We identified two zzso zzso zzso zzso and a novel zzso zzso leading to a premature stop zzso in zzso zzso The truncated protein zzso by zzso carrying the zzso was stable yet zzso to the zzso in zzso sections and when zzso expressed in cultured zzso zzso we found zzso to be subject to extensive alternative zzso with some 90 zzso zzso detected in our zzso zzso While all zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso together with the spliced zzso we demonstrate and/or predict some of these zzso zzso to lack zzso function and/or zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso may represent a novel mechanism to zzso zzso and propose to further explore the significance of the complex zzso patterns of this zzso zzso gene in zzso
