zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the zzso zzso of zzso to zzso For use as a clinical zzso the gene zzso zzso from zzso zzso was cloned by the zzso zzso Also, the zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli cells as a fusion protein with zzso zzso zzso The expressed zzso fusion protein zzso zzso in the soluble fraction exhibits zzso zzso and additional zzso zzso zzso investigated a new ultraviolet zzso method for determining serum zzso zzso using zzso zzso as a zzso zzso The principle of the method is as zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso as the donor and zzso zzso zzso zzso is formed by the zzso of serum zzso zzso is zzso converted to zzso zzso and zzso by zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso results in a high zzso zzso which is considered as a drawback for use as a clinical zzso Using zzso zzso we examined the effects of pH and zzso on these two activities, and found that several zzso suppress the additional zzso zzso activity with little or no effect on zzso zzso The results indicate a promising approach to establishing an ultraviolet zzso method for determining serum zzso activity using zzso as the donor zzso and zzso zzso as a zzso zzso
