A low molecular weight zzso zzso class of zzso designated as zzso zzso exhibit repeated sequence motifs of either zzso or zzso through which zzso or zzso zzso metal zzso are bound in zzso zzso The preservation of zzso clusters in an increasing number of three-dimensional structures of these proteins zzso the importance of this structural zzso This review focuses on the recent developments regarding the versatile and striking chemical zzso of zzso as well as on the existence of zzso dynamics within their zzso Both properties and their interplay are likely to be essential for the still elusive biological function of these zzso
