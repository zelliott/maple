zzso zzso zzso are a family of zzso zzso involved in cellular zzso that catalyze the attachment of zzso zzso to zzso Two classes of zzso related to the zzso and zzso classes of zzso in Antarctic zzso have been cloned from zzso zzso The full-length zzso of zzso class zzso zzso is zzso in length and contains an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso 223 zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of this gene have zzso and zzso identity to zzso class zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso class zzso zzso zzso however, is zzso in length and contains an zzso of zzso zzso 231 zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences share only zzso identity with zzso class zzso from zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso zzso and zzso cloned in our previous study were examined using real-time zzso chain reaction in response to exposure to a zzso zzso zzso zzso The expressions of these three zzso transcripts were rapidly zzso although they showed different expression levels and patterns within each zzso Moreover, zzso was the most zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso in response to zzso zzso The zzso zzso were highly expressed in transformed zzso coli, and their kinetic properties were studied with various zzso As a result, the three classes of zzso were found to have diverse biological functions and were responsible for different zzso zzso
