An zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso has been isolated, zzso and identified in the primary structure following chemical zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso and reduction with sodium zzso The zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso is zzso which zzso exactly to zzso zzso in the deduced primary sequence of the zzso zzso Comparative analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequences of the zzso from zzso coli, zzso zzso and zzso C4 and zzso acid metabolism plants indicates that they all contain this specific zzso group, as well as a high degree of sequence zzso zzso this zzso zzso This observation suggests a critical role for zzso during zzso by zzso zzso zzso This represents the first identification of a specific, zzso zzso zzso in the zzso
