Recent studies with zzso virus zzso have shown that zzso integration is directed by DNA sequence motifs that are present in both the viral replication origin and the zzso zzso DNA and that specify binding and zzso sites for the viral regulatory zzso zzso This finding raised the question as to whether other zzso regulatory proteins might direct zzso zzso with DNA targets that contain origin sequences functionally equivalent to those described for zzso To investigate this question, active and inactive forms of the minute virus of mice zzso 3' replication origin, derived from a zzso zzso zzso were zzso in an zzso zzso shuttle zzso which replicates as an zzso in a zzso manner in zzso zzso Upon zzso infection of these cells, the infecting zzso integrated into zzso containing the zzso sequence reported to be efficiently zzso by the zzso regulatory protein zzso In contrast, zzso did not integrate into zzso containing either the inactive form of the origin sequence reported to be zzso zzso by zzso or the active form from which the zzso consensus zzso site had been zzso The structure of the cloned zzso zzso zzso displayed several features previously described for zzso zzso and zzso zzso The findings indicate that the rules which govern zzso zzso zzso also apply to zzso and suggest that zzso zzso insertions may be achievable with different autonomous zzso zzso proteins which recognize binding and zzso sites on the target zzso
