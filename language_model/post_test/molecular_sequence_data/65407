The engineering of proteins to manipulate cellular zzso has developed into a promising technology for biomedical research, including gene zzso In particular, zzso zzso zzso which consist of a zzso zzso domain zzso to a tailored zzso zzso zzso domain, have proven invaluable for stimulating zzso gene repair in a variety of cell zzso However, previous studies demonstrated that zzso could be associated with significant zzso due to zzso at zzso zzso Here, we compared the in zzso affinities and zzso of nine zzso zzso zzso with their performance as zzso in human zzso The results of our zzso zzso reveal that the zzso zzso addition to the zzso a major zzso of zzso activity and is zzso correlated with zzso zzso In addition, our data provide the first evidence that engineering strategies, which account for zzso zzso effects, yield zzso that function as highly efficient zzso in human zzso
