Type I zzso zzso are essential to the clearance of viral diseases, however, a clear distinction between genes zzso by direct zzso interactions and genes zzso by secondary zzso production has not been zzso Here, we investigated differential gene regulation in zzso upon subcutaneous administration of zzso and during zzso zzso In zzso experiments revealed that zzso causes zzso zzso and zzso of abundant zzso response genes zzso zzso zzso and other genes that participate in zzso and zzso zzso zzso During infection with zzso not only a variety of zzso were zzso but also a significantly broader range of genes involved in cell migration and zzso This work allowed dissection of several molecular signatures present during zzso which are part of a robust zzso zzso zzso These signatures can be useful markers to evaluate the status of zzso responses during a viral infection and specific features of different zzso
