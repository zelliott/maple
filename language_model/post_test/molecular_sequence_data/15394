The zzso zzso zzso which allows efficient display of zzso zzso on zzso has been reported zzso but its practical zzso in a zzso zzso library has not been zzso To resolve this issue, we created two small zzso human zzso zzso libraries using the zzso and isolation of zzso zzso was zzso zzso of one zzso library, termed zzso library, which has a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complexity, against zzso resulted in successful isolation of human zzso clones specific for the zzso despite the presence of only a single light chain in the zzso By using the unique feature of the zzso an zzso library of a larger size, named zzso which has a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complexity, was also generated in a rapid manner by combining zzso zzso zzso heavy chains and 131 light chains and more diverse zzso zzso zzso clones were successfully zzso Our results demonstrate that the zzso can be applied readily in creating zzso zzso libraries with much less effort, and zzso zzso clones can be isolated reliably via light chain zzso of zzso zzso
