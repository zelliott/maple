The sequence components that direct zzso binding of zzso virus 40 zzso T zzso to zzso origin region I are composed of two recognition zzso separated by a zzso This region has binding sites for two zzso zzso zzso We extended the zzso region I sequence by one and two sets of zzso and zzso and also shortened the region by one zzso Our zzso studies with these zzso show that the protein has a strong preference for binding to an even rather than an odd number of zzso separated by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reveal that the size of the complex formed between the zzso region I sequence and T zzso did not increase when the sequence was extended with one zzso sequence but did increase with two such zzso zzso I zzso and zzso zzso experiments indicate that the protein did not protect a zzso that was not paired with another zzso The zzso zzso resumed its binding activity when it was paired with a zzso and another zzso zzso We propose that T zzso binds to region I as a zzso zzso
