A series of model zzso with a single break in one of the chains were zzso The efficiency of the new zzso bond formation by means of chemical zzso was shown to depend on the DNA structure in the zzso site, decreasing in the following order: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This relationship is the most pronounced in duplexes with zzso group as zzso zzso For duplexes, containing zzso base pairs in the reaction zzso the yield of zzso products also depends on the nature of the interacting zzso
