A zzso zzso zzso library cloned in the zzso zzso was screened using as zzso synthetic zzso designed from the known zzso acid sequence of a zzso obtained from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The screening led to the isolation of six zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and one of them zzso zzso contained the entire zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence accounts for a protein made of zzso zzso acids and the initial zzso is zzso by a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso sequence versus zzso from zzso zzso and bacteria showed that zzso is very similar to other zzso but not to zzso or zzso zzso For known zzso zzso zzso the rate of zzso zzso per site per year showed that these sequences are zzso not only at the zzso acid but also at the zzso zzso The evolutionary rates are nearly similar to those reported for other zzso zzso
