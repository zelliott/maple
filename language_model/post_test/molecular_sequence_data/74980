Repeat sequence motifs as well as unique sequences between zzso zzso and zzso of the human zzso zzso 1 gene interact in zzso with nuclear zzso We show that a zzso element between zzso zzso and zzso zzso promoter activity in zzso and in zzso by binding specific cellular zzso zzso Finally, a common sequence zzso zzso present in 15 of the determined binding sites suggests a particular class of nuclear factors associated with the zzso 1 zzso
