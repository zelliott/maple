Gene zzso is an important mechanism for acquiring new genes and creating genetic novelty in zzso Evidence suggests that duplicated genes are retained at a much higher rate than originally thought and that functional divergence of gene copies is a major factor promoting their retention in the zzso We find that two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso have a higher zzso within species and are significantly more zzso between species than the zzso zzso zzso Our data suggest that following gene duplication, the zzso gene experienced relaxed selective constraints, whereas the zzso gene experienced positive selection acting on several zzso We report significant zzso in evolutionary rates among all three zzso at zzso zzso indicating that functional divergence has coincided with zzso zzso zzso zzso may allow for a more rapid evolution of zzso traits and a greater specialization of zzso zzso Our data add to the increasing evidence that duplicated genes experience lower selective constraints and in some cases positive selection following zzso zzso duplicated genes that are zzso from selective constraints may provide a mechanism for developing new interactions and a zzso for the evolution of new zzso
