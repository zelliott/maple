The cold shock protein zzso from the zzso zzso zzso differs from its zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso in the Gibbs free energy of zzso zzso The two proteins vary in sequence at 12 positions but only two of them, zzso and zzso of zzso which replace zzso and zzso of zzso are responsible for the additional stability of zzso These two positions are near the ends of the protein chain, but close to each other in the three-dimensional zzso The zzso exchange alone changed the stability by more than 11 zzso zzso Here, we zzso the molecular origins of the stability difference between the two proteins by a zzso zzso zzso contributions to stability were characterized by measuring the zzso zzso of many zzso as a function of salt zzso Double and triple zzso analyses indicate that the stabilization by the zzso exchange originates from three zzso zzso zzso interactions of the zzso zzso of zzso contribute about 4 zzso zzso Another 4 zzso zzso is gained from the relief of a zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso as in the zzso zzso and 3 zzso zzso originate from a general zzso stabilization by the positive charge of zzso which is not caused by a zzso zzso zzso of all potential partners for an zzso pair within a radius of 10 A around zzso had only marginal effects on zzso The zzso charge reversal thus zzso zzso interactions at the protein surface by both local and global zzso However, it cannot convert the zzso zzso with another zzso zzso into a corresponding zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is probably a much simpler route to zzso than the creation of stabilizing surface zzso pairs, which can form only at the expense of zzso zzso
