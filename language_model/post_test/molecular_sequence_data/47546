Mal d 1, the major apple zzso zzso with zzso specific for the major birch zzso zzso zzso v 1, and is responsible for birch zzso related food zzso to zzso zzso of zzso v 1 showing minor sequence variations display different binding capacity for specific zzso zzso from allergic zzso Moreover, zzso variation of zzso has been reported for zzso 

To investigate the occurrence of zzso zzso of Mal d 1 which may differ in their zzso potential, to obtain data on structures essential for binding of Mal d 1 to the zzso and to gain insights into the structures responsible for its zzso zzso to zzso v zzso 

The zzso of Mal d 1 from various apple strains was amplified by a zzso strategy based on zzso regions of known Mal d zzso and zzso Two major zzso of Mal d 1 were expressed as zzso proteins and zzso as were different zzso of the major birch zzso zzso zzso v zzso Together with already existing zzso birch zzso and apple zzso these were subjected to zzso testing by zzso zzso zzso zzso test and dose related zzso zzso zzso for zzso were identified by zzso zzso 

Twelve Mal d zzso were zzso from 7 apple varieties and compared to 3 known Mal d 1 zzso The clones were clustered into two groups, each showing a high degree of sequence identity to one of the known sequences and specific differences to the third zzso No zzso sequences were zzso In contrast, apple strains with reported differences in zzso showed different expression levels of the major zzso zzso testing of zzso zzso revealed high zzso binding capacity of 2 major zzso named zzso and zzso with a slightly higher zzso binding capacity of zzso Moreover, the zzso was similar to another r Mal d 1 reported in the literature, representing the zzso divergent from our zzso zzso analysis of our Mal d 1 zzso identified zzso in position 111 as essential for zzso zzso zzso was almost depleted by changing this zzso into a zzso Moreover, the corresponding zzso zzso present in position 112 of zzso v 1, was in a similar manner crucial for the zzso of the birch zzso zzso 

We conclude that divergent zzso of apple strains mainly depends on different expression levels of the major zzso Introduction of a zzso zzso in position 111 of Mal d 1 and in position 112 of zzso v 1 led to a drastic reduction of zzso of both the zzso and the food zzso obviously also removing the zzso zzso zzso with reduced zzso but maintained zzso zzso may represent new candidates for a safer specific zzso with reduced zzso
