zzso membrane proteins are represented by zzso of the zzso zzso and crucial for cellular functions including cell zzso zzso influx, toxin zzso and maintenance of zzso zzso zzso over zzso of all drugs are targeted at membrane zzso Because of their zzso however, methods used to characterize the structure of soluble zzso such as zzso and X-ray zzso are generally not suitable to the study of membrane proteins zzso The methods described in this chapter facilitate the identification and mapping of both zzso and zzso zzso of integral plasma membrane proteins using mass zzso By combining a classical zzso protection approach with recently developed zzso methods, zzso peptides zzso are zzso from proteins embedded in their native zzso environment and identified to characterize the zzso of integral membrane zzso
