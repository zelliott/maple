Recent studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso play important roles during development and zzso Chicken, the first zzso zzso zzso possesses unique features for zzso and evolutionary zzso However, apart from zzso information on chicken zzso has mainly been obtained from zzso predictions without experimental zzso In the present study, we performed a systematic identification of intermediate size zzso zzso zzso by zzso library construction and identified 125 chicken zzso zzso through the zzso and expression analysis, we found the chicken zzso has several novel features: zzso comparative zzso analysis against 18 zzso zzso zzso revealed that the majority of the newly identified zzso candidates is not zzso and most are potentially zzso specific, suggesting that zzso play roles in zzso zzso during zzso zzso The expression pattern analysis of zzso zzso and their host genes suggested the coordinated expression between zzso and their host zzso zzso Several zzso specific expression patterns suggest involvement of zzso in tissue zzso Together, these findings provide new clues for future functional study of zzso during development and zzso
