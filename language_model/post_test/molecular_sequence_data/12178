The nuclear magnetic resonance structure of the zzso binding zzso domain of zzso zzso to a zzso reveals an alternative means of recognizing zzso zzso Unlike in zzso zzso the zzso forms an zzso zzso with a zzso of the zzso interacts with a zzso pocket through the zzso zzso and adopts a zzso The zzso domain is structurally similar to zzso zzso zzso (a zzso capped by an zzso and binds to zzso zzso suggesting a possible role in membrane zzso
