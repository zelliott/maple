The zzso zzso protein from the temperate zzso zzso zzso was zzso to near zzso and used in zzso I zzso analyses to identify six binding sites in this zzso All these sites contained zzso 15 zzso zzso zzso Three of these 15 zzso zzso repeats were located between the zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and the other three were 3' to the zzso gene zzso to zzso Two of these sites were identified as operator sites for the zzso by DNA sequence analyses of virulent zzso zzso Almost all these zzso identified lay within the 15 zzso zzso repeats zzso zzso and zzso and almost all were in the most highly zzso positions in the zzso The majority of virulent zzso contained zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso affinities for individual operators were measured by zzso I zzso analyses using DNA fragments which contained a single zzso operator adjacent to two zzso zzso zzso of these values with the affinity observed with these sites in the zzso operator indicated that zzso zzso zzso bound zzso to zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso of almost zzso Cooperative binding occurred in an alternative zzso fashion, as previously seen with zzso zzso zzso In addition to cooperative binding between two adjacent operators, the zzso also increased the affinity for adjacent zzso DNA sites, resulting in a periodic pattern of binding termed zzso This phasing pattern extended beyond regions predicted for zzso interaction, but was significantly decreased on a template with two adjacent operators, suggesting that zzso zzso zzso with zzso
