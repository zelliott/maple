zzso is a known health hazard for humans, fish, and other zzso zzso it is important to assess the response of an zzso exposed to zzso zzso The data reported here show that a liquid zzso zzso zzso approach for the detection of zzso zzso can be used to measure the ability of zzso to degrade zzso including determining the current zzso degradation zzso Signature peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso can be used as zzso of zzso presence and zzso Four peptides each derived from CD and zzso zzso zzso A zzso and seven peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso B zzso were identified as signature zzso for zzso degradation, as these sequences are zzso in the majority of the pure and mixed zzso microbial cultures zzso However, zzso zzso signature zzso peptides from zzso zzso zzso were found to be different from those in other cultures used and should also be included with selected CD zzso The combination of these peptides derived from the two zzso represents a promising zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso peptides were detected at zzso zzso as low as zzso zzso and at different time points both in pure cultures and within zzso environmental enrichment zzso The zzso zzso were also detected in the simultaneous presence of zzso and an alternate electron zzso zzso We believe that this technique can be useful for monitoring zzso processes for other anthropogenic environmental zzso with known zzso zzso
