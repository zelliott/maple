zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso is an zzso zzso disorder caused by zzso in the zzso carrier family 4, sodium zzso zzso member 11 zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to identify the genetic cause of zzso in six Indian families and catalog all known zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso blood samples were collected from individuals of the families with zzso and used in zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso were used to amplify the entire coding region including zzso junctions of zzso zzso were subsequently zzso to identify the zzso 

DNA sequence analysis of the six families identified four novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and one known zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was identified in two zzso 

This study increases the zzso spectrum of the zzso zzso A review of the literature showed that the total number of zzso in the zzso gene described to date is zzso Most of the zzso are zzso followed by zzso The present study will be helpful in genetic diagnosis of the families reported zzso
