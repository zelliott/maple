zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso protein that promotes and maintains zzso zzso In zzso zzso filaments are used by molecular zzso to transport zzso or to generate zzso forces by altering the dynamics of filament growth and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso ring during zzso and is absolutely required for its formation and zzso We show that zzso associates with zzso filaments throughout the cell cycle and is subjected to zzso modification that does not vary with cell cycle zzso At any given point in the cell cycle zzso of zzso molecules are zzso which significantly enhances their affinity for zzso zzso of electron microscopic images of zzso filaments establish that the majority of zzso strands sit in the zzso position on zzso zzso suggesting a role in the regulation of zzso zzso We show that zzso regulates the equilibrium binding of zzso to zzso without affecting the rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso bind zzso but have a reduced ability to regulate zzso binding to zzso We conclude that although zzso of zzso is not essential, it provides a regulatory mechanism for modulating zzso filament integrity and zzso zzso
