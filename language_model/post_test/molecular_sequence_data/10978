The zzso nuclear zzso of zzso zzso was previously shown to be deficient in zzso zzso zzso c zzso activity, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now demonstrated that the zzso of this zzso contain zzso for the zzso protein and that zzso cannot be detected during zzso labeling experiments of zzso translation zzso Cloning and analysis of the zzso gene reveal a long open reading frame capable of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that the potential zzso protein contains a zzso targeting sequence at its zzso The long open reading frame also contains a 200 zzso region with zzso to the zzso zzso which is required for the production or stability of zzso zzso zzso as well as the translation of mature zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that the zzso protein of zzso zzso is required in a zzso step for zzso zzso most probably for the efficient translation of zzso zzso
