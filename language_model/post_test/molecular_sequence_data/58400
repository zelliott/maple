Using zzso zzso zzso and subsequent zzso we have detected the presence of an active zzso which zzso with the insect zzso zzso zzso in the brain of the zzso zzso zzso We have isolated a zzso zzso the precursor for this zzso from zzso libraries representing zzso zzso brain zzso The zzso sequence contains an open reading frame that upon translation would result in a zzso of 96 zzso zzso zzso zzso of the predicted precursor could result in several zzso including a 10 zzso acid zzso zzso that would, upon modification of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso be identical to the insect zzso zzso No other zzso products are predicted to be processed from the zzso Southern zzso analysis indicates that the gene is present in the zzso zzso zzso in a single zzso Northern zzso analysis shows that the gene is predominantly expressed as a zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso Study of the expression of the zzso gene in zzso zzso brain, using in zzso zzso indicates that expression occurs primarily in the zzso zzso of the zzso a region showing abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coupled to zzso indicates that zzso represents a significant proportion of zzso zzso production in the zzso However, zzso analysis also indicates the presence of significant levels of other related zzso demonstrating the presence of more than one zzso gene in this zzso
