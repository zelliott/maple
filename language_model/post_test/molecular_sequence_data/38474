zzso A, the zzso portion of zzso is the major zzso of septic zzso therefore, zzso molecules could have important clinical zzso Here we show that peptides derived from zzso zzso factor zzso zzso increasing protein zzso and zzso zzso bind to zzso A and block the zzso zzso A interaction in zzso Because their zzso capacity in zzso as well as in zzso has been zzso we created hybrid peptides zzso two zzso zzso The hybrid zzso zzso containing zzso zzso from zzso and zzso zzso turned out to be the most active zzso within the series of peptides tested here to inhibit the zzso A interaction and is able in zzso to block the zzso zzso release of zzso zzso up to zzso Furthermore, zzso not only reduced peak serum levels of zzso of mice when zzso but also reduced zzso levels when given 15 zzso after the zzso zzso As compared with other zzso only zzso is able to strongly decrease zzso zzso release by human zzso cell lines as well as by zzso Furthermore, the hybrid zzso is protective against zzso lethal zzso As such, zzso could have zzso and/or therapeutic properties in humans for the management of septic zzso
