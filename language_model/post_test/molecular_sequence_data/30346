We have recently found presence of a high concentration of a novel type of zzso zzso zzso in human tumor zzso in addition to conventional zzso zzso Because of their potential zzso activity, it is of interest to know how these zzso can be zzso in zzso zzso of two synthetic zzso BK and zzso added to the zzso fluid from patients with zzso zzso and zzso were analyzed by reversed phase zzso Both zzso were zzso into their zzso or zzso and zzso or zzso products following incubation with the zzso zzso The rate of the degradation of BK and zzso was the zzso The formation of zzso was completely inhibited by zzso I zzso while the formation of zzso was not completely inhibited by a zzso II zzso The degradation of both zzso was inhibited completely by zzso The results indicate the presence of other zzso which zzso zzso in the zzso fluid, in addition to zzso I and zzso zzso The zzso A and zzso B zzso zzso zzso acid, failed to block degradation of both zzso A rapid cleave of zzso into zzso and zzso was also found in the zzso zzso Thus, the major degradation products of zzso in the zzso fluid were demonstrated to be either zzso or zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso were rapidly converted into BK and zzso by the zzso zzso
