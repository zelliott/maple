zzso zzso zzso is the key zzso for the expression of blue or purple flower zzso A full-length zzso for the zzso gene was cloned from petals of zzso major, and its zzso zzso designated zzso zzso number zzso in the zzso zzso was isolated from leaves by a zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis revealed that zzso contains one zzso and an open reading frame zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence shows between 51% and zzso identity with those of previously reported zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis showed that there are zzso copies of the zzso gene in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene were detected in young flower petals but not in leaves as revealed by zzso zzso When zzso was expressed in transgenic zzso zzso under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso promoter, some transgenic plants showed drastic flower color zzso from red to deep red with deep purple zzso These transgenic plants accumulated zzso zzso in their zzso which were never detected in zzso plants by zzso liquid zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso isolated from zzso major encodes zzso and is active in a zzso plant zzso
