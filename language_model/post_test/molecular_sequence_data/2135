As a factor zzso zzso zzso is a potent zzso and zzso agent that is found in the zzso zzso of the Mexican zzso zzso zzso zzso clones that zzso zzso have been zzso zzso sequence analysis and comparison with the zzso acid sequence of the mature protein indicates that zzso is produced as a zzso containing a zzso acid signal zzso zzso exists as at least two zzso By sequence analysis of multiple zzso zzso we found two additional sites for zzso acid zzso confirming zzso that differ from each other by zzso acid changes at a minimum of four zzso These sequence variations appear to be the result of zzso variation rather than gene zzso as deduced from DNA zzso zzso zzso data suggest that zzso may have evolved from a smaller ancestral gene by a zzso event giving rise to a zzso structural zzso between the zzso and zzso halves of the zzso zzso cells zzso with a zzso zzso expressed zzso which was biologically active and had an zzso mobility identical to that of the native zzso
