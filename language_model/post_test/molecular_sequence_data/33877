In zzso shoot branching greatly determines overall plant architecture and affects fundamental aspects of plant zzso zzso patterns are determined by genetic pathways zzso widely across zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a central role in this process, acting locally to arrest zzso bud zzso In tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso we have identified two zzso zzso zzso and zzso These genes are expressed in arrested zzso buds and both are zzso upon bud zzso although zzso is transcribed at much lower levels than zzso Alternative zzso of zzso renders two transcripts that zzso two zzso proteins with different zzso zzso due to a zzso zzso The zzso of zzso lines suggests that zzso has retained the ancestral role of zzso in shoot branch zzso We have isolated the zzso and zzso genes of other zzso species and have studied their evolution rates across the zzso These studies indicate that, after zzso of an ancestral zzso zzso zzso genes continued to evolve under a strong zzso selection that was consistent with the zzso function of zzso in shoot branching zzso In contrast, the coding sequences of zzso zzso genes have evolved at a higher evolution zzso zzso tests indicate that this difference does not reflect relaxation but rather positive selective pressure for zzso
