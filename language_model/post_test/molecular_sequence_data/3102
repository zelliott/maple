Two zzso clones zzso zzso were isolated from a root zzso zzso library of zzso zzso by the zzso zzso The two zzso zzso and zzso zzso for 335 and 317 zzso acid zzso with the molecular mass of mature proteins being zzso and zzso zzso zzso The two zzso showed similar protein structures consisting of four zzso zzso signal zzso domain, zzso zzso domain, hinge domain, and zzso zzso The zzso gene showed similar expression levels in root zzso and leaves, with no detection of transcripts in the zzso The zzso gene was expressed at similarly high levels in the roots and root zzso but at a very low level in the zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso transcripts were strongly detected in the zzso zone, but zzso detected in the outer zzso layer of the root zzso and in the zzso cells of the fixation zzso On the other hand, zzso transcripts were strongly detected in the infected cells of the fixation zone and central vascular system, but zzso detected in the zzso zzso Our results suggest that the two zzso may play different biological roles in the root zzso zzso may be involved in a defense response against internal zzso external zzso or both, while zzso may be involved in normal plant development as well as in a defensive role against external zzso
