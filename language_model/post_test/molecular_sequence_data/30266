To allow the efficient construction of ordered clone libraries, we have been investigating the use of zzso zzso as an approach to identify overlapping zzso and ultimately restore the linear order of the clone zzso To test the effectiveness of the zzso we have constructed a zzso library from the zzso of the human DNA virus zzso and used zzso to multiple zzso selected from the zzso sequence to reconstruct the order of clones and zzso on the zzso
