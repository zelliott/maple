Two related but clearly different zzso clones corresponding to zzso factor 1 alpha zzso zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso Whereas the zzso sequences of these two zzso differ within the coding region at 49 out of zzso positions zzso the derived zzso acid sequences are completely zzso thereby indicating a substantial evolutionary constraint on this translation zzso zzso analysis of zzso DNA suggests that, besides the two closely related zzso alpha genes investigated in this study, other zzso related genes may exist in the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso alpha genes during zzso and embryonic development was studied by zzso analysis and by in zzso zzso A high amount of zzso alpha zzso was detected in zzso zzso At later stages of embryonic development, zzso alpha zzso was found to be accumulated in zzso active zzso
