zzso searches of zzso zzso have yielded many zzso candidates where the identity of the zzso is not immediately obvious on examination of associated zzso One of these motifs is found exclusively in the family zzso within the zzso untranslated regions zzso of genes zzso the hypothetical membrane protein classified as zzso or zzso While the function of this protein class is zzso a zzso binding the zzso zzso intermediate zzso zzso has been identified in the zzso zzso of zzso genes in many zzso species of bacteria outside of zzso Here we show that a representative of the zzso zzso motif from zzso zzso zzso also binds zzso Furthermore, representatives of this zzso have structural and molecular recognition characteristics that are distinct from those of the previously described zzso zzso zzso zzso is the second zzso for which two or more distinct classes of natural zzso exist, indicating that natural zzso utilizing different structures to bind the same zzso may be more common than is currently zzso Additionally, the association of zzso binding zzso with most genes zzso proteins classified as zzso strongly suggests that these proteins function as zzso for zzso or another zzso zzso zzso
