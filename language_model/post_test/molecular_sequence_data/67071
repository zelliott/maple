zzso is one of the main zzso receptors on natural killer cells, and it can induce zzso to target cells through interaction with its zzso zzso or zzso zzso is also involved in T cell zzso zzso and zzso The expression of zzso on natural killer cells and T cells can be regulated by zzso and chemical zzso however, the mechanism of the regulation of the zzso gene is still zzso In this study, we have identified two promoters in the human zzso gene named zzso and zzso which are located at zzso to zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso respectively, and a negative regulation element between zzso and zzso Both zzso and zzso can be regulated by zzso zzso zzso and calcium zzso zzso zzso analysis shows that, within this zzso gene region, there are putative binding sites for zzso factors zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have found that zzso factor zzso zzso zzso can zzso zzso promoters zzso and zzso in human zzso cells, a zzso cell line with low expression of zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, the zzso factor zzso promotes zzso zzso activity but zzso zzso zzso activity for which a zzso zzso composite site zzso in zzso may be zzso
