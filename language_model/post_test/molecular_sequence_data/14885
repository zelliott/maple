The zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso protein zzso is highly enriched in the brain and is involved in the regulation of zzso dynamics and cell zzso However, the molecular mechanisms accounting for these functions are poorly zzso Here, we have identified zzso a novel zzso of zzso predominantly expressed in the mouse zzso In primary cultures of zzso and zzso zzso localized on intermediate filaments and zzso and zzso directly with zzso a zzso protein responsible for zzso cold zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso cold stability by zzso zzso away from zzso It also resulted in the formation of membrane zzso for which zzso was a necessary zzso of zzso This study identifies zzso as a new zzso interacting protein able to zzso zzso zzso cold zzso Moreover, it illustrates a novel mechanism by which zzso regulates cell zzso
