zzso proteins are essential in zzso recruitment and, in a few cases, restraint of various zzso during cellular zzso zzso zzso and zzso comprise a closely related family of zzso which zzso regulates zzso protein zzso zzso downstream of zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso by zzso and zzso appears critical in the negative regulation of the zzso zzso However, as zzso does not bind zzso it has been unclear how zzso zzso zzso downstream of zzso Here, we identified zzso as a zzso protein upon its zzso zzso This interaction required the intact binding motifs of the zzso zzso domain, and a zzso zzso having a zzso substitution at these motifs failed to inhibit Ras and zzso zzso downstream of a zzso zzso zzso Because zzso forms a stable complex with zzso a crucial zzso of zzso these data suggest that zzso zzso zzso and zzso the ability of the zzso complex to activate zzso Indeed, forced expression of zzso but not zzso inhibited the recruitment of the zzso complex to zzso downstream of zzso which is an essential event for zzso of the zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso sequesters zzso from zzso and zzso the zzso zzso downstream of zzso
