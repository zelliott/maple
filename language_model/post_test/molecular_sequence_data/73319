It is noteworthy that in spite of the similarity of the reactions zzso by these zzso the modes of expression of zzso function are surprisingly different, varying according to the chain length and zzso of reaction zzso These zzso are summarized and classified into four groups, as shown in Figure zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso require no zzso except zzso metal zzso zzso or zzso which are commonly required by all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso including the zzso for the synthesis of zzso and zzso are unusual because they each consist of two zzso dissimilar protein zzso neither of which has zzso zzso The zzso for the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso require zzso carrier proteins that remove zzso products from the active sites of the zzso to maintain efficient turnovers of zzso The zzso responsible for zzso zzso include zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which require a zzso The zzso of zzso zzso seems to be fundamentally similar to that of bacterial zzso except that no zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso The zzso zzso zzso in zzso cells is zzso zzso zzso which zzso much longer chain zzso than do bacterial zzso zzso zzso zzso will be a major target of future studies in this field in view of its involvement in zzso zzso
