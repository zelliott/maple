zzso zzso plays an important role in drug development, zzso zzso regulation, and zzso with product zzso When an inhibitor has high structural similarities to the zzso of an zzso controlling inhibitor binding without affecting zzso zzso binding is often challenging and requires zzso of the active zzso We zzso that an extended set of genetically zzso zzso acids can be used to design an zzso active site that reduces zzso inhibitor binding without compromising zzso zzso As a model case, we chose zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and inhibitor zzso zzso models of zzso zzso containing zzso zzso acids zzso with each zzso were constructed to identify a key zzso for inhibitor binding and zzso zzso acids to replace the key zzso Then, we discovered that replacing the key zzso zzso with two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso enhances binding affinity toward the zzso zzso over the inhibitor by zzso and zzso zzso Such an enhanced selectivity is mainly due to a reduced inhibitor binding affinity by zzso and zzso zzso The zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso containing zzso is comparable to that of zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso containing zzso exhibits a moderate decrease in the zzso zzso The work described here clearly demonstrates the feasibility of selectively controlling zzso zzso using an expanded set of genetically zzso zzso zzso
