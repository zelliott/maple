We used two sequencing methods, namely long zzso chain reaction zzso and primer walking, to determine the complete zzso DNA zzso sequence of zzso zzso and most of the zzso sequence of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso contained 36 genes including 12 of the 13 zzso genes characteristic of zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and 22 transfer zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso contained 33 zzso including 12 zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso and 19 transfer zzso zzso The gene order of the zzso zzso from the zzso species showed no clear zzso with either the zzso or other zzso zzso This indicates that the zzso exhibit great zzso in zzso gene zzso This is the first complete sequence analysis of the zzso zzso of a zzso member of zzso which will facilitate further studies on the population zzso and zzso evolution of the zzso
