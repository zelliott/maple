zzso switch commonly follows onset of zzso zzso in the zzso center zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso as a zzso zzso cell zzso zzso with zzso includes a subset with zzso zzso and a minor subset with zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we investigated whether switch events and AID expression occur in zzso In 4 of 6 zzso and 4 of 7 zzso zzso alternative zzso zzso transcripts were zzso AID zzso including a zzso zzso were common to both zzso AID expression correlated with switch in 8 of 8 cases, but in 3 of 5 cases it occurred with switch zzso Circle transcripts zzso were identified in 5 of 7 evaluated zzso In 1 of 12 cases, zzso of tumor cells expressed zzso zzso surface zzso zzso switch zzso events appear to be a feature of zzso likely restricted to a minor tumor zzso with occasional zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso origins from zzso B cells and reveal switch events at zzso zzso
