zzso zzso marker 7 zzso was recently identified as an zzso transcript zzso in the blood vessels of human solid zzso Here, we identify several new zzso of zzso derived by alternative zzso that are predicted to be zzso zzso zzso zzso or on the cell surface membrane zzso of tumor zzso Using new zzso against the zzso zzso we confirmed the predicted expression of zzso on the cell surface and demonstrated that zzso zzso like its zzso is zzso on the zzso of various tumor zzso We then used an affinity zzso strategy to search for zzso proteins and identified zzso as a protein capable of binding to the zzso region of both zzso and its closest zzso zzso zzso which is also expressed in tumor zzso The binding domain of zzso was mapped to a unique zzso acid region in its zzso zzso These studies establish the zzso of zzso protein in tumor zzso and provide new opportunities for the delivery of therapeutic and imaging agents to the vessels of solid zzso
