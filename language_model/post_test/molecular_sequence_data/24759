zzso of von zzso factor zzso to a variety of zzso zzso zzso components and to zzso zzso zzso zzso complex is important in zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the early stage of zzso We previously zzso a potent zzso zzso named zzso functionally acting as a zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, we further characterized zzso as a zzso zzso with a molecular mass of 25 zzso as determined by gel zzso and two-dimensional zzso zzso is a zzso binding and zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as judged by flow zzso and Western zzso The multiple effects of zzso on zzso and zzso zzso zzso antagonized zzso but not collagen and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that its effect is zzso We also found that zzso zzso zzso to approximately 14 and approximately 10 zzso fragments in the presence of zzso Interestingly, both degradation fragments, intact and reduced zzso were able to bind zzso suggesting the binding of zzso to zzso is zzso In conclusion, the results presented further explain the potent zzso effect of zzso in zzso In addition, the multiple effects of zzso may be used as a tool to determine the binding motifs that are responsible for the zzso or zzso zzso zzso
