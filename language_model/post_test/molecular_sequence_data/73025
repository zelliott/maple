DNA amplification is a common mechanism invoked by many human tumors to elicit zzso of genes whose products are involved in drug resistance or cell zzso Although amplified regions in tumor DNA may exceed several zzso in size, segments of zzso with a high probability of containing gene sequences may be amenable to detection by restriction landmark zzso scanning zzso a high-resolution DNA analysis that separates labeled zzso fragments in two zzso Here, we tested this by applying zzso to matched samples of zzso and normal brain DNA and found zzso amplification of the gene zzso zzso zzso 6 zzso an observation not previously reported in human zzso The zzso gene has been localized to zzso zzso but in the zzso studied here, it was not zzso with either the zzso zzso zzso or zzso growth factor zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this may be part of a novel zzso in zzso We then zzso this finding by identifying both zzso and zzso increases in zzso protein levels in zzso relative to matched normal brain zzso These data zzso the zzso gene in zzso amplification and illustrate the potential of zzso for the more general identification and cloning of novel genes that are amplified in human zzso
