The zzso zzso is a soluble zzso of the zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso to form the zzso zzso In zzso the reaction products are immediately zzso by zzso zzso The zzso has a unique zzso it zzso zzso but not native, zzso It has been proposed that the zzso zzso together with zzso in the control mechanism by which only properly folded zzso can exit from the zzso zzso In this paper it is demonstrated that the zzso recognizes two elements in the zzso zzso the zzso zzso unit of the zzso and protein zzso exposed in zzso but not in native, zzso Both zzso have to be zzso zzso In many cases the first element is not accessible to zzso zzso in native zzso zzso the protein zzso it is demonstrated here that the zzso interacts with zzso zzso acids exposed in zzso zzso More zzso zzso zzso those exposing more zzso zzso zzso were found to be those having higher zzso zzso zzso It is suggested that both accessibility of the zzso zzso unit and binding to zzso patches determine the exclusive zzso of zzso zzso by the zzso
