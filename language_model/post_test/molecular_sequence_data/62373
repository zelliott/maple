zzso zzso a member of the zzso group, is an important pathogen of zzso zzso Previous attempts to develop genetic techniques for this zzso zzso zzso have met with zzso Here we describe the development of techniques for the genetic manipulation of zzso zzso and the identification of zzso zzso zzso a reporter system, and a zzso that function in several zzso of this fish zzso The zzso resistance genes zzso zzso and zzso function in zzso zzso Cloning zzso based on the zzso zzso cryptic zzso zzso which carried these zzso markers were introduced by zzso from zzso coli, resulting in zzso colonies of zzso zzso zzso transfer of DNA into zzso zzso was strain zzso zzso transfer was observed for two of the seven strains tested zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso functioned in zzso zzso when expressed from a zzso promoter, allowing its development as a reporter for studies of gene zzso zzso isolated from zzso zzso were efficiently introduced into zzso zzso by zzso but plasmids isolated from zzso coli were not suitable for transfer by this route, suggesting the presence of a restriction zzso DNA isolated from zzso zzso was resistant to zzso by zzso and zzso indicating that a zzso restriction modification system may constitute part of this zzso zzso was introduced into zzso zzso from zzso coli and zzso with apparent zzso resulting in zzso zzso The techniques developed in this study allow for genetic manipulation and analysis of this important fish zzso
