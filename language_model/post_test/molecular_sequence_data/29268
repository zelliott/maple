The zzso that degrade proteins to peptides for presentation on zzso class II molecules are poorly zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso L zzso and zzso S zzso have been shown to process zzso chain, thereby zzso zzso class II zzso However, their role in zzso processing is not zzso To examine this issue, we generated embryonic zzso lines that express zzso zzso or zzso zzso of zzso or zzso mediates efficient degradation of zzso chain as zzso zzso presentation was evaluated using T cell zzso zzso as well as mass zzso analysis of peptides zzso from zzso class II zzso Interestingly, we found that the majority of peptides are presented regardless of zzso or zzso zzso although these zzso often alter the relative levels of the zzso However, for a subset of zzso zzso generation is critically regulated by zzso or zzso This result suggests that these zzso zzso participate in zzso processing and generate qualitative and quantitative differences in the zzso zzso displayed by zzso class II zzso
