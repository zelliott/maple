In zzso the majority of zzso proteins are generated from zzso zzso zzso These zzso are unique in that they are not zzso but have a zzso structure in their 3' untranslated zzso An early event in 3' end formation of zzso zzso is the binding of zzso binding protein zzso to the zzso zzso Here we provide insight into the mechanism by which zzso contacts the zzso zzso There are two binding sites in the zzso zzso binding domain for the zzso zzso zzso The first binding site zzso consists of a zzso motif that likely recognizes the zzso zzso in the loop of the zzso hairpin and, upon zzso zzso the first zzso base pair at the base of the zzso The second binding site lies between zzso zzso and zzso which appears to recognize the second zzso base pair from the base of the stem and possibly regions zzso the zzso zzso We show that the zzso zzso complex is regulated by zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso sequence that lies between the two binding zzso zzso zzso increases the affinity of zzso for zzso zzso by slowing the off rate for complex zzso whereas the adjacent zzso acts as a critical hinge that may orient the second binding site for formation of a stable zzso zzso zzso The nuclear magnetic resonance and kinetic studies presented here provide a framework for understanding how zzso recognizes zzso zzso and highlight possible structural roles of zzso and zzso zzso in zzso binding proteins in zzso zzso zzso
