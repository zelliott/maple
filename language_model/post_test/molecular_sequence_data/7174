Three groups of zzso zzso zzso convert zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso have been shown to function in zzso protein zzso and they serve as zzso signaling molecules for regulating cell zzso To further zzso the mechanism of regulation and function of zzso we cloned genes zzso five putative zzso zzso from zzso zzso Database analysis indicates that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are most closely related to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is closest to the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso is most zzso to zzso zzso Together with other known zzso zzso a zzso of zzso zzso genes has been zzso with all of the zzso proteins sharing a common highly zzso zzso core zzso zzso zzso and zzso may have redundant functions because disruption of any single gene had no effect on zzso zzso growth or zzso However, strains in which both of the two most highly related zzso zzso and zzso were disrupted showed both growth and zzso zzso while double zzso of zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso appear to be zzso The delta zzso delta zzso zzso cells were smaller than zzso cells and grew slowly both in association with bacteria and in zzso medium when attached to zzso plates but were unable to grow in suspension in zzso zzso When delta zzso delta zzso zzso cells were zzso for zzso development, they formed zzso having multiple tips and produced abnormal zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso (a putative zzso of the zzso zzso zzso led to a zzso in the growth of zzso zzso cells on bacterial lawns and abnormal zzso zzso zzso the zzso growth zzso of a zzso zzso delta zzso zzso strain, suggesting zzso encodes a functional zzso of zzso zzso These observations indicate that in zzso zzso different zzso zzso regulate distinct cellular zzso including cell growth, development, and protein zzso
