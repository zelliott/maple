zzso spots from two-dimensional zzso gel zzso of a human zzso cell line have been identified by analysis of the zzso zzso zzso using zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso separation with zzso detection using zzso zzso mass zzso zzso This is performed using an zzso trap zzso zzso mass zzso system zzso A zzso zzso mapping display developed to process the zzso data acquired with this zzso system has been used to obtain mass identification of each zzso even though the zzso zzso only provides limited separation capability of the zzso zzso zzso studied zzso Using this method, a substantial fraction of the protein sequence can be covered and identified using the zzso zzso It is demonstrated that by entering the cell species, the approximate zzso and zzso range as determined by zzso gel zzso and the zzso zzso map into the database a unique match for identification of the protein generally zzso It is also demonstrated that a much improved coverage of the protein sequence is obtained by this method relative to zzso laser zzso mass zzso zzso
