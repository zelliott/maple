Human zzso leukemia virus zzso envelope zzso zzso induce fusion, leading to rampant zzso formation in a broad range of cell zzso Here, we identified zzso zzso zzso and zzso cell lines that are resistant to zzso zzso zzso zzso This resistance was not due to the absence of functional receptors for zzso zzso as these cells were susceptible to infection with zzso zzso zzso As zzso leukemia virus zzso zzso and zzso zzso present close structural zzso zzso zzso Kim, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2000), and because zzso of zzso formation by zzso zzso generally requires zzso of the R zzso in the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso we assessed whether zzso of the zzso domain of zzso zzso would alleviate this zzso Indeed, in all resistant cell lines, zzso of the last 8 zzso acids of the zzso zzso zzso domain zzso was sufficient to overcome resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso infection zzso varied according to the target cell lines and could be significantly higher than that observed with zzso zzso on zzso zzso These data indicate that a zzso located within the 8 zzso zzso zzso acids of TM plays a distinct role in zzso zzso zzso infection and zzso zzso
