zzso zzso assembly is a zzso process involving multiple zzso zzso Type XIV collagen contains multiple zzso and is capable of interacting with collagen zzso and other zzso zzso zzso During zzso development, naturally changing expression of type XIV collagen and its zzso may zzso such zzso Type XIV collagen was studied using zzso and molecular zzso Western analysis demonstrated that type XIV collagen content was high between days 14 and 19, decreasing sharply at zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that type XIV collagen was zzso with a zzso of 67 zzso indicating specific zzso zzso zzso zzso for type XIV collagen was seen at zzso indicating a removal of collagen XIV from the zzso zzso The expression of two zzso zzso zzso was zzso Overall, type XIV collagen zzso decreased significantly from day 14 to zzso The long zzso zzso zzso was the zzso species at 14 zzso at 19 days the two zzso were expressed in lower amounts at nearly a zzso zzso at zzso both zzso were expressed zzso Changes in zzso zzso zzso suggest that different functional forms of type XIV collagen are present, allowing modified interactions with zzso during zzso In conclusion, type XIV collagen is zzso and zzso zzso zzso of expression of the zzso zzso zzso may mediate the zzso interactions that allow the transition from growing zzso zzso to mature zzso
