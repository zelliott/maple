A zzso process for the manufacture of a zzso zzso heavy chain zzso from zzso zzso zzso C zzso a potential vaccine candidate, has been defined and successfully zzso The zzso was produced zzso in zzso zzso zzso using a three step zzso process, zzso zzso batch phase, a zzso zzso phase to achieve high cell zzso followed by a methanol induction zzso The zzso was captured from the soluble protein fraction of cell zzso using zzso charge induction zzso zzso zzso zzso and then further zzso using a CM zzso zzso exchange zzso step followed by a polishing step using zzso once zzso zzso development at the bench scale was achieved using zzso columns and the process was performed at the pilot scale using zzso columns in preparation for technology transfer to zzso zzso The process yielded approximately zzso g of zzso wet cell weight zzso at the bench scale and zzso g zzso zzso at the pilot zzso The zzso zzso was stable for at least 3 months at 5 and zzso as determined by reverse zzso and zzso and was stable for 24 months at zzso zzso based on mouse potency zzso zzso zzso acid sequencing confirmed that the zzso of the zzso zzso was zzso
