A method has been developed for the extraction from transformed zzso coli cells of zzso bovine zzso zzso in a relatively pure zzso While the extracted zzso was as zzso as the native hormone with respect to zzso zzso zzso its zzso as measured by the zzso zzso in zzso zzso was relatively zzso The zzso of the zzso could be increased to the same order as that of the native hormone by treatment with a mixture of oxidized and reduced zzso A number of zzso zzso containing specific zzso acid changes have been generated by zzso zzso The changes involved the substitution (or zzso of some of the zzso zzso acids in zzso by the different zzso acids present at the corresponding positions in the zzso but zzso bovine zzso Nine zzso containing single zzso acid changes had zzso and zzso of the same order as those of zzso One zzso which incorporated two of the single zzso acid changes zzso 62 to zzso and zzso 65 to zzso had zzso zzso that of zzso but much lower zzso zzso A further zzso generated by the deletion of zzso 28, had essentially no zzso although it could not be distinguished zzso from zzso or zzso The findings are discussed in the light of the putative three-dimensional zzso structure and current hypotheses which seek to relate specific regions of zzso to zzso zzso It appears that the first putative zzso of zzso is important for the binding and zzso activity of the zzso
