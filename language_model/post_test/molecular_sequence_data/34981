The zzso protein zzso zzso belongs to the family of zzso zzso that function in zzso resistance against zzso pathogens in zzso zzso zzso is associated with a severe zzso zzso The protein has been variously interpreted as a direct zzso zzso on bacterial zzso or on other zzso or as an zzso of zzso In this study, we zzso one of these claims, namely that zzso targets zzso and zzso zzso We found no zzso of zzso zzso using two zzso zzso techniques, either in zzso or in zzso We demonstrated the predicted existence of two protein zzso of zzso derived from differential zzso and described zzso zzso for their zzso Both zzso zzso zzso to the zzso apparatus and zzso to zzso however, only the long zzso zzso can be detected on zzso zzso Together with the previous observation that the general zzso zzso of zzso mice is reversed in zzso zzso mice, our results argue against a direct zzso function of zzso at the bacterial zzso We discuss these findings in the context of evidence that zzso functions as a negative regulator of other members of the zzso zzso protein zzso
