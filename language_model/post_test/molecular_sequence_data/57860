We have identified transcripts zzso several different forms of rat zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso that serves as a zzso for zzso Some forms of zzso lack the zzso zzso domain and thus resemble previously defined truncated zzso of zzso Other forms of zzso contain zzso zzso acid insertions within the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all forms of zzso can be detected throughout the nervous system, displaying substantial overlap as well as mutually exclusive distribution patterns with transcripts for zzso zzso only transcripts zzso the truncated forms of zzso and zzso are found in zzso peripheral zzso and zzso zzso Finally, forms of zzso containing insertions within the zzso domain retain their ability to zzso in response to zzso but cannot mediate proliferation in zzso or zzso differentiation in zzso zzso
