The zzso zzso highly zzso in all zzso cells, is an important regulatory zzso It plays an important role in the growth, amplification, zzso signal zzso and other crucial life activities of zzso A zzso zzso a putative zzso protein was isolated from cotton fiber zzso zzso The zzso designated as zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso zzso in length (including a zzso zzso long open reading frame and zzso zzso and deduced a protein with zzso zzso zzso The zzso shares higher zzso with the known plant zzso zzso and possesses the basic structure of zzso zzso one zzso domain, one zzso rich zzso four zzso zzso and one zzso Hand zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso was predominantly expressed during early fiber development, and reached to the peak of expression in 10 days post zzso zzso fiber cells, suggesting that the gene may be involved in regulating fiber zzso The gene is also expressed at higher level in both zzso and zzso but displays lower or zzso level of activity in other zzso of zzso
