zzso I zzso zzso zzso is the zzso which zzso the formation of complex zzso zzso in zzso by transforming zzso to the zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity and the structure that is zzso by this zzso are found in animals and plants but not in zzso zzso zzso the zzso have already been cloned from several zzso and the zzso zzso zzso In this article the cloning of an zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso to animal zzso is zzso By expression of the plant zzso in zzso zzso cells, a zzso cell line deficient in zzso it was shown that it encodes an active zzso with the same zzso activity as the animal zzso It has already been shown that a human zzso can complement an zzso zzso zzso zzso Here it is shown that the reverse is also true, the plant zzso is able to complement a zzso zzso zzso deficient in zzso
