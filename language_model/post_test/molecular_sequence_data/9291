In zzso the zzso zzso and stores proteins and zzso which will be transferred to the surface of adjacent zzso The mechanism of zzso storage, and transfer of these zzso materials in zzso zzso zzso differs completely from that reported in zzso zzso zzso which stores major zzso materials in zzso and zzso On zzso zzso three zzso zzso zzso and a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso coat zzso zzso are zzso During zzso development, zzso and zzso transcripts appeared at a mid zzso stage, whereas zzso transcript emerged at a late zzso zzso zzso and zzso transcripts were present only in the zzso zzso of the plant, whereas zzso transcript was distributed zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso family but has no closely related zzso Its nascent zzso has a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a zzso All three proteins were zzso in the zzso and were present on mature zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells of mid to late zzso stages revealed small zzso distributed throughout the zzso and numerous zzso zzso concentrated near the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso localized zzso in zzso zzso in the zzso and the wall facing the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso of zzso rather than in zzso The zzso zzso locations of the three proteins and zzso indicate distinct modes of their storage in zzso cells and transfer to the zzso surface, which in turn reflect their respective functions in zzso cells or the zzso zzso
