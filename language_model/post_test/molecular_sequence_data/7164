zzso is a zzso zzso zzso expressed in Philadelphia zzso human zzso zzso of zzso cell survival by zzso of zzso has been proposed to be an integral component of zzso chronic zzso zzso zzso elicits transformation of both zzso and zzso cells and blocks zzso following zzso deprivation in various zzso zzso To zzso the mechanisms zzso zzso zzso transformation and blocks zzso in zzso cells, we examined the biological effects of expression of a series of zzso zzso Single zzso acid zzso in the zzso binding site zzso zzso zzso 2 domain zzso or an zzso site in the zzso zzso domain zzso do not diminish the zzso and transforming properties of zzso in zzso cells, although these zzso were previously shown to drastically reduce the transforming activity of zzso in zzso A zzso zzso containing all three zzso zzso exhibits a severe decrease in transforming and zzso activities compared with the zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso zzso zzso Ras is zzso the zzso adapter protein is zzso zzso and binds zzso and zzso zzso levels are increased following expression of all zzso active zzso proteins with the exception of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso We propose that zzso uses multiple pathways to activate Ras in zzso cells and that this zzso is necessary for the transforming and zzso activities of zzso However, Ras zzso is not sufficient for zzso zzso A zzso deletion zzso zzso zzso that activates Ras and blocks zzso but has severely impaired transforming ability in zzso cells has been zzso These data suggest that zzso requires additional signaling components to elicit zzso growth which are distinct from those required to block zzso
