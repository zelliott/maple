We have identified a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that efficiently zzso zzso zzso In zzso this zzso will zzso zzso DNA or zzso of mixed zzso composition depending on the mix of zzso present in the synthesis zzso The zzso is conservative, changes zzso within the active site to zzso and does not affect promoter specificity or overall zzso zzso zzso of this zzso also reduce discrimination between zzso and zzso zzso but these zzso also cause large activity zzso Of 26 zzso of other zzso in and around the active site examined none showed marked effects on zzso zzso zzso of the corresponding zzso in DNA zzso zzso I increase zzso though effects on zzso discrimination for the zzso I zzso have not been zzso This zzso zzso may therefore play a similar role in many zzso by sensing incorrect geometry in the structure of the zzso due to inappropriate zzso structure or zzso zzso zzso can use zzso templates as well as DNA templates and is capable of both primer extension and de zzso zzso The zzso zzso retains the ability to use zzso or DNA zzso Thus this zzso can display de zzso initiated or primed zzso DNA zzso reverse zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso activities depending simply on the templates and zzso presented to it in the synthesis zzso
