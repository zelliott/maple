zzso channels are zzso zzso zzso that may serve as zzso models for more complex protein zzso zzso zzso zzso synthesis of zzso zzso using zzso acid zzso followed by chemical zzso of these peptides zzso zzso studies of particular channel states in zzso zzso State 3 in particular, tentatively assigned to a zzso zzso zzso is sufficiently zzso that zzso zzso can be made during the lifetime of an individual channel zzso zzso models of zzso zzso zzso generated using restrained molecular dynamics with simulated zzso indicate that a zzso zzso zzso will increase channel diameter zzso zzso the zzso of state 3 of the zzso channel is found to be larger than that of the zzso channel when zzso flow is in the usual direction zzso entering the zzso end of the zzso When zzso flow is in the opposite direction, no difference in the zzso of state 3 of Q7 and state 3 of zzso channels is zzso These results indicate that the effect of a change in pore diameter at position 7 is dependent on the magnitude of other barriers to zzso and that these barriers are zzso
