zzso clones zzso the A chain of zzso growth factor zzso have been zzso The gene contains seven zzso spanning about 24 zzso of zzso The positions of intervening sequences closely match those of the related zzso zzso gene on zzso zzso In zzso zzso was used to zzso the zzso zzso gene to the zzso portion of the short arm of zzso 7 zzso Within the zzso + zzso zzso region, a single zzso start site was identified approximately equal to 36 base pairs downstream of a zzso consensus promoter zzso The three size classes of zzso zzso probably arise by selection of alternative zzso sites in zzso 7, but only a single consensus zzso signal was identified in this zzso Two functionally different zzso zzso which differ by the presence or absence of a basic C zzso are generated as a result of alternative zzso zzso events, which include or exclude zzso zzso This and other structural features of the zzso gene suggest that zzso expression may be modulated at zzso and zzso zzso
