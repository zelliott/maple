zzso in zzso is believed to constitute a mechanism of response to adverse conditions and represents an important attribute for the development of zzso by a number of zzso zzso zzso We have isolated zzso a gene zzso a zzso protein that is essential for zzso growth in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and which represents the first zzso zzso described for zzso zzso is not an essential zzso and its deletion does not affect the ability to mate or impair zzso polarization in zzso zzso However, strains lacking functional zzso show zzso in cell zzso suggesting that the function of zzso may be related to some aspect of the polarization of cell zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that zzso of zzso increases steadily during the zzso transition, while Southern zzso analysis of zzso DNA suggested the presence of several zzso family members in zzso zzso Interestingly, strains lacking functional zzso are still able to grow as the zzso form and to invade zzso thus pointing to a function for zzso downstream of zzso a previously isolated gene zzso a zzso zinc finger protein with the ability to bind putative stress response elements and whose activity is essential for both zzso and zzso growth in zzso zzso
