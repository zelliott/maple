zzso one of the major structural genes of cartilage, encodes a zzso core protein composed of an extended central zzso domain, flanked by zzso zzso at each zzso The central region consists of long stretches of repeating zzso acids that serve as attachment sites for zzso such as zzso and zzso zzso the terminal zzso zzso interact with other cartilage zzso The zzso attachment region is zzso in several species by a single large zzso within which are several different types of repeating zzso Several species show within this zzso a similar block of zzso repeats for attachment of zzso zzso but in humans this group of repeats is particularly well zzso zzso of zzso DNA from a population of unrelated individuals by zzso chain reaction or Southern zzso zzso shows this block of repeat sequences exists in multiple zzso forms, which differ by the number of repeats at this site in each zzso Thirteen different zzso have been identified, with repeat numbers ranging from 13 to zzso This is an unusual example of an expressed variable number of tandem repeat zzso This zzso is apparently restricted to humans, of several species zzso This zzso results in individuals with differing length zzso core zzso bearing different numbers of potential attachment sites for zzso zzso The possibility exists for a molecular understanding of biological variation in cartilage functional zzso
