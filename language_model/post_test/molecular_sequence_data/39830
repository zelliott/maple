zzso acid, type A zzso zzso of which the zzso zzso family is a zzso are members of the zzso loop family of neurotransmitter zzso zzso modeling of the zzso domain of these proteins has revealed many molecular details, but it is not yet clear how zzso is zzso in the binding zzso Here we have examined the role of zzso zzso that the zzso model locates in or close to the binding site of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso using zzso and functional zzso The data suggest that zzso is critical for zzso binding and/or zzso substitution with zzso Ala, or zzso resulted in zzso zzso and modeling placed the zzso of zzso within 3A of this zzso zzso of zzso with Ala or zzso resulted in zzso increases in zzso values compared with wild type zzso and modeling indicated a role of this zzso both in binding zzso and in the structure of the binding zzso zzso of zzso with zzso or Ala yielded zzso zzso whereas zzso caused an approximately zzso increase in zzso zzso was zzso with Ala, zzso or zzso with relatively small ( approximately zzso changes in zzso These and data from other zzso that the model suggested could interact with zzso zzso zzso and zzso support a location for zzso in the binding site with its zzso zzso between zzso and zzso with zzso zzso and zzso contributing to the structure of the binding pocket through salt bridges and/or hydrogen zzso
