The gradual zzso of examples of protein zzso in which a zzso intervening sequence is spliced out of the interior of a zzso zzso suggests that this curious phenomenon might prove to have universal zzso distribution and biological zzso The known examples are zzso with the aim of establishing underlying patterns, and a generalized mechanism of zzso protein zzso is zzso The testable consequences of such a proposal and the possible evolutionary origins of the phenomenon are zzso
