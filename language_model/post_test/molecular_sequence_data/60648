zzso is a zzso zzso derived from sand flies that is an zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso type 1 zzso Surprisingly, zzso does not share significant sequence zzso with zzso To examine the relationship between structure and activity of zzso several zzso acid zzso and deletions were made in the zzso These peptides were examined in zzso for binding to crude zzso derived from rabbit brain, a tissue that expresses zzso type 1 zzso and induction of zzso was determined in zzso cells, a line that expresses these zzso The peptides were examined in zzso for their ability to induce zzso in rabbit zzso zzso of the individual zzso at positions 1 and 5 or deletion of this ring structure had little effect on zzso zzso of either zzso at position 14 or 51 eliminated zzso zzso of the 19 zzso acids between positions 24 and 42 resulted in a zzso with zzso but no functional zzso The capacity of this deletion zzso to interact with zzso cells zzso with the zzso type 1 zzso revealed that this zzso was a specific zzso to the zzso type 1 zzso
