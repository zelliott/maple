The potent zzso factor zzso zzso zzso factor zzso is a distant member of the transforming growth zzso zzso zzso of zzso We report a zzso factor that is the first nuclear protein known to be induced by zzso thus designated zzso zzso zzso factor zzso The zzso was cloned in the course of investigating zzso factors that bind to zzso consensus zzso using the in zzso filter detection method, and it was found to zzso a protein having the same zzso zinc finger motif as zzso zzso analysis indicated that zzso is zzso to the human zzso zzso early gene zzso and human early growth response zzso zzso zzso is widely distributed in the adult mouse with high zzso levels in zzso zzso brain, liver, heart, and zzso In the adult brain, zzso is abundantly expressed in zzso cerebral cortex, zzso and zzso with lower amounts in zzso nucleus zzso zzso zzso thalamus, and zzso zzso During development, zzso zzso also has a wide distribution, including in cerebral cortex, zzso zzso zzso zzso liver, and zzso zzso zzso the expression of zzso rapidly and zzso both in a zzso cell line and in primary cultures of rat embryonic cortical zzso zzso of the zzso zzso cells using zzso expression zzso and reporter zzso having zzso binding sites indicated that zzso zzso zzso from a zzso as well as from a zzso zzso These observations suggest that the zinc finger zzso factor zzso could be important in zzso some of the biological effects of zzso
