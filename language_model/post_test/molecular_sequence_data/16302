An extensive analysis of zzso DNA preparations from a number of normal and zzso zzso revealed zzso site zzso of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso gene zzso were found to contain an additional zzso site localized in a region of zzso zzso This zzso form of zzso gene was also responsible for zzso protein having altered zzso zzso zzso cloning and sequencing of both the zzso of zzso gene revealed a zzso change in zzso 72 causing zzso substitution in the zzso with the additional zzso zzso Both zzso of the zzso gene may occur in zzso state and are therefore zzso
