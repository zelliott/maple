To establish a baseline for monitoring resistance to zzso zzso zzso and examining the efficacy of their use among persons in Cameroon infected with human zzso virus type 1 zzso we analyzed genetic zzso and zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso sequences in strains isolated from 110 zzso zzso zzso Of the 110 zzso 85 were classified into six zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso 1), B zzso zzso 1), F zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso zzso H zzso zzso 1), and J zzso zzso zzso and a circulating zzso form, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso genes from the remaining 25 zzso specimens were zzso whereas zzso (7 of zzso zzso zzso sequences were reported for a global zzso Two major zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were detected in strains from only two zzso whereas secondary zzso were found in strains from all samples except one strain of zzso B and two strains of zzso The secondary zzso showed the typical zzso zzso pattern for zzso B viruses in both zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso being the zzso zzso zzso followed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso zzso Of these zzso dual and triple zzso zzso zzso were found in 38% of all the zzso zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences had significantly more dual and triple zzso zzso versus zzso P zzso zzso zzso and clinical evaluations are needed to estimate whether zzso resistance during zzso drug treatment occurs more rapidly in individuals infected with zzso strains harboring multiple zzso zzso zzso This information may be important for determination of appropriate drug therapies for zzso persons in zzso where more than one-third of zzso strains were found to carry dual and triple minor zzso zzso zzso
