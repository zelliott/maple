zzso communities responsible for methane cycling in mud volcanoes onshore are poorly zzso This study zzso bubbling zzso and zzso sediments retrieved from a mud zzso in eastern zzso The pore water profiles revealed that methane zzso generally increased with depth and changed dramatically at different depth intervals at different zzso The methane zzso were zzso correlated with zzso zzso and zzso values of zzso marking zzso transition zones in the zzso zzso zzso communities were dominated by zzso members and zzso zzso whereas bacterial communities consisted primarily of zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso gene copy numbers of zzso and zzso populations varied by two to three orders of magnitude along the profile and exhibited a pattern comparable with those of zzso and zzso values of zzso These lines of evidence suggest a zzso between zzso zzso and metal reduction in the zzso transition zones under zzso conditions, a zzso scheme contrasting with that observed in marine cold zzso zzso zzso zzso by removing methane produced from in zzso zzso and originating from the deep zzso Methane finally zzso into the atmosphere is zzso and zzso altered by various microbial processes zzso at different depth zzso
