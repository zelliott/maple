zzso zzso zzso zzso represents one of the most advanced and powerful tools for studying and visualizing zzso interactions in living zzso In this method, putative interacting protein partners are fused to complementary zzso fragments of an zzso zzso such as the yellow spectral zzso of the green fluorescent zzso zzso of the test proteins may result in reconstruction of zzso if the two portions of yellow spectral zzso of the green fluorescent protein are brought together in such a way that they can fold zzso zzso provides an zzso for detection of zzso zzso and for the zzso zzso of the interacting protein zzso To facilitate the application of zzso to plant research, we designed a series of zzso for easy construction of zzso and zzso zzso of the target protein to the yellow spectral zzso of the green fluorescent protein zzso These zzso carry zzso expression zzso with an expanded zzso zzso In addition, these zzso facilitate the assembly of zzso expression zzso into zzso zzso expression zzso plasmids for zzso of interacting partners and additional zzso proteins that may serve as internal transformation controls and markers of zzso zzso We demonstrate the utility of these zzso for the analysis of specific zzso interactions in various cellular zzso including the nucleus, zzso and zzso of different plant species and cell zzso
