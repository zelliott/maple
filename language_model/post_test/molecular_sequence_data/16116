The zzso sequence corresponding to almost the whole of a mouse zzso zzso zzso was determined from overlapping cloned DNA copies derived from brain zzso Several zzso processed zzso were isolated from a library of cloned zzso mouse zzso DNA, and the zzso sequences of these were determined and compared with that of the zzso This showed that two of these zzso had arisen from a gene zzso or amplification event, and indicated that they had subsequently undergone partial correction against one zzso The relative ages of the zzso were estimated on the basis of their percentage divergence from the zzso sequence and these were compared with an zzso based on the number of presumed silent zzso in the zzso since each zzso had zzso zzso results were zzso except in the case of one zzso which also showed an anomalous regional distribution of differences from the zzso zzso One way of accounting for the features of this anomalous zzso is by zzso that it is derived from a second functional gene for zzso different from that represented by the zzso described zzso
