Up until recently the only available experimental zzso zzso structure of a zzso zzso zzso was that of bovine zzso In the past few years the determination of zzso structures has accelerated with three new zzso as well as zzso zzso being successfully zzso All share a common molecular architecture of seven zzso zzso and can therefore serve as templates for building molecular models of zzso zzso However, despite the common general architecture of these structures key differences do exist between zzso The choice of which experimental zzso zzso to use for building a comparative model of a particular zzso is unclear and without detailed structural and sequence zzso could be zzso The aim of this study is therefore to perform a systematic and detailed analysis of zzso relationships of known zzso zzso 

We analyzed in detail zzso and unique sequence motifs and structural features in zzso zzso zzso zzso insight into specific and important structural features of zzso as well as valuable information for template selection has been zzso Using key features a zzso has been formulated for identifying the most appropriate zzso for building zzso models of zzso of unknown zzso This zzso was applied to a set of 14 human family A zzso suggesting for each the most appropriate zzso for building a comparative molecular zzso 

The available crystal structures represent only a subset of all possible structural variation in family A zzso Some zzso have structural features that are distributed over different crystal structures or which are not present in the templates suggesting that zzso models should be built using multiple zzso This study provides a systematic analysis of zzso crystal structures and a consistent method for identifying suitable templates for zzso zzso zzso that will help to produce more reliable three-dimensional zzso
