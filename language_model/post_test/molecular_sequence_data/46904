Four zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso human zzso zzso were used as zzso to study the interaction of the zzso zzso to its zzso The zzso binding to immobilized zzso was completely inhibited by zzso and zzso but neither zzso nor zzso showed any zzso zzso zzso of the immune complexes formed by zzso zzso with paired zzso revealed the lack of simultaneous binding of two different zzso to the zzso suggesting that all zzso recognize the same zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso were also able to neutralize the zzso zzso and zzso activities as well as zzso binding to zzso zzso As zzso did not recognize zzso exposed zzso in the zzso complexes, zzso induction of a zzso change in the zzso binding domain zzso its binding to receptors was considered zzso In order to identify the zzso region recognized by zzso zzso was zzso with different zzso zzso zzso of the resulting peptides was examined by Western zzso and their sequences were established by zzso degradation after zzso to zzso zzso zzso Data obtained indicated that the smallest zzso region recognized by zzso consisted of zzso zzso or zzso As this zone includes the sequence zzso which has been involved in the binding to zzso and our zzso did not show an zzso zzso it is concluded that they are directed to overlapping zzso located close to or even included in the zzso binding zzso
