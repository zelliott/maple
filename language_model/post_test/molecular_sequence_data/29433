zzso acids are zzso zzso that are toxic to aquatic life when released in high zzso in pulp mill zzso These naturally formed organic acids are readily zzso by bacteria and zzso zzso many of the mechanisms involved are still zzso We report the zzso zzso and sequencing of genes for zzso degradation zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso Using gene knockout zzso we demonstrate that zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso is required for growth on zzso and zzso zzso A second gene knockout in zzso zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso reduced the growth of strain zzso on zzso and zzso acids as sole sources of carbon and energy, but did not eliminate zzso The degree of zzso between zzso and zzso the closest known zzso zzso to zzso identifies zzso as a new member of the zzso zzso zzso of six of the zzso genes to zzso DNA of a related zzso acid degrading zzso zzso zzso zzso identified zzso zzso in this strain that zzso aromatic ring zzso genes zzso to open the ring structure of zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest the zzso and zzso genes may function in concert to allow these zzso strains to degrade zzso zzso zzso of several of the zzso genes were detected in zzso acid degrading zzso and zzso species within the zzso and zzso
