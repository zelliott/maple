A rapid and sensitive zzso method for the determination of zzso activity is zzso This method is based on the monitoring of the zzso at 320 zzso of zzso zzso zzso formed from the zzso zzso zzso after separation by zzso liquid zzso using a zzso zzso column by zzso zzso This method is sensitive enough to measure zzso at levels as low as 10 zzso yields highly zzso results and requires less than zzso zzso per sample for separation and zzso The optimum pH for zzso activity was zzso The zzso and zzso values were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, with the use of zzso extract obtained from mouse whole zzso The approximate molecular mass of this zzso was estimated to be 64,000 by gel zzso zzso activity was strongly inhibited by zzso zzso and zzso zzso By using this method, zzso activity could be readily detected in a single mouse zzso zzso Among the zzso examined in various mouse brain regions, the highest specific activity of the zzso was found in cerebral zzso The sensitivity and selectivity of this method will aid in efforts to examine the zzso role of this zzso
