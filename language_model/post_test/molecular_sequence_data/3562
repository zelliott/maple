The zzso target of zzso zzso controls the translation machinery via zzso of zzso zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso of the zzso initiation factor zzso zzso binding proteins 1, 2, and 3 zzso zzso and zzso are regulated by zzso and zzso zzso The molecular basis of zzso regulation of zzso and zzso remains zzso 

We have identified a zzso zzso signaling zzso motif in the N zzso of all known zzso zzso and in the C zzso of the zzso that is crucial for zzso and regulation zzso and zzso zzso zzso or zzso within the zzso motif significantly inhibit zzso zzso and the zzso of its zzso zzso zzso In addition, this sequence is required to suppress an zzso activity zzso by the zzso C zzso The zzso motif is essential for zzso zzso by zzso as zzso in this motif mimic the effect of zzso on zzso zzso and render zzso insensitive to changes in zzso zzso Furthermore, only zzso of zzso with an intact zzso motif prevents zzso zzso by a common zzso zzso of zzso and zzso 

zzso and zzso contain a zzso five zzso acid sequence zzso zzso that is crucial for their regulation by the zzso zzso zzso seems to regulate zzso by two distinct zzso The zzso motif appears to function as a zzso site for either zzso itself or a common upstream zzso of zzso and zzso
