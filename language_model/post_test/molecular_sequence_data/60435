We previously showed that bovine zzso zzso zzso had zzso activity against zzso coli and the zzso zzso zzso in zzso We have characterized here the active domain of zzso using synthetic zzso A zzso corresponding to zzso zzso zzso exhibited significant zzso activity against zzso coli in zzso but not against zzso zzso zzso using zzso peptides indicated that the zzso zzso are required for the zzso zzso zzso induced the release of zzso trapped inside the zzso whose zzso composition resembles that of zzso coli zzso suggesting that zzso zzso can destabilize the zzso coli zzso CD zzso showed that the zzso of zzso zzso increased from zzso to zzso by addition of the zzso When zzso coli cells were incubated with zzso zzso some proteins were released to the external zzso probably zzso to membrane zzso caused by the zzso In electron zzso of zzso coli cells treated with zzso zzso transparent zzso and zzso zzso were zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso caused the loss of zzso activity against zzso coli, although zzso activity was zzso zzso zzso of the cells treated with zzso zzso revealed zzso change only at the zzso Therefore zzso zzso appears to primarily target the zzso rather than the membrane of zzso coli zzso
