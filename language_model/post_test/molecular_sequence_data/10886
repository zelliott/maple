zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that removes long chain fatty zzso groups from modified zzso zzso in zzso zzso in this zzso were recently shown to zzso the zzso neurodegenerative disorder, infantile zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso derived from zzso proteins were found to accumulate in zzso from individuals with the zzso In the current study, we describe the cloning and expression of a second zzso zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso that shares an zzso identity with zzso zzso zzso expression of a zzso zzso led to the production of a zzso zzso protein with zzso zzso activity comparable with zzso zzso However, zzso did not remove zzso groups from zzso proteins that are zzso for zzso zzso In zzso experiments, zzso did not abolish the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso cell zzso These results indicate that zzso is a zzso zzso that possesses a zzso specificity that is distinct from that of zzso zzso
