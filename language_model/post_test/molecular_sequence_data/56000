zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso of the black widow zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso selective only for zzso A zzso zzso the putative zzso precursor was isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso contains a zzso open reading frame corresponding to a zzso protein composed of zzso zzso zzso The mature zzso with molecular mass approximately 130 zzso is probably derived from double processing in the zzso and zzso regions of the primary translation zzso The structure region, extending over zzso zzso is composed almost entirely of zzso repeats which represent a motif also found in the zzso zzso which has selective action on zzso Total alignment of the zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences reveals an overall similarity of zzso Strong sequence divergence is observed in analogous zzso regions situated within the zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso
