zzso zzso zzso channels zzso exclusively to the plasma membrane of zzso outer segments of rod zzso where they generate the electrical response to zzso Here, we report the finding that targeting of zzso channels to the rod outer segment required their interaction with zzso zzso localized exclusively to rod outer zzso zzso with the zzso channel, and bound to the zzso domain of the channel zzso zzso zzso depletion in zzso mouse zzso markedly reduced zzso channel zzso zzso expression of zzso channel zzso zzso in zzso rods showed that zzso binding was necessary and sufficient for targeting of the zzso zzso to outer zzso Thus, zzso is required for transport of zzso channels to the plasma membrane of rod outer zzso
