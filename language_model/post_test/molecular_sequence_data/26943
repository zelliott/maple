zzso B virus zzso is primarily transmitted from mother to child, by sexual zzso intravenous drug abuse, or unsafe health zzso injection zzso Despite increased safety efforts, zzso acquired zzso B infection remains zzso 

A large zzso outbreak was investigated zzso 36 patients with acute zzso infection in a primary care zzso zzso 

In a retrospective study zzso 36 serum samples from patients with acute zzso infection were zzso They had received several injections by the same physician at least 3 months before the onset of clinical zzso As a control group, zzso were collected from zzso patients from other physicians from the same zzso zzso zzso zzso were amplified and were zzso zzso 

zzso complete zzso of 32 patients were successfully amplified and zzso and clustered together with the reference zzso A, zzso zzso zzso We also zzso 26 control zzso zzso A zzso All 32 zzso strains from the patient group clustered in a zzso branch with a zzso value of 100, whereas the control samples zzso separately in another zzso The genetic distance value showed small differences within the patients group, whereas the rate within the control group was seven times zzso These observations confirm that the source of transmission was clearly different in both zzso 

zzso likelihood analysis and genetic distance calculations based on the full-length zzso of zzso strains isolated from patients and controls provided strong evidence for a common zzso source of infection for all 32 patient zzso
