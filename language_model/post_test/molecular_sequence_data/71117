We have shown recently that the relative abundance of the three zzso forms zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso protein from zzso coli varies during growth and in response to environmental zzso Using gel zzso zzso we have compared the DNA binding properties of the three zzso with different DNA zzso The determination of their DNA binding parameters shows that the relative affinities of zzso and zzso are zzso Both zzso with a high degree of affinity under stringent conditions, zzso structures or DNA molecules with a zzso or a zzso whereas they bind to linear DNA only at low zzso DNA containing a gap of two zzso is in fact the zzso recognized with the highest degree of affinity by these two forms under all zzso zzso zzso binds very poorly to duplex DNA and shows a much lower affinity for zzso or gapped zzso However, zzso binds to zzso DNA structures almost as well as zzso and zzso This almost exclusive binding of zzso to a unique zzso is surprising in regards of the zzso identity, in the three forms, of the flexible arms considered as the zzso zzso of the three forms of zzso zzso DNA may stabilize zzso structure which could be structurally zzso
