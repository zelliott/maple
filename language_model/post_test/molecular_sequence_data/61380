Although a novel DNA virus, zzso virus zzso has been isolated from a patient with zzso zzso zzso its zzso role remains zzso To zzso its prevalence and clinical impact in patients with liver diseases, the presence of zzso DNA was assessed in patients with liver diseases and blood donors zzso in Japan using two primer sets, one conventional and the other new and highly zzso 

We studied 261 samples, 72 with chronic zzso associated zzso C virus zzso 57 with zzso zzso associated zzso zzso 12 with zzso without either zzso or zzso B virus zzso and 120 of zzso 

Using two primer sets, zzso DNA was detected in 68 zzso 53 zzso 12 zzso and 98 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The prevalence was not significantly different between zzso and zzso or between zzso and zzso zzso between patients with and without zzso revealed no significant differences in backgrounds or zzso zzso zzso findings in patients with zzso and number, maximum diameter, and zzso differentiation of zzso also did not demonstrate any relation to zzso zzso zzso strains can be divided into five groups using zzso analysis, but no zzso group appears to zzso 

Our data suggest that: 1) zzso is very prevalent among patients with liver diseases and even among zzso in Japan, 2) zzso infection does not impact on liver damage with zzso infection, and 3) zzso infection also does not affect the development or progression of zzso
