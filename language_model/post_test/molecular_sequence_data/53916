The genes zzso three forms of zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from an zzso zzso zzso fix II zzso zzso zzso Southern zzso analyses indicate zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso are separated by zzso zzso of sequence and are zzso zzso Since the transcripts from all three sod genes are zzso the zzso start point of each gene was determined in a zzso system that lacks zzso machinery by in zzso zzso using zzso zzso nuclear zzso followed by primer extension zzso The ability of the zzso zzso region of the genes zzso the three zzso to promote zzso was further examined in transient zzso of Chinese zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso reporter zzso the zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso gene promoters showed zzso strong, and moderate levels of activity in these cells, zzso Both zzso and zzso gene promoter regions showed an initial increase in activity in response to zzso zzso The results from the in zzso zzso experiments and the zzso reporter zzso were consistent and suggest the presence of zzso elements in the promoter regions of the zzso zzso
