The prevalence of zzso disease zzso ticks on zzso birds was studied in zzso A total of zzso birds were caught at eight different bird zzso and examined for zzso Five different species of ticks were found zzso the zzso The dominant species, zzso constituted zzso of the ticks zzso The presence of zzso was determined by an zzso zzso of tick larvae and DNA amplification by zzso on all zzso To determine which zzso zzso zzso zzso species were present, a species zzso was performed by DNA amplification with zzso zzso zzso zzso and by DNA sequencing zzso is DNA coding for zzso zzso gene sequences of all species of zzso zzso zzso zzso previously recorded in Europe were zzso zzso zzso was the most prevalent zzso disease zzso species in ticks collected from birds arriving from the South or Southeast in the spring, whereas the distribution was more zzso in ticks from birds zzso from the zzso These data support the notion that birds are partly responsible for the zzso distribution of zzso disease zzso zzso in zzso
