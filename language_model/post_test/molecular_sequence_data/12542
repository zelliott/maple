The binding of zzso zzso and native wheat germ zzso with zzso and zzso was measured and zzso The zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso and zzso 86 zzso of wheat germ protein synthesis initiation factor zzso have been obtained from zzso coli expression of the cloned DNA zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The binding of the zzso cap analogue zzso to the small zzso zzso of zzso as a function of zzso temperature, and zzso strength is zzso The mode of binding of zzso to cap zzso is very similar to the intact zzso Assuming that all zzso zzso contribute to zzso and zzso fluorescence, zzso zzso shows that all 9 zzso zzso in zzso are zzso while only 6 out of 16 zzso zzso are zzso on the intact zzso The zzso zzso studies of zzso and zzso with cap show a zzso zzso zzso The rate of this zzso change was approximately zzso faster for the isolated zzso compared with the native zzso From these studies it appears that cap recognition resides in the zzso zzso However, zzso enhances the interaction with capped zzso and probably is involved in zzso interactions as zzso Both zzso are required for zzso zzso
