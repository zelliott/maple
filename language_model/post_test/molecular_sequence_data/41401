A new zzso zzso was isolated from a low zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequencing indicated that the strain was closely related to zzso zzso zzso experiment results showed that the strain completely oxidized 500 zzso of zzso to zzso within 12 h of incubation in a minimal zzso zzso The optimum initial pH range for zzso zzso was zzso The strain was found to tolerate as high as 60 zzso zzso in culture zzso The zzso zzso gene was amplified by zzso with zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence showed the highest identity zzso zzso with the zzso containing large zzso of zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso zzso the zzso acids involved in binding the zzso zzso were zzso with the zzso zzso of other zzso zzso bacteria such as zzso zzso and zzso zzso To our knowledge, this study constitutes the first report on zzso zzso using zzso zzso and the strain has great potential for application in zzso zzso of contaminated zzso
