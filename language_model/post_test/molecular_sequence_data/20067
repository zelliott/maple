The tomato zzso zzso zzso gene encodes a protein with putative zzso zzso site and zzso repeat zzso zzso zzso resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso potato zzso zzso zzso and sweet potato zzso zzso zzso To identify genes required in the zzso resistance to zzso and zzso we used tobacco rattle virus zzso zzso gene zzso zzso to repress candidate genes and zzso for zzso and zzso zzso We targeted zzso zzso of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso shock protein zzso which are known to participate early in resistance gene signaling zzso Two zzso zzso zzso zzso genes exist and one has been implicated in disease zzso Thus far the sequence of only one zzso zzso is known in zzso To design zzso zzso zzso we cloned a second tomato zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso construct zzso resulted in zzso while zzso zzso using zzso did not result in lethal zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso plants indicated no role for zzso in zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso construct zzso both zzso and zzso yielded live plants and identified a role for zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso did not affect zzso zzso and zzso resistance and demonstrated that zzso is not required for zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso and zzso resistance and indicated a role for zzso The requirement for zzso and zzso in zzso resistance provides further evidence for common components in early resistance gene defense signaling against diverse pathogens and zzso
