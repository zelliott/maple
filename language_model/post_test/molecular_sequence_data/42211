The mouse zzso zzso was shown to be constantly shuttling between the nucleus and zzso although under zzso conditions it is detected predominantly in the cell nucleus in both the absence and presence of zzso zzso was demonstrated by monitoring the transfer of protein between zzso in zzso and by examining the zzso distribution of zzso zzso In the presence of the partial zzso zzso the zzso was retained in the nucleus whereas it accumulated in the zzso when cells were treated with the pure zzso zzso zzso The effect of the pure zzso was to inhibit zzso shuttling of the zzso by blocking its nuclear zzso Thus although zzso binding is not required by the zzso zzso to undergo zzso zzso this process can be disrupted by the binding of a pure zzso
