The zzso DNA of zzso zzso F zzso zzso includes a zzso zzso zzso coding sequences zzso and a zzso zzso 25 zzso The arrangement of the zzso zzso zzso F zzso gene zzso a zzso (or zzso zzso including the zzso gene and other relevant zzso and its different zzso sites in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso F were zzso Mobile elements and zzso factors were zzso We also found a cell zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso which may function in attaching to the host and as a zzso zzso The nine zzso gene clusters of group I zzso zzso strains were located at three sites in the zzso of zzso zzso F zzso zzso This study showed the inserting inclination of zzso tend to have gene clusters inserted at site 3, zzso at site 2, and zzso at site zzso Additionally, we found the zzso event between the zzso gene clusters of sites 2 and 3, a mechanism that contributed to the diversity of the zzso gene cluster zzso
