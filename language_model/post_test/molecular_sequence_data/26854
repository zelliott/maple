Most core components of the neurotransmitter release machinery have zzso in other types of zzso membrane traffic, likely underlying a universal mechanism of zzso membrane zzso However, no clear similarity between zzso and protein families generally involved in membrane traffic has been reported, despite the essential nature of zzso for neurotransmitter zzso This crucial function was ascribed to a minimal zzso region called the zzso domain, which likely zzso in soluble zzso sensitive factor attachment protein zzso complex zzso assembly and is also found in zzso zzso protein for zzso We have now used comparative sequence and structural analyses to study the structure and evolutionary origin of the zzso zzso We found weak yet significant sequence similarities between the zzso domain and a set of protein zzso from several related zzso zzso complexes, such as zzso from the zzso complex and zzso from the zzso retrograde protein zzso Such an evolutionary relationship allows structure prediction of the zzso domain and suggests functional similarities between zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso complexes such as zzso zzso zzso zzso complex, zzso retrograde protein complex, and zzso These findings further unify the mechanism of neurotransmitter release with those of other types of zzso membrane traffic and, in turn, support a role for zzso complexes in soluble zzso sensitive factor attachment protein zzso complex zzso
