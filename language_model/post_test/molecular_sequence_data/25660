The zzso resolution crystal structure of native zzso iron zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was solved and refined to a final R factor of zzso The zzso structure contains one zzso iron center per zzso with an zzso zzso coordination of protein zzso to the zzso Each zzso contains two zzso with the zzso zzso zzso 74 and zzso zzso zzso contributed by the large domain and stabilized by an extended zzso network, including zzso from opposing zzso The zzso zzso zzso 26) is found on the small domain and does not participate extensively in the stabilizing zzso zzso The open zzso coordination position of the iron is devoid of bound water molecules or zzso The metal is located zzso A out of the plane of the zzso zzso toward zzso 26, providing a slightly skewed coordination away from the iron binding zzso The zzso contains a zzso zzso in the active site which is zzso between all iron zzso zzso to data but which is zzso among all zzso zzso at a separate position in the zzso This zzso shows the same structural interactions in both cases, zzso that iron and zzso zzso are zzso zzso of one zzso
