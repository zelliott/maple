The zzso domain of zzso consists of three imperfect tandem repeats and the third one which is essential for zzso binding was established to have a zzso zzso DNA sequences recognized by zzso have been reported to contain zzso zzso Here we have examined the details of zzso zzso Using zzso with a single zzso on the various sites of two specific zzso and some fragments of the zzso domain of zzso we have found that zzso in a specific DNA which contains only one zzso zzso each zzso zzso is found to be essential for the specific binding of zzso while any other zzso cause no serious binding loss, zzso in a specific DNA which contains two zzso sequences zzso one zzso is not so important in the zzso and zzso for the specific binding with DNA, at least both repeats 2 and 3 of zzso are zzso These findings suggest that repeat 3 containing a zzso structure recognizes the core zzso sequence and repeat 2 supports this recognition by interactions with zzso groups of zzso
