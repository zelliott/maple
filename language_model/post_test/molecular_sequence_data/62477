zzso of the zzso C virus zzso zzso for infected patients increasingly has become accepted as the standard of zzso zzso assignment helps in assessing disease prognosis and assists in establishing the appropriate duration of zzso The great genetic diversity of zzso with 11 major zzso and zzso zzso contributes to the technical difficulty of zzso zzso While the zzso zzso for testing is zzso acid sequencing, a variety of zzso zzso including the line probe zzso have been developed to provide more rapid and accessible forms of zzso The aim of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso liquid zzso zzso could be used as a clinical method for distinguishing zzso zzso 1, 2, 3, and zzso A portion of the zzso untranslated region of the zzso zzso was amplified by zzso multiplex reverse zzso zzso The two zzso then were analyzed by zzso analysis and compared to the zzso determined by sequence zzso After 115 specimens were analyzed as standards, 200 masked specimens zzso whose identity was not known before zzso were analyzed to determine the zzso of the zzso The zzso had a zzso of zzso at the zzso level and a zzso of zzso at the zzso zzso However, the zzso method was not as accurate as other reported methods of zzso zzso This is the first time that zzso zzso has been performed by zzso
