The influence of an zzso hairpin DNA minor groove zzso on the zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso reaction step of the zzso was zzso The results demonstrate that zzso is affected by the hairpin zzso in the zzso concentration range while the zzso zzso zzso of a 162 zzso zzso of zzso containing a single strong zzso site is effectively inhibited at zzso zzso As demonstrated by footprint analysis the latter effect is caused by a specific binding of the hairpin forming zzso to the zzso recognition site zzso which indicates that the zzso activity to produce a double strand break is blocked at this zzso The zzso hairpin zzso is the most potent inhibitor of the zzso zzso zzso reaction compared to other known zzso active DNA binding zzso
