We isolated zzso clones containing the mouse zzso 8 zzso a member of the zzso gene zzso We show that zzso 8 comprises two zzso of approximately 600 and zzso zzso separated by a zzso zzso and that it zzso with previously mapped markers in the zzso region of mouse zzso zzso In zzso zzso the zzso 8 gene produces transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso Both transcripts are present in facial zzso of the newborn zzso though the ratio of the zzso transcript to the zzso transcript is reduced relative to the ratio observed for zzso zzso An alignment of the zzso sequences of previously characterized members of the zzso family revealed three zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Both the zzso zzso genes and zzso zzso genes are present throughout the zzso Representatives of the third zzso the zzso zzso are found in a zzso zzso and a zzso zzso and are thus likely to be zzso zzso To investigate the distribution of zzso zzso genes outside the zzso we used the zzso chain reaction and zzso zzso 8 zzso to screen zzso DNA of the purple sea zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We isolated a gene with greater sequence similarity to mouse zzso 8 than to members of the zzso 7 or zzso zzso demonstrating that the zzso 8 zzso has been in existence at least since the zzso zzso from the lineage that gave rise to the zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
