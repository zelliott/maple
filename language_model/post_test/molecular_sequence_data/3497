In zzso mosquitoes zzso zzso the most common mechanism for resistance to zzso zzso zzso involves amplification of one or more zzso Two zzso zzso are often involved, with different zzso forms zzso zzso is zzso with zzso in a Colombian zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso These two zzso zzso on zzso gels, often leading to zzso of the zzso as zzso of a single zzso zzso By sequencing zzso zzso DNA, we determined the zzso gene length is zzso zzso The open reading frame of zzso encodes a 540 zzso acid zzso as for zzso in strain zzso zzso from Sri zzso The zzso boundaries of zzso are identical to those of zzso suggesting that they are zzso of the same zzso The zzso zzso gene differs from zzso in strain zzso from Cuba, although they have equivalent zzso mobility, showing that these two strains contain distinct zzso zzso Twenty zzso differences were scored between the zzso partial zzso zzso sequence and that in the zzso strain, with two zzso acid changes, demonstrating distinct zzso zzso Our sequencing data show zzso identity between the three zzso genes (each has six zzso and seven zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are at least zzso apart in zzso zzso and zzso apart in zzso zzso whereas these zzso genes are only zzso apart in the zzso parental zzso stock, as in zzso SS zzso Sri zzso zzso demonstrating that this region of the zzso is susceptible to expansion and zzso
