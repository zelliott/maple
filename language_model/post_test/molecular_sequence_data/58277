The interaction of the zzso zzso domain with the zzso zzso of zzso is investigated using structural detail and zzso zzso The solution structure complex of the zzso domain with a zzso zzso mimic of the binding site on the zzso zzso is zzso This indicates that the zzso binds as a zzso type II zzso zzso zzso zzso studies reveal that in the zzso state the zzso exhibits no zzso zzso data for the binding of this zzso to the zzso domain suggest that the weak binding zzso 31 zzso of this interaction is, in part, due to the zzso zzso effect of zzso formation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain to the intact zzso zzso zzso its own zzso zzso is zzso and the zzso and zzso contributions are very different from those given by the zzso interaction zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso delta zzso zzso zzso zzso From these dramatically different zzso zzso we are able to conclude that the interaction of the zzso zzso does not effectively mimic the interaction of the intact zzso zzso with the zzso domain and suggest that other interactions could be zzso
