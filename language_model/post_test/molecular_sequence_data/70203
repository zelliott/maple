The hormonal induction of the zzso gene in zzso zzso cells is dependent on the action of zzso and steroid zzso zzso growth factor, insulin, zzso and zzso act in a sequential manner to regulate the zzso of the zzso We have studied the hormonal requirements as well as the nuclear proteins which are involved in the induction zzso In zzso zzso in cell free nuclear extracts has been used to demonstrate the central role of the zzso zzso specific nuclear factor, zzso in the mediation of the hormonal signals to the zzso zzso A gene construct zzso 344 zzso of wild type zzso promoter sequence and a zzso cassette of 220 zzso was used to test the activity of nuclear extracts in the in zzso zzso zzso A construct in which the zzso zzso binding site in the zzso promoter region has been zzso by zzso and a construct regulated by the zzso major late promoter served as zzso Nuclear extracts were prepared from zzso insect cells, zzso cells and zzso zzso cells of zzso zzso Strong zzso of the wild type zzso promoter construct was observed in the zzso cell zzso weak zzso in the extracts of zzso insect cells and the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso binding site drastically reduced the in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso cell zzso zzso promoter activity was also compared in nuclear extracts from zzso and zzso hormone induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from induced cells are more efficient in the support of zzso gene zzso
