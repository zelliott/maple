The transforming region of the zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso zzso encodes a zzso that raises the zzso frequency of zzso To find the effect of this zzso on cell zzso three types of cells were zzso with a shuttle zzso zzso that expressed the zzso When zzso rat zzso were zzso they rapidly became zzso with high efficiency, but were not zzso in nude zzso When monkey kidney cells were zzso five zzso cell lines were isolated, of which one became zzso but was not zzso in nude zzso When human oral zzso were zzso they did not become zzso The zzso therefore induced some of the features of transformation in different cell types, but did not induce a zzso zzso in any zzso This suggests that interaction with zzso would be necessary for the zzso to contribute to the development of oral zzso
