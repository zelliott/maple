zzso analysis of the zzso Growth Factor zzso zzso and zzso genes to select zzso cell lung cancer zzso patients for treatment with novel zzso zzso zzso zzso is an appealing possibility currently under zzso Although frozen tumor tissue would probably be the optimal source for analysis, the most common source of tumor material is fixed and zzso embedded zzso archival zzso Here, we evaluate how different procedures of tissue sample processing and preservation may affect the outcome of zzso and zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, we compare the sensitivity of the analysis using zzso DNA zzso versus zzso 

We used zzso amplification and direct sequencing to analyze zzso and zzso genes in paired zzso and frozen tumor samples corresponding to 47 zzso zzso In frozen samples, the analysis was carried out using both zzso and zzso extracted in zzso 

Whereas zzso of frozen samples were successfully zzso the rate of successful zzso amplification in zzso samples was approximately zzso We detected three previously described zzso point zzso in 2 zzso In ten other samples, a zzso zzso was zzso These zzso were detected in DNA extracted from frozen samples as well as in DNA obtained from zzso zzso In addition, 10 zzso changes, were detected in zzso samples that were not detected in the frozen zzso Upon zzso these zzso changes could not be confirmed and were most likely the result of zzso embedding and fixation zzso All zzso found in zzso were also detected in the corresponding zzso and, in two cases, the presence of the zzso zzso was easier to identify by using zzso 

Our results indicate that zzso extracted from frozen tissue is the preferred source for zzso and zzso zzso zzso When analyzing zzso samples, reducing the size of the amplified fragments would increase zzso success rate, and care should be taken to control for zzso zzso
