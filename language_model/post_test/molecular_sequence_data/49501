New influenza vaccines have been designed based on the fact that the zzso domain of zzso protein zzso is nearly zzso in all influenza A zzso To clarify which exact region of zzso could induce zzso with zzso activities against influenza virus zzso four overlapping peptides covering zzso were zzso and then coupled to the carrier protein bovine serum zzso through the zzso of the zzso After a vaccination course, all these four zzso vaccines could induce high levels of rabbit zzso with zzso zzso specificity zzso zzso zzso Besides, the zzso zzso zzso reacted strongly with zzso and reacted zzso with the middle part and zzso of zzso The zzso zzso for zzso effect proved that zzso recognizing the zzso of zzso could obviously inhibit replication of influenza A virus zzso and influenza B virus zzso in zzso in a zzso manner, while zzso recognizing the middle part and the zzso of zzso did not show such significant zzso zzso zzso analysis indicates that the first nine zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso are extremely zzso Just this region containing the first nine zzso acid zzso could induce zzso with zzso activity against influenza A and influenza B virus zzso suggesting that the zzso of zzso may contain an zzso that could induce zzso zzso against influenza virus replication in zzso
