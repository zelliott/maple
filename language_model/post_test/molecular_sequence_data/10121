A highly zzso zzso zzso virus, zzso was previously isolated from a nondomestic zzso In this report, we describe experiments to characterize its zzso map and examine its Rev zzso The zzso progression of viral gene expression is similar to that of zzso The zzso pattern of viral transcripts was determined by sequence analysis of zzso viral zzso In zzso zzso and translation of two putative rev zzso revealed that they zzso at least one zzso zzso The zzso element zzso of zzso identified by zzso zzso secondary structure analysis, was inserted into the zzso of an zzso reporter zzso and used in a transient zzso zzso for Rev zzso zzso of the zzso construct with the two rev zzso clones significantly increased the expression of the reporter gene linked to the zzso indicating that both transcripts zzso an active Rev zzso The Rev activity of zzso is 5 to 8 times higher than that of a domestic cat zzso zzso zzso Our experiments also demonstrate the zzso interaction of zzso Rev with the zzso zzso even though the zzso of the two viruses have very little zzso sequence zzso
