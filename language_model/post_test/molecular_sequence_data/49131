We determined zzso and kinetic parameters for the zzso interaction using a group of zzso zzso zzso whose differences in zzso acid sequences had arisen only from zzso zzso These zzso zzso were considered to have originated from a common zzso clone and to represent progression along the affinity maturation zzso The kinetic zzso showed that both association and zzso rate zzso of the zzso interaction decreased during zzso zzso zzso revealed that an increase in affinity was obtained by an increase in zzso without any significant change in zzso These results suggested that the mechanism for the zzso interaction shifted from a zzso type to a zzso type during zzso zzso
