Three zzso zzso 27 and 29) predicted to zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso were cloned and characterized from white spruce zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso screening a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a putative zzso zzso zzso and zzso and 29 are predicted to zzso different zzso class II zzso zzso although they share zzso identity within DNA coding regions and zzso identity for predicted zzso They are zzso regulated during zzso zzso development and subsequent zzso zzso in addition they show strong response to zzso zzso zzso of the two kinds of zzso genes could be detected in zzso zzso before induction of zzso zzso but subsequently increased, being most abundant at late zzso zzso Gene expression levels were very low or not zzso in zzso zzso or needle zzso from older zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso zzso for spruce zzso zzso could also induce the zzso zzso
