Using human alpha zzso zzso probe and six restriction zzso we examined the zzso of human zzso genes in zzso DNA of 11 unrelated zzso We show that, in contrast to the human, the zzso exhibits an unusual array of zzso distributed restriction zzso length zzso zzso No clear correlation was found between the zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of the subjects, with one possible zzso However, pairs of zzso zzso occurring at a relatively high frequency were zzso In addition, the zzso of zzso zzso genes to the human genes was examined using as zzso synthetic zzso specifying distinct regions of human zzso zzso We show that the zzso gene family in the zzso consists of at least three members that are zzso to the human zzso zzso and E genes zzso A, B, and zzso and may share a similar gross structure and overall zzso
