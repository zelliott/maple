zzso zzso zzso is regulated by consensus sequences at the zzso boundaries and branch zzso Recently, zzso et zzso reported the importance of an additional zzso zzso an zzso repeat in chicken zzso that is a binding site for a protein required for zzso zzso Interestingly, we have detected zzso in zzso of the human growth hormone zzso gene that affect a zzso zzso consensus sequence and which also zzso zzso In a series of zzso zzso zzso that cause zzso zzso we found two zzso that do not occur within the zzso and 3' zzso sites, or branch consensus zzso The first zzso is a zzso transition of the 28th base zzso of and the second zzso 18 zzso zzso of zzso of the human zzso zzso These zzso zzso with zzso dominant zzso zzso in both zzso and no other zzso zzso gene changes were zzso zzso amplification of transcripts from expression zzso containing the zzso or zzso zzso yielded products showing a zzso preferred use of alternative zzso similar to findings previously reported for zzso donor site zzso Both zzso are located 28 zzso downstream from the zzso zzso site and examination of the sequences zzso revealed an zzso zzso repeat similar to the repeat found to regulate zzso zzso in chicken zzso Interestingly, the zzso repeats involved in our zzso exhibit zzso spacing to those in a so-called zzso zzso zzso zzso of A1 zzso nuclear zzso zzso by zzso sequences in zzso transcripts is thought to play an important role in zzso packaging and transport as well as zzso zzso site selection in zzso that contain multiple zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest that zzso zzso repeats may regulate alternative zzso in the human zzso gene and zzso zzso of these repeats cause zzso zzso by zzso alternative zzso zzso of zzso zzso sequences may zzso other human zzso
