Type II DNA zzso are essential and ubiquitous DNA zzso zzso that alter DNA zzso zzso have two indispensable type II DNA zzso DNA zzso zzso by zzso and zzso and zzso IV zzso by zzso and zzso These genes belong to a single family whose members span both zzso and zzso The highly zzso motifs in these genes provide a rationale for the design of universal zzso used in the zzso chain reaction in order to systematically generate a data set suitable for bacterial diversity studies at the zzso level, as well as at the zzso level displaying individual species and zzso This family of genes is the subject of intensive zzso and genetic zzso which provide an opportunity for comprehensive understanding of sequence conservation and zzso and their relationship to zzso These genes are zzso suited for microbial identification and zzso zzso
