zzso muscle contraction is regulated by zzso through the zzso complex consisting of three zzso zzso C zzso zzso T zzso and zzso I zzso We reported previously that the abnormal zzso of cardiac zzso in zzso with zzso zzso resulted in a greater binding affinity to zzso In the present study, we characterized a zzso of cardiac zzso in the heart of wild zzso zzso cloning and sequencing of the novel turkey cardiac zzso revealed a single zzso acid zzso zzso zzso in avian cardiac zzso zzso to a zzso in zzso This zzso is zzso in cardiac and skeletal muscle zzso across the zzso zzso zzso a functional zzso In the partial crystal structure of cardiac zzso this zzso acid resides in an zzso that directly contacts with zzso zzso modeling indicates that the substitution of zzso for zzso or zzso at this position would not disrupt the global structure of zzso To evaluate the functional significance of the different size and charge between the zzso and zzso side zzso zzso zzso using zzso turkey cardiac zzso expressed in zzso coli were zzso The results show that the zzso substitution lowered binding affinity to zzso which is potentially zzso to the increased zzso affinity of the zzso cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso the fixation of the cardiac zzso zzso zzso in the wild turkey population and the corresponding functional effect reflect an increased fitness value, suggesting a novel target for the treatment of zzso zzso
