The zzso zzso zzso plays a key role in regulating the transition to flowering in zzso zzso is the founding member of a zzso zinc finger protein family that is defined by a highly zzso zzso sequence called the ID zzso The ID domain includes a cluster of three different types of zinc fingers separated from a fourth zzso finger by a long zzso zzso is distinct from other ID domain proteins by having a much longer zzso In zzso DNA selection and amplification binding zzso and DNA binding experiments showed that zzso binds selectively to an 11 zzso consensus motif via the ID zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso protein showed that zinc fingers located at each end of the ID domain are not required for binding to the consensus motif despite the fact that one of these zinc fingers is a zzso zzso DNA binding zzso In addition, an zzso in zzso deletion zzso that lacks the extra zzso between zinc fingers binds the same 11 zzso motif as normal zzso suggesting that all ID zzso proteins recognize the same DNA target zzso Our results demonstrate that zzso zzso and ID domain proteins have novel zinc finger zzso with unique DNA binding zzso
