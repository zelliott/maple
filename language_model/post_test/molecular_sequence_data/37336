zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso is often caused by a zzso in DNA mismatch zzso By using conventional methods of zzso analysis, point zzso in the DNA mismatch repair genes zzso and zzso have been detected in up to zzso of patients suspected of zzso However, large zzso deletions cannot be detected by these zzso In our study, we applied a zzso multiplex zzso to detect the proportion of large deletions in patients meeting the Bethesda criteria whose zzso exhibited zzso instability zzso Of 368 unrelated patients, 180 exhibited zzso In these patients, 68 zzso point zzso zzso had previously been detected in the zzso and zzso genes by zzso zzso analysis or zzso followed by direct zzso The remaining 112 patients (including 24 patients with rare zzso or other zzso zzso were examined for large zzso We identified deletions in 19 patients zzso zzso zzso deletions were located in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso The size of deletions ranged from 1 zzso to a deletion of a whole zzso Five zzso of deletions were zzso zzso elements were involved in all of zzso In patients meeting the Amsterdam criteria the proportion of large deletions was zzso A similar proportion of deletions was found in the group of patients with a positive family history for zzso cancer and zzso zzso not meeting the Amsterdam zzso The results of our study suggest that large zzso deletions in both zzso and zzso genes play a considerable role in the zzso of zzso and should be part of the routine zzso zzso detection zzso
