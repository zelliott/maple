We have designed a novel fluorescent indicator composed of two green fluorescent protein zzso joined by the zzso domain from smooth muscle zzso light chain zzso When zzso is bound to the indicator zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso resonance energy transfer between the two zzso is zzso the ratio of the zzso intensity measured at zzso zzso to the intensity measured at 440 zzso decreases zzso Images of zzso living cells demonstrate that zzso ratios can be used to monitor zzso changes in the zzso of the zzso Changes in indicator zzso in these cells are coupled with no discernible lag zzso zzso to changes in the zzso free zzso zzso zzso ranging from below 50 zzso to approximately 1 zzso This observation suggests that the activity of a zzso target with a typical 1 zzso affinity for zzso is responsive to changes in the zzso zzso concentration over the zzso zzso It is likely that the indicator we describe can be modified to detect the levels of zzso and proteins in the cell other than zzso
