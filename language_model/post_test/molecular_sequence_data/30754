The zzso sequences were determined for the zzso and zzso zzso of two human zzso zzso zzso and zzso specific for the D zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso genes of the two zzso were derived from separate zzso genes within the zzso gene family, but both zzso used the same zzso zzso The zzso genes differed from each other, and no similarity was found to known D zzso The light chain of zzso belongs to the V zzso zzso and that of zzso probably belongs to the V zzso zzso both light chains used the zzso zzso zzso models of the variable zzso were made, based on those of known zzso zzso The surface contours at the combining sites are clearly different, consistent with the evidence that the zzso recognize different but overlapping zzso Some details of the molecular zzso of zzso regions have been deposited as zzso zzso zzso zzso (6 zzso at the British Library zzso Supply Centre, Boston Spa, zzso West zzso zzso zzso zzso from whom copies can be obtained on the terms indicated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
