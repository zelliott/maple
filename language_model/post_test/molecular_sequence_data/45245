zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have long served as an animal model for the study of human disease and zzso Given the current shortage of zzso zzso many researchers have turned to zzso zzso from China as a zzso However, a number of studies have identified marked genetic differences between the Chinese and Indian zzso We investigated the genetic characteristics of a third zzso population, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso Temple in zzso Nepal, were compared with more than 300 zzso and zzso zzso zzso The sequence analyses of two zzso DNA zzso zzso from the zzso I and 12 S zzso regions, showed that the zzso animals were more similar to zzso than to zzso zzso The distribution of zzso at 24 short tandem repeat zzso zzso distributed across 17 zzso also showed greater similarity between the zzso and zzso zzso Finally, an analysis of seven major zzso complex zzso zzso showed that the zzso animals expressed Class I zzso that are common to zzso animals, including zzso All of these analyses also revealed a low level of genetic diversity within this zzso zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso of Nepal more closely resemble zzso zzso of Indian origin than those of Chinese zzso As such, the zzso zzso may offer an additional resource option for researchers who wish to maintain research protocols with animals that possess key genetic features characteristic of zzso zzso zzso
