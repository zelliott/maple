zzso of zzso target genes is regulated by a zzso of zzso and the high mobility group box zzso factors of the zzso zzso factor zzso factor zzso zzso In zzso four zzso family members have been zzso They all contain a zzso zzso motif at the N zzso and a highly zzso high mobility group box for DNA zzso The core sequence between these motifs is less zzso and contributes to the specific properties of the individual family zzso To identify interacting proteins that allocate specific functions to the individual zzso zzso factors, we performed a zzso zzso screen using the less zzso core sequence as zzso We isolated the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso clone zzso also termed zzso zzso zzso zzso of 55 zzso and cloned the highly zzso zzso zzso In addition, we report that the zzso zzso zzso half of zzso binds to a zzso alternatively spliced zzso in zzso zzso zzso Our functional analyses revealed that zzso acts as negative regulator of a subset of zzso family members, which have been characterized as zzso in reporter gene analyses and in the zzso axis induction zzso In addition, we observed a repressive interference of zzso family members with zzso zzso of zzso transcription, which again could be allocated to specific zzso zzso With the characterization of zzso as a binding partner of the alternatively spliced zzso in zzso zzso factors, we identified a novel molecular mechanism in the zzso of steroid and zzso zzso signaling that is zzso zzso
