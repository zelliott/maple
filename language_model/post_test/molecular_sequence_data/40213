A three zzso model was developed for zzso protein sequence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso that has not been solved zzso by X-ray zzso or zzso zzso modeling was employed for the structure prediction using zzso as template zzso a high-resolution X-ray zzso zzso The model predicted for the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein reveals a partial zzso domain only due to its partial sequence of 104 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso model contains three zzso such as domain I, a bundle of eight alpha zzso with the central relatively zzso zzso surrounded by zzso zzso while domain II and III contain mostly zzso zzso structural differences within domain II in this model among all zzso protein structures indicates that it is involved in recognition and binding to cell zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso predicted structure with available zzso determined zzso structures reveals identical zzso The distribution of zzso potential on the surface of the molecules in the model is zzso and identifies one side of the zzso domain as zzso charged indicating orientation of toxic molecules toward the cell membrane during the initial binding with a cell surface zzso The collective knowledge of zzso toxin structures will lead to a more critical understanding of the structural basis for zzso binding and pore formation, as well as allowing the scope of diversity to be better zzso This model will serve as a starting point for the design of zzso experiments aimed to improve the toxicity and to provide a new tool for the zzso of the mechanism of action of these zzso zzso
