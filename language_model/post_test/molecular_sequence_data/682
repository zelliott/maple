The zzso method for DNA cloning is by propagation in biological zzso but this method has limitations because certain sequences are difficult to clone using any combination of available hosts or zzso Recently, zzso rolling circle amplification zzso has been applied to overcome the problems of the DNA cloning via host zzso However, when zzso is used to amplify from minute quantities of DNA template, the products are mostly zzso DNA molecules generated by false zzso and primer zzso zzso This study demonstrates that zzso using random zzso zzso of DNA zzso the synthesis of zzso and succeeded in amplifying one copy of a circular DNA zzso more than zzso to give zzso quantities of amplification product without using zzso reaction zzso Furthermore, a zzso strategy was elaborated to zzso only the desired DNA sequence and eliminate zzso zzso A combination of these methods was able to amplify and zzso a large construct without zzso DNA sequences and at zzso quantities within one zzso zzso these methods have the possibility to improve DNA cloning techniques that have been restricted by the limitations of zzso methods or by the host zzso
