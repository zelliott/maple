The zzso zzso protein zzso zzso gene contains essential promoter sequences located both upstream and downstream of the cap zzso A combination of gel mobility shift, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso were used to analyze the interaction of factors binding to a downstream element zzso at position zzso to zzso The zzso downstream element identified zzso zzso zzso ranging in size from 45 to 25 zzso zzso Four base pair changes in the zzso sequence of the downstream element eliminated zzso An zzso containing the zzso responsive element sequence zzso specifically for the zzso protein in both the gel mobility shift zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso Our data also indicate that the downstream binding factors contribute to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
