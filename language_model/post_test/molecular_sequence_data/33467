zzso zzso zzso constitute a large class of cortical maternal zzso which include zzso zzso zzso and zzso We have analyzed the zzso cortical zzso and cell type segregation of zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso using very high-resolution fluorescent in zzso zzso We also compared zzso extracted from whole zzso and from isolated zzso using zzso and localized zzso possessing clusters of zzso motifs in their zzso Based on these combined approaches we conclude that: zzso the vast majority of the 39 zzso zzso (including zzso are localized in the egg zzso zzso Many zzso zzso zzso are enriched in zzso zzso allowing us to identify 2 novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso anchored to cortical zzso zzso zzso and those associated with zzso have different cell zzso We propose that there are 2 distinct categories of zzso zzso on the basis of their cortical zzso and cell zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso anchored to zzso which segregate into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso which in addition to zzso cells segregate into zzso germ zzso
