zzso of 29 strains of viruses in the bean common mosaic virus zzso zzso of zzso zzso reacted strongly with one or more of the zzso zzso zzso which are known to be specific for zzso located along the 50 zzso acids which constitute the zzso end of the viral coat zzso zzso one half of the virus strains reacted with the zzso zzso specific zzso zzso zzso which is specific for zzso zzso while the other half reacted with zzso zzso zzso or zzso which are specific for zzso zzso All but two strains contained at least one of these zzso while no strain contained zzso Competitive zzso using five zzso zzso zzso zzso peptides indicated that the zzso acids critical for zzso zzso reaction were located at positions 5, 7, and 10 from the zzso end of the coat zzso By deduction we zzso that the zzso acids critical for zzso zzso are located at positions 10, 16, and zzso Because zzso zzso requires zzso at position 10 for expression whereas zzso zzso requires zzso to be zzso no one strain can express both zzso Two viruses in our tests zzso mosaic and zzso mosaic zzso had deletions in this portion of their sequence explaining their failure to react zzso specific for either zzso The critical zzso acids for a third zzso zzso were located at positions 16 and zzso We found no correlation between any of the three zzso zzso defined in this study and the presence or absence of any biological property that we could accurately zzso zzso symptomatology, host range, or zzso However, when coat protein sequences were aligned according to zzso type zzso or zzso we found that sequences within groups had high levels of identity while between group identities were zzso We also found that sequences in the zzso zzso region exhibited similar relationships within and between zzso zzso Two strains of zzso zzso and zzso were found to possess coat protein sequences typical of zzso zzso but zzso sequences typical of zzso zzso These data suggest that both strains may be the result of natural zzso between the two zzso zzso
