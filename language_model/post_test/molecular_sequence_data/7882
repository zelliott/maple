In molecular biology, the expression of fusion proteins is a very useful and well-established technique for the identification and zzso zzso of gene zzso Even a short fused sequence of five or six zzso enables proteins to bind to an immobilized metal zzso zzso zzso By synthesis of a class of zzso zzso we have transferred this approach to the concept of zzso The specific interaction and lateral organization of a fluorescent fusion zzso containing a zzso zzso sequence was studied by film balance techniques in combination with zzso zzso Due to the phase behavior of the various zzso zzso used, the zzso lipids can be zzso zzso generating two-dimensional zzso of zzso zzso Because of the large variety of fusion proteins already available, this concept represents a powerful technique for orientation and organization of proteins at zzso zzso with applications in zzso zzso of zzso zzso two-dimensional zzso and studies of zzso zzso
