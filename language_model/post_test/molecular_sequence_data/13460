We established and characterized zzso zzso cells with mouse zzso virus to study the molecular mechanisms of zzso persistence and evolution in zzso Following infection, viral zzso and zzso zzso were zzso reduced by about zzso as compared to acute infection suggesting that the reduction in zzso synthesis was due to reduced levels of zzso active full length and zzso length zzso zzso Although the rates of zzso synthesis were also reduced, the relative percent zzso ratio of the zzso and zzso zzso were similar to those detected during acute zzso In contrast to the finding during zzso zzso analysis of the zzso leader zzso indicated that the leader zzso and zzso junction sequences were extremely zzso These data suggested that zzso and zzso resulting in zzso zzso was not required for zzso zzso zzso zzso persistence was significantly associated with a A to G zzso at zzso 77 in the zzso end untranslated region zzso of the zzso zzso
