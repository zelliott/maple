The zzso modification zzso zzso zzso zzso I has been isolated in zzso purity from an zzso coli strain harboring a zzso zzso with a zzso pair insert from the zzso zzso Its molecular size, zzso acid zzso and zzso sequence zzso to those predicted by the structure and expression of the zzso zzso zzso activity, as measured by a zzso release zzso is unaffected by zzso of zzso zzso zzso I with zzso zzso and is zzso by the addition of a zzso zzso and zzso zzso The activity is inhibited by all zzso species tested, including zzso modified zzso zzso or zzso containing zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso I occurs with both zzso and zzso zzso and does not require a zzso zzso Our findings are consistent with a zzso mechanism zzso zzso zzso zzso I first binds zzso and then forms transient zzso zzso with zzso zzso In the absence of other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso I forms zzso at all three modification sites known to be affected in zzso zzso The zzso zzso product of the gene adjacent to zzso whose translation is linked to that of zzso zzso zzso I, is not a functional zzso for zzso zzso zzso I activity, nor is it a separate zzso acting at one of the three zzso
