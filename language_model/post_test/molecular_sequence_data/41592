zzso zzso receptors zzso represent a highly zzso and diverse gene family in zzso zzso zzso of the respective gene products have been hampered until now due to zzso of specific zzso zzso and failure of zzso of zzso zzso zzso We zzso one zzso zzso and two zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins for generation of zzso zzso in zzso Besides broadly reacting ones, we obtained zzso zzso zzso zzso with intermediate and with single zzso These zzso zzso were tested for binding to a panel of zzso zzso zzso proteins after zzso expression on zzso zzso zzso zzso mapping identified two zzso regions that are located next to each other in the mature zzso zzso The availability of zzso zzso against zzso zzso zzso proteins will enable future studies on zzso at the protein level in zzso zzso as important animal models of human infectious zzso
