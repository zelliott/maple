Crown rust is an important disease of zzso caused by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Crown rust is efficiently and effectively managed through the development of resistant zzso zzso zzso is a zzso crown rust resistance gene that is highly effective against the current zzso zzso population in North zzso The primary objective of this study was to develop DNA markers linked to zzso for purposes of zzso selection in zzso breeding zzso The zzso locus was mapped using a population of zzso zzso zzso lines developed from the cross zzso zzso made at the zzso Development Centre, University of zzso The population was evaluated for reaction to zzso zzso in field zzso in 2008 and zzso zzso mapped to a linkage group consisting of 44 Diversity zzso Technology zzso zzso zzso were successfully converted to sequence characterized amplified region zzso zzso Five robust zzso were developed from three zzso zzso that zzso with zzso zzso markers were developed for different zzso systems, such that zzso are available for zzso gel zzso zzso zzso and zzso single zzso zzso zzso The zzso markers accurately zzso the zzso status of 23 North American zzso breeding zzso
