The zzso satellite DNA zzso family found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso satellite with a zzso zzso of 150 zzso zzso variation analyses suggest a zzso zzso region as a possible protein binding site with constraints acting on the whole sequence but a zzso variable zzso Besides the zzso arrangement of 150 zzso zzso zzso analyses evidenced incomplete zzso one zzso event, and three zzso Both observed zzso and the higher values of sequence zzso scored suggest that rearranged zzso reside in regions with a lower degree of zzso zzso zzso percent of the zzso occurs at zzso zzso thus supporting their role in zzso as documented in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of different lengths may result from crossing over between repeats zzso through the direct and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso results indicate that the same range of sequence diversity is experienced at the individual and population zzso therefore, the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso is zzso
