Four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso The predicted zzso acid sequences contain the zzso zzso region characteristic of zzso zzso which includes the zzso zzso that binds the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that, whereas zzso and zzso belong to the zzso zzso family, zzso and zzso form a new family of zzso zzso zzso zzso of each gene was examined for organ zzso and also for response to zzso nitrogen and zzso The zzso transcript accumulated in all zzso zzso and was induced in shoots and roots upon sulfur zzso under zzso nitrogen zzso The zzso transcript accumulated in shoots grown in the light, but disappeared almost completely by dark zzso The zzso transcript was found more abundantly in roots than in zzso and was reduced in the dark, as well as under sulfur and nitrogen zzso The zzso transcript was scarce in all zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso zzso genes zzso functionally distinct zzso zzso zzso and that they are zzso regulated by the availability of zzso zzso and zzso
