zzso channels facilitate the transport of water, zzso and other small zzso across cell zzso The zzso roles of many zzso remain zzso To better understand zzso function, we characterized the zzso gene family in the zzso zzso zzso Eight zzso zzso genes zzso are present in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso in zzso zzso increased water zzso five- to zzso zzso zzso was increased three to zzso by expression of zzso zzso or zzso Green fluorescent protein zzso and zzso reporters demonstrated that zzso genes are expressed in numerous zzso zzso cell types, including the zzso zzso cell, and zzso which play important roles in whole animal zzso To define the role of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso we isolated deletion zzso for four zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which are expressed in zzso zzso and mediate water zzso Single, zzso zzso and quadruple zzso zzso animals exhibited normal survival, development, growth, zzso and movement under normal and zzso culture zzso zzso quadruple zzso exhibited a slight zzso in recovery from zzso stress but survived zzso stress as well as zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso are not essential for whole animal zzso and/or that deletion of zzso genes activates mechanisms that compensate for loss of water channel zzso
