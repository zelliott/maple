zzso zzso against zzso are associated with zzso disorders as well as with zzso and zzso Moreover, recent interest is focused on zzso because of their possible role in zzso In this study, we used a set of overlapping synthetic peptides zzso the structure of the zzso human zzso light chain zzso to map zzso zzso recognized by natural zzso present in normal zzso human zzso We found that zzso in human zzso react strongly with two distinct V zzso zzso corresponding to the first zzso determining region zzso and the third framework zzso zzso showing weak zzso against three regions of the constant domain also occur in the zzso The zzso directed against light chain peptides comprise less than zzso of the zzso zzso Analysis by direct binding and by competitive zzso zzso established that affinity zzso zzso specific for zzso and zzso zzso zzso react with the intact light chain zzso as well as with the corresponding zzso Competitive zzso studies comparing total zzso and zzso zzso indicate that natural zzso showing a wide range of affinities are zzso The zzso nature of the natural zzso is further shown by the presence of both zzso and zzso light chains in the zzso zzso Although the role of such natural zzso remains to be determined, the zzso between V zzso peptides and the intact chain suggest that they can function in regulation of zzso zzso
