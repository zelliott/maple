To define the zzso zzso site in the zzso domain of rabbit zzso and to determine whether the zzso zzso can be used as a marker of zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso 

The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso region zzso of rabbit zzso was determined by reverse zzso chain reaction complementary DNA cloning and DNA sequence analysis, followed by zzso and mass spectral protein sequence analysis of the zzso zzso Active zzso was injected into the stifle zzso of zzso and a zzso zzso zzso was analyzed by Western zzso and localized in zzso by indirect zzso zzso fragments in joint zzso were zzso by a zzso blue zzso zzso 

zzso zzso of rabbit zzso generated a zzso zzso zzso that terminated in the sequence zzso An zzso zzso recognized the zzso zzso in zzso in cartilage from zzso zzso The appearance of the zzso zzso corresponded to the release of cartilage zzso fragments into the joint fluid, and could be inhibited by zzso of the rabbits with a synthetic zzso zzso 

These results indicate that the zzso zzso can be used to assess the role of zzso in cartilage degradation in zzso
