zzso a zzso zzso plays a critical role in the development of zzso and differentiation to T helper type 2 zzso To date, no information is available on the role of zzso in the zzso immune zzso We identified full-length zzso and alternatively spliced zzso of zzso zzso carp zzso zzso The zzso gene is transcribed into multiple zzso zzso lacking either one or both zinc finger zzso although the sequences of both zzso are fully zzso between zzso and other zzso We found that alternative zzso site and stop zzso in zzso zzso 3, located between zzso that separately zzso the two zinc finger zzso are zzso among zzso suggesting that zzso zzso gene can be translated into multiple zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso is strongly expressed in the brain, zzso and zzso of zzso zzso Moreover, zzso expression was detected in zzso zzso among kidney cells sorted by zzso zzso zzso demonstrated that expression levels of full-length zzso and the zzso zzso differed with tissue type, but full length was always the predominantly expressed zzso These results suggest that zzso including its zzso zzso is involved in zzso zzso zzso
