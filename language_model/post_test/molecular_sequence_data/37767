By means of a differential screening technique, a zzso zzso designated zzso was identified from zzso zzso subspecies zzso This protein is similar in sequence to the protective surface zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso acid sequence analyses revealed a zzso zzso signal sequence and predicted the outer membrane location for zzso In support of this, zzso raised against zzso zzso promotes zzso and zzso of zzso zzso by rabbit zzso and zzso zzso is absent from washed zzso preparations presumed to be lacking outer zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence is zzso zzso among 11 strains representing 4 zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso partially protected rabbits from subsequent zzso zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that may be present on the surface of zzso zzso and may represent a potential vaccine candidate for zzso
