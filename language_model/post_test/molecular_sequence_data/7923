We have developed a system to transcribe the zzso zzso zzso gene in the absence of the zzso factor zzso A long transcript was zzso both in zzso and in zzso from a hybrid gene in which the zzso promoter sequence of the zzso gene was fused to the zzso zzso zzso zzso No internal initiation directed by the zzso zzso zzso promoter or any processing of the hybrid transcript was observed in zzso zzso cells devoid of zzso factor zzso which, therefore, could not zzso any zzso zzso from the zzso zzso copies of zzso zzso could survive if they carried the hybrid zzso construct on a zzso zzso In this case, the only source of zzso zzso was the precursor zzso transcript that gave rise to two zzso species slightly larger than zzso zzso zzso This establishes that the only essential function of zzso is to promote the synthesis of zzso zzso However, cells devoid of zzso and surviving with these two zzso grew more slowly at 30 degrees C compared with zzso cells and were zzso at 37 degrees zzso
