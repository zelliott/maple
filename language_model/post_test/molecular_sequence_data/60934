To investigate the molecular mechanism of resistance to zzso in the southern cattle zzso zzso zzso we have obtained and zzso a partial zzso sodium channel zzso from susceptible and zzso tick zzso A point zzso that results in an zzso acid change from zzso to zzso was identified in the highly zzso domain zzso of the zzso sodium channel from ticks that are highly resistant to zzso zzso This zzso is at a location different from those reported in the same gene in zzso zzso
