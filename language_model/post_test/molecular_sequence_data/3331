zzso with human zzso virus type 1 zzso is associated with dramatic depletion of zzso T cells, the major zzso zzso zzso has been suggested to play an important role for the T cell depletion and a number of mechanisms have been proposed for the zzso in T zzso Here, we compared the levels for zzso induction in primary peripheral blood zzso cells zzso among several laboratory strains and primary zzso of the zzso zzso B and zzso The results showed that zzso in infected zzso zzso in zzso T cell population, became zzso around the time for virus production by flow zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso end labeling zzso technique and zzso with the nuclear dye zzso zzso The abilities to induce zzso in zzso were highly variable in individual zzso The increase of zzso protein in infected zzso which was initiated before virus production, was observed in infected zzso and the levels of zzso protein were almost zzso to the rates of the zzso to induced zzso The cells infected and cultured in the presence of zzso had significantly decreased cell zzso indicating that activated zzso also played a significant role in the zzso Thus, zzso zzso in primary T cells was accompanied by the zzso protein and zzso zzso at varied levels in primary zzso
