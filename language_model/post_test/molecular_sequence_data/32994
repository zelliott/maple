The interactions between viruses and zzso play a key role in shaping the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of oceanic zzso One of the most fascinating examples of horizontal gene transfer between a zzso host and its virus is a de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso found in the zzso of both zzso zzso and its zzso zzso Here, we focus on a natural zzso zzso system off the coast of Norway and investigate the dynamics of host and virus zzso gene expression for two of the most important zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso dynamics display three defined stages along zzso zzso bloom formation and decline, with the zzso transcripts taking over and controlling the zzso in stages 2 and zzso The observed patterns fit the hypothesis according to which viral zzso are involved in the timing and physical processes of zzso release from the host zzso This study provides a unique insight into the zzso interplay of zzso zzso pathways between virus and host during zzso progression of oceanic zzso zzso zzso
