The mechanism of zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso alpha zzso 4) by zzso isolated from the zzso of the oyster zzso zzso has been monitored by zzso zzso zzso The results of these experiments reveal that zzso zzso the zzso of the synthetic zzso zzso alpha zzso with initial release of zzso This is consistent with an overall mechanism for the zzso which proceeds with retention of zzso zzso These results agree with earlier zzso studies of other zzso zzso zzso from both viral and bacterial zzso
