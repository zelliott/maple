We have compared the performances of two different approaches using overlapping synthetic peptides to identify the location of linear zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The first method was based on the use of 15 overlapping peptides zzso zzso zzso using conventional zzso chemistry, removed from the zzso by a standard zzso zzso and tested by zzso after direct coating to zzso zzso zzso The second approach used a commercial kit zzso to zzso 75 overlapping zzso on cellulose membrane which were zzso by a direct zzso zzso Both standard and zzso methods were evaluated with zzso raised in rabbits against synthetic peptides of zzso and zzso from patients with zzso zzso In addition to inherent problems linked to the zzso synthesis (in particular the impossibility of checking the quality of zzso a number of limitations in the zzso method were identified zzso a certain lack of sensitivity and, in one case, the complete lack of zzso zzso due to the removal of charged end groups at both zzso However, we found no background with zzso from zzso patients in the zzso and the zzso maps obtained using the two approaches generally zzso This study shows that the zzso approach represents a simple, relatively non expensive and rapid method for initial screening to identify candidate sequences that may be dominant linear zzso in a zzso zzso analysis and controls should include the preparation of conventionally zzso peptides for formal zzso zzso
