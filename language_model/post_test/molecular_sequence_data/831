The zzso zzso which are involved in regulation of zzso trafficking, exhibit a complex but incompletely understood evolutionary zzso We zzso the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso implicated in the zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso have been generated over the course of zzso evolution, with some zzso coinciding with the advent of major zzso lineages zzso zzso zzso We also identified a unique, derived zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso that occurs in zzso zzso and zzso represented by the zzso zzso zzso This finding is consistent with the recently documented existence of a major zzso zzso zzso zzso these three zzso We further found a zzso protein in the zzso zzso zzso but it exhibits unusual features among zzso zzso absence of a zzso zzso motif and an zzso extension with two MSP zzso and its zzso relationships could not be established convincingly due to its divergent zzso Our results nevertheless point to a unique membrane trafficking zzso shared by at least some lineages of zzso and zzso an insight that has implications towards interpreting the early evolution of zzso and the zzso zzso
