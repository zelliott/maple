zzso zzso a large quantity of highly zzso zzso zzso proteins suspected to be involved in zzso zzso The effect of the zzso proteins on the zzso and zzso zzso activities of a family B DNA zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso both zzso DNA and zzso DNA at similar rates in zzso at temperatures of zzso zzso The zzso proteins were capable of significantly zzso the zzso and enhancing the extension of matched template zzso by the zzso However, the proteins did not protect zzso DNA from zzso by zzso In addition, the zzso proteins did not affect the zzso ability of zzso and were not zzso to the zzso of mismatched zzso by the zzso The zzso zzso required for the effective zzso of the zzso zzso activity of zzso were lowered from approximately 1 zzso in the absence of the zzso proteins to approximately 50 zzso in the presence of the proteins at 65 degrees zzso Our data suggest that the zzso zzso proteins serve to zzso the extension and zzso activities of the zzso DNA zzso reducing the cost of zzso by the zzso at high zzso
