A new and simple model enabling a chemical species to be brought to a zzso site in single strand DNA is zzso Two zzso containing a zzso linkage were zzso to their complementary sequences with an zzso opposite the zzso zzso zzso studies results shown that the addition of a zzso zzso strongly increased the zzso of both duplexes when added in a zzso zzso zzso studies on one of these duplexes brought evidence of the zzso of the zzso at the position involving the zzso zzso These results suggest that this system could be used to target a specific reaction at a zzso position using the zzso zzso as carrier for the zzso zzso
