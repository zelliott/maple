To seek an alternative model for studies of the zzso protein complex, we isolated by zzso cloning and characterized the mouse zzso and zzso zzso which are zzso to the human zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids which occurs as a composite of human zzso and zzso with zzso identity and zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso acids that shares zzso identity and zzso similarity to human zzso However, zzso has an zzso C zzso and four zzso sites clustered on zzso zzso zzso plots suggest that zzso and zzso each span the zzso zzso 12 times, with N and C zzso facing the zzso zzso and zzso are both specified by 10 zzso and bear a similar zzso structure, but their major zzso start sites are mapped at zzso and zzso Northern analysis revealed zzso of zzso and zzso from zzso zzso throughout adult life in zzso zzso Southern zzso and linkage analysis showed that zzso and zzso are zzso genes localized to zzso 4 and 17, zzso they are zzso to one another but zzso to human zzso and zzso The results together zzso the occurrence and signify a zzso function of the zzso zzso membrane zzso
