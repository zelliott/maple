The activity of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso 6 zzso 1) is zzso by zzso of zzso in the zzso motif by zzso zzso target of zzso complex 1) and zzso of zzso in the zzso loop by zzso zzso zzso zzso however, the order of the two events is still zzso In the present paper we report six crystal structures of the zzso zzso domain alone or plus the zzso motif in various forms, in complexes with a highly specific zzso The structural data, together with the zzso data, reveal zzso zzso of zzso in the absence of zzso zzso and demonstrate the importance of two zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the establishment of a zzso network between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso of zzso or introduction of a corresponding zzso charged group leads to reinforcement of the network and stabilization of zzso zzso Furthermore, comparisons of zzso with other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso family zzso suggest that the structural and sequence differences in the zzso motif and zzso zzso account for their divergence in zzso zzso Taken together, the results of the present study indicate that zzso of the zzso motif in zzso is independent of, and probably precedes and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
