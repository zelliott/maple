This study examined the zzso zzso of the coding region of the zzso zzso 3 zzso from the human zzso zzso zzso zzso alternative zzso leads to three different transcripts zzso zzso and zzso Since the expression of zzso is zzso by zzso stress, it is assumed that it is involved in the defense against zzso oxygen species zzso resulting from cellular zzso Furthermore, we suggest that zzso plays an important role in the protection of the zzso against zzso derived from the zzso immune zzso To zzso investigate these zzso we generated zzso zzso lines transgenic for zzso zzso and examined their resistance to artificially generated zzso The zzso worms zzso and integrated zzso were found to be much more resistant to internal zzso and external zzso zzso zzso stress than zzso zzso zzso zzso interference experiments targeted to the zzso transcripts resulted in decreased resistance, confirming that this effect is due to the transgenic expression of zzso These results clearly demonstrate that the zzso gene zzso an increased resistance to zzso zzso This study also shows the zzso of zzso as a model zzso for the functional characterization of genes from zzso zzso species which are not accessible to genetic zzso
