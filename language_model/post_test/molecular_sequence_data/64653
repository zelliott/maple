zzso are membrane proteins that possess tandem C2 zzso and play an important role in regulated membrane fusion in zzso zzso Here we show that both zzso I and II, the two major zzso zzso can interact with the zzso protein of 25 zzso zzso zzso the immediate precursor of the soluble zzso attachment protein zzso zzso fusion zzso A stretch of basic zzso acids highly zzso throughout the animal kingdom is responsible for this zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso which is mirrored by changes in zzso cell zzso Our results shed new light on the functional importance of the zzso zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso interacts with the zzso zzso to zzso the probability of zzso membrane zzso
