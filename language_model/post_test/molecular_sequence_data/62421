The aim of this study was to test the protective immunity against zzso zzso in mice induced by a zzso protein zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the restriction zzso zzso was inserted into the zzso site of zzso zzso termed zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with restriction zzso zzso and zzso was cloned into the zzso zzso sites of a separate zzso zzso termed zzso The zzso zzso zzso excised from zzso was inserted into the zzso site of zzso and a zzso zzso constructed, zzso The fusion proteins zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso Star zzso zzso coli and zzso by zzso zzso zzso After removing the zzso tag, the zzso proteins zzso zzso and zzso were independently collected and injected into different groups of mice to evaluate their protective zzso The highest proliferation of zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was observed in zzso mice which had received two zzso injections of zzso zzso production of zzso was also found in the culture zzso of zzso zzso from zzso zzso Finally, zzso zzso of mice zzso with zzso survived at least 28 days after a lethal challenge of 1 zzso zzso live zzso which killed all zzso mice within 10 zzso zzso survival rates were observed in mice zzso with either zzso zzso or zzso zzso These results show that the zzso protein zzso can elicit a zzso protection against zzso zzso infections in zzso
