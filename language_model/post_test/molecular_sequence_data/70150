The zzso sugar chains of blood zzso factor VIII zzso from zzso plasma were released as zzso by zzso These sugar chains were converted to radioactive zzso by reduction with sodium zzso and separated into neutral and zzso zzso by paper zzso Most of the zzso zzso were converted to neutral ones by zzso zzso indicating that they are zzso zzso The neutral and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso by serial zzso on immobilized zzso zzso zzso study of each zzso by sequential zzso zzso and by zzso analysis revealed that zzso factor VIII contains high zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso sugar zzso zzso percent of the zzso sugar chains contained the Gal alpha zzso group, and zzso of the zzso zzso sugar chains contained the zzso zzso zzso These structures were not detected in the sugar chains of human plasma factor zzso An in zzso competition study of von zzso factor and zzso zzso for binding to factor VIII revealed that von zzso factor prevented zzso binding to Gal alpha zzso groups in zzso factor VIII sugar zzso This suggests that zzso zzso present in human plasma may not interact with the sugar chains of therapeutic zzso factor zzso zzso zzso chain reaction was used to identify zzso zzso producing zzso zzso These studies revealed that the kidney is one of the major zzso expressing factor VIII which may contain the sugar chains with the zzso zzso zzso
