The trafficking of zzso receptors is an important component of the zzso that regulates plasticity of zzso zzso The 17 zzso zzso zzso protein zzso has been implicated in the trafficking of zzso receptors because of its ability to interact not only with the zzso zzso of the zzso but also with zzso and the zzso factor zzso To zzso the role of zzso in the trafficking of zzso zzso we have constructed a yellow fluorescent protein zzso fusion protein of zzso and expressed it in zzso using zzso so that its function may be zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso receptors and zzso to the zzso zzso in cultured zzso zzso and to the zzso regions of zzso that are making synaptic zzso zzso of zzso in zzso cells and cultured zzso zzso was able to increase the level of zzso receptors detected at the plasma zzso even at low levels of zzso zzso This effect is specific to the function of zzso on zzso zzso trafficking, because point zzso in the zzso domain of zzso zzso with the ability of zzso to increase zzso zzso surface zzso These zzso also disrupted the zzso of zzso with the zzso zzso and with zzso in zzso zzso The results of this study show for the first time that zzso has a functional effect on the trafficking of zzso receptors and provide decisive evidence for the role of zzso in transporting zzso receptors to the plasma membrane in zzso
