We have isolated a new zzso zzso zzso from the sea zzso zzso zzso whose zzso acid sequence differs greatly from that of other sea zzso zzso The zzso chain contains 46 zzso acid zzso with a molecular mass of zzso Da and an zzso point at pH zzso The zzso acid sequence determined by zzso degradation of the reduced, zzso zzso chain and zzso and zzso peptides is zzso zzso - zzso zzso - zzso No zzso zzso were present in the zzso zzso to other sea zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso nerve muscle zzso with zzso and not with muscle zzso inducing a massive release of neurotransmitter that causes a strong muscle zzso The low zzso of zzso with zzso II and zzso II toxins has implications regarding the role played by particular zzso acid zzso
