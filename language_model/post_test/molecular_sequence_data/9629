zzso of zzso a zzso gene of zzso zzso results in zzso defects in growth, zzso and zzso evident at neutral to alkaline pH but absent at zzso zzso zzso we searched for a functional zzso of zzso active at low zzso This resulted in the isolation of a second zzso zzso designated zzso The expression of zzso was zzso related to that of zzso being zzso at pH values above 6 and progressively induced at more zzso pH zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso zzso was zzso identical to that of zzso A zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso defects in growth and zzso analogous to those of zzso zzso but manifest at acid rather than alkaline pH zzso zzso expression of zzso at acid pH in a zzso zzso strain and zzso at alkaline pH in a zzso zzso strain zzso the defects in the opposing zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso resulted in a strain with zzso zzso growth and zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso represent a novel zzso system of functional zzso required for zzso zzso to adapt to environments of diverse zzso
