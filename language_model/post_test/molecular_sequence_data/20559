Whole proteins of the second-generation zzso of zzso zzso were analyzed by two-dimensional gel zzso zzso and western zzso using the chicken zzso infected artificially with zzso zzso zzso 640 spots were detected on zzso map of the second-generation zzso stained by zzso brilliant blue zzso and 85 spots were recognized on western zzso map as zzso Forty four spots of the zzso were identified by zzso laser zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Twenty six proteins of zzso zzso and three zzso proteins to other zzso zzso or zzso were identified using zzso zzso These proteins included zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso beta chain, zzso protein zzso large zzso zzso protein zzso and surface zzso of zzso zzso heat shock protein zzso of zzso zzso protein zzso type 1 of zzso zzso and hypothetical protein zzso of zzso zzso The rest proteins were searched against the zzso zzso protein sequence database using zzso zzso zzso zzso search engine in automated mode and 11 unknown proteins were zzso After the zzso acid sequence of the unknown proteins were searched using zzso against zzso sequence databases zzso surface zzso 12 of zzso zzso and six zzso proteins to other zzso zzso were zzso They were membrane skeleton protein zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and hypothetical protein zzso of zzso zzso No zzso of 8 spots of the 44 analyzed proteins were zzso These proteins enriched the data of zzso proteins of the second-generation zzso of zzso zzso
