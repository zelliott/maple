Parkinson's disease is a debilitating movement disorder characterized by altered levels of zzso * ( * indicates the possible presence of additional zzso zzso zzso receptors zzso localized on zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a highly useful zzso to probe zzso zzso structure and function, but it does not discriminate among closely related zzso * zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso primary sequence led to the identification of zzso zzso an analog with zzso discrimination between zzso * zzso found in both human and zzso zzso zzso zzso binds most strongly zzso zzso zzso to the high affinity zzso zzso a zzso that is selectively lost in Parkinson's zzso Here, we present the three-dimensional solution structure for zzso zzso as determined by two-dimensional zzso zzso zzso to zzso backbone and zzso heavy atom zzso zzso from mean zzso zzso comparisons suggest that the increased zzso area of zzso zzso relative to other members of the zzso family may be responsible for its exceptionally high affinity for zzso * zzso as well as discrimination between zzso and zzso containing zzso This finding may enable the rational design of novel zzso zzso that demonstrate enhanced specificity for zzso * zzso zzso zzso and provide a means to better understand zzso structural zzso that zzso brain zzso levels and the zzso of Parkinson's zzso
