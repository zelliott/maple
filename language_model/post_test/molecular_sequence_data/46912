zzso and zzso constitute the two zzso growth zzso of the zzso zzso In zzso and in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso is tightly controlled by zzso zzso a zzso zzso protein that enables zzso zzso by the zzso zzso We investigated whether zzso zzso is zzso by this zzso in spite of the lack of zzso zzso Strong zzso zzso was detected only following addition of zzso zzso zzso to zzso extracts of zzso suggesting that zzso contain a protein with properties similar to zzso zzso We zzso the complex between zzso and this protein to zzso Using an zzso that specifically recognizes zzso zzso we demonstrate that zzso in zzso can be zzso in this zzso A full-length zzso zzso zzso was cloned and the deduced zzso acid sequence shows zzso identity with zzso zzso However, the zzso are zzso by different zzso Northern blots using zzso from a developing zzso strain demonstrate that this zzso zzso zzso zzso is not expressed in zzso In zzso zzso showed that zzso A is present mainly underneath the plasma zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso express a zzso zzso zzso which shares the property of binding zzso and converting the latter into a zzso for the zzso zzso
