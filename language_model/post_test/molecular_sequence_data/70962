The mechanisms by which zzso proteins attain their increased zzso remain zzso as usually the sequence and structure of these proteins are very similar to those of their zzso zzso To gain insight into the basis of zzso we have determined protein stability zzso describing the temperature dependence of the free energy of unfolding for two zzso zzso one from the zzso zzso coli and one from the zzso zzso zzso The circular zzso signal was monitored as a function of temperature and zzso zzso zzso and the resulting free energies of unfolding were fit to the zzso equation to obtain a set of zzso parameters for these zzso Although the zzso zzso for these proteins occur at similar temperatures, the heat capacity of unfolding for zzso zzso zzso H is lower, resulting in a smaller temperature dependence of the free energy of unfolding and therefore a higher zzso melting zzso In addition, the zzso of these proteins are similar at the optimal growth temperatures for their respective organisms, suggesting that a balance of zzso stability and flexibility is important for zzso
