The bacterial zzso protein zzso zzso zzso interactions involved in zzso regulation of the stress zzso Specifically, zzso helps pair zzso zzso zzso with complementary regions of target zzso To probe the mechanism of this zzso we generated a series of zzso zzso and measured their affinity for zzso like those with which zzso must associate in zzso We tested the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and their ability to stabilize zzso zzso against degradation in zzso Our results suggest that zzso has two independent zzso zzso In addition to a well-known site around the core of the zzso zzso we observe interactions with the zzso face of zzso a new locus with which zzso and zzso sequences zzso Our model explains how zzso can simultaneously bind a zzso and its zzso target to facilitate the strand displacement reaction required for zzso zzso zzso
