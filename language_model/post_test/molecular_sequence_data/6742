The zzso zzso acid sequence of human zzso was determined and it was shown that two sequences were zzso The major zzso zzso accounted for zzso of the zzso and started at zzso zzso 17 of the human zzso core protein zzso sequence zzso zzso et zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The other zzso zzso zzso started at zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso core protein peptides present in the zzso of adult human zzso cartilage showed that at least 11 zzso core proteins were present with approximate zzso between 300,000 and zzso All these core proteins were found to have the same zzso sequences as that observed in human zzso When zzso cartilage was placed in zzso culture in medium containing zzso M zzso acid there was a zzso increase in the loss of zzso into the culture medium compared to tissue maintained in medium alone or medium containing zzso zzso newborn calf zzso Analysis of the zzso core protein fragments that were released to the culture medium containing zzso M zzso acid showed the presence of 13 core protein peptides of zzso between 300,000 and zzso The 11 smaller peptides of zzso 230,000 to zzso were shown to have the zzso sequence zzso This sequence which starts at zzso zzso of the human zzso core protein is located within the zzso region between the zzso and zzso zzso and is the site of zzso zzso by the putative zzso zzso The presence of core proteins of varying sizes but with the same zzso sequence reflects zzso processing from the zzso end of the core protein that was also observed in the zzso zzso extracted from the zzso of human zzso zzso This zzso processing was also evident but to a lesser extent in newly zzso zzso zzso zzso
