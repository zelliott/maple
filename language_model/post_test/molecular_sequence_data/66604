Both zzso and genetic evidence have implicated the genes for zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso Here, we report for the first time the association of their zzso and zzso with zzso asthma in Indian zzso We zzso seven single zzso zzso encompassing the two zzso in patients and control subjects in two independent zzso zzso zzso levels of selected individuals were measured and correlated with zzso and zzso The A zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso was associated with reduced risk of asthma zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso A and B, respectively), reduced zzso levels zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso in zzso A and B, respectively), and reduced serum zzso levels zzso zzso zzso A marginal association was also observed for zzso zzso with asthma and zzso zzso Furthermore, analysis using zzso zzso showed significant differences in the major zzso zzso zzso zzso between patients and control subjects zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso for zzso A and B, zzso zzso the zzso zzso was the most frequent in patients zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso for zzso A and B, respectively), and was associated with high zzso and serum zzso levels, whereas zzso was the most frequent in the control subjects zzso zzso zzso and P zzso zzso for zzso A and B, respectively), and was associated with low zzso and serum zzso zzso We also report here that the C zzso A substitution at position zzso of the zzso influences the binding of nuclear proteins in zzso mobility shift zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso A zzso in the promoter region of zzso may influence zzso expression and affect zzso levels and zzso to zzso
