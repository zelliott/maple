zzso zzso zzso zzso is widely distributed in sensory zzso and nerve zzso To clarify the function of zzso on the immune system, the effect of zzso on zzso by zzso zzso was examined by means of flow zzso zzso enhanced zzso of latex beads in a zzso zzso Because the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso zzso enhanced the zzso enhancement of zzso the enhancement might be zzso by zzso In the presence of zzso the zzso was suppressed and the zzso enhancement was also zzso suggesting that zzso receptors on zzso were involved in zzso the zzso of latex zzso and zzso enhanced the zzso zzso zzso The present results indicate that zzso can zzso the function of zzso in nerve terminals of sensory zzso during the development and maintenance of zzso
