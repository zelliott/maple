The recurrence in the zzso repertoire of individual zzso zzso genes can now be extended from the restricted zzso populations of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso to the expressed zzso repertoire of normal zzso Why the human B cell zzso zzso these individual zzso genes remains zzso However, it is apparent that the population of zzso genes used to zzso zzso reflects the normal expressed repertoire zzso zzso Even so, the overrepresentation of other V genes such as zzso in zzso zzso and the presence of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso disease continues to suggest an zzso influence on zzso zzso We zzso that only a fraction of available zzso V genes are zzso in the expressed repertoire, and that zzso of naturally occurring zzso and zzso zzso of zzso compensate for the loss of diversity entailed by the limited use of the potential zzso The mechanisms by which zzso genes become zzso remains unclear but they presumably relate to zzso loss of regulatory control or perhaps environmental factors zzso et zzso zzso What then are the mechanisms which lead to escape of these zzso genes from normal control? What zzso drive if any produces zzso specificity in zzso Why indeed is the expressed repertoire using only a fraction of the available zzso To answer these questions, further study of the zzso repertoire of selected populations of zzso cells and of zzso zzso zzso is necessary and is zzso The contribution of individual V genes to zzso binding and zzso is also being dissected and promises to yield important information about the relative contribution of zzso genes to zzso
