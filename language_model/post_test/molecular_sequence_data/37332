zzso of the brine shrimp, zzso zzso exhibit remarkable resistance to zzso stress, which is temporally correlated with the presence of two zzso one a small heat zzso protein termed zzso and the other called zzso of unknown zzso zzso was zzso previously by zzso degradation, and its relationship to zzso an iron storage zzso zzso The isolation from an zzso expressed sequence tag library of zzso and zzso zzso extends this zzso zzso zzso was found to contain an zzso of zzso zzso and its deduced zzso zzso except for the zzso zzso was identical with that determined zzso zzso zzso is 725 zzso in length with an zzso of 516 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are most similar to zzso but zzso is enriched in zzso The abundance of zzso and their zzso spatial distribution suggest that zzso protects zzso against zzso damage and/or that its function is zzso zzso The zzso regions in zzso and zzso zzso are structurally similar to one another and both proteins assemble into zzso However, modeling of the zzso structure indicated that zzso zzso lack the central space used for metal storage that characterizes zzso zzso zzso different roles for this zzso zzso of Northern blots revealed two zzso zzso one of zzso zzso and another of zzso zzso These transcripts decreased in parallel and had almost disappeared by 16 h of zzso The zzso transcript of zzso zzso increased slightly during zzso of development, then declined, and was almost completely gone by 16 zzso Clearly, the loss of zzso and zzso during zzso development is due to zzso regulation and zzso degradation of the zzso
