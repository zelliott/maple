zzso of most insects are composed of simple zzso zzso repeats that are zzso by zzso However, in some zzso insects such as zzso zzso zzso zzso repeats or zzso activity has not been zzso Although zzso structure is well documented in zzso and zzso very limited information is available on lower insect zzso To understand general aspects of zzso function and evolution in insects, we zzso to characterize structures of the zzso and zzso regions in a lower zzso the Taiwan zzso zzso zzso FISH analysis of this zzso zzso demonstrated zzso zzso repeat elements in all zzso zzso Just zzso to the zzso repeats, the highly zzso zzso long terminal unit zzso sequences are zzso zzso These were observed in four of six zzso three zzso ends, and one zzso zzso zzso sequences represent about zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Each zzso contains a core zzso sequence zzso and five types of zzso zzso (short zzso zzso J zzso X, zzso zzso sequence zzso and zzso vary in length from about 150 zzso to zzso zzso The zzso sequence is defined as zzso Most zzso regions may be derived from the ancestral common zzso which is observed in ST regions six times and at many other zzso zzso We could not find the zzso sequence in three other zzso including the closest species, zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso in zzso zzso has been rapidly amplified in zzso regions through recent zzso zzso It is also suggested that the highly zzso structure of the zzso is maintained by zzso and may contribute to zzso zzso as seen in zzso zzso
