Several zzso zzso zzso associated with leukemia or zzso have been shown to occur in zzso band zzso between the genes zzso and zzso a distance of approximately 750 zzso A combination of zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso field gel zzso zzso experiments has further refined the zzso containing one of these zzso zzso to within 200 zzso of zzso We have extended the zzso analysis to show that the zzso zzso lies in a region of approximately 100 zzso situated 100 zzso zzso to zzso Furthermore, we show that a second zzso zzso zzso which was also previously mapped between zzso and zzso is distinct from that of the zzso zzso The zzso sequences that are involved at the zzso zzso are not present in a zzso containing the zzso zzso The zzso zzso has been localized on the zzso map of the zzso zzso and is at least 110 zzso zzso to the zzso zzso thus demonstrating zzso among zzso zzso
