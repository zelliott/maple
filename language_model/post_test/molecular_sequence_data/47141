The potential for the development of zzso zzso resistance in zzso of zzso zzso and the existence of zzso tolerance in adult worms of this human pathogen are major concerns for the effective control of zzso zzso zzso an zzso zzso protein associated with zzso resistance in zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso might play important roles in the development of zzso resistance and/or in the tolerance of adult zzso zzso In order to find the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso has been performed in a specially zzso zzso pool and two full-length zzso have been cloned and zzso The first, zzso encodes a zzso putative protein zzso with zzso duplicated halves, each containing six putative zzso motifs and an zzso zzso zzso is most similar in sequence to other zzso zzso The second zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso zzso which is only half the size of typical zzso although it still shares high zzso with zzso zzso patterns of the two genes in different zzso stages have been investigated by zzso zzso zzso suggesting that the expression levels of the two genes (especially zzso may be linked with zzso zzso low levels were found in zzso sensitive zzso stages while high levels were found in zzso tolerant adult zzso
