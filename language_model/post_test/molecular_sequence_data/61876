The contribution of the factor Va C1 domain zzso to assembly of the zzso complex has not been previously zzso The zzso zzso domain contains a binding site for zzso zzso that includes the zzso zzso of zzso at the zzso of zzso In order to investigate the structure and function of zzso a molecular model was constructed based on the structure of zzso The aromatic and zzso side chains of zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso are located at the predicted zzso of zzso zzso charged and zzso zzso in zzso were changed to zzso in clusters of 1-3 zzso per zzso The zzso 20 zzso were expressed in zzso cells and screened for binding to immobilized zzso and zzso activity on zzso zzso containing either zzso or zzso zzso Two zzso zzso and zzso showed both decreased binding to immobilized zzso and a selective decrease in zzso activity on zzso containing zzso zzso The interaction of zzso zzso with zzso zzso was studied using zzso resonance energy transfer and zzso zzso The affinity of zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso was reduced zzso compared to zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso was markedly impaired on zzso zzso containing zzso or less zzso We conclude that zzso exposed zzso and aromatic zzso acids in both zzso and zzso contribute to the interaction of factor V with zzso zzso
