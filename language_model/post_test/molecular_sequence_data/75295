zzso A is the major membrane zzso of human zzso and represents a typical example of a zzso zzso The functional role of this zzso component is not known but it represents a zzso for zzso bacteria and zzso like zzso zzso zzso Two zzso clones zzso zzso A have been characterized from human fetal zzso zzso The longer zzso extended from the coding region of zzso A zzso zzso to the 3' untranslated region which included two zzso signals and a zzso zzso zzso The structural gene for zzso A is located on zzso 4, zzso as shown by in zzso zzso thus confirming the previous zzso by genetic linkage zzso zzso Three distinct zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been identified in zzso zzso Northern zzso analyses with a probe directed against the 3' untranslated region of the zzso indicated that all these species share a zzso 3' zzso region and that the first zzso signal downstream the stop zzso is not zzso zzso zzso studies by Southern zzso analysis of the zzso DNA from normal zzso and rare zzso donors suggest that the zzso A gene has a complex organization and is largely deleted in donors of the zzso zzso zzso zzso who lack zzso A on their red zzso
