We have carried out an in-depth comparative analysis of a zzso zzso zzso containing two imprinted zzso zzso and zzso using sequences derived from human, zzso and zzso In all three zzso zzso is located at a similar zzso distance and in the same orientation relative to zzso indicating the basic structural conservation of this imprinted zzso However, several zzso changes have occurred that affect the zzso structure and zzso status of zzso Human zzso and zzso share a set of zzso zzso and a common promoter, and both genes are zzso zzso In contrast, mouse and cow zzso genes do not share zzso zzso with zzso and zzso employs a separate downstream promoter in both zzso The zzso status of zzso is also not zzso among zzso mouse zzso is expressed zzso in zzso but predominantly from the maternal zzso in brain, while cow zzso is expressed zzso in zzso The separate zzso of zzso and zzso and the change in promoter usage and zzso status appear to have resulted from independent zzso events that have placed unrelated zzso zzso and zzso respectively, between zzso and zzso in mouse and zzso Our results suggest that zzso and zzso represent the two original genes at this locus and that zzso have occurred independently in different zzso lineages in recent evolutionary zzso Our data also suggest that zzso of human zzso and zzso was not zzso but may represent a fusion event joining the two neighboring genes and bringing zzso under paternal expression zzso These observations are striking in light of the structural and functional conservation that typifies other imprinted zzso and suggest that the zzso imprinted domain may have evolved in an unusual zzso zzso
