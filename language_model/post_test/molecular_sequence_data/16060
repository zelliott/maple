The zzso transfer site has been localized at the zzso of domain V of zzso zzso zzso zzso primarily on the basis of a zzso binding zzso The implicated region constitutes an zzso circle in the current secondary structural model which contains several universally zzso zzso With a view to investigate the function of this zzso region further, four of these zzso zzso including one indirectly implicated in zzso zzso were selected for zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso were expressed in zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso and each one yielded dramatically altered zzso zzso exhibiting zzso or zzso zzso were zzso and it was shown by inserting the zzso genes after a zzso promoter that the zzso zzso were directly zzso In addition, a zzso transition caused a decreased growth rate, probably due to a partial selection against zzso zzso incorporation into zzso while an zzso zzso produced a decreased growth rate and zzso resistance to zzso All of the zzso zzso were incorporated into zzso zzso but while the two lethal zzso zzso were strongly selected against in zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso was preferred over the zzso zzso contrary to current regulatory zzso The results establish the critical structural and functional importance of highly zzso zzso in the zzso binding zzso A zzso model is also presented to explain the disruptive effect of zzso (and other zzso on zzso bond formation at the zzso zzso zzso
