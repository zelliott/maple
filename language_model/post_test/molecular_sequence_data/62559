zzso can play an important role in the genetic structuring of natural zzso In this regard, freshwater zzso often exhibit extensive population genetic subdivision and are ideal subjects for investigating current and historical patterns of connection and zzso between zzso We set out to generate a comprehensive molecular zzso for a widespread freshwater fish from eastern Australia, the Pacific zzso zzso zzso Although movement via flood events may be important in the southern end of the zzso range, genetic structuring revealed the importance of historical drainage connections and zzso in zzso or zzso zzso A dominant feature of our zzso is a split between northern and southern zzso which appears to be zzso with a zzso barrier recently implicated as important for the connectivity of freshwater organisms in eastern zzso The extent of the split also has zzso implications consistent with suggestions that the Pacific zzso may represent more than a single zzso
