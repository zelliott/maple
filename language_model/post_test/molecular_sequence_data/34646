The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes an essential function that is required for zzso and zzso transitions during zzso and at various stages during zzso We have isolated a functional zzso of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso expressed from its own promoter on a zzso zzso The predicted product of zzso has 37% overall identity to the zzso zzso zzso zzso although this identity is biased towards the zzso region of the two proteins which contains eight copies of the zzso zzso zzso an element found in proteins that regulate diverse biological processes and an zzso domain zzso to the first iteration of the zzso zzso Both the zzso domain and zzso motifs appear necessary for the zzso functions of zzso in both zzso In contrast to its zzso role in zzso zzso zzso zzso is unable to rescue the zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso under restrictive conditions, even when expressed from an efficient zzso zzso zzso In opposition to zzso zzso zzso being essential, zzso zzso zzso appears to be zzso and in its absence is critical for zzso growth in zzso zzso
