Two zzso zzso bacterial strains zzso and zzso were isolated from river zzso and rice field zzso zzso They zzso zzso fatty acids with zzso carbon atoms in zzso association with zzso however, neither tested zzso fatty acids nor could zzso be zzso The strains formed spores when zzso with zzso on zzso or when grew on zzso plus zzso zzso zzso in pure zzso The cells were slightly curved rods with zzso cell wall structure, and contained small amount of zzso zzso The strains could not degrade zzso alone, nor could use zzso zzso zzso sulfur or nitrate as electron zzso except zzso for zzso zzso The generation time of strain zzso was about zzso when growing on zzso at 37 degrees zzso The growth of the new strains occurred in the range of pH zzso and of temperature zzso degrees C, and at zzso concentration of zzso zzso The zzso content of the zzso DNA of strain zzso was zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene similarity showed the two strains to be a member of species zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso however they differed from the existing strains in both zzso and genetic zzso zzso a new subspecies of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The type strain was zzso zzso
