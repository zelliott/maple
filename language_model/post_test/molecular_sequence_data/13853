We looked for abnormalities of the zzso zzso gene and of RB protein expression in 35 patients with multiple myeloma zzso zzso in zzso 20 to 24 of the zzso gene zzso where zzso predominate in zzso and other solid zzso were analyzed by single stranded zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was studied in bone zzso plasma cells by zzso (ABC zzso zzso with a specific zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis of zzso gene was also performed in 20 of the zzso Twenty two patients analyzed had advanced disease zzso III or, in one case, plasma cell zzso and zzso analysis zzso in 31 zzso found zzso 13 in 9 zzso No zzso of the zzso gene was found by Southern zzso Absent or greatly reduced zzso protein level was found in plasma cells in 4 of the patients zzso whereas normal levels were seen in the remaining zzso No point zzso in zzso 20 to 24 and their zzso zzso were found in any of the 35 zzso Three of the 4 patients with absent or reduced zzso protein expression had advanced zzso zzso zzso 2 zzso plasma cell zzso 1 zzso all 4 patients were resistant to treatment (as compared to 7 of the 31 patients with normal zzso protein zzso only one of them was subsequently found to have zzso 13 (as compared to 9 of the 28 other zzso zzso Our findings suggest that abnormalities of the zzso gene and its expression are rare in zzso Absent or reduced expression of zzso protein was not significantly correlated to zzso 13 and was not associated with gross zzso of the zzso gene by Southern analysis or point zzso in zzso 20 to 24 of the zzso zzso expression of zzso protein may be associated with advanced disease and poor response to treatment, although larger numbers of patients will be required for more adequate zzso
