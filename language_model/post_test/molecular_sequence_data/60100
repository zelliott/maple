We have designed zzso zzso zzso that allow the physical zzso within the same zzso of B and zzso zzso as structurally separate zzso The immune response against such zzso was explored using zzso zzso a B cell zzso originating from a zzso zzso surface zzso and zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso The two peptides were linked to the outer surface of small zzso approximately 100 zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso to two different zzso To that end we have developed a strategy that allows the controlled chemical zzso of zzso and zzso zzso at their N zzso with a zzso to zzso zzso containing zzso derivatives of zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This synthetic construct zzso zzso to zzso zzso induced highly intense zzso zzso zzso zzso and long-lasting (over 2 zzso immune responses, indicating that this strategy is zzso Two parameters were of prime importance to elicit this response with our zzso zzso zzso zzso the simultaneous expression of B and zzso zzso on the same zzso and zzso the zzso zzso anchor of the zzso zzso zzso could not be replaced by a zzso anchor (a lesser immune response was zzso Analysis of the zzso response revealed a complex zzso thus, besides the zzso response zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso of a zzso zzso zzso response was also found zzso and zzso These results indicate that zzso zzso zzso could be attractive in the development of synthetic zzso zzso
