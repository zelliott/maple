zzso zzso the initial ability of zzso zzso to bind to zzso zzso zzso zzso the major zzso zzso and a minor protein termed zzso reportedly essential for zzso zzso undergo zzso phase and structural zzso We demonstrate here that at least two different adherence properties are associated with the zzso zzso one is specific for zzso which is virtually unaffected by zzso variation, and another is specific for zzso cells, and is modulated in response to the variation of zzso Based on this finding, zzso of a zzso strain were selected that had lost the ability to bind to human cornea zzso cells zzso but retained the ability to form zzso zzso and to zzso human zzso zzso The zzso zzso failed to produce zzso levels of zzso or zzso zzso representing zzso phase zzso generated in the absence of zzso The A- zzso phase zzso were indistinguishable from their zzso parents and spontaneous zzso zzso with regard to the amount of zzso produced and its zzso mobility, the degrees of zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso zzso These data demonstrate a central role for zzso in zzso adherence of zzso zzso to human zzso cells and further indicate that neither zzso nor zzso is obligatory for the assembly of zzso zzso
