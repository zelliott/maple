The widespread use of antibiotics is selecting for a variety of resistance mechanisms that seriously challenge our ability to treat bacterial zzso zzso bacteria can be selected at the high zzso of antibiotics used zzso but what role the much lower zzso zzso present in many environments plays in selection remains largely zzso Here we show using highly sensitive competition experiments that selection of resistant bacteria occurs at extremely low zzso zzso Thus, for three clinically important zzso drug zzso up to several zzso below the minimal zzso concentration of susceptible bacteria could enrich for resistant bacteria, even when present at a very low initial zzso We also show that de zzso zzso can be selected at zzso zzso of zzso and we provide a mathematical model predicting how rapidly such zzso would take over in a susceptible zzso These results add another dimension to the evolution of resistance and suggest that the low zzso zzso found in many natural environments are important for enrichment and maintenance of resistance in bacterial zzso
