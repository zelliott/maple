Members of the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of protein zzso are higher plant zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso protein zzso Based on analogies with the zzso system, we zzso that the zzso zzso would be regulated by zzso on a zzso zzso to zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso within the 'T zzso between the zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have raised an zzso against a zzso based on this zzso and used it to show that zzso of two spinach zzso zzso by protein zzso and zzso by a zzso upstream protein zzso is associated with changes in the zzso state of this zzso We also show that zzso of this zzso by protein zzso and zzso zzso is inhibited by low zzso of zzso via binding to the zzso zzso the zzso This is the first report showing that the plant zzso zzso are regulated by zzso in a manner similar to their zzso zzso The possible zzso significance of these findings is zzso
