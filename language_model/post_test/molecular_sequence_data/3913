We identified zzso in the zzso zzso gene for two distinct inherited zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso One of the zzso zzso responsible for zzso altered the zzso and impaired DNA zzso Two other sequence changes zzso and zzso were associated with zzso and zzso respectively, and involved a region adjacent to the zzso The zzso zzso and a fourth zzso affecting the highly zzso zzso domain zzso occurred in a child with very severe zzso who required a zzso transplant at 3 months of zzso In this family, relatives with the zzso change alone had mild to moderate zzso while zzso alone caused no zzso zzso However, with either the zzso or zzso zzso zzso detected abnormal function of the inner zzso where zzso is zzso These data define the molecular basis of two important zzso zzso and reveal the importance of the zzso domain in the human zzso
