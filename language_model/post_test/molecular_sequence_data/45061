zzso cells are the most potent of the zzso cells and are characterized by surface expression of zzso Here, we show that the coding region of zzso zzso contains a novel zzso structured zzso element that binds to zzso a member of the zzso family of zzso element zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells demonstrated that this zzso zzso element acts as a zzso regulatory element in cells zzso zzso zzso binding of zzso to the zzso zzso regulatory element did not affect zzso zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso efficient expression of zzso In particular, zzso was required for zzso zzso of zzso zzso Likewise, zzso of the zzso nuclear export zzso by zzso B or zzso of a defective form of the zzso zzso diminished zzso zzso zzso zzso In zzso the data presented demonstrate that the zzso axis affects the zzso zzso of zzso zzso under regular zzso zzso
