zzso zzso protein zzso belongs to a family of four zzso core zzso proteins rich in zzso zzso and is the principal zzso protein found in milk of a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso have two zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso are characterized by the presence of an additional domain at the zzso zzso zzso and expression differences between zzso and zzso zzso have presented challenges to identifying zzso functions of the zzso zzso We have characterized the zzso structure of zzso zzso zzso zzso identified its zzso zzso and investigated the potential function of zzso We have demonstrated that zzso and domain III zzso of the protein alone stimulate proliferation of a mouse zzso zzso cell line zzso and primary cultures of zzso zzso zzso cells zzso whereas deletion of zzso from zzso zzso this zzso zzso However, zzso does not induce proliferation of human embryonic kidney zzso zzso DNA synthesis and expression of zzso D1 and zzso zzso genes were significantly zzso when zzso and zzso cells were grown in the presence of either zzso or zzso These data suggest that zzso is the functional domain of the zzso protein and that evolutionary pressure has led to the loss of this domain in zzso most likely as a consequence of adopting a zzso strategy that relies on greater investment in development of the newborn during zzso
