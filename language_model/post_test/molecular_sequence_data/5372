The zzso zzso of phase zzso is a large modular protein that plays a central role in zzso We show that the zzso end zzso domain, I beta zzso which is responsible for binding the DNA attachment sites at each end of the zzso zzso comprises two zzso I beta and I zzso that are structurally autonomous and do not interact with each other in the absence of zzso The solution structure of the I gamma zzso has been determined by zzso zzso zzso The structure of I gamma comprises a four zzso bundle and, despite the absence of any significant sequence identity, the zzso of the first three zzso is very similar to that of the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso The zzso motif of I zzso however, differs from that of the zzso in so far as the loop is longer and the second zzso is zzso reminiscent of that in the zzso zzso
