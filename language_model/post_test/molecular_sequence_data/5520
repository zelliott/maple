zzso interactions with the zzso zzso of sequence zzso zzso as zzso zzso in zzso zzso have been studied by electron spin resonance zzso zzso with zzso zzso The zzso zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso channel protein and contains the single putative zzso span of this zzso zzso interactions give rise to a second component in the zzso zzso of lipids zzso on the zzso atom of the chain that zzso to restriction of the zzso mobility by direct interaction with the zzso zzso From the dependence on the zzso ratio, the zzso of zzso interaction is found to be about two zzso zzso The sequence of selectivity for zzso association with the zzso zzso is in the order zzso acid zzso zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with previous data for a corresponding zzso zzso zzso with a single deletion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso indicates a very similar mode of membrane incorporation for native and zzso zzso but a strongly modified pattern and degree of specificity for the interaction with zzso charged zzso The latter is interpreted in terms of the relative zzso of the charged zzso acid side chains in the zzso zzso of the native and zzso zzso
