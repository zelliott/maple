zzso zzso membrane protein 1 zzso has zzso potential and is expressed in many zzso zzso Although zzso is regarded as a potential zzso zzso for zzso and several zzso zzso class zzso zzso zzso have been reported, little is known regarding zzso class zzso zzso helper zzso zzso zzso for zzso The goal of the present studies was to determine whether zzso class zzso zzso zzso responses could be induced against the zzso zzso and to evaluate the zzso effect of these zzso We have combined the use of a zzso zzso class II binding zzso zzso with in zzso vaccination of zzso T cells using candidate peptides to identify naturally processed zzso derived from zzso that elicit immune responses against zzso tumor zzso zzso zzso was effective in inducing zzso responses that were restricted by zzso zzso or zzso indicating that this zzso behaves as a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso zzso clones directly recognized zzso zzso B cells, zzso natural killer zzso cells and naturally processed zzso in the form of zzso tumor cell zzso presented by zzso zzso zzso Because the newly identified zzso zzso zzso with an zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso might have the ability to induce simultaneous zzso and zzso responses against zzso Overall, our data should be relevant for the design and zzso of zzso zzso zzso against various zzso zzso including zzso cell zzso
