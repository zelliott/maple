zzso of zzso zzso known as zzso zzso zzso efficiently inhibit gene expression by zzso interference zzso when introduced into zzso zzso We show that zzso can be zzso by in zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso providing an economical alternative to chemical synthesis of zzso By using this method, we show that short hairpin zzso can function like zzso duplexes to inhibit gene expression in a zzso zzso Further, we find that hairpin zzso or zzso expressed from an zzso zzso III zzso based on the mouse zzso zzso promoter can effectively inhibit gene expression in zzso zzso zzso hairpin zzso dramatically reduced the expression of a zzso zzso protein during the zzso differentiation of mouse zzso cells, demonstrating that this approach should be useful for studies of differentiation and zzso We also observe that zzso within hairpin zzso can increase the strand selectivity of a hairpin zzso which may reduce zzso of zzso expressing zzso Use of hairpin zzso expression zzso for zzso should provide a rapid and versatile method for assessing gene function in zzso cells, and may have applications in gene zzso
