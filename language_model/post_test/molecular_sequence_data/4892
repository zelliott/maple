zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso During zzso infection, zzso and zzso zzso simultaneously express multiple members of a zzso surface protein zzso The effect of this extensive surface protein zzso on the zzso host T cell response is not zzso In this report, we identified a surface protein zzso class zzso T cell zzso zzso 1), and cloned 10 surface protein zzso that zzso zzso 1 zzso All these zzso zzso zzso were processed and presented to T cells, and some functioned as partial T cell zzso zzso T cells primed with zzso 1, and challenged with zzso 1, proliferated and expressed zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso T cells primed with a mixture of zzso zzso and zzso 1, and challenged with zzso 1, expressed zzso but did not zzso or express zzso The data suggest that the simultaneous expression of zzso surface proteins that zzso zzso T cell zzso may limit the expression of each surface protein zzso below a threshold level required to stimulate a protective zzso response against that zzso This system of T cell evasion is unique and contrasts with the sequential zzso variation used by African zzso to evade zzso directed against their surface zzso
