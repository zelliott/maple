We determined the zzso acid and zzso sequences of zzso zzso of the zzso human zzso zzso zzso from zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso 118 was identified as a site that was zzso independently of zzso in zzso zzso zzso is on the zzso zzso of zzso zzso which suggests that the zzso may be a consensus zzso site motif for either the zzso protein zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively zzso the zzso zzso in zzso on zzso 118 independent of zzso whereas zzso did not zzso the zzso We demonstrated previously that zzso 167 of the zzso was zzso in an zzso zzso We therefore compared the consequence of zzso zzso at zzso 118 by zzso zzso and zzso at zzso 167 by zzso zzso II on the zzso affinity for specific DNA zzso The binding of the zzso to an zzso response element was not altered by zzso with zzso zzso at zzso 118 but was significantly increased when zzso at zzso 167 by zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso of the zzso by zzso zzso pathways may influence zzso action by a mechanism other than the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso zzso zzso
