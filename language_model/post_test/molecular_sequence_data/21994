Gill zzso a series of openings in the zzso zzso are characteristic features of the zzso and zzso body zzso In zzso these openings, called zzso are formed in the zzso zzso during juvenile zzso Multiple zzso in zzso zzso analyses based on approximately 1,500 genes expressed in zzso zzso zzso identified 28 genes expressed predominantly in the zzso zzso zzso patterns of these zzso genes were classified into four different zzso On the basis of these findings, we have been able to show that the peripheral region of a zzso consists of at least three different zzso The expression of a zzso gene was detected in zzso cells during the zzso zzso and division and was maintained in the zzso region of the elliptical zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso B1 zzso during the differentiation of the zzso zzso cells suggests that some of the molecular mechanisms involved in zzso differentiation might be recruited for the zzso development, or vice zzso zzso of the zzso such as zzso and zzso were also expressed in the zzso zzso These genes might facilitate further analyses regarding the evolution of the zzso fissures and the development of the zzso zzso
