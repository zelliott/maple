To determine zzso in transgenic zzso mice, a new technology, real-time quantitative zzso has recently been introduced in transgenic research to overcome several drawbacks zzso specialized techniques and/or ambiguity in the zzso of previously established methods, for example, Southern zzso zzso dot zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso However, the previous real-time quantitative zzso method still possesses several zzso for example, it needs two sets of zzso and the complicated setting up of appropriate conditions, both of which are expensive and remain zzso We therefore developed an improved real-time quantitative zzso system for determination of zzso which is easy, rapid and less expensive, because the technique needs only two experimental zzso zzso of DNA concentration and zzso Green zzso We found that zzso zzso and zzso animals could easily be distinguished among F1 zzso in crosses of zzso zzso and zzso zzso Our improved method will be zzso to any zzso mouse zzso when a primer set is matched to the corresponding zzso
