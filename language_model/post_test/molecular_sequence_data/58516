Little is known about the functional significance of zzso B virus zzso sequence zzso Here we analyzed the type, frequency, and function of zzso in the core zzso II region of zzso in zzso zzso The major zzso population in zzso patients with severe liver disease had zzso zzso and/or base changes in this zzso Such zzso were not found in zzso patients with mild zzso Except for two zzso all created a zzso nuclear factor 1 zzso binding site or a potential zzso binding zzso Occasionally, known binding sites for zzso and zzso were additionally zzso Eleven zzso core promoter zzso sequences were functionally tested in the context of a zzso zzso by zzso in zzso zzso Despite the diversity of zzso tested, all decreased zzso levels of zzso zzso drastically and increased those of the C zzso zzso zzso This correlated with reduced levels of zzso zzso B e zzso and increased zzso levels of core and Pol proteins and zzso zzso DNA zzso The levels of zzso zzso zzso particles were also increased although most of the zzso reduced the levels of zzso zzso and zzso and zzso proteins as well as zzso of zzso B surface zzso These data reveal a novel class of zzso zzso with zzso binding sites in the core promoter which are characterized by a zzso in zzso B e zzso zzso enhanced zzso and altered protein levels, all probably zzso by altered zzso factor zzso The zzso of these zzso and their prevalence only in zzso patients with severe liver disease may indicate that they play a role in zzso
