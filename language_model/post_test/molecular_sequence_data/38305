zzso zzso is a zzso modification occurring in many zzso zzso and zzso proteins and has impact on diverse zzso and pathological zzso zzso important is the generation of zzso zzso which anchor membrane proteins to the zzso Both protein modifications depend on the central zzso sugar zzso zzso The zzso reactions leading to generation of zzso zzso are established, yet most of the respective genes still await zzso We describe the characterization of such a zzso zzso which we identified based on its differential expression in zzso zzso precursor zzso We further demonstrate regulated expression during zzso zzso codes for a zzso acid protein exhibiting zzso zzso zzso It thereby holds a key position in the zzso toward de zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, the protein associates with the zzso side of various zzso zzso accumulates prior to zzso and zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso
