The zzso zzso zzso is generated by the fusion of the zzso zzso domain of the zzso zzso to the zzso region of another gene named zzso zzso This zzso has been detected only in human zzso zzso zzso We have previously demonstrated that the putative zzso zzso in the zzso region of zzso can mediate zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso In this study, we further demonstrated that the zzso zzso forms a zzso in zzso and the zzso zzso is responsible for this zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is essential for zzso zzso and the transforming activity of the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso cells suppressed the transforming activity of zzso and reversed the transformed zzso of these cells, presumably by forming inactive zzso between the two forms of zzso Taken together, these data indicate that zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is essential for zzso transforming activity and suggest that zzso zzso acquired by zzso or by point zzso may be a general mechanism for the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso
