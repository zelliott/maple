The zzso zzso zzso of bone zzso includes zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso expression of these disorders ranges from mild to zzso lethal zzso We report the detection and partial characterization of a zzso in type II collagen in a zzso lethal form of zzso zzso in sodium zzso zzso of CB peptides (where CB represents zzso zzso from type II collagen of the diseased cartilage showed a zzso band for zzso alpha zzso and evidence for zzso zzso of the major peptides zzso zzso and zzso seen as a retarded zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso and on zzso high pressure liquid zzso fragments of abnormal mobility were zzso zzso analysis of a unique zzso zzso revealed a single zzso acid substitution zzso at position zzso of the triple zzso zzso This was confirmed by sequence analysis of amplified zzso zzso which revealed a single zzso substitution zzso in 5 of 10 zzso zzso zzso of the diseased cartilage showed a sparse zzso zzso and zzso containing zzso rough zzso zzso which suggested impaired assembly and zzso of the zzso zzso This case further documents the molecular basis of the zzso zzso spectrum of zzso as zzso in zzso
