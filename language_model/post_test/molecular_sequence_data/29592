Four types of zzso D zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso have been characterized in zzso and they display different requirements for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or free fatty zzso However, all previously cloned plant zzso contain a zzso zzso C2 domain and require zzso for zzso This study documents a new type of zzso zzso zzso 1, which is zzso different from previously characterized zzso It contains at the N zzso a zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso domain, but not the C2 zzso A full-length zzso for zzso zzso zzso 1 has been identified and used to express zzso active zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 does not require zzso or any other zzso zzso for zzso In addition, it selectively zzso zzso whereas the other zzso zzso use several zzso as zzso zzso zzso 1 requires zzso for activity, but unlike the zzso zzso beta or zzso zzso is not needed in zzso zzso These differences are zzso together with a zzso analysis of 12 putative zzso zzso genes that are grouped into zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso based on their gene zzso sequence similarities, domain structures, and zzso zzso
