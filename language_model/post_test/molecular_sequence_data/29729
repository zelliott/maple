The basic zzso zzso zzso protein family comprises a group of zzso regulators that often respond to a variety of zzso and environmental zzso Two zzso members of this family, Single zzso 1 zzso and Single zzso 2 zzso are essential for zzso survival but differ from other zzso family members such as the zzso zzso zzso and zzso factors, in that they behave as zzso zzso in zzso zzso experiments and have yet to be ascribed a regulating zzso In cell lines engineered to zzso express zzso and zzso we show that both are nuclear proteins that zzso complex with the general zzso partner factor, zzso We report that the zzso SIM factors, in combination with zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso during zzso Such zzso between zzso zzso factors can occur through competition for zzso which we find evident in SIM repression of zzso zzso from a zzso response element reporter zzso However, zzso but not zzso can activate zzso from the EPO zzso at zzso zzso that the SIM proteins have the ability to bind zzso response elements and affect either zzso or repression of zzso This notion is supported by zzso of EPO zzso sequences with the zzso zzso SIM protein levels decrease with zzso treatment in our stable cell lines, although levels of the transcripts zzso zzso and zzso and the approximately zzso zzso of each protein are unchanged during zzso zzso of protein zzso known to occur in cells during hypoxic stress in order to decrease zzso zzso appears to account for the fall in SIM zzso Our data suggest the existence of a hypoxic switch mechanism in cells that zzso zzso factor and SIM zzso where zzso and zzso of zzso zzso is zzso with zzso of SIM zzso
