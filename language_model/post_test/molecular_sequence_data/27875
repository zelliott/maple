Two zzso zzso clones were isolated from a library derived from the zzso human cell line, which is known to express zzso zzso zzso zzso appeared to contain the entire zzso coding zzso which differs from zzso in having three additional zzso zzso and 111 additional zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso had an internal 32 zzso acid zzso not found in zzso or in turkey zzso zzso zzso was truncated at its zzso end and did not contain this new zzso Analysis of a zzso clone of human zzso revealed that the new zzso was a portion of an zzso zzso zzso The occurrence of potential zzso sites and of open reading frames in the zzso consensus zzso sequence suggests that the incorporation of zzso fragments as potential coding zzso could be a relatively common event in human zzso Whether such messages can be translated is zzso zzso raised against a zzso at the predicted zzso of the zzso protein zzso zzso but zzso raised against a zzso located in the zzso zzso did zzso
