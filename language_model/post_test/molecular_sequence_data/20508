zzso remains one of the major human zzso diseases, particularly in zzso zzso Most of the fatal cases are caused by zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso has been the model of choice in research due to its similarities to human malaria, including zzso cycle, preferential invasion of mature zzso zzso of asexual development, zzso variation, gene zzso as well as similar resistance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential catalyst of the zzso zzso in different biological systems with folding and zzso zzso Most of the proteins exported by zzso have to pass through the zzso zzso before reaching their final destination and their correct folding is critical for zzso zzso zzso constitutes a potential target for the development of alternative therapy strategies based on the zzso of folding and zzso of exported zzso We here describe the sequencing of the gene coding for the zzso from zzso zzso and zzso the relationship to its counterpart zzso particularly with the zzso from other zzso zzso The model constructed, based on the recent model deduced from the zzso structure zzso was compared with the previous theoretical model for the whole zzso zzso constructed by zzso A zzso zzso from zzso zzso was also produced and used as an zzso for zzso zzso production for application in zzso zzso
