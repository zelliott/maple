zzso of the zzso gene in zzso coli is controlled by Ada zzso which binds to a specific region of the zzso promoter and enhances further binding of zzso zzso zzso to the zzso To determine the sequence recognized by the Ada zzso we introduced various base zzso into the promoter region of zzso and examined their effects on expression of the zzso both in zzso and in zzso Base changes within the sequence zzso located between positions zzso and zzso from the zzso initiation site, greatly decreased the zzso of initiation of zzso In zzso experiments, the region containing this sequence was protected by the Ada protein and base changes within this sequence led to failure of binding of Ada protein to the zzso It is likely that the Ada protein recognizes the zzso sequence in the zzso promoter and binds to the region containing the zzso thereby allowing ready access of zzso zzso to the zzso There are considerable differences between the mechanisms of action of Ada protein on the promoters of zzso and zzso even though the expression of both genes is positively regulated by Ada zzso
