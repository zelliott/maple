We have measured the membrane binding affinities of zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2 to zzso of varying zzso composition using zzso zzso Our studies show that these proteins bind with affinities of zzso M, with a small dependence on zzso zzso zzso was relatively insensitive to the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso major zzso zzso zzso zzso as well as the presence of zzso which is required for zzso The presence of zzso zzso gamma zzso alpha 11 zzso of zzso zzso zzso binding proteins zzso zzso did not alter the membrane binding affinity of zzso zzso zzso 1, even though alpha 11 is a potent zzso of this zzso Similarly, the presence of zzso beta gamma zzso of G proteins did not alter the membrane association of zzso zzso zzso 2 even though these zzso strongly activate this zzso These results argue against a recruitment model for zzso zzso by G zzso zzso charged zzso zzso or zzso and suggest that zzso occurs through association of the zzso zzso
