Late zzso abundant zzso proteins are members of a large group of zzso zzso proteins found in plants, algae, zzso and bacteria known collectively as zzso that are zzso expressed in response to zzso or zzso zzso Group 2 zzso zzso or responsive to zzso zzso proteins are zzso to stabilize zzso against damage by zzso dehydration, zzso or zzso zzso However, the structural and zzso properties of group 2 zzso proteins that account for such functions remain zzso We have analyzed the structural properties of a zzso form of a soybean zzso zzso group 2 zzso zzso zzso scanning zzso of zzso zzso demonstrated that the protein does not display a cooperative unfolding transition upon zzso zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso revealed that the protein is in a largely hydrated and zzso zzso in zzso However, ultraviolet zzso and circular zzso zzso collected at different temperatures showed that the protein exists in equilibrium between two extended zzso zzso zzso and left-handed extended zzso or zzso zzso II zzso It is estimated that zzso of the zzso of zzso adopt or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 12 degrees zzso The content of extended zzso gradually decreases to zzso as the temperature is increased to 80 degrees zzso Studies of the zzso of the protein in solution in the presence of zzso zzso and sodium zzso zzso indicated that zzso has a very low intrinsic ability to adopt zzso structure and to interact with zzso zzso through zzso zzso The ability of the protein to remain in a highly extended zzso at low temperatures could constitute the basis of the functional role of zzso in the prevention of zzso zzso zzso or zzso stress-related damage to zzso zzso
