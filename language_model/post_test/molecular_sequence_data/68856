zzso zzso from zzso zzso is a zzso zzso which displays zzso zzso with respect to the binding of both zzso and zzso The binding of both zzso follows zzso zzso zzso of zzso 233 to zzso zzso decreases the affinity of the active zzso for zzso at both zzso and zzso zzso zzso (from the Hill plot, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at 50 zzso zzso In addition, this zzso displays zzso zzso zzso of positive zzso with respect to the binding of zzso These two effects can be reversed by the addition of zzso zzso m final zzso or by a second zzso zzso at either position zzso or zzso The effect of either zzso or second site zzso is to increase the binding affinity of the zzso zzso for zzso zzso values are 22 zzso for the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso M zzso zzso zzso for the zzso zzso and zzso zzso for the zzso zzso With the restoration of the tight binding of zzso zzso zzso are restored since the kinetic analysis of zzso zzso formation involves only binding of zzso to the active zzso It is likely that the physical mechanism for the positive zzso present in the zzso zzso actually exists in the zzso zzso but is not observed zzso due to the initial binding of zzso to the active zzso These results indicate that, in some cases, a decrease in zzso affinity is sufficient to introduce zzso into a zzso zzso
