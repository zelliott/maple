zzso zzso from rat liver exists as large molecular weight zzso composed of at least three different zzso Cloning of zzso for the zzso zzso revealed the presence of two highly zzso zzso of 34 zzso designated as zzso I and zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed zzso expression of the two zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli and studies on the zzso zzso showed differences in sensitivity to zzso by zzso and zzso and to heat zzso The rat gene for zzso I has 22 zzso and is split into 7 zzso zzso for human zzso were also zzso Human genes for zzso I and zzso II are localized at different regions on the zzso and their promoter regions were zzso Another zzso zzso zzso protein of 39 zzso zzso was cloned from zzso library of the rat zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso is remarkably similar to those of zzso I and zzso zzso Evidence indicated molecular interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso and an zzso effect of zzso on the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene is zzso like the zzso zzso indicating that the composition of zzso zzso may differ with the zzso hence properties of the zzso would zzso Further studies on these components and their interaction are expected to reveal various mechanisms governing zzso zzso zzso
