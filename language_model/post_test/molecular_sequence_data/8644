zzso cells are zzso zzso zzso cells that have been used to model the zzso zzso response to zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso of coding sequence and zzso zzso of zzso region was cloned and zzso zzso derived from both zzso and rat zzso zzso were used to characterize the expression of putative zzso zzso in zzso zzso Two larger putative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso were resolved and a smaller zzso species was also zzso The level of the zzso zzso is zzso in freshly split zzso cells and increases as the cells reach zzso In contrast, the amount of the zzso zzso zzso is greatest in freshly split cells and decreases gradually as the cells approach zzso The levels of the zzso and zzso zzso are also affected by zzso the cells, and the zzso zzso accumulates to high levels if cells are retained in the same media for 4 zzso Exposure to zzso media had little or no effect on the levels of zzso zzso expressed in zzso or zzso cells, zzso in growing and zzso cells, this treatment did affect the level of the zzso zzso Thus the putative zzso zzso species are zzso zzso Given this complexity, a careful assessment of zzso zzso species, of zzso zzso and of growth conditions are essential for a meaningful analysis of zzso zzso levels in cultured zzso
