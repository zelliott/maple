A zzso zzso zzso zzso alcohol zzso zzso was zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso Although zzso zzso belongs to a group of zzso the characteristics of its zzso were similar to the zzso characteristics of the typical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from the group of zzso The zzso zzso was zzso from the zzso and zzso after zzso zzso and affinity zzso with specific activity of zzso The zzso zzso was estimated to be composed of two zzso of zzso 72 and zzso as judged by zzso gel zzso The zzso zzso had maximum activity at zzso and showed the highest zzso specificity to ethanol, zzso alcohol, zzso and zzso The deduced sequences of cloned genes zzso and zzso zzso zzso I and II of zzso showed zzso zzso acid zzso identity to zzso and zzso AA identity to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Because of the high similarity between genes zzso zzso I and II of zzso and its zzso genes found in a zzso related zzso group of zzso acid bacteria, the results suggest the possibility of horizontal gene transfer between these two groups of zzso
