We describe the cloning and analysis of zzso and zzso copies of a gene from sea zzso that encodes a new member of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso shows similarity to previously described receptors for zzso zzso such as zzso zzso and zzso as well as a variety of small zzso zzso and zzso although we have been unable to determine which zzso is the natural zzso zzso generated against the zzso zzso protein identify a single protein with a molecular weight of 66 zzso in membrane zzso zzso studies using the same zzso have enabled zzso of the zzso in the nervous zzso Western zzso and zzso analysis reveal that a zzso of this zzso is expressed in zzso and soft zzso We suggest that the zzso plays a role in zzso in the sea zzso and other members of the zzso zzso
