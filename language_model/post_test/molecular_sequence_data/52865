We have characterized transcripts for nine major intrinsic proteins zzso some of which function as water channels zzso from the ice plant zzso zzso To determine the cellular distribution and expression of these zzso zzso zzso were generated against zzso zzso zzso or zzso which, according to sequence and functional zzso are located in the plasma membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso were most abundant in cells involved in bulk water flow and zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found in all cells, while signature cell types identified different zzso zzso predominantly in zzso cells, zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso and zzso of immature zzso zzso protein analysis confirmed zzso as zzso zzso zzso and zzso were found in zzso zzso and also in zzso distinct from either the zzso or zzso zzso was most abundant but not exclusive to PM zzso where it is expected based on its sequence zzso We suggest that within the cell, zzso are mobile, which is similar to zzso cycling through animal zzso zzso cycling and the differential regulation of these proteins observed under conditions of salt stress may be fundamental for the control of tissue water zzso
