zzso has properties of a zzso zzso zzso Although its mechanism of action is unknown, zzso has been implicated in transforming growth factor beta 1 zzso beta 1) signal zzso In an earlier study we decreased zzso zzso levels zzso to zzso by zzso zzso zzso in two zzso colon zzso zzso at different stages in tumor progression with different responses to zzso beta 1: the zzso zzso which shows zzso beta zzso growth arrest and zzso and the more zzso zzso zzso whose growth and invasion are zzso by zzso beta zzso Only zzso beta zzso responses in zzso cells were inhibited by zzso zzso zzso suggesting that zzso functions in only one zzso beta 1 signaling zzso In the current report we have extended this study to cell zzso zzso zzso was increased by zzso zzso zzso zzso which decrease zzso zzso levels, while zzso cell zzso was zzso decreased by zzso beta 1 which increases zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was not increased by basic zzso zzso beta 1 or zzso zzso while the zzso higher zzso zzso of zzso cells was zzso zzso by basic zzso zzso by zzso beta 1 and zzso by zzso zzso but not by scatter zzso zzso in zzso and response to zzso factors could not be ascribed to differences in either zzso levels of zzso or zzso of their levels by zzso beta zzso Both zzso and zzso cells displayed equal levels of zzso activity and zzso equal expression of the zzso inhibitor zzso and no zzso zzso by zzso No differential response to zzso beta 1 was seen in any of these zzso Thus limited cell zzso and lack of response to zzso factors in zzso colon cancer cells could be correlated with expression of zzso active in signal zzso
