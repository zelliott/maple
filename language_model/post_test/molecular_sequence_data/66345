In this study, the full zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso It is a circular DNA zzso of 73 242 zzso and contains 44 known genes zzso 18 proteins and 26 zzso zzso The zzso genes include 14 common zzso zzso one zzso small zzso protein 3 zzso one zzso zzso gene and two DNA zzso zzso In addition, one zzso and one DNA zzso genes were identified in a zzso zzso These two genes show relatively low similarities to their zzso in the zzso zzso but they are nearly identical to the known zzso zzso genes from another zzso zzso zzso This suggests that the zzso may mediate the horizontal gene transfer of the DNA and zzso zzso genes into zzso zzso and such a transfer may be an ancient zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso verified the traditional zzso of zzso zzso among zzso However, the zzso were observed in the zzso trees based on the six zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso and their zzso in other species, suggesting that these zzso zzso are foreign DNA sequences obtained through zzso In zzso this analysis provides valuable information towards the understanding of the evolution of zzso zzso
