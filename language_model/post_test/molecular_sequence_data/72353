zzso are thought to exert most of their beneficial effects in breast cancer by zzso the actions of zzso We report here that zzso also stimulate the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which may provide protective effects against the toxicity and zzso caused by zzso zzso is zzso by low zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso breast cancer cells, and this increase is suppressed by zzso via an zzso zzso Since regulation of the zzso zzso as well as other genes involved in zzso such as the zzso zzso Ya zzso zzso zzso zzso is known to be zzso by an zzso response element zzso we examined the effects of zzso on a zzso zzso responsive region derived from the zzso Ya zzso zzso of this zzso region into zzso breast cancer cells in the presence or absence of an expression zzso for the human zzso as well as zzso studies, revealed that the zzso construct was activated by zzso to the same extent as by zzso zzso a known zzso of zzso however, only the stimulation by zzso and not zzso required zzso and was zzso by zzso although zzso by both zzso mapped to the same zzso zzso consensus zzso Thus, there appear to be two pathways for zzso zzso one that is activated by zzso zzso such as zzso and is zzso independent, and a second that is zzso regulated and zzso zzso both pathways act through the zzso The zzso action of zzso may thus derive not only from the already well-known repression of zzso activities but also from the zzso of detoxifying zzso such as zzso that may contribute to the beneficial zzso activity of zzso
