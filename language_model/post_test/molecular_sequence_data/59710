The sex zzso of zzso zzso are unusually large compared to those of other zzso zzso about zzso of the zzso and containing substantial amounts of zzso zzso Previous studies have described two highly repeated DNA families zzso and zzso that zzso to this zzso zzso 1992, zzso The present report describes a third satellite DNA family zzso zzso in zzso zzso that is also located in the sex zzso This repeat consists of zzso copies zzso similarity zzso zzso of a zzso repeated zzso Southern zzso of zzso revealed that although some higher order zzso zzso repeats do exist, none has spread throughout an appreciable portion of the zzso zzso field gel experiments indicated that most of the larger zzso zzso zzso of all three satellite families are distributed across numerous size classes, suggesting that the three repeats are zzso with one another in this zzso Analysis of a boundary between zzso and zzso showed that the junction zzso of each satellite are intact and that a zzso has apparently been transferred from zzso to zzso via zzso zzso comparisons of zzso with another zzso satellite and with the zzso region of the zzso zzso virus zzso long terminal repeat identified zzso repeats and similarities with viral zzso zzso in the zzso zzso Additionally, the zzso consensus was found to be similar to the R region of zzso suggesting a zzso zzso for these zzso repeated DNA zzso
