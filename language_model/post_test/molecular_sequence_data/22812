The generation of a comprehensive zzso library and the sequencing of its zzso set the stage for reverse zzso approaches in zzso zzso However, these also require tools for the specific zzso of target gene zzso zzso a large number of diverse zzso were developed aimed at reducing target gene expression in zzso via the stable expression of zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso generated by the zzso of zzso and sense zzso or by hairpin formation of an zzso zzso feeds into the zzso zzso zzso In this pathway, zzso is zzso into approximately zzso small interfering zzso zzso by the zzso zzso One of the two complementary strands of a zzso is then loaded onto an zzso protein present as core component within larger zzso zzso by this zzso zzso the zzso protein either detects zzso transcripts and zzso these zzso or zzso zzso gene zzso This article summarizes current information derived mainly from the zzso zzso project on components that are assumed to be involved in zzso zzso mechanisms in zzso Furthermore, all approaches employed in zzso to date to zzso target gene expression by zzso or zzso repeat zzso are reviewed and discussed zzso
