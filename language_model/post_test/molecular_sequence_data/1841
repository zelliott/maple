The crystal structures of zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso have been solved and compared with that from the zzso zzso zzso This is the first example we know of where a trio of protein structures has been solved that have the same number of zzso acids and a high level of identity zzso and yet come from organisms with different operating zzso The zzso were characterized for their own zzso zzso and zzso and they exhibited the same temperature preferences as their source zzso The structures of the three highly zzso dynamic proteins with different zzso profiles provide an opportunity to explore a molecular mechanism of cold and heat zzso Their analysis suggests that the maintenance of the balance between stability and flexibility is crucial for proteins to function at their environmental temperatures, and it is achieved by the modification of zzso interactions in the process of temperature zzso
