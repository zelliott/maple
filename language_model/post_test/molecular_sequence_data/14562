The zinc finger protein zzso 2, zzso has been implicated in female mouse infertility, because an zzso zzso zzso zzso leads to zzso stage arrest of zzso derived from the zzso zzso female zzso zzso is a member of the zzso zzso family of zzso tandem zinc finger proteins that can bind to transcripts containing zzso elements zzso resulting in zzso and zzso of these zzso I show here that the mouse zzso is composed of two zzso and a single zzso zzso a zzso of 484 zzso zzso I observed that zzso protein is similar to both zzso zzso and zzso zzso in that it zzso between the zzso and nucleus, binds to zzso containing zzso and promotes zzso of a model ARE transcript in a zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso and protein were rapidly zzso upon zzso exposure in bone zzso zzso The zzso protein was substantially more resistant to zzso zzso than the zzso I zzso that the embryonic arrest linked to the zzso zzso might be related to its resistance to zzso zzso
