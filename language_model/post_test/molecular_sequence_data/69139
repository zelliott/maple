The zzso group zzso proteins are responsible for keeping zzso regulators, like zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso during zzso zzso Several similarities to a protein class involved in zzso formation suggest that the zzso exerts its function at the higher order zzso zzso Here we have mapped the distribution of the zzso protein in the zzso zzso complex zzso of zzso tissue culture zzso We have elaborated a method, based on the in zzso zzso zzso technique, that allows a substantial enrichment for zzso sites by zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso zzso We find that the zzso protein zzso covers large regulatory regions of zzso zzso zzso zzso we find that the zzso gene is active in these cells and the region devoid of any bound zzso zzso
