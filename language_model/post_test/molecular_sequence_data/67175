zzso domain zzso 2 zzso is a kind of protein zzso zzso associated with cell proliferation and tumor zzso and zzso identified as a zzso for zzso zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso and zzso expression in cellular zzso To investigate the roles of zzso in destruction of cartilage in zzso arthritis zzso and tumor zzso we tried to express zzso domain of zzso fused with a His tag to increase protein zzso and facilitate zzso (without signal zzso and zzso domain, designated zzso in zzso zzso purify the expressed zzso and characterize its function, for purpose of future application as a specific zzso zzso Two clones of relative high expression of zzso were zzso After zzso by a zzso zzso zzso zzso column, soluble fused zzso over zzso purity were zzso Competitive binding zzso zzso demonstrated that expressed zzso could block the binding of zzso and natural zzso receptors on zzso and zzso cell zzso zzso of zzso Western zzso and zzso zzso showed that zzso was capable of zzso zzso and zzso zzso from zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso by collagen zzso For zzso the zzso effect was displayed at the levels of zzso and zzso whereas for zzso it was demonstrated at the level of protein zzso zzso All these findings suggested that the fused expressed zzso inhibited the activity of natural zzso and relevant zzso and zzso expression in zzso and zzso cells provoked by collagen zzso
