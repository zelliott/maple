The zzso toes zzso mouse zzso was created by zzso zzso resulting in the deletion of several hundred zzso of zzso sequences of mouse zzso zzso zzso Mice zzso for the zzso zzso are characterized by partial zzso of forelimbs and massive zzso zzso indicating that programmed cell death is zzso zzso zzso zzso die at zzso and show severe zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, establishment of zzso asymmetry is zzso Here we report on the zzso cloning of a novel gene by zzso trap analysis of a zzso clone zzso zzso sequences corresponding to parts of the deletion in zzso zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that the newly identified zzso zzso zzso is expressed throughout embryonic zzso Wide expression was also found in zzso of adult zzso We show that expression of zzso is completely absent in mouse embryonic zzso zzso for the zzso zzso In addition, we isolated the full-length zzso which encodes a putative zzso protein showing no similarities to known proteins or protein zzso The expression data of zzso define it as a candidate gene involved in processes such as programmed cell death, zzso development, and establishment of zzso zzso
