The sense of taste plays an important role in the evaluation of the zzso composition of consumed zzso zzso taste in particular is believed to serve a warning function against the zzso of poisonous zzso In the past years enormous progress was made in the characterization of bitter taste zzso including their gene expression patterns, pharmacological features and presumed zzso roles in zzso as well as in zzso zzso However, due to a lack in zzso zzso the zzso of zzso proteins within zzso zzso has never been zzso In the present study we have screened a panel of commercially available zzso raised against human bitter taste receptors by zzso zzso One of these zzso was found to be highly specific for the human bitter taste zzso zzso We further demonstrate that this zzso is able to detect zzso expressed zzso protein on Western zzso The zzso is, however, not able to interfere significantly with zzso function in cell based calcium imaging zzso Most importantly, we were able to demonstrate the presence of zzso protein in human zzso zzso Using double zzso we show that zzso cells form a zzso of zzso expressing zzso On a zzso level the zzso of this bitter taste zzso is neither restricted to the cell surface nor particularly enriched at the level of the zzso protruding into the pore region of the taste zzso but rather evenly distributed over the entire cell zzso
