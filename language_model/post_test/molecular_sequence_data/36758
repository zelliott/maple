zzso 8 of zzso zzso zzso zzso is a small zzso component of the zzso zzso zzso zzso relations in zzso 8 were studied by focusing on three structural zzso a highly zzso zzso region, a central zzso region zzso suggested to be a zzso zzso and a zzso region bearing a zzso array of three positively charged zzso A combined approach was used, which encompasses zzso zzso in zzso import and assembly tests, and an in zzso zzso expression system zzso host cells unable to zzso zzso 8 in zzso The results indicate that the zzso region of zzso 8 is involved functionally in the zzso zzso As the central zzso region can functionally tolerate the introduction of zzso positively charged zzso (which zzso the zzso zzso characteristics of the entire zzso the role of this zzso region as a zzso stem is brought into zzso Each of the three positively charged zzso toward the zzso of zzso 8 is required for the efficient assembly of this zzso into the zzso zzso zzso of the more zzso charged zzso zzso or zzso has a more severe impact on zzso 8 assembly than does removal of the most zzso zzso zzso in terms of both in zzso import and assembly as well as the ability of the zzso 8 zzso to function in zzso zzso zzso in zzso
