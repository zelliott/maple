zzso zzso recognize the major groove of the DNA double zzso at zzso sequences by forming local triple zzso The zzso is bound parallel to the zzso strand of the zzso This binding can be revealed by a zzso technique using zzso as a zzso zzso zzso binding in the major groove prevents zzso by zzso The zzso patterns on opposite strands of the duplex at the boundaries of the triple zzso are zzso They are shifted to the zzso indicating that the zzso zzso binds in the minor groove of the duplex zzso zzso of the zzso at the junction between the triple and the double zzso is not zzso on the zzso of the bound zzso zzso In contrast, a strong enhancement of zzso is observed on the zzso strand at the zzso junction on the zzso of the zzso zzso
