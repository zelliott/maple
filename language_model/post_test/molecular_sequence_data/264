A zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from fresh water of a slightly alkaline lake, zzso Lake, in zzso zzso China, and its zzso position was studied by using a zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and positive for zzso and zzso It grew at zzso degrees C zzso 30 degrees zzso and pH zzso zzso pH zzso and in the presence of 0-3 % zzso zzso It formed zzso smooth and circular zzso 1-2 zzso in diameter, on zzso zzso plates after incubation at 30 degrees C for 3 zzso zzso of strain zzso were zzso zzso zzso wide and zzso zzso zzso The major fatty acids zzso zzso were zzso : zzso zzso zzso and summed feature 3 zzso : zzso and/or zzso : zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was zzso The DNA zzso content was 43 zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that strain zzso was zzso related to members of the zzso zzso with sequence similarities of zzso zzso the highest sequence similarity being to the sequence from zzso zzso zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso data, strain zzso was considered to represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
