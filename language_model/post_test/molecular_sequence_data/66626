In most organisms, zzso zzso zzso zzso is present as zzso and zzso with the latter zzso under zzso zzso An absolutely zzso zzso zzso zzso in chicken zzso zzso appears to play a key role in zzso zzso Recently, it has been shown that the sponge zzso zzso a member of the most ancient group of living zzso animals, expresses an zzso zzso zzso that lacks this absolutely zzso zzso zzso instead possessing a zzso in this zzso In the present study we confirm that the absolutely zzso zzso zzso is lacking in other sponge zzso where it is instead zzso by zzso or zzso Site directed zzso of the zzso in expression zzso of chicken zzso zzso and the zzso zzso from the marine zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso structure producing only zzso A zzso zzso in an expression construct of the zzso zzso construct failed to produce zzso zzso and zzso zzso also yielded zzso These results, in conjunction with analysis of zzso models of zzso and zzso zzso strongly support the view that while the absolutely zzso zzso zzso is important in zzso stability, zzso formation involves a complex suite of interactions between a variety of zzso
