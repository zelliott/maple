zzso of zzso peptides to zzso at the cell surface first requires assembly of zzso class I with zzso and beta zzso in the zzso zzso This process involves an assembly complex of several zzso including zzso zzso and zzso all of which associate specifically with the beta zzso open form of the class I heavy zzso To better comprehend at a molecular level the regulation of class I zzso we have assessed the influence of multiple individual zzso acid zzso in the zzso class I alpha 2 domain on interaction with zzso zzso and zzso In this report, we present evidence indicating that many zzso surrounding position zzso in zzso influence interaction with assembly complex zzso Most zzso decreased association, but one zzso strongly increased zzso The zzso zzso with the exception of zzso exhibited characteristics suggesting zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to the zzso of zzso expressed in a zzso cell zzso zzso zzso was less zzso zzso than zzso zzso which is consistent with its unusually strong association with the zzso zzso assembly zzso
