The zzso system was used to test for zzso interactions between the tobacco vein zzso virus zzso zzso zzso zzso (or zzso zzso and two other zzso zzso the zzso zzso which consists of zzso protein zzso and zzso zzso and the viral coat protein zzso Using this approach, we find that the zzso protein interacts with both the zzso protein and the zzso in zzso zzso Moreover, we find that a zzso in the zzso zzso domain of the zzso protein diminishes the zzso interaction but not the zzso zzso Likewise, zzso in the vicinity of the zzso protein to which the zzso zzso is zzso attached eliminate the zzso zzso We conclude that the zzso protein interacts with the zzso domain of the zzso protein and that this interaction requires a functional zzso attachment zzso This interaction may be important for the initiation of viral zzso synthesis in infected zzso We also conclude that the zzso interacts with the zzso in a manner that is sensitive in changes in the highly zzso zzso zzso The role of this interaction in the functioning of the zzso protein or the zzso is zzso but may involve regulation of viral zzso synthesis in infected zzso
