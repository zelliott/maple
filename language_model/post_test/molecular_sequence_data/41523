zzso are present both in zzso and eggs in zzso and have been associated with different zzso steps as zzso zzso egg coat zzso and zzso zzso In this zzso we have analyzed the activity of different zzso of zzso zzso zzso The main activity corresponded to zzso zzso which was reported to participate both in zzso binding and zzso prevention among zzso distant zzso We have raised zzso zzso against a zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and characterized zzso zzso both by Western zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was mainly localized to the zzso of animal zzso of zzso zzso and zzso eggs, and remained zzso after zzso zzso is constituted by different pair arrangements of two zzso zzso and zzso giving rise to three possible zzso zzso A zzso B zzso and S zzso However, no information was available regarding molecular identity of zzso in zzso We present for the first time the primary sequences of two zzso of zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, our results suggest that zzso and zzso zzso that constitute zzso zzso could be zzso from a same gene in zzso by alternative zzso zzso This finding denotes an evolutionary divergence with zzso where zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso from different genes on different zzso
