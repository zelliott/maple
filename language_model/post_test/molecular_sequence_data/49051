The zzso ROOTS AND zzso zzso gene is single copy in the zzso zzso and based on overall zzso acid similarity and conservation of functional zzso the zzso protein is zzso with zzso zzso zzso associates with zzso a zzso complex that binds the zzso zzso II zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso locus caused defective organ formation indicative of zzso shoot, zzso zzso and root zzso zzso is a putative zzso binding zzso in addition, zzso binding activity was demonstrated in zzso for the C zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and genetic data position zzso relative to regulatory zzso for leaf development, in which it acts zzso We identified zzso zzso for the six zzso components and zzso that zzso regulates zzso zzso through a putative plant zzso zzso of the zzso transcript in the strong zzso zzso supports this zzso
