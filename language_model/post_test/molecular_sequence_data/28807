The stability of zzso during the zzso is regulated by a number of cellular factors, some of which stabilize zzso and others that promote zzso zzso is a zzso protein that zzso zzso zzso and is required for zzso zzso zzso We have examined the binding and zzso effects of zzso on different zzso zzso in order to learn about its mechanism of zzso zzso zzso zzso characterized by an zzso zzso arrangement, are zzso by zzso indicating that this zzso acts on a single zzso zzso rings, which zzso to the low-energy state of zzso are stable only under conditions that inhibit zzso zzso activity, but can be stabilized by zzso bound to zzso zzso zzso made of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso are resistant to zzso zzso suggesting that the interaction of the zzso tail of zzso with basic zzso in zzso unique to zzso I proteins is required for zzso
