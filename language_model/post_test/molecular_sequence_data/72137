zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso the zzso of zzso to zzso and zzso In zzso animals zzso is the final zzso of the zzso cycle, but in many species it has a wider role controlling the use of zzso for other zzso purposes, including the production of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso activity is regulated by various small zzso including the product zzso The aim of these structural studies was to test aspects of the zzso mechanism and to investigate the structural basis of zzso zzso 

We report here the crystal structures of zzso from zzso zzso at pH zzso and pH zzso and of zzso complexes of the zzso with zzso zzso and zzso at pH zzso The zzso zzso comprises a single compact zzso domain that further associates into a zzso zzso zzso The zzso complexes reveal a common mode of zzso zzso which places the zzso adjacent to the zzso zzso We also observe a zzso change that impacts on the active site and is coupled with the occupancy of an external site by zzso or zzso 

The structures reported here clarify aspects of the active site and indicate key features of the zzso zzso including zzso coordination to one of the zzso zzso and an zzso role for a neighboring zzso zzso zzso for zzso acids is found to depend on their precise recognition at the zzso zzso Identification of a second zzso site, remote from the active site, and associated zzso changes lead us to propose a regulatory role for this site in zzso zzso
