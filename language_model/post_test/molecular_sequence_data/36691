We have developed an zzso method for the incorporation of the zzso zzso on the zzso group of a zzso zzso within a zzso chain in a zzso zzso Using zzso chemistry for the solid phase synthesis approach and a base zzso acid stable protecting group zzso for the zzso group of the target zzso we prepared fully protected zzso bound peptides which are zzso zzso Following zzso zzso the uniquely zzso peptides were obtained in a high degree of zzso Using this approach, a number of zzso derivatives of a zzso zzso analog were zzso zzso of selected zzso zzso of high affinity zzso led to the preparation of the zzso zzso analog containing zzso at zzso This zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso has zzso higher affinity for the ETA zzso than the commercially available N zzso zzso The general utility of this zzso methodology was demonstrated by the synthesis of a zzso zzso zzso analog which contained several side chain zzso zzso acid zzso in its zzso The synthetic method reported here is zzso in that it allows the facile variation of the length of the zzso and also offers the potential to introduce in a site specific manner other groups such as affinity labels and fluorescent zzso
