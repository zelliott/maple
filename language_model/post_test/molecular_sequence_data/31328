Various approaches have been developed to study how zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso affect the function of the zzso Most of them are in zzso approaches, where zzso are introduced in a specialized zzso harboring the zzso zzso zzso The zzso plasmids are then expressed in an appropriate host, where they can zzso resistance to antibiotics whose target is the zzso zzso can be used where the host zzso zzso genes or the host zzso are selectively zzso and the effect of the zzso on zzso assembly and function can be zzso Another approach, which has been developed mainly with zzso zzso zzso can be used entirely in zzso In this approach, a zzso has been constructed which contains the zzso zzso zzso gene under control of a zzso zzso zzso can be introduced in the zzso zzso zzso sequence and the zzso zzso zzso zzso are produced by in zzso zzso It is then possible to investigate how the zzso affect the assembly of the zzso zzso zzso into zzso zzso and the activity of the zzso zzso zzso in zzso protein synthesis zzso Although these approaches are recent, they have already provided a large body of interesting information, relating specific zzso sequences to interactions with zzso zzso to zzso function, and to its response to zzso
