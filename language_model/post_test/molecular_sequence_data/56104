In this paper we report partial zzso acid sequence for zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence of isolated zzso and the sequences of peptides obtained by zzso zzso show a high degree of similarity to the zzso zzso acid sequence of a human protein which was initially reported as a component of zzso and subsequently as zzso This sequence in turn shows zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso melanoma zzso A component of approximately zzso zzso isolated from human zzso was found to have identical mobility on zzso to zzso and identical zzso zzso but a different overall zzso Human zzso from zzso syndrome patients did not recognize zzso but showed positive reaction with the zzso zzso zzso component from zzso zzso zzso against zzso zzso in contrast, recognized both zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso component thus has an identical zzso sequence to zzso and to the reported zzso zzso and is recognized by zzso in zzso syndrome zzso The data obtained indicate that zzso and the reported zzso component are similar but not identical zzso which belong to the same protein zzso
