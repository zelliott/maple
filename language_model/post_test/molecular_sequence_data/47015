A zzso regulated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from zzso mouse zzso using a fluorescent differential display zzso The strongest expression of zzso was detected in the zzso zzso cells at approximately zzso day zzso zzso was enriched in the zzso density zzso and its zzso was concentrated at zzso of the inner zzso layer when active zzso zzso zzso protein could be divided into two functional zzso the zzso portion, which was highly zzso among zzso family zzso and the zzso portion, which consisted of a putative zzso structure, including several zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso of zzso which was able to associate with zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso also zzso with zzso in zzso In keeping with this, zzso zzso zzso with zzso in cultured zzso zzso cells, and a zzso complex was zzso from crude zzso zzso using an zzso zzso On the other hand, the zzso portion of zzso bound to zzso a member of zzso family small zzso in a zzso manner in zzso and zzso functionally zzso with zzso in a zzso expression zzso Together, our findings indicate that zzso may serve as a zzso scaffold protein that links zzso signaling with zzso zzso and zzso family zzso perhaps during the dynamic phase of zzso changes that occur during zzso formation in zzso zzso zzso
