zzso underlying the specificity and efficiency of zzso which modify zzso zzso especially with the variable requirements of synthesis in the zzso zzso pathway, are poorly zzso Here, we examine the process of zzso zzso in individually identifiable zzso zzso that zzso multiple zzso yielding complex zzso of structurally diverse zzso zzso The zzso of these zzso zzso is efficiently controlled by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which contains four different copies of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and a single zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso this zzso is converted to yield a mixture of zzso zzso In zzso each zzso displays a unique combination of zzso affinity and reaction zzso depending on the penultimate zzso of the zzso This suggests that the different zzso are generated in order to efficiently zzso the many zzso zzso that are present in zzso zzso The cellular expression of the zzso gene is restricted to zzso that zzso zzso zzso which underscores the critical importance of regulation of zzso zzso
