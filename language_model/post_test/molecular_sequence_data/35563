We describe methods to improve the properties of zzso zzso zzso zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso envelope zzso zzso for use in structural studies and as zzso In the absence of zzso detergents, zzso of the zzso zzso terminating at zzso zzso in zzso zzso has a tendency to form zzso complexes or zzso which is particularly zzso for zzso zzso We found that this zzso in the absence of zzso does not involve the zzso zzso or zzso variable regions of zzso Moreover, we observed that zzso forms zzso around the zzso external region zzso of the zzso zzso zzso whereas deletion of most of the zzso zzso by terminating the zzso at zzso zzso zzso prevented the zzso that otherwise occurs in zzso in the absence of zzso Although the zzso can contribute to zzso formation, zzso of most of it only modestly reduced zzso and lacked global adverse effects on zzso Thus, the zzso deletion minimally influenced the zzso of the binding of soluble zzso and a zzso site zzso to immobilized zzso as detected by surface zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso deletion did not alter the overall three-dimensional structure of the zzso as viewed by zzso electron zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are therefore useful for zzso and structural zzso
