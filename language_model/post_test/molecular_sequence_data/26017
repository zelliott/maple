zzso A rat zzso H zzso was isolated from a rat liver zzso library with synthetic zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis indicated that it codes for rat zzso zzso zzso Using this clone together with the zzso for zzso B, D, L and S as zzso the expression of five major zzso zzso was investigated in ten different normal rat zzso and in a rat zzso zzso The common feature of their expression is that the five zzso have relatively high zzso levels in lung and zzso suggesting that they all play important roles in zzso engaged in active protein zzso zzso In other zzso the zzso of the five zzso zzso are significantly zzso This may indicate that their expressions are zzso regulated and that they may have specialized functions in specific zzso zzso The zzso B zzso level is at least zzso higher in the rat zzso than in any of the normal rat zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso levels for the other four zzso show no comparable zzso zzso This finding is consistent with previous observations reporting a correlation between zzso B expression and zzso zzso
