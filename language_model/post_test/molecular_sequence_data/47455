zzso zzso zzso play a crucial role in the control of active sex steroid zzso zzso Seven types of zzso have been zzso In this study, we report the cloning and characterization of the mouse type 5 zzso belonging to the zzso zzso zzso in contrast with types 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 7 zzso which belong to the zzso alcohol zzso zzso The gene spans 16 zzso and contains 9 zzso separated by 8 zzso zzso extension analysis identified a major zzso start site beginning 50 zzso upstream from the zzso initiation zzso Northern zzso analysis showed a high zzso expression level in the liver and a weaker signal in the zzso To determine more precisely the zzso specificity of the zzso we established a stable cell line expressing mouse type 5 zzso in transformed human embryonic kidney zzso zzso The zzso cell line zzso zzso the transformation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso into testosterone zzso and zzso zzso zzso This data is somewhat in contradiction with a previous study that described the zzso as zzso zzso Our results indicate that the rate of transformation of zzso zzso to zzso zzso represents only zzso of the rate of transformation of zzso to zzso Mouse type 5 zzso shares zzso zzso acid sequence identity with human type 5 zzso zzso zzso zzso with rat zzso and human types 1 and 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso with zzso rat and human zzso zzso
