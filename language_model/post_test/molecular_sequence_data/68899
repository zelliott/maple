zzso zzso usually contain multiple molecular forms of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso induce a wide range of pharmacological effects which may depend or not on the zzso of zzso In this study, a zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso by gel zzso on a zzso zzso column, followed by zzso zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso column zzso zzso of zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso was determined by indirect zzso using zzso egg zzso zzso as zzso The zzso is an zzso protein with zzso zzso and an apparent molecular weight of zzso as estimated by gel zzso on a zzso 12 zzso zzso Similar properties have been described for zzso from other snake zzso The zzso of the zzso protein was zzso These partial sequence data show a high degree of zzso between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso from other snake zzso as well as bovine pancreatic zzso
