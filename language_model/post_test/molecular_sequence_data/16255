zzso zzso is derived from a zzso precursor zzso Although the zzso acid sequences specifying the signal zzso and pancreatic zzso are well zzso between the rat and the human, the zzso zzso acid sequences of the precursors are highly zzso To better understand the molecular basis of the divergence between the rat and human zzso zzso we have determined the zzso sequence of the rat pancreatic zzso zzso A comparison between the primary structures of the rat and human genes reveals that the zzso of the zzso peptides can be explained in large part by a zzso zzso and the zzso of an alternative zzso donor site in the third zzso of the rat zzso As a consequence of the displaced zzso site, part of the third zzso of the rate gene is zzso to the sequence in the third zzso of the human zzso Our results suggest that the rat and human pancreatic zzso genes arose from a common ancestral zzso and that differences in the zzso zzso of the precursor reflect less strict evolutionary constraints than those imposed upon the zzso zzso of the zzso
