A zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying genes for zzso zzso was cloned from zzso DNA of zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis revealed the presence of an open reading frame which was identified by data base searches and comparison with the zzso derived zzso zzso acid sequence to code for zzso c of zzso zzso A comparison of the primary sequences of the two well established zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso indicates the length of the zzso as well as specific zzso located in the zzso membrane to be important for zzso zzso
