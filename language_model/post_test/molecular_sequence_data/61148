The zzso acid sequence predicted from a rat liver zzso library indicated that the precursor of zzso I zzso zzso zzso zzso consists of a mature zzso of zzso zzso acid zzso and a zzso acid terminal segment, with zzso acids attributed to the leader zzso However, the mass of zzso I from rat brain was larger than that from rat liver and zzso as assessed by zzso analysis, mass zzso and zzso zzso The mature form of zzso I from the brain had an zzso zzso on the zzso of the liver mature zzso zzso Brain zzso I was zzso to liver zzso I when incubated with fresh zzso extract from rat zzso These results imply that mature rat liver zzso I is zzso zzso in two zzso The first zzso of the motif zzso downward zzso is performed by a zzso processing zzso yielding an zzso protein which is the mature brain zzso zzso The second zzso which generates the mature liver zzso I, is also carried out by a zzso zzso The second zzso is active in liver but lacking in zzso
