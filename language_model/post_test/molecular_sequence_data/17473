zzso of the zzso zzso will result in zzso fragments in which the zzso zzso is zzso We have employed a molecular sieve (2 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment sequence which permits concurrent measurement of zzso zzso and several zzso zzso peptides in a single zzso Using this zzso the release of zzso and zzso zzso zzso greater and less than 2 zzso from spinal zzso and the zzso zzso zzso was assessed under resting conditions and during stimulation of the zzso nerve in the zzso zzso zzso Under resting conditions measurable levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are found in zzso and spinal zzso zzso The zzso measured under resting and evoked conditions in zzso and spinal zzso is associated almost exclusively zzso than zzso with fragments greater than 2 zzso in zzso There results, showing the relative absence of zzso levels of zzso forms greater than 2 zzso were confirmed by reverse phase zzso During zzso nerve zzso the levels of both zzso and zzso were mildly elevated in spinal and zzso zzso With the addition of zzso zzso zzso though there was no effect on the resting release of either zzso or zzso the levels of zzso measured under evoked conditions were significantly zzso in both zzso and spinal zzso
