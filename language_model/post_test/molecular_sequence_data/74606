zzso zzso zzso zzso factors are critical components of the lateral zzso machinery that mediates zzso cell patterning in zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso using the zzso program reveals that there are a total of six zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of TRY and zzso 1, 2, and 3 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso factors that are approximately 50% identical to one another at the zzso acid zzso Previous studies indicate that these zzso zzso zzso regulate zzso cell zzso However, each of the previous studies of these zzso zzso zzso has been limited to an analysis of only a subset of these six zzso and zzso they have limited their attention to zzso development in only one or two of the zzso In addition, the zzso regulation of these zzso zzso zzso genes remains largely zzso 

By analyzing multiple zzso lines, we report here that zzso functions zzso with other zzso zzso zzso zzso factors to control both leaf zzso and root hair zzso On the other hand, zzso and zzso participate in controlling zzso formation on zzso stems and zzso Further, we discovered that zzso zzso zzso suppress zzso formation on zzso and zzso zzso that normally do not bear any zzso By using zzso zzso zzso zzso we found that all zzso zzso zzso examined interact with zzso and that zzso or zzso and zzso or zzso are required and sufficient to activate the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso and zzso Furthermore, only zzso zzso was greatly reduced in the zzso zzso double zzso 

Our comprehensive analysis enables us to draw broader conclusions about the role of zzso zzso zzso gene family than were possible in the earlier studies, and reveals the genetic basis of zzso control of zzso zzso Our findings imply the presence of multiple mechanisms regulating the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and provide new insight into the lateral zzso mechanism that mediates zzso cell zzso
