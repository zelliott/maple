The zzso zzso zzso was previously suggested as a model for the zzso plant zzso We present here the zzso sequence and the derived gene organization of a small part of the zzso in this model zzso Two functional genes with the same zzso orientation were identified within the zzso zzso region zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso repeat zzso gene encodes a zzso with similarity to a repeated motif present in the zzso zzso light chain zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene are found primarily in roots and root zzso while transcripts of the zzso gene are found in roots, root zzso and zzso In the region between zzso and zzso the presence of a third zzso zzso was suggested by analysis with the zzso zzso recognition zzso zzso of the zzso gene a segment carrying two apparently zzso fragmented zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso zzso similarity to reverse zzso and zzso regions defined the defective zzso zzso and zzso within this zzso Terminal repeats were not found but three different sets of short direct repeats are located adjacent to the zzso zzso The three genes and the incomplete zzso occupy most of the zzso DNA, leaving approximately one-fifth of the zzso zzso without zzso zzso zzso
