zzso cells recognize and respond to zzso zzso minute zzso in the zzso zzso calcium concentration zzso but the mechanisms underlying this process have remained zzso Recently, we employed expression cloning in zzso zzso zzso to isolate a zzso coding for a zzso zzso from bovine zzso Like the native zzso the cloned zzso zzso stimulates zzso C zzso in a zzso manner with a nearly identical pharmacological zzso Its deduced zzso acid sequence confirms that it is a member of the zzso of zzso receptors zzso zzso for the zzso are expressed in zzso and other zzso that sense zzso zzso kidney and zzso zzso as well as those that have no known role in zzso zzso zzso such as the zzso The availability of the zzso clone for the zzso zzso made it possible to test the hypothesis that zzso in the gene zzso the human zzso of the zzso cause inherited disorders of mineral zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso severe zzso zzso are, in fact, caused by zzso that reduce the activity of the zzso when they are present in the zzso and zzso states, zzso In contrast, we have subsequently discovered a family in which a form of zzso dominant zzso results from an zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso therefore, permits zzso to play a zzso role as an zzso first zzso in addition to its well described role as an important zzso second zzso
