zzso acute regulatory protein zzso a zzso protein involved in the transport of cholesterol to inner zzso membrane during stimulation of steroid hormone zzso has recently been cloned from human zzso and zzso mouse zzso tumor zzso We examined the regulation of zzso zzso zzso upon induction of zzso in immortalized rat zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso DNA alone zzso with zzso DNA and zzso zzso zzso with zzso DNA, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso or with zzso zzso zzso or with the beta zzso zzso zzso beta zzso expression zzso zzso were cultured to zzso and then zzso for 24 h with zzso (4 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso (10 zzso or zzso zzso zzso By quantitative zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso cells zzso with zzso DNA alone, zzso either in the presence or in the absence of zzso In contrast, variable amount of the message was detected in all zzso cell lines zzso with zzso DNA and zzso Moreover, an increase in the zzso zzso expression was evident in all zzso cells upon stimulation with their respective zzso zzso with enhanced zzso zzso The zzso product was zzso and the zzso base pairs of rat zzso were found to be zzso and zzso identical to mouse and human zzso zzso The deduced 126 zzso acid sequence was zzso zzso and zzso identical to the zzso human and bovine deduced protein zzso We conclude that zzso message is expressed only in the zzso rat zzso cells and can be zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the appropriate cell zzso In addition, we find that the rat zzso zzso exhibit a high degree of zzso with the mouse and human zzso
