The emergence in zzso species of functional zzso devoid of light chains zzso to as zzso zzso or zzso is an intriguing evolutionary zzso zzso zzso have also been documented in spotted zzso ( zzso and nurse shark zzso To reveal the evolutionary history of zzso we evaluated the zzso and zzso relationships among zzso and conventional zzso across zzso and confirmed the current viewpoint that different groups of zzso have evolved independently in the three zzso At least, in the zzso zzso are not the result of resuscitation of dormant zzso They are derived from the conventional zzso within the zzso zzso and are apparently the outcome of more recent zzso changes occurring in the compartment of zzso zzso The shared structural properties of zzso across zzso are therefore explained by zzso evolution due to similar constraints related to the absence of pairing to the light zzso It appears that innovative evolutionary changes in zzso have led to a new level of zzso binding repertoire diversification and have allowed acquisition of novel zzso zzso
