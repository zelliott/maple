zzso zzso zzso is an ancient and highly zzso protein that functions in the first common step in zzso zzso The zzso protein sequence contains a unique metal switch region that has been zzso to dictate an exclusive zzso use of either zinc or zzso and perhaps also zzso In some zzso the zzso of the metal switch sequence zzso have been demonstrated to bind a zzso zzso and in other zzso the zzso acid zzso of the metal switch sequence zzso have been zzso to bind a zzso essential zzso and/or zzso The current work describes zzso proteins that contain the zzso sequences of pea zzso and zzso zzso zzso in place of the naturally occurring zzso sequence of human zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are substantially activated by both zzso and zzso but not by zzso The specific activities of the zzso are significantly lower than human zzso zzso kinetic and zzso data are presented for both zzso proteins and are discussed in terms of this unique zzso variation in metal zzso zzso The identity of a basic zzso which is zzso in human zzso strictly zzso with the presence or absence of the zzso zzso Those zzso with the zzso metal switch sequence contain zzso in the analogous zzso The zzso zzso was inserted into wild type and zzso human zzso and found to further reduce the activity of both, illustrating the subtle nature of the role of this zzso
