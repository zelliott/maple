zzso of the zzso pearl oyster shells is composed of zzso zzso and zzso organic zzso The relationship between the organic zzso and the mechanism of zzso formation currently constitutes the main focus regarding the zzso zzso In this study, we isolated a new zzso zzso protein in zzso zzso and zzso zzso we called zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso which is remarkably rich in zzso and which is specifically zzso in zzso the zzso cells of the mantle and in the zzso zzso The structure of this protein is drastically different from those of the other zzso proteins already zzso This unusual zzso protein is a new member in the growing list of low complexity domain containing proteins that are associated with zzso These observations offer new insights to the molecular mechanisms of zzso
