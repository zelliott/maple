zzso are a large family of zzso that have important zzso and cell signaling zzso Genes zzso two novel zzso zzso proteins were identified in the expressed sequence tag data base of the zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso agent of zzso The zzso proteins showed zzso activity in zzso with a variety of zzso and used both the zzso and the zzso systems as electron zzso zzso kinetic analysis indicated that the new zzso had zzso zzso whereas a previously identified zzso zzso was found to function with more typical zzso zzso zzso The zzso efficiencies zzso zzso zzso were similar to those for other zzso studied zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso indicated that zzso dependence and kinetic differences were zzso by the zzso zzso forming 22 zzso zzso This is the first report of zzso zzso efficiently utilizing reducing zzso from both the zzso and zzso zzso Studies to determine the resistance to zzso zzso important in regulating cell signaling zzso showed that zzso zzso possess both zzso resistant and zzso sensitive zzso The zzso to zzso zzso was zzso by the zzso tail containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso is the first zzso shown to possess both robust and sensitive zzso The ability of zzso zzso to use alternative electron donors, and their variable resistance to zzso may reflect their presence in different cellular sites and emphasizes the significant differences in overall zzso balance mechanisms between the zzso and its zzso zzso
