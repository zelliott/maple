zzso zzso attached to the esophagus of zzso leeches which are known to harbor zzso bacteria were removed from three species in the zzso family zzso zzso observations indicated that zzso zzso are paired and zzso inserting into the esophagus zzso to the zzso Light and electron zzso demonstrated that there is a single layer of zzso zzso cells harboring zzso rods and that these zzso cells are zzso distinct from neighboring zzso zzso zzso Fluorescent in zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso localized the bacteria solely to the zzso both in adult and in zzso juvenile leeches whereas a zzso probe did not yield a bound zzso zzso DNA was isolated from these zzso and subjected to zzso amplification using zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso zzso from sequencing the amplification products and zzso analysis with other zzso revealed that the bacteria resident in these zzso comprise a new zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso closely related to the zzso zzso zzso The three bacterial zzso though different from each other were each other's closest relatives, suggesting a history of close zzso with their zzso zzso
