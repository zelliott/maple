A unique zzso zzso is transcribed from the zzso and zzso genes of the mouse major zzso zzso zzso protection experiments and DNA sequence analysis have mapped the 3' zzso to a site located zzso zzso downstream from zzso zzso zzso of the 3' sequence of zzso to that of Q7 revealed that the two genes diverge from one another at a point located 200 zzso into the untranslated zzso This finding explains the increased size of the zzso zzso protection experiments involving twelve different strains of mice have revealed few sequence zzso A tissue distribution of the zzso transcript in B6 mice revealed that the highest quantities of message were present in the zzso with zzso lower amounts in the zzso liver, zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso appeared zzso it is zzso zzso yet expressed a zzso transcript which zzso to a zzso zzso A comparison of a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso has established that these quantitative cell surface differences are reflected in zzso zzso A zzso search of the zzso database has revealed that the 3' portion of zzso contains extensive zzso to a zzso long terminal repeat sequence that is characteristic of an zzso zzso zzso
