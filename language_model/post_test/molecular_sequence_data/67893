zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso that causes zzso is considered a zzso because of its high zzso and the high mortality rate of respiratory zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is thought to be a main protective zzso in mice and humans, and we have previously demonstrated the protective effect of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in a mouse model of respiratory zzso zzso characterization has shown that the zzso recognized by zzso is contained within two internal repeat units of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso To further zzso the zzso zzso and understand the molecular interactions between the zzso and the zzso we determined the X-ray crystal structure of the zzso zzso of zzso and derived an zzso complex using molecular zzso The zzso complex, refined through energy zzso reveals an zzso binding site in the shape of a large canyon with a central pocket that zzso a zzso zzso consisting of six sugar zzso zzso These results inform the development of vaccines and zzso zzso against zzso by suggesting a desired zzso for binding of the zzso to internal zzso of zzso zzso This is the first report of an X-ray crystal structure of a zzso zzso that targets a protective zzso B cell zzso
