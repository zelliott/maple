The general zzso factor zzso consists of the zzso protein zzso and multiple zzso factors zzso We previously identified two distinct zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here we report the identification of another zzso zzso zzso which is the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso such as human zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was identified in a zzso screen as a protein that interacts with the zzso zzso zzso region of zzso Gene disruption revealed that zzso is essential for cell zzso In zzso zzso bound to zzso but less efficiently to zzso In zzso cells, zzso was detected as a protein with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 50 zzso zzso experiments demonstrated that zzso is present in both the zzso and zzso complexes as in the case of zzso These results indicate that the zzso region of zzso which largely consists of zzso repeats, interacts with zzso in the zzso and zzso complexes, suggesting a role for the zzso repeat domain in the interaction between zzso
