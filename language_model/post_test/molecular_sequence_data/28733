The presence of zzso crystal inclusions in plasma cells from zzso and zzso zzso to zzso and zzso has been frequently zzso Our case describes a zzso zzso in a patient with zzso zzso showing an unusually high plasma cell zzso and for the first time zzso in plasma zzso Using zzso these zzso were identified as being zzso with a balanced zzso zzso zzso gene analysis zzso zzso 5 zzso showed that they were zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso 3): in one case, an zzso of 9 zzso on the zzso region was zzso High zzso values in the zzso indicated zzso selectivity and affinity zzso Since no zzso centers could be detected and the analyzed B cells showed zzso zzso it may be concluded that already zzso activated B cells migrated into the zzso and locally differentiated into plasma cells, leading to the extensive zzso zzso zzso zzso were shown to support terminal B cell zzso Our data suggests that the ability of zzso to activate B cells is not only restricted to zzso but also occurs in zzso The intense plasma cell zzso contributed to further cartilage damage by altering the zzso of the zzso zzso tissue or by the local production of zzso zzso
