zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso inherited zzso disease associated with zzso in the zzso DNA zzso We describe the clinical and molecular genetic findings in a zzso patient and his family with a new zzso zzso at zzso in the zzso zzso 

zzso examination was performed in one affected male and two maternal zzso zzso sequence analysis of the complete zzso protein coding region was initiated in the affected zzso Four unaffected maternal relatives also underwent molecular genetic zzso 

Clinical examination of the affected male showed typical features of zzso In his unaffected mother slight zzso zzso was zzso zzso analysis did not show any of the common zzso zzso A zzso exchange was detected at position zzso replacing a zzso by zzso in the zzso zzso This zzso was the only new zzso found within the entire protein and zzso coding region of the patient's zzso zzso This novel zzso was also present in four zzso maternal family members, but absent in 60 other zzso lineages and 175 unrelated zzso 

The new zzso at zzso position zzso lies in the close vicinity of other zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within the zzso most zzso region of the zzso zzso Since no other zzso was detected throughout the zzso coding region and the new zzso was excluded in controls, our clinical and molecular genetic findings suggest that the novel point zzso at zzso is responsible for zzso in this zzso
