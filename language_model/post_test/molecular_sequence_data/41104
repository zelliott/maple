zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a devastating inherited disorder characterized by episodic zzso and/or sudden cardiac arrest during exercise or acute emotion in individuals without structural cardiac zzso Although rare, zzso is suspected to cause a substantial part of sudden cardiac deaths in young zzso zzso in zzso zzso the cardiac zzso calcium channel, have been identified as zzso in approximately half of all zzso inherited zzso zzso zzso a zzso linkage analysis in a large Swedish family with a severe zzso inherited form of zzso zzso we mapped the disease locus to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso segregating with the zzso A second, de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was subsequently identified in an individual of Iraqi zzso this individual was diagnosed with zzso from a screening of 61 zzso samples with no identified zzso zzso Both zzso zzso demonstrated compromised calcium zzso and zzso displayed an zzso interaction with the zzso zzso zzso at low calcium zzso We conclude that zzso zzso can cause severe cardiac zzso and that the zzso genes are candidates for genetic screening of individual cases and families with idiopathic zzso zzso and unexplained sudden cardiac zzso
