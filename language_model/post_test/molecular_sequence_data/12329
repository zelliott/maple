zzso zzso zzso channels, which are permeable to zzso and zzso zzso are expressed in a number of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso have been cloned in retinal zzso cones, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso heart, and most recently zzso zzso clamp studies have identified and characterized zzso zzso channels in the cortical collecting duct zzso and inner zzso collecting duct zzso zzso zzso channels in kidney share many zzso and molecular properties with the retinal rod zzso zzso However, unlike the retinal rod channel, the zzso zzso channel in kidney is inhibited by zzso and zzso by increased calcium zzso In the zzso the zzso zzso channel mediates zzso sodium zzso which is inhibited by zzso via zzso Recently, zzso zzso channel zzso zzso has been identified in other zzso segments by zzso and in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso channel protein has also been identified in all zzso segments by Western zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso channels, or closely related gene products, may play an important zzso role in all zzso zzso zzso that increase zzso zzso may regulate zzso and perhaps zzso zzso in zzso segments zzso to the zzso zzso in cell sodium and calcium may regulate other transport and signaling zzso
