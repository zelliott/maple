In order to increase the versatility of zzso display technology, it is desirable to be able to impose some structural constraints on the peptides that are presented by the zzso zzso This is currently not feasible since the zzso of the zzso zzso used to link the foreign zzso to the zzso are either unknown zzso or too simple zzso to permit the engineering of zzso zzso into a constrained zzso To reach this scope we have modified the zzso of gene III by appending a zzso protein zzso the zzso bundle of the bacterial protein zzso zzso particles displaying zzso can be separated from zzso zzso particles by affinity zzso with an zzso zzso can be extensively modified by substituting its zzso zzso and/or by inserting peptides either into the zzso tail or into the bend region that connects the two zzso of the zzso These results open the possibility to construct zzso libraries where the peptides are constrained either into an zzso type zzso or an zzso Libraries formed by peptides inserted into the zzso can also be zzso Furthermore, the system that we have developed permits to produce large quantities of the elements of the libraries in the zzso or to display them on the zzso of zzso zzso
