zzso binding of the zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso requires both its zzso chain and basic zzso zzso Previous studies with a zzso corresponding to the zzso region, zzso showed that the 13 basic zzso interact zzso with zzso lipids and that the 5 zzso zzso zzso penetrate the polar head group region of the zzso Here we describe the zzso of the membrane binding of fluorescent zzso peptides measured with a zzso zzso Even though the zzso zzso the polar head group region, the association of zzso with zzso is extremely zzso association occurs with a zzso association rate zzso For example, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for the zzso binding to zzso diameter zzso zzso As expected zzso zzso is independent of factors that affect the zzso partition zzso such as the mole fraction of zzso zzso in the zzso and the salt zzso The zzso rate constant zzso is approximately 10 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso with zzso zzso zzso in 100 zzso zzso zzso zzso decreases markedly the lifetime of the zzso on zzso zzso from zzso to zzso s in the presence of 5 zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and pulls the zzso off zzso We discuss the biological implications of this switch zzso speculating that an increase in the level of zzso could rapidly release zzso 4, zzso that previous work has suggested is zzso in lateral zzso formed by zzso and zzso
