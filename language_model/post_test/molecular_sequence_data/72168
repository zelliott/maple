In the zzso zzso zzso a small protein named zzso is found associated with translation initiation factor zzso the zzso zzso zzso We demonstrate here that zzso is a zzso of zzso translation zzso zzso shows zzso acid sequence zzso to a region of zzso the large zzso of the zzso protein complex zzso which carries the binding site for zzso Both, zzso and zzso bind to zzso and compete with each other for binding to zzso The zzso complex can bind to the cap structure and inhibit zzso but not zzso translation initiation: the translation of a zzso with the 67 zzso omega sequence of tobacco mosaic virus in its zzso untranslated region (which was previously shown to render translation zzso is not inhibited by zzso Whereas the translation of the same zzso lacking the omega sequence is strongly inhibited by zzso zzso of zzso the gene zzso zzso stimulates the growth of zzso cells, zzso of zzso causes slower growth of zzso zzso These results show that zzso is a regulator of zzso activity which zzso zzso initiation of translation by interfering with the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso the formation of the zzso
