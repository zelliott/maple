zzso proteins are essential components of the zzso cascade initiated by members of the zzso Growth zzso zzso zzso binding to zzso complexes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso on their C zzso zzso This zzso leads to zzso with zzso a common zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso complexes then zzso to the nucleus where they play zzso regulator zzso Even if they share zzso identity, the two zzso restricted zzso and zzso are not functionally zzso As we have previously zzso zzso acts as a zzso factor by binding to a zzso sequence termed zzso box whereas zzso does zzso zzso differs from zzso mainly in the zzso zzso domain where it contains two additional stretches of zzso acids that are lacking in zzso Here, we show that one of these zzso corresponding to zzso 3 is responsible for the absence of zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, in zzso studies indicate that this domain prevents zzso from binding to this DNA zzso This suggests that zzso and zzso may have different zzso of target genes participating thus in distinct responses among zzso zzso zzso
