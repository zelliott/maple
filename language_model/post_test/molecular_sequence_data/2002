Using data from a partial protein sequence analysis of zzso proteins derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso The zzso enabled us to zzso several zzso protein genes and to determine their zzso zzso The zzso acid sequences that were deduced from the genes zzso to proteins zzso and zzso from the zzso zzso according to the zzso organization in zzso coli, and to proteins zzso and zzso which have comparable locations, as in the zzso coli zzso zzso Various degrees of similarity were found when the four proteins were compared with the corresponding zzso proteins of zzso or zzso zzso The highest sequence zzso was found in counterparts from other zzso such as zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso In general, the zzso zzso protein sequences were more related to the zzso kingdom than to the zzso or zzso zzso On the other hand, the organization of the zzso protein genes clearly follows the zzso structure of the zzso coli zzso and is different from the zzso zzso gene zzso The protein coding regions were not interrupted by zzso Furthermore, the zzso type sequences of zzso bacteria are zzso with those of zzso and also their zzso regions are zzso
