zzso is a barbed zzso zzso protein which was previously reported to be concentrated at zzso zzso junctions zzso and zzso zzso Recently, zzso zzso mouse zzso was isolated, showing that zzso is highly zzso to but distinct from zzso From mouse zzso cells we isolated and analyzed zzso zzso another zzso zzso zzso analysis has demonstrated that this protein is a mouse zzso of human zzso zzso zzso and that it shares zzso and zzso identity with zzso and zzso zzso zzso experiments in zzso combined with zzso analyses led us to conclude that there is a gene family consisting of zzso zzso and zzso These members are zzso in various types of zzso Then, by zzso zzso we closely analyzed their distribution using zzso and zzso zzso which could recognize all three zzso In addition to zzso zzso and zzso zzso it was shown that they were concentrated at zzso and zzso zzso in various types of zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso zzso zzso were clearly stained by zzso zzso only after the zzso zzso and zzso were removed by the zinc zzso We conclude that at least one of the members of the zzso family is concentrated at specific regions where zzso filaments are densely associated with plasma zzso
