We describe a genetic variation map for the chicken zzso containing zzso million zzso zzso zzso This map is based on a comparison of the sequences of three domestic chicken breeds (a zzso a layer and a Chinese zzso with that of their wild zzso red jungle zzso zzso experiments indicate that at least zzso of the zzso sites are true zzso and at least zzso are common zzso that segregate in many domestic zzso Mean zzso diversity is about five zzso per zzso for almost every possible comparison between red jungle zzso and domestic lines, between two different domestic lines, and within domestic zzso contrast to the notion that domestic animals are highly zzso relative to their wild zzso In fact, most of the zzso originated before zzso and there is little evidence of selective sweeps for zzso zzso on length scales greater than 100 zzso
