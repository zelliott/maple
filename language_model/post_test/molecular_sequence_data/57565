The zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso which is responsible for the zzso of the zzso gene in zzso cells transformed by zzso The zzso promoter contains several zzso consensus binding sites and has previously been shown to be regulated directly by zzso Here we report that the zzso gene is activated zzso by zzso and different zzso zzso zzso We have cloned a chicken zzso gene that is highly expressed in zzso cells and identified it as the chicken zzso of zzso zzso A zzso zzso of chicken zzso beta interferes with the zzso induced zzso of the zzso gene in these cells, suggesting that zzso beta or another zzso zzso factor is required for the zzso of zzso by zzso We found that zzso beta and other zzso zzso factors zzso to zzso the ability to induce the zzso gene in the presence of zzso Finally we show that, in contrast to zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso factors only at low zzso of zzso zzso Our results suggest a role for zzso zzso and possibly for other zzso zzso factors, in zzso function and in zzso gene zzso
