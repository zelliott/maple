zzso is a zzso scorpion toxin zzso by four zzso bridges that acts zzso on both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso channel zzso Two approaches were used to investigate the relative contribution of the zzso functional zzso zzso and zzso to the toxin zzso zzso the chemical synthesis of a zzso zzso lacking the functional zzso and zzso the production of a zzso analogue that is zzso on zzso zzso According to molecular zzso this zzso is expected to selectively impact the two zzso acid zzso belonging to the functional zzso without altering the nature and three-dimensional positioning of other zzso zzso was directly produced by zzso synthesis to rule out any possibility of trace contamination by the zzso zzso Both zzso zzso were compared with synthetic zzso for zzso In zzso zzso and zzso are lethal by zzso injection in mice zzso values of 100 and 40 zzso zzso In zzso zzso and zzso compete with zzso for binding to SK channels of rat brain zzso zzso values of 30 and 10 zzso zzso and block rat zzso zzso channels expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso values of 22 zzso and 75 zzso respectively), whereas they are inactive on zzso or zzso channels at zzso zzso zzso although both zzso are less active than zzso both in zzso and in zzso the integrity of the zzso functional zzso does not appear to be a prerequisite for the recognition and binding of the toxin to the zzso channels, thereby highlighting the crucial role of other toxin zzso with regard to zzso action on these zzso The zzso simulations detailing the zzso of zzso peptides on to the zzso channels support an unexpected key role of specific basic zzso acid zzso which form a basic ring zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in toxin zzso
