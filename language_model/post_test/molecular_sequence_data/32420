zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were first discovered in zzso as key zzso involved in scavenging of activated oxygen species zzso Their efficient zzso activity depends on the presence of the rare zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins zzso with a zzso zzso instead of zzso have also been found in most zzso As zzso is important for zzso activity, the function of the zzso can be zzso Here, we highlight the evolutionary link between zzso and zzso particularly the evolution of the zzso incorporation zzso We then discuss what is known about the zzso activity and zzso functions of zzso zzso studies have shown that zzso are not true zzso notably they reduce zzso using reducing zzso other than zzso such as zzso We provide evidence that, in addition to their inefficient scavenging action, zzso act as zzso sensors in various zzso zzso
