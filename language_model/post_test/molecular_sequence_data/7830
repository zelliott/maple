Although this chapter does not represent a historical review, it will be clear how the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso has evolved and where we stand in zzso While the functional activities of the proteins were recognized at least three to four decades ago, highly zzso preparations became available around zzso In the zzso the zzso of the proteins were zzso representing a major breakthrough in the zzso of the four zzso zzso acid sequences were derived from the zzso zzso zzso with other proteins were recognized and larger amounts of zzso proteins became available for zzso In addition, zzso proteins were prepared by zzso DNA technology, enabling investigation of zzso zzso This report is mainly based on the latter zzso zzso information about three-dimensional structures of the proteins and the mode of interaction with other zzso is still zzso To obtain this information will be the goal for zzso in the coming zzso
