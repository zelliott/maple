Two distinct zzso components of zzso zzso and zzso have been identified based on chemical composition and molecular weights zzso and low, zzso in zzso With the aim of characterizing the expression pattern of zzso zzso we have prepared zzso zzso zzso directed against the zzso core of zzso and against a synthetic zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso raised against partially zzso zzso stained a zzso zzso in Western blots of partially zzso zzso zzso binding was increased by zzso with zzso acid as well as with subsequent zzso treatment, and was eliminated by zzso treatment, strongly suggesting that zzso zzso was directed to a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso raised against a synthetic zzso derived from the zzso zzso sequence reacted with the native zzso and stained a narrow zzso of zzso 200,000 to zzso in Western blots of concentrated saliva and a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso on frozen sections of human zzso zzso showed that zzso zzso selectively labeled zzso cells, whereas zzso zzso labeled zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso demonstrated that the zzso patterns were zzso The development of these zzso zzso will facilitate studies of zzso expression in diseases of zzso zzso
