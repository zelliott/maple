zzso zzso virus infection is initiated by zzso a viral zzso factor that activates the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso does not recognize the zzso gene promoters directly but instead forms a zzso complex with zzso and zzso a ubiquitous nuclear protein required for progression through the zzso phase of the cell zzso The functional significance of recruiting zzso to the zzso complex is not zzso Here we describe the identification of a second zzso zzso designated zzso zzso is smaller than zzso but shares three regions of strong zzso acid sequence zzso including the zzso domain required for association with zzso zzso is expressed in many zzso especially the zzso and shows a more dynamic pattern of zzso zzso than zzso Although zzso associates with zzso and can support complex assembly with zzso and DNA, it is significantly less efficient than zzso A similar preference is shown by zzso a cellular counterpart of zzso Analysis of zzso proteins showed that differences between the fifth and sixth zzso repeats of the zzso zzso from zzso and zzso dictate this zzso These results reveal an unexpected level of specificity in the recruitment of zzso to the zzso complex, zzso the preferential selection of zzso rather than the closely related zzso domain protein zzso zzso for regulation of the viral life cycle are zzso
