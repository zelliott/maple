In the absence of the de zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso salvage is of primary importance for zzso zzso zzso of the salvage zzso are, therefore, good targets for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the first committed step in the synthesis of zzso from zzso is a potential target for zzso zzso We report here the crystal structure of zzso zzso from the malaria zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso at 2 A zzso The overall architecture of zzso zzso zzso zzso is similar to the known structures from zzso coli, mouse and zzso zzso in zzso interactions seen in this structure provide a plausible explanation for the kinetic differences between zzso and the zzso from other zzso Additional hydrogen bonding interactions of the protein with zzso may account for the ordered binding of zzso to the zzso The zzso interface of zzso is also different, with a pronounced excess of positively charged zzso zzso highlighted here provide a basis for the design of zzso zzso of the zzso
