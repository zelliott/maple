zzso the zzso agents of two emerging diseases, are zzso zzso viruses with a zzso zzso We isolated two zzso from a parental strain of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso named after their focus size when zzso The two zzso were zzso this revealed differences at two positions in the zzso protein and two positions in the zzso zzso zzso but the zzso were zzso We also detected a zzso deletion in the zzso zzso zzso zzso region covering a predicted hairpin loop structure that was found to be zzso among all zzso with members of the zzso zzso zzso as their zzso Stocks of zzso showed a lower ratio of viral zzso to infectious particles than stocks of zzso and zzso indicating that zzso zzso more efficiently in zzso zzso zzso zzso E6 zzso In zzso E6 cells, zzso zzso to higher zzso and zzso zzso to lower zzso than zzso In contrast, in zzso zzso cells, zzso and zzso zzso to similar levels, while zzso progeny virus production was strongly zzso The different zzso clearly differed in their potential to induce innate immune responses in zzso zzso zzso caused stronger induction of zzso zzso and zzso than zzso and zzso while zzso caused stronger zzso and zzso induction than zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso of isolated zzso zzso can have substantial differences compared to each other and to the parental zzso zzso this implies that the reported differences in zzso for zzso might depend more on chance due to spontaneous zzso during passage than inherited true differences between zzso
