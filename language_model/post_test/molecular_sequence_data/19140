Transport zzso allow the direct kinetic analysis of a specific zzso by measuring apparent zzso and zzso values, and permit the characterization of zzso specificity profiles through competition zzso In this protocol we describe a rapid and easy method for performing zzso zzso in the model zzso zzso zzso zzso Our method makes use of zzso zzso zzso zzso at a defined zzso stage in which most zzso show zzso zzso avoiding technical difficulties associated with the use of zzso In combination with the ease of construction of genetic zzso zzso in zzso zzso our method allows the rigorous characterization of any zzso in genetic backgrounds that are devoid of other zzso of similar zzso Here, we use this method to characterize the kinetic parameters and the specificity profile of zzso a zzso zzso zzso present in all zzso and member of the ubiquitous zzso zzso family, in specific genetic backgrounds lacking other relevant zzso
