We zzso using reverse zzso chain reaction, that, whereas abdominal zzso from rabbit consists almost entirely of zzso heavy chain zzso zzso with no insert at the zzso coding region, the distributing arteries zzso and zzso begin to show zzso zzso with the zzso insert that encodes seven zzso acids in the zzso region located in the zzso zzso The zzso artery contains zzso 50% inserted zzso whereas the more zzso zzso artery contains zzso zzso inserted zzso This insert is also present in the smooth muscle from rat tail artery but is absent in the smooth muscle from rat zzso The zzso zzso activity of zzso from the rabbit zzso artery is zzso higher than that of the zzso from the zzso A zzso increase (about zzso in the maximum zzso zzso of the zzso artery, compared with that of the zzso indicates that the preponderance of the inserted zzso is associated with both an increase in the zzso zzso activity and a larger maximum zzso of zzso Furthermore, analysis of the zzso essential light chain from the zzso reveals near equal quantities of the zzso light chain zzso a and zzso whereas the zzso from the zzso zzso artery contains predominantly the zzso light chain a zzso Together, these data indicate that the smooth muscle cells from the small distributing arteries are similar to those of visceral smooth muscle with respect to the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso
