The zzso scale zzso of five complete microbial zzso is revisited using our state-of-the-art zzso algorithm, zzso Considering that structure assignment to an zzso could be useful for predicting zzso function as well as for analyzing zzso it is important to assess the current status of zzso scale zzso The fraction of zzso to which we could assign protein structures with a reasonably good confidence level to each zzso sequences is over zzso which is significantly higher than earlier zzso Using the assigned structures, we have predicted the function of several zzso through zzso template structures, obtained from an analysis of the relationship between protein fold and zzso The fold distribution of the zzso and the effect of the number of zzso sequences on structure assignment are also zzso
