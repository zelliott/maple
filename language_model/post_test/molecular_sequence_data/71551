In 1992 some samples of zzso zzso and zzso were collected from zzso Bay, Southern Victoria Land zzso degrees zzso S 162 degrees zzso zzso and, as a result of a routine screening zzso some zzso were zzso One of them, designated as strain zzso showed marked differences when compared to other zzso zzso According to zzso and zzso zzso we were able to identify the strain zzso as a zzso belonging to the zzso zzso Some characteristics of this zzso are the growth response to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the absence of zzso and zzso asexual zzso zzso blue B test zzso and zzso zzso positive and the growth without zzso This strain zzso formed cream colonies of zzso appearance with cells of 3 zzso 2 zzso in size, that grew between 4 degrees C and 20 degrees zzso The G + C content of strain zzso was zzso zzso The molecular characterization by zzso proteins and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene and the two zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso revealed that this strain was different from other zzso species of this zzso The zzso tree deduced from the zzso zzso gene sequence showed the strain zzso as a member of the zzso zzso clearly separated from other zzso zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso and zzso data, the new isolate zzso was described as zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
