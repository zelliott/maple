One approach to the understanding of the molecular basis of aging in higher organisms may be to use genes whose timing and rate of expression during the life span run parallel with specific functions that can be zzso The genes for egg zzso such as zzso zzso which is expressed in the liver, and zzso zzso zzso that are expressed in the zzso of birds, meet these zzso zzso laying function is dependent on the production of these zzso which, in turn, depends on the expression of their zzso In this communication we present the age-related studies on the zzso II gene of the bird, Japanese zzso The gene is expressed only in the liver and its expression is considerably lower in old birds that do not lay zzso zzso of the promoter region of the gene carrying the two important zzso zzso zzso responsive element zzso and zzso responsive element zzso shows it to be zzso zzso to the corresponding region of the chicken zzso II zzso zzso of DNA and zzso of zzso of this region were zzso as they are known to be important for regulation of expression of zzso Our studies show that in the liver of adult female zzso which lay eggs, a zzso sequence located in this region is zzso and the zzso encompassing this region of the gene is zzso In the old, the zzso sequence is zzso and the zzso is zzso This is correlated with a decrease in the expression of the gene and decrease in egg zzso Further, zzso mobility shift zzso zzso shows that the zzso of specific zzso factors that bind to zzso and zzso present in the region, are not different in adult and old zzso Hence the zzso status of the zzso sequence that is located zzso the zzso and the zzso may be crucial for the zzso of zzso and availability of these two important zzso elements for the binding of the zzso zzso This, in turn, may zzso the expression of the gene in old zzso
