In looking for genes that escape X zzso zzso we scanned the zzso status of zzso DNA from zzso zzso and zzso mice using the method of restriction landmark zzso scanning using zzso zzso We detected and cloned a candidate locus and identified the zzso zzso zzso has sequence similarities to the B2 repetitive element and human zzso (formerly called zzso which escapes X zzso The B2 element spans the 3' zzso of the zzso and the 3' zzso of zzso The zzso gene encompasses zzso zzso of zzso DNA including 11 zzso and 10 zzso Taking advantage of zzso zzso present between zzso and zzso we showed that zzso zzso is mapped to the zzso region of the X zzso Despite the zzso of the zzso site, zzso is subject to X zzso
