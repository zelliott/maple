The zzso gene zzso zzso was previously isolated in a search for proteins that bound a DNA promoter zzso The presence of zzso zzso organization zzso zzso and an zzso zzso domain led to speculation that this gene regulated zzso structure or gene zzso This study describes the cloning and characterization of three novel human genes related to zzso zzso of sequence databases produced several more related zzso most of which were not known to be similar to zzso yielding a total of 12 highly zzso zzso genes from organisms as diverse as zzso and zzso The major region of sequence variation is in the zzso part of the zzso a region with zzso activity in zzso zzso deletion of zzso the sole zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed with deletion strains being less sensitive than wild type to the zzso effect of zzso This finding suggested that enhanced zzso arrest at zzso zzso II pause sites due to zzso zzso pool depletion was reduced in the deletion strain and that zzso inhibited zzso This zzso along with the known roles of other proteins with zzso or zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso of gene expression by zzso genes might occur by modifications of zzso structure, with altered access of the zzso apparatus to its zzso DNA zzso
