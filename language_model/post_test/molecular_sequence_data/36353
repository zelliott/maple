The zzso zzso domain of human tissue factor (the essential zzso for zzso factor zzso is a prospective regulatory domain through which viable cells may control the expression of tissue factor zzso Furthermore, this domain is subject to zzso modifications of as yet unknown functional zzso zzso producing zzso against the zzso domain of tissue factor were obtained using zzso harvested from mice zzso with a synthetic zzso corresponding to the nine terminal zzso of the protein zzso These zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso react with zzso zzso tissue factor, but not with a zzso soluble tissue factor lacking the zzso and zzso zzso This confirms that tissue factor from biological zzso contains the entire zzso domain predicted from the zzso zzso and provides a mechanism to determine whether tissue factor used zzso retains this zzso sensitive zzso The zzso have been employed to demonstrate selective zzso removal of the zzso zzso from tissue zzso Limited experiments indicate that they will be useful for characterizing the distribution of zzso with regard to the possible zzso of tissue factor on their zzso
