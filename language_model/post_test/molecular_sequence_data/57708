DNA sequence analysis of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso region A revealed genes that are zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is present in two copies, encodes a novel type of zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso share zzso only with the zzso domain of zzso from zzso zzso and zzso zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso which are almost perfectly zzso the predicted zzso acid sequences of the two zzso proteins showed only zzso sequence zzso zzso of the zzso zzso which is preceded by a putative zzso zzso promoter, required the function of zzso and the zzso zzso gene product zzso by zzso Analysis of defined zzso and deletion zzso demonstrated that only zzso was absolutely essential for nitrogen fixation in zzso zzso zzso carrying zzso in zzso were capable of very slow zzso growth, whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso as well as a zzso double zzso exhibited a zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso zzso zzso zzso were able to reduce zzso not only to zzso but also to ethane under conditions preventing the expression of the alternative zzso zzso zzso added to the growth medium zzso ethane formation and cured the zzso zzso in zzso zzso Higher zzso of zzso were necessary to complement the zzso zzso of a polar zzso zzso zzso indicating a possible role of zzso either in zzso transport or in the incorporation of this compound into the zzso zzso of zzso
