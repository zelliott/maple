We isolated a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso gene family zzso zzso as a zzso zzso based on the analysis of a human zzso zzso clone zzso located on band zzso of human zzso zzso The gene zzso consists of 12 zzso spanning over 29 zzso in size and is located between two zzso zzso and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence indicated the zzso features of zzso zzso and sequence motifs which are common to the zzso protein zzso The zzso cloning revealed the presence of three types of variation in its zzso The first variation is caused by the existence of three distinct first zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso panels indicated the differential expression of these transcript zzso The second variation is caused by skipping over one zzso zzso zzso The third variation is caused by the premature zzso termination at a site between zzso 8 and zzso zzso Both zzso skipping and premature termination caused zzso resulting in the production of truncated zzso zzso These results suggested that zzso of zzso gene is controlled in a complex zzso
