zzso of zzso zzso requires assistance to melt DNA at the promoter site but is zzso by numerous zzso and zzso zzso To alleviate these zzso zzso zzso bacterial zzso binding proteins zzso a subset of the zzso associated with various cellular activities zzso protein family, are required to zzso the zzso complex using energy derived from zzso zzso However, neither the process of energy conversion nor the internal architecture of the closed promoter complex is well zzso zzso coli zzso shock protein F zzso a well-studied zzso contains a zzso loop 1 zzso zzso is key to the energy zzso process by interacting with Region I of zzso zzso in a zzso dependent zzso Our analyses uncover new levels of complexity in the engagement of a zzso zzso with a zzso zzso complex via several zzso The zzso implications for these zzso zzso interactions are elaborated in the light of available structures for the zzso and its target zzso
