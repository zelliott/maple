zzso are presented to locate zzso stabilization center zzso which are expected to stabilize protein structures by preventing their zzso with their cooperative long range zzso zzso neural network-based zzso were developed to predict these zzso from the primary structure of single proteins and from the zzso acid sequences of zzso zzso The prediction accuracy using only single sequence information is zzso but the incorporation of evolutionary information in the form of multiple alignments and conservation scores raises the efficiency by zzso The zzso relative accessibility, number and type of zzso conservation and the X-ray zzso factor of the identified stabilization center zzso are different, not only from the whole data set but from the rest of the long range interacting zzso as zzso The most frequent stabilization center zzso are usually found at buried positions and have a zzso or aromatic zzso but some polar or charged zzso also play an important role in the zzso The stabilization centers show significant difference in the composition and in the type of linked secondary structural elements compared with the rest of the zzso The performed structural and sequential conservation analysis showed the higher conservation of stabilization centers over protein zzso The relation of the proposed stabilization centers to folding zzso is also zzso
