The zzso X and Y zzso are thought to have evolved from a common, nearly zzso zzso zzso Although there is little sequence similarity between the mouse or the human X and Y, there are several regions in which moderate to extensive sequence zzso have been found, including, but not limited to, the so-called zzso segment, in which zzso pairing and zzso take zzso The steroid zzso gene is in the zzso region of the zzso but not in zzso We have cloned and characterized the human zzso zzso locus and a zzso that is present on the long arm of the Y zzso Our data in humans and other primates suggest that there has been a zzso inversion of the Y zzso during zzso evolution that has disrupted the former zzso arrangement of these zzso These results provide additional insight into the evolution of the sex zzso and into the nature of this interesting portion of the human zzso
