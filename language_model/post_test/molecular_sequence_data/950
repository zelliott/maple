The effects of zzso on zzso zzso by an zzso zzso zzso zzso and by a zzso zzso were investigated in a model system derived from zzso coli, in which a zzso bond is formed between zzso and zzso bound at the zzso of zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso after a transient phase of interference with the zzso is slowly zzso near to the zzso so that zzso bond is still formed but with a lower zzso rate zzso At high zzso of zzso S zzso zzso zzso a second drug zzso binds to a weaker binding site on zzso and this may account for the onset of a subsequent zzso zzso zzso zzso enhances the zzso S zzso effect by zzso the drug accommodation to both zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso was found competing with zzso for the zzso of zzso S zzso complex zzso via a zzso zzso according to which the fast formation of the encounter complex CA is followed by a slow zzso to a tighter complex, termed zzso In contrast to that observed with zzso zzso zzso reduced zzso potency by decreasing the formation and stability of complex zzso zzso effects on drug binding were more pronounced when a mixture of zzso and zzso was used, instead of zzso zzso Our kinetic results correlate well with zzso and zzso data and suggest that zzso bound at the vicinity of the zzso binding pockets zzso zzso the interaction of these drugs with zzso
