We report the presence, in the zzso DNA zzso of all of the sexual species of the zzso family zzso of a shared zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso We place the zzso zzso in context by presenting the sequence of zzso zzso of zzso from zzso zzso zzso describe the zzso composition of the zzso zzso in all of the species of zzso and compare it to other coding and zzso regions of zzso and several other zzso zzso The zzso substitution rate of the zzso zzso is approximately three times faster than the substitution rate of the control region, as shown by comparisons among six zzso zzso sequences and eight members of the zzso zzso zzso We also found additional zzso within the zzso zzso of five species that varied from zzso zzso in zzso The presence of the zzso zzso in all sexual species of zzso suggests that it arose at least 20 zzso and has been a stable component of the zzso zzso ever zzso As such, it represents one of the few examples of a large and persistent zzso zzso in the zzso of any zzso zzso
