The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso two kinds of zzso zzso and zzso by using zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively, and produces zzso zzso as the first degradation zzso A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso which was induced in the bacterial cells grown on either zzso or zzso was found to act on the zzso of zzso zzso produced from zzso by zzso zzso and the zzso and its gene were isolated from zzso zzso The zzso sequence showed that the gene contained an zzso consisting of zzso base pairs coding a zzso with a molecular weight of zzso The zzso zzso was a zzso with a molecular mass of 42 zzso and was most active at pH zzso and 45 degrees zzso Because the zzso can act not only on the zzso product by zzso zzso but also on zzso zzso and zzso zzso produced by zzso and zzso zzso respectively, it is considered that the zzso zzso zzso plays specific and ubiquitous roles in the degradation of zzso with zzso zzso acid at the zzso terminal produced by zzso zzso
