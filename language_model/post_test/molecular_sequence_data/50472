A zzso clone of one member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene family zzso was isolated and zzso A region of zzso was found in the zzso region with the promoter of a zzso and a tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso of its primary structure with other zzso zzso revealed conservation of seven zzso regions as well as similarity with 11 zzso acids of the zzso site of zzso zzso DNA gel zzso suggested the existence of an zzso zzso zzso family in zzso possibly with three other members, none of which is very closely related to zzso The existence of at least one other gene was confirmed by the isolation of a zzso zzso from a zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was mapped on the zzso restriction zzso length zzso map and is located on the top of zzso zzso This position does not zzso to any known zzso on the genetic zzso zzso of the zzso gene was studied by reverse zzso on total zzso zzso zzso was strong in young leaves and zzso The gene was not induced by wounding of young leaves or in zzso in the presence of zzso zzso exposure of mature plants led to an induction of zzso gene zzso It is suggested that zzso protein has a role in zzso control of zzso zzso
