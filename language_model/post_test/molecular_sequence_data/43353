The zzso membrane protein 2 zzso of zzso virus interferes with zzso signal zzso through the zzso zzso zzso Two zzso of zzso exist and differ only in that one zzso zzso contains an zzso zzso domain that the other zzso does zzso zzso is a zzso that is zzso on zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso fusion protein containing the 119 zzso acids of the zzso domain, affinity zzso zzso zzso activity from zzso cell zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity was increased following zzso zzso of Western zzso of zzso proteins showed that the zzso form of zzso protein zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins containing the zzso domain of zzso and zzso analyses were used to identify zzso and zzso as the sites of in zzso zzso A zzso rabbit zzso was prepared against a zzso binding zzso zzso domain fusion protein zzso and used to zzso zzso from the in zzso zzso zzso line zzso zzso zzso from zzso contained zzso as a zzso zzso zzso surface zzso on zzso cells failed to induce zzso activity within the zzso Treatment of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to bypass the zzso zzso block and activate zzso zzso zzso of zzso on zzso zzso increased after zzso zzso The possible role for zzso zzso zzso by zzso in the control of zzso is zzso
