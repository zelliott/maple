Human melanoma cells zzso a 21 zzso protein which binds with zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso type IV zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the same zzso We have zzso this binding protein and determined its complete primary structure by directly sequencing overlapping zzso fragments which span the entire zzso We refer to this protein as zzso based on the zzso zzso acids zzso and the apparent molecular weight of zzso zzso on gel zzso The zzso acid sequence of zzso demonstrates that this protein shares significant zzso with human zzso zzso inhibitor of zzso including conservation of the positions of the twelve zzso zzso and three of four zzso zzso The identification of zzso now indicates that a family of zzso proteins zzso Individual members of this family may possess selective affinities for different members of the zzso zzso zzso Based on its sequence zzso to zzso and ability to inhibit type IV zzso we propose the name zzso for this zzso zzso produced by tumor cells can also be considered as an zzso gene product, because it could play an important role in regulating the zzso involved in tumor invasion and zzso
