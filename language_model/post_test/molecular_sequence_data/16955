zzso zzso zzso and zzso protein zzso catalyze the zzso of the zzso products zzso zzso and, in the case of zzso zzso zzso searches in zzso zzso revealed two genes zzso proteins zzso to zzso or zzso in various zzso and in chicken but only one zzso zzso a protein more similar to zzso than to zzso in zzso and the sea zzso zzso zzso This suggests that a gene zzso event occurred after the fish radiation and that the zzso gene evolved more rapidly than the zzso zzso In agreement with this distribution, only one zzso zzso zzso and zzso but not zzso was found in the zzso from a fish zzso zzso whereas two zzso with zzso similar to either zzso or zzso were found in zzso zzso and chicken zzso zzso is particularly active in brain, heart, zzso and skeletal zzso Its activity is also relatively elevated in zzso from man, zzso and mouse but barely zzso in zzso from chicken and zzso which zzso well with the low zzso concentration of zzso in zzso from these zzso This is in keeping with the specific role of zzso to repair protein damage caused by zzso zzso was more evenly distributed in zzso except for skeletal muscle where its activity was particularly zzso This may be related to low activity of the zzso zzso zzso in this zzso as suggested by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso This finding, together with the high affinity of zzso for zzso suggests that this zzso may serve to repair damage caused by the powerful zzso agent, zzso zzso
