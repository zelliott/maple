In short germ insects, the zzso and zzso anterior segments comprise most of the embryonic zzso which lengthens as zzso segments are added during development zzso zzso (1976) zzso zzso zzso 12, zzso The expression pattern of a zzso zzso of the primary zzso gene zzso zzso suggests that it is not relevant to zzso in this short germ insect zzso zzso Ball, zzso and Goodman, zzso (1992) Nature zzso zzso However in zzso a long germ insect that forms all segments zzso eve plays a vital role in segment formation zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have characterized the eve zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence is highly zzso between zzso fly, and zzso eve zzso zzso eve is expressed in stripes during zzso but in a pattern differing in some details from that of the fly zzso This pattern is zzso with that detected with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Nature zzso zzso Thus, an ancestral zzso gene appears to have evolved a role in zzso in a common zzso of flies and zzso Unlike zzso zzso but similar to zzso zzso eve is not linked to the zzso zzso
