The E alpha class II gene of the major zzso complex is expressed in a variety of zzso zzso Part of the control of zzso expression is zzso by a block of sequences found far upstream of the zzso zzso this stretch is necessary for expression in the B zzso of transgenic mice, but largely zzso zzso We review the evidence for the role of this region in E alpha zzso in transgenic animals, as well as data from zzso into zzso cells, which indicate that this region has zzso zzso zzso We discuss possible models to explain how a zzso zzso can participate in zzso zzso
