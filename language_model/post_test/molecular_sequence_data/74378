zzso exchange has been recognized for decades in zzso zzso but the zzso proteins have eluded zzso In this study, a zzso from a human brain library, previously designated zzso in the zzso was cloned and zzso The zzso transcript bears more similarity to zzso than known zzso zzso zzso but it was found to be expressed in multiple zzso zzso and cultured zzso A zzso to zzso was generated and found to label an approximately zzso native protein in multiple zzso and cell zzso The specificity of this zzso was confirmed by demonstrating the loss of the native zzso band on zzso when cultured cells were treated with zzso small interfering zzso Although zzso protein was detected in multiple zzso within each, its expression was restricted to specific cell zzso In the zzso zzso with zzso zzso and reverse zzso of zzso zzso revealed that zzso is limited to the zzso convoluted zzso In cell lines, native zzso was localized both to the plasma membrane and to the zzso zzso zzso electron zzso of rat zzso convoluted zzso demonstrated zzso predominantly but not exclusively on the inner zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso was observed with differential zzso and two zzso markers zzso with zzso in cultured zzso Regarding function, human zzso reversed the zzso zzso zzso when expressed in zzso zzso zzso and restored the ability to defend high zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso sodium zzso that is restricted to the zzso convoluted zzso in the zzso
