zzso zzso zzso repeat proteins perform a wide variety of functions in zzso zzso They are zzso by the presence of a number of zzso repeat motifs that contribute to the zzso structures which are the common feature of this large group of zzso We report here the properties of the first zzso member of this family in the American zzso zzso zzso zzso In the zzso zzso clone the protein is zzso zzso acids long and is predicted to contain four zzso repeat zzso flanked by zzso and zzso terminal zzso zzso is a single copy gene present on a zzso zzso pair of zzso zzso in a locus that is zzso with the corresponding regions of zzso zzso and zzso major zzso zzso with the proposed hybrid nature of the zzso zzso zzso the proteins zzso by the two different zzso share only zzso identity at the zzso acid zzso To determine zzso location, we examined zzso zzso for the distribution of green fluorescent protein zzso fused with different regions of zzso These studies demonstrated that a 115 zzso acid zzso derived from the zzso terminal domain of zzso is able to target zzso to the zzso Interestingly this region lacks a typical zzso terminal zzso suggesting that zzso import is zzso by an alternative targeting zzso
