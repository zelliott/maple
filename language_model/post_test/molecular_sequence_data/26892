We have employed zzso zzso as a surrogate for zzso in CD and zzso studies of the zzso preferences of the zzso portion of the structure in media which do not provide zzso zzso solutions of zzso due to its rapid conversion to zzso beta zzso zzso zzso comparison of zzso and zzso could be made under zzso zzso On the basis of CD and zzso zzso zzso the zzso loop zzso has a zzso of zzso zzso zzso the extent to which this zzso zzso further into the sequence is zzso a zzso from zzso through zzso (with end fraying from zzso zzso is observed in zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso the zzso region of zzso forms a second zzso domain zzso zzso the two zzso regions of zzso do not have any specific geometric relationship as they are connected by a flexible loop that takes different zzso and zzso although the extreme zzso is essential for zzso it is found to be extensively zzso with zzso zzso occurring at a much faster rate than that is observed in the remainder of the zzso zzso Two zzso structures of the zzso sequence zzso of zzso have been zzso The work also serves to illustrate improved methods for the zzso characterization of zzso A detailed quantitative analysis of the zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso revealed alternative zzso in the zzso portion of the common zzso zzso a region that is known to be involved in the zzso phenomena leading to zzso Even though the zzso sequence appears to be a flexible loop, the chemical shifts (and changes induced upon zzso zzso suggest some interactions between the loop and the zzso segment of zzso that occur on partial zzso zzso
