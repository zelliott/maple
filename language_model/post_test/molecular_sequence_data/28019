zzso zzso of zzso coli is a zzso zzso complex that zzso the final step in zzso zzso when zzso is the terminal electron zzso The zzso domain of zzso zzso consists of the zzso zzso which contains the active site, and a zzso prosthetic group zzso attached to zzso plus the zzso zzso which contains at least two of the three zzso zzso clusters of the zzso To examine the role of zzso bound zzso in zzso activity and electron transfer during zzso cell growth, zzso zzso was used to alter zzso of the zzso zzso to a zzso zzso or zzso zzso The resulting zzso zzso complexes that were zzso associated normally with the zzso zzso but had decreased ability zzso than zzso to reduce zzso with reduced zzso zzso an artificial electron donor of low zzso potential zzso zzso zzso zzso Clark, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of Organic Systems, Robert zzso zzso Publishing zzso Melbourne, zzso Even lower activities were measured when the higher potential, natural electron donor zzso was used, which, however, correlated with the slower growth rates of the different zzso zzso In contrast to the normal zzso the zzso zzso complexes were unable to zzso zzso zzso of zzso for zzso produced a totally inactive zzso complex that permitted no cell growth on zzso zzso with zzso as electron zzso All four zzso complexes contained zzso bound zzso in zzso zzso These data indicate a unique role of the 8 zzso zzso linkage in zzso activity, by raising the zzso potential of free zzso to permit reduction by both zzso and zzso
