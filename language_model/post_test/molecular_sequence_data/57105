To characterize the mechanism of membrane attachment of zzso zzso an expression system producing the processed form of this zzso has been zzso We have replaced the zzso signal zzso of bovine zzso zzso with a zzso signal zzso which is efficiently recognized and zzso in zzso Schneider 2 zzso A zzso zzso this zzso zzso bovine zzso has been zzso zzso into Schneider 2 zzso The zzso expression of active zzso zzso in these cells has been verified by Western zzso and zzso activity zzso zzso sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso demonstrates complete removal of the signal zzso zzso analysis shows that the zzso zzso exists as both a soluble and a zzso form in these zzso These data demonstrate that the zzso signal zzso is not required for the formation of the zzso zzso zzso and further that the zzso can be bound to zzso via a mechanism other than zzso signal zzso
