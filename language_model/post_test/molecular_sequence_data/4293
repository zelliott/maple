The zzso zzso protein of zzso zzso has been described as being both present on the surface of all zzso zzso disease zzso examined to date and a target for a zzso zzso zzso zzso which enhanced pulmonary clearance of this zzso in a mouse model system zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso that formed plaques which bound zzso zzso was shown to contain a zzso zzso zzso designated zzso that zzso a protein with a calculated molecular weight of zzso zzso of an zzso zzso zzso revealed that elimination of expression of zzso did not eliminate the zzso of zzso zzso with zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso acid analysis of internal peptides derived from native zzso protein and Southern zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso DNA suggested the existence of a second zzso zzso A combination of zzso mapping and zzso zzso methods identified a second zzso zzso zzso designated zzso which also zzso the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein had a calculated molecular weight of zzso Both the zzso zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso possessed the ability to express a zzso zzso that bound zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis indicated that disease zzso of zzso zzso likely possess both zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso most closely resembled zzso produced by other bacterial zzso
