zzso zzso is subjected to zzso stress from both internal and environmental zzso A previous study zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Weiser, zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that a zzso strain of zzso zzso was very resistant to killing by zzso hydrogen zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso a zzso family zzso regulator, was identified and zzso in zzso zzso strain zzso resulting in an increase in sensitivity to killing by zzso in disk diffusion zzso and a zzso zzso serial dilution zzso Genes zzso a predicted zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso showed zzso zzso in zzso cells exposed to zzso DNA zzso and real-time reverse zzso zzso analyses identified zzso zzso genes whose expression was affected by zzso stress in an zzso zzso Testing of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso for their abilities to zzso zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso was responsible for most of this activity in the zzso parent zzso The introduction of the same zzso into zzso zzso strain zzso showed that the growth of a zzso zzso zzso was markedly inhibited by the addition of 50 zzso zzso but that this zzso could still form a zzso equivalent to that produced by its zzso parent zzso
