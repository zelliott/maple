The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso zzso zzso produced to the active site of zzso zzso from human zzso was subjected to a zzso zzso The specific binding of MA zzso to MA zzso (K zzso zzso zzso zzso was shown by the method of surface zzso zzso and the functional activity of MA zzso was zzso Unlike zzso zzso this zzso specifically reacted with the irreversible zzso zzso of zzso A zzso map of MA zzso was analyzed by zzso mass zzso The zzso zzso of its heavy chain was shown to be within the active site of the zzso zzso A computer modeling of the MA zzso active site suggested the existence of a zzso zzso formed by zzso and zzso A comparison of the zzso structures of the MA zzso and the zzso zzso zzso which also exhibited an zzso activity and was produced to the stable analogue of the reaction transition state, indicated a practically complete coincidence of the structures of their presumed active zzso
