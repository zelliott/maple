Recently, human zzso 18 zzso zzso was zzso and the zzso protein with a tentatively assigned zzso zzso acid sequence was zzso However, natural zzso has not yet been isolated, and its cellular processing is therefore still zzso To clarify this, we zzso natural zzso from the zzso extract of zzso zzso zzso Natural zzso exhibited a molecular mass of zzso zzso and the zzso zzso acid was zzso Biological activities of the zzso protein were identical to those of zzso zzso with respect to the enhancement of natural killer cell zzso and zzso production by human peripheral blood zzso zzso We also found two precursor zzso zzso activities in the zzso of zzso zzso These activities were blocked separately by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso Further analyses of the partially zzso zzso revealed that one is zzso which zzso zzso at the zzso site to generate the mature zzso and the other is zzso which zzso both precursor and mature zzso at zzso and zzso to generate biologically inactive zzso These results suggest that the production and processing of natural zzso are regulated by two processing zzso zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
