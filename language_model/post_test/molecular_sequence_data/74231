The island of Madagascar and surrounding volcanic and zzso islands are considered to form a zzso hotspot with large numbers of unique zzso The origin of this endemic zzso can be explained by two different factors: zzso or zzso Deciphering which factor explains the current zzso pattern of a given zzso group requires robust zzso as well as estimates of divergence zzso The lineage of Indian Ocean zzso zzso zzso includes six or seven species that are endemic to Madagascar and portions of the zzso and zzso zzso little is known about the species limits, zzso affinities and relationships to each zzso In the present study, using DNA sequence data gathered from six zzso we examine the zzso history of the Indian Ocean zzso We also compare the pattern and timing of colonization of the Indian Ocean islands by zzso with divergence times already proposed for other bird zzso 

Our analyses revealed that Indian Ocean islands zzso do not form a zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso is genetically closer to the zzso Asian endemic zzso zzso than to species from the zzso and zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso often considered closely related to, if not zzso with zzso zzso of zzso is instead closely related to the African mainland zzso zzso zzso among the Indian Ocean zzso from the zzso and Madagascar are zzso despite the analysis of over zzso zzso suggesting a diversification burst after the initial colonization zzso We also highlight one case of putative zzso to the Asian mainland from an island zzso zzso zzso Our divergence date estimates, using a zzso relaxed clock method, suggest that all these events occurred during the last zzso zzso albeit colonization of the Indian Ocean islands were not zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso about zzso zzso while species from Madagascar and the zzso zzso from their zzso zzso about zzso zzso We highlight that our estimates coincide with estimates of diversification from other bird zzso 

Our analyses revealed the occurrence of multiple zzso colonization events of the Indian Ocean islands by zzso at a time when zzso exchanges involving Madagascar was common as a result of lowered zzso that would have allowed the formation of zzso zzso zzso of diversification that emerged from the zzso data are: 1) a zzso pattern concerning the order of colonization of the Indian Ocean islands and 2) the high genetic distinctiveness among all Indian Ocean zzso reinforcing their recognition as distinct zzso
