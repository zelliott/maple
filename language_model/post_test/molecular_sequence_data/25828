During the course of a screening program for zzso zzso among zzso zzso in zzso we observed a zzso zzso in the initiation zzso of the zzso gene which has not been described zzso The zzso was initially detected through mapping of the zzso gene by Southern zzso analysis using the restriction zzso zzso zzso The loss of the zzso I site resulted in the presence of an zzso zzso band in addition to the normal zzso zzso zzso The zzso was identified by sequence analysis of amplified DNA and by zzso analysis of this DNA with a zzso zzso zzso An additional zzso zzso was present at zzso 2 on the same zzso this zzso was detected by zzso et al in 1982 zzso zzso and in zzso chain synthesis data suggest that the zzso is of the beta zero zzso
