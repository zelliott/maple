A zzso zzso zzso human DNA region zzso located on zzso 19 zzso contains an origin of DNA replication in zzso zzso zzso The origin was zzso by means of quantitative zzso within approximately zzso zzso in a highly transcribed region containing at least two closely spaced genes with the same polarity of transcription, one zzso zzso B2 and the other an unidentified zzso The origin region zzso an zzso zzso zzso at the zzso of the second zzso zzso A binding site zzso for basic zzso zzso DNA binding proteins such as zzso or zzso was located by zzso I zzso analysis in the promoter of the second zzso zzso differentiation of zzso cells, that completely shuts off zzso also drastically reduces the zzso of zzso zzso On the other hand such treatment does not modify the zzso pattern of the zzso island and does not abolish the zzso I protection of the zzso binding zzso
