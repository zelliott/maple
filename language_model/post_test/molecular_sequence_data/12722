The sequence of a zzso zzso of the rat zzso zzso zzso gene is zzso A zzso clone corresponding to rat MR was isolated from a rat brain zzso zzso zzso analysis of the region corresponding to the DNA binding domain revealed the presence of a 12 base pair zzso zzso Analysis of zzso from several rat zzso suggests that the zzso is less abundant than the wild type in most zzso The zzso zzso is also a product of the human MR zzso the identical zzso zzso was also observed in human white blood cell zzso Unlike other zzso zzso reported for the zzso this zzso alters the zzso protein by the addition of four zzso acid zzso in the DNA binding zzso The altered protein may influence the affinity of the MR for zzso or zzso response zzso
