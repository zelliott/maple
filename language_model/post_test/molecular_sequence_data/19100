zzso important genes of the major zzso complex zzso have been characterized in a number of avian species with the general finding of considerable variation in size and structural organization among zzso A range of zzso which represent zzso zzso lineages have been described as having only one zzso class II zzso locus potentially leading to the conclusion that this is the ancestral zzso Here, we examine the zzso zzso critically endangered zzso zzso zzso for zzso variation at zzso class II zzso zzso 2, as part of zzso recovery zzso We found two to four confirmed sequence zzso per individual indicating the presence of more than one zzso class II zzso zzso Given the zzso zzso evolutionary status, evidence for multiple zzso class II zzso zzso seems to counter the proposed zzso history of modern zzso However, zzso gene duplication, zzso and loss among and within bird species may confound avian relationships making it difficult to zzso the ancestral zzso This study adds essential data for zzso the course of zzso structural evolution in zzso
