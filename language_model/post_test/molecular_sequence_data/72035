Here we describe the cloning of the regulator of zzso growth factor 2 zzso zzso zzso using a zzso zzso screening with a defined motif in zzso promoter as a target zzso zzso of human zzso zzso reduces zzso zzso and protein levels in both normal and tumor cell zzso Its zzso zzso zzso and zzso have deletions in the putative DNA binding domain and fail to bind zzso promoter and repress zzso gene zzso The ratios of zzso zzso differ between normal and tumor cells, with the zzso zzso dominating in tumor zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso cell zzso Our data suggest that regulation of zzso by zzso is important for cellular functions and may be impaired in certain zzso
