zzso muscle zzso is initiated by the binding of zzso to the single zzso regulatory site of cardiac muscle zzso C zzso zzso binding causes structural changes between zzso and two critical regions of cardiac muscle zzso I zzso the regulatory region zzso zzso zzso and the zzso region zzso zzso These changes are associated with a decreased zzso affinity for zzso and a heightened affinity for zzso Using zzso resonance energy transfer, we have measured three zzso distances in the zzso zzso and zzso zzso states in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso was zzso by zzso zzso B zzso both zzso and zzso and C (from a zzso zzso zzso to a zzso in the center of zzso exhibited zzso increases of zzso zzso These results compliment our previous determination of the distance between zzso zzso zzso zzso Together, the data suggest that zzso zzso causes zzso within zzso to switch from a zzso to an extended zzso zzso as the zzso are broken, whereas zzso remains zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso We have used the data to construct a structural model of the zzso zzso and regulatory regions in the zzso and zzso zzso
