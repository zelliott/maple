Five neurodegenerative diseases are caused by proteins with expanded zzso zzso zzso of these proteins has been previously identified only in zzso and no simple model systems are zzso In this paper, we demonstrate in zzso coli that long zzso zzso zzso zzso as zzso proteins inhibit growth while smaller zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso have no zzso zzso in humans, zzso repeats less than zzso zzso produce a normal zzso while expansion greater than 40 zzso is always associated with zzso zzso of zzso proteins in zzso coli may help identify the molecular mechanism of zzso of zzso zzso repeat diseases and be a useful screen to identify potential therapeutic zzso
