Species of zzso (especially zzso zzso are associated with two severe diseases in zzso zzso disease in young plants and zzso disease in adult zzso zzso species grow slowly on culture zzso and it is difficult to identify these species on the basis of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were designed in the zzso DNA internal transcribed zzso zzso regions zzso and zzso zzso They yielded a single zzso of 415 zzso for nine species of zzso that may occur in zzso A zzso zzso zzso general zzso zzso zzso in the primary zzso was developed to detect zzso directly in zzso zzso zzso detection was more sensitive than the traditional method of zzso in growth medium zzso Identification of zzso species was achieved by digesting the zzso zzso with the restriction zzso zzso zzso and zzso It was possible to distinguish these species by their restriction zzso length zzso patterns, except for zzso zzso and zzso zzso which had zzso similarity in their ITS region zzso A zzso zzso amplification of the partial zzso gene using the primer pair zzso and zzso was necessary to differentiate zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso An easy and fast protocol was developed to detect and identify species of zzso in a few zzso zzso defined here can be used in a plant nursery sanitation program to produce plants free of zzso zzso Use of healthy zzso plants in new plantations is the most effective measure to manage zzso zzso
