Two novel zzso bacteria, designated zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso zzso of the two strains were zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso and strain zzso was zzso and zzso The highest zzso zzso gene sequence similarity for both strains zzso and zzso was observed with zzso zzso zzso % and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed that strain zzso formed a cluster with zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso formed a cluster with zzso zzso zzso The zzso pairing studies showed that zzso displayed zzso % and zzso % zzso to the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence similarity between strains zzso and zzso was zzso zzso and the level of zzso zzso between them was zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that both strains contained the zzso 7 zzso as the zzso respiratory zzso The major cellular fatty acids zzso zzso were zzso : 0, zzso : 0, zzso : 0, zzso : 0 and zzso : 0 in zzso and zzso : 0, zzso : 0, zzso : 0, zzso : 0 and zzso : 0 in zzso Based on the zzso zzso zzso features, zzso zzso with the nearest zzso zzso and zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene zzso the two strains were determined to be two distinct novel species in the zzso zzso and the names proposed are zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso ( zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
