zzso interference zzso is a zzso zzso process of zzso degradation induced by small interfering zzso zzso In this report, zzso strategy was exploited to treat the infection of zzso 71 zzso considered as one of the most virulent pathogens that can cause severe complications in the family of zzso We developed short hairpin zzso zzso expression plasmids that significantly inhibited viral protein expression in a zzso and zzso fashion after transient zzso in cell zzso zzso expression of zzso in cultured cells exhibited marked viral resistance in every step assessed in the viral zzso Using zzso of zzso cells as a surrogate marker, it was shown that replication of zzso was specifically attenuated by these zzso zzso while zzso of other related zzso examined were zzso These zzso studies demonstrated the feasibility of this approach for the therapy of zzso zzso
