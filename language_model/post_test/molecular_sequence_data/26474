zzso are the major nuclear proteins in zzso cells, having a crucial role in the correct packaging of the paternal zzso The fact that zzso zzso in mice resulted in abnormal zzso packaging and male zzso suggested that the zzso could also be important candidates in explaining some of the idiopathic male zzso cases in zzso The first clinical studies focused on analyzing zzso at the protein zzso Various studies have found the presence of an altered amount of zzso in some zzso patients, in contrast to the normal situation in fertile individuals where the two zzso zzso 1 and zzso 2, are both present in approximately equal zzso zzso the zzso genes were the subject of various zzso genetic screening studies in search of zzso that could be associated with deregulation in the zzso expression zzso The results of these zzso zzso studies showed that the presence of high zzso zzso is a very rare cause of male zzso However, some zzso and some zzso described may behave as risk factors for male zzso More recently, the presence of zzso in the mature zzso cell has also been zzso The present chapter will introduce the basic aspects of zzso evolution and function and review the various articles published to date on the relationship between the zzso studied at the DNA, zzso and protein levels and male zzso
