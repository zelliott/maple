zzso zzso markers were developed in apricot zzso zzso zzso and grape zzso zzso zzso zzso libraries from either apricot leaves or grape roots were used in an enrichment procedure for zzso and CA zzso The zzso of zzso simple sequence repeat zzso markers from apricot and zzso to other related and unrelated species was zzso Overall, grape zzso amplified products in most of the zzso zzso while the apricot zzso amplified zzso zzso only in closely related species of the zzso In this zzso family, ten zzso zzso zzso were tested, and one single primer pair, zzso was amplified across species and sections in the zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in other species and zzso confirmed a higher level of conservation in the zzso motif and zzso regions in the zzso compared to the zzso Two distinct fragments of the zzso locus amplified across the zzso and zzso zzso however, while the coding region was highly zzso the zzso repeat motif was no longer zzso The zzso pattern was explained by base substitution and zzso events in the zzso region of zzso This study includes the determination of the degree of zzso detected among species and zzso in two unrelated zzso families and the evaluation of the information provided by the zzso repeats and the zzso zzso
