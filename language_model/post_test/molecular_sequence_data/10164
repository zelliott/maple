A gene zzso zzso a novel zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso When the zzso gene was expressed in zzso a unique zzso of approximately 40 zzso was zzso zzso zzso of zzso coli cells carrying the zzso gene indicated that the zzso protein was distributed in both the zzso and the zzso zzso with the notable ability to appear in the latter zzso zzso sequence analysis predicted a single open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso acid zzso with an estimated zzso of zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso showed high similarity to the sequence of zzso responsible for zzso zzso production, and zzso in zzso zzso The zzso also exhibited sequence zzso to the zzso protein sequence of zzso zzso and the sequences of zzso zzso family proteins from various zzso zzso screening and Southern zzso of zzso zzso strains revealed that all of the 41 zzso zzso clinical zzso contained zzso zzso
