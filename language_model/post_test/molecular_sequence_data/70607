zzso zzso an zzso zzso zzso in zzso secretions, where the level of free zzso iron zzso zzso is not sufficient for bacterial zzso This represents a mechanism of resistance to bacterial infections by prevention of colonization of the host by zzso In this study we were able to show that zzso zzso specifically recognizes and binds the iron carrier protein human zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso reduced zzso binding significantly, indicating that the zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso performed with 63 clinical zzso belonging to different zzso showed that zzso of the tested zzso zzso with zzso zzso analysis showed the existence of two zzso proteins with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The receptors were zzso by affinity zzso and internal sequence analysis revealed that one of the zzso zzso proteins was zzso to zzso surface protein A zzso The function of zzso as an zzso protein was confirmed by the ability of zzso zzso to bind zzso and to competitively inhibit zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso may use the zzso interaction to overcome the iron limitation at zzso surfaces, and this might represent a potential zzso zzso
