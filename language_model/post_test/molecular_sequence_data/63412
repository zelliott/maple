The hypothetical zzso coli protein zzso has been identified as the archetype for the family zzso zzso zzso despite a complete lack of experimental zzso The zzso gene was amplified from the zzso DNA of zzso coli zzso and cloned to zzso a fusion protein with a zzso zzso zzso The zzso was found to be localized to the outer membrane of zzso coli, as would be expected for a zzso zzso Its gene was engineered for the production of a truncated soluble zzso zzso lacking an zzso signal sequence and membrane zzso The soluble zzso zzso was zzso to apparent zzso and three separate in zzso zzso involving high pressure liquid zzso and zzso laser zzso zzso zzso mass zzso were used to demonstrate the zzso release of zzso from zzso zzso In addition, an in zzso zzso developed using the zzso zzso zzso system confirmed that the zzso functions as an zzso Based on these data, the zzso was renamed zzso zzso zzso zzso The modular structure of zzso was investigated through genetic engineering for the separate production of identified zzso and zzso zzso The ability to bind zzso and zzso activity were only associated with the isolated zzso zzso The zzso properties of this zzso zzso domain were found to be very similar to those of the zzso zzso The one notable exception was that the zzso domain appears to zzso the zzso behavior of the zzso domain to permit continued zzso of zzso zzso a unique feature of zzso compared with other characterized zzso zzso
