The 16 zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso is a potent zzso zzso Here, we demonstrate that zzso zzso zzso produced and zzso by zzso generate biologically functional zzso from full-length zzso When incubated with human zzso at neutral zzso zzso extracts and zzso zzso as well as zzso in culture, zzso the zzso zzso bond in zzso yielding - upon reduction of zzso zzso bonds - a 16 zzso zzso zzso This zzso inhibited basic zzso growth factor zzso zzso cell proliferation in zzso The zzso site is highly zzso and both human and rat zzso were zzso at this site by zzso from either zzso zzso of zzso to zzso by zzso zzso was completely abolished by the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso human zzso at zzso one zzso downstream from the zzso zzso zzso site, with the following relative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso expressed zzso zzso (as revealed by zzso and they contained and released zzso zzso 16 zzso zzso zzso by western zzso and zzso cell zzso These results suggest that several zzso zzso in cartilage generate zzso zzso from zzso derived or locally produced zzso
