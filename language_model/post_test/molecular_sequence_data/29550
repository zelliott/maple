zzso are involved in specific and zzso zzso zzso and participate in many zzso zzso Normally, they are regulated by zzso produced zzso zzso which, thus, represent lead structures for the development of zzso We succeeded in partially zzso and cloning a novel human zzso zzso inhibitor which, according to its structure and the expression pattern of the corresponding zzso was termed zzso zzso inhibitor zzso This inhibitor is of special interest because it exhibits an extraordinarily large number of 15 potentially zzso zzso and is of zzso importance for the severe zzso disease zzso zzso Here, we review the as yet known data on protein structure, zzso properties, zzso organization and gene zzso Furthermore, the relevance of zzso for several disorders pointing out its possible future therapeutic value, is zzso
