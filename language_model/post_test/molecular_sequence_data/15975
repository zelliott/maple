Human zzso clones encompassing the tissue specific expressed gene zzso an zzso growth factor binding protein were isolated and zzso The gene is organized in four zzso and spans zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis determined a single zzso start zzso The first zzso and zzso zzso region are highly zzso rich and located in a zzso zzso The zzso island zzso the zzso box, the zzso box, the zzso start site and a potential zzso zzso factor binding zzso The zzso promoter region is characteristic for genes expressed in a tissue specific zzso All signals required for zzso are located within zzso IV, predicting a zzso of zzso zzso which is consistent with the size seen on zzso zzso
