A zzso simple, zzso method for detection of four common zzso causing zzso zzso zzso has been developed combining zzso with zzso zzso chain reaction zzso This approach zzso provides an easy zzso for direct zzso of normal and zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso The strategy involves multiplex zzso of zzso 10, 11, and 21 within the zzso zzso zzso zzso regulator zzso gene in a single reaction containing three common zzso and either the four normal or four zzso zzso corresponding to the delta zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are chosen so that the size of the four zzso products zzso thereby zzso detection on zzso gels following amplification in the same zzso Patient samples are primed with either four normal or four zzso zzso zzso and zzso products run in parallel on gels to detect band presence or zzso This approach provides a simple and potentially automated method for cost-effective population zzso
