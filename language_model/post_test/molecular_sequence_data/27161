The zzso independent evolution of zzso traits reflects adaptation to similar selective zzso In some circumstances, parallel zzso evolution has a common genetic zzso Here, we investigate the types of genetic change responsible for the repeated evolution of red flowers among zzso zzso We identified three independent transitions from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso among zzso zzso The genetic basis for these transitions was examined using zzso and gene expression zzso Using a literature survey to estimate the expected spectrum of zzso types capable of producing red flowers, we evaluated whether the observed distribution of zzso types differed from zzso In these species, red floral pigmentation appears to be caused by the disruption of flux through the zzso zzso at the same zzso zzso zzso zzso regulatory changes in the same zzso which suggests the possibility that flower color evolved independently via the same genetic zzso Although multiple molecular mechanisms are capable of producing red flowers, we found a zzso between the zzso of observed and expected zzso types responsible for these evolutionary zzso Regulatory zzso thus appear to be zzso targeted during evolutionary change between zzso We discuss possible explanations for this apparent zzso
