The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of zzso coli is assembled at the cell zzso by a process that is zzso similar to that of zzso zzso The release of the filament zzso is zzso by zzso from the zzso conversely, entry into a host cell is zzso by zzso of the zzso coat proteins into the zzso The zzso zzso of the minor zzso protein zzso have the sole role of binding to host receptors during zzso In contrast, the C domain of zzso is required for two opposite zzso zzso of the zzso into the membrane during infection and zzso at the termination step of zzso We identified a zzso segment in the zzso C domain, which is required for zzso entry but zzso for release from the membrane at the end of zzso This segment, which we named the zzso segment zzso works only in zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and does not require the equivalent zzso sequences in other zzso within the zzso zzso The zzso contains a predicted zzso zzso and is rich in small zzso zzso zzso Ala, and zzso which are arranged as a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso showed that small zzso are compatible with zzso Overall, organization of the C domain is reminiscent of zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso The unique ability of zzso to mediate both membrane zzso and zzso allowed us to compare these two fundamental membrane transactions and to show that zzso zzso is a more complex process than zzso from zzso
