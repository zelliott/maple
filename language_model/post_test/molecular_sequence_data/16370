The HD domain motif is found in a zzso of proteins in bacteria, zzso and zzso A few of these proteins are known to have zzso zzso activity, but the others are functionally zzso Here we have characterized an HD zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso This protein has sequence similarity to zzso coli zzso zzso however, no zzso zzso activity was zzso The zzso activity of the protein was determined in the presence of more than two kinds of zzso zzso zzso which were zzso to their respective zzso and zzso and was found to be strictly specific for zzso in the following order of relative activity: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Interestingly, this zzso zzso zzso activity requires the presence of zzso or zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which themselves were not zzso were nonetheless able to stimulate the zzso of zzso These results suggest the existence of binding sites specific for zzso and zzso as positive zzso distinct from the zzso zzso zzso This is, to our knowledge, the first report of a zzso zzso that is activated by zzso zzso
