zzso zzso zzso belong to an zzso family that zzso terminal zzso and zzso zzso from zzso In this report, we zzso a novel zzso zzso from the marine zzso zzso zzso by applying ammonium zzso zzso affinity zzso on a zzso column, followed by two rounds of size exclusion zzso zzso analysis indicated a single band protein of apparent zzso with a molecular mass of zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and to a lesser extent zzso zzso zzso kinetic analysis using zzso resulted in a specific activity of zzso zzso a zzso value of zzso zzso and a zzso value of zzso zzso and zzso value of zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso zzso activity was decreased by zzso zzso or zzso and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The optimum activity of zzso was observed at pH zzso and elevated temperatures zzso degrees zzso zzso sequencing of zzso fragments generated from zzso revealed remarkable similarities to plant zzso which belong to family 18, although no zzso activity was detected with zzso We conclude that zzso representing a type of zzso activity, and zzso share common functional zzso and/or may have evolved from a common zzso
