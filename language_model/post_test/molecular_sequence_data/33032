zzso zzso has been used to map the interaction domain on zzso coli zzso for the zzso dependent zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso all clustered around zzso (the more zzso of the two zzso zzso have been located at the zzso binding zzso The center of the binding domain is dominated by zzso zzso zzso with a smaller number of charged and polar zzso acids located on the periphery of the zzso Twelve of the zzso acids detected by zzso have zzso zzso side zzso including one aromatic zzso acid zzso Four of the zzso zzso acids at the zzso binding site have polar side chains zzso zzso zzso and zzso with three of the four having charged side zzso zzso zzso experiments have shown that replacement of zzso zzso and zzso and of the absolutely zzso zzso significantly decreases the zzso for the zzso reduction of zzso with zzso coli zzso serving as the electron zzso The most dramatic effect was observed with the zzso zzso which showed no activity as a donor to zzso Although the zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso is the point of the initial zzso attack by reduced zzso zzso replacement of zzso by zzso has no effect on zzso binding to zzso
