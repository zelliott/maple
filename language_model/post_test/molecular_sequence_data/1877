Two zzso human zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the respective zzso stools of an infant and an adult in zzso zzso gene sequences of strains zzso and zzso showed high identity with that of the zzso zzso strain zzso and with those of zzso strains reported recently from zzso the United States, and zzso zzso gene sequences of strains zzso and zzso showed the highest identity with those of zzso zzso In Northern zzso zzso strains zzso and zzso were found to be closely related to strain zzso zzso nine zzso segments zzso to each zzso Moreover, all segments each of the two Japanese zzso strains zzso to those of the Thai zzso strain zzso These results suggest that Japanese zzso strains detected in this study are zzso between a zzso strain and a strain in the zzso zzso A similar zzso was found in the Thai zzso strain zzso
