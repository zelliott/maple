Based on selective labeling by zzso zzso zzso of the Calvin zzso zzso zzso zzso from spinach has been assigned to the zzso region zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The equivalent position is occupied by zzso or zzso zzso in the zzso from both zzso and zzso sources, suggesting a requirement for a basic zzso at this zzso To examine this possibility, we have replaced zzso of the spinach zzso with zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso by zzso zzso All of the zzso zzso retain substantial zzso zzso and even in the case of the radical substitution by zzso the zzso values for zzso and zzso zzso are not zzso zzso zzso at zzso may destabilize zzso structure, because the yield of this zzso protein from transformed zzso coli is quite low compared to that of the other proteins in this zzso Despite the zzso proximity of zzso our results show that this zzso does not play a key role in zzso or zzso zzso
