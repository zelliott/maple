We report characterization of several zzso within the zzso zzso region of the zzso marker protein zzso gene that may participate in regulating zzso of this and other zzso zzso zzso Analysis by zzso mobility shift zzso and zzso I zzso identifies two regions that contain a novel sequence zzso zzso between this motif and nuclear proteins were detected only with nuclear protein extracts derived from zzso zzso and this activity is more abundant in zzso zzso enriched in immature zzso We have designated a zzso involved in this binding as zzso The zzso motif consensus sequence was defined as zzso Studies with transgenic mice indicate that a zzso zzso of the zzso gene containing one zzso motif is sufficient for zzso zzso expression of the reporter zzso Some of the other identified sequence motifs also interact specifically with zzso nuclear protein zzso We propose that zzso is a novel, zzso zzso zzso factor involved in the zzso expression of zzso
