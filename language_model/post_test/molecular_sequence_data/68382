Human zzso zzso factor zzso binds to both human and mouse zzso receptors zzso while mouse zzso zzso binds only to mouse zzso Moreover, zzso binds with higher affinity to the zzso than does zzso In order to define the regions of the zzso zzso responsible for zzso interaction with the zzso and for the unusual zzso binding to the zzso a series of 15 zzso zzso hybrids has been zzso Perhaps surprisingly, both of these properties mapped to the same region of the zzso zzso The zzso contribution was from zzso in the loop linking the third and fourth zzso with lesser contributions from zzso in the third zzso and the loop connecting the second and third zzso in the predicted three-dimensional zzso Since all zzso retained full biological activity and zzso activity on mouse cells, and there was little variation in the specific biological activity of the zzso zzso it can be concluded that the overall secondary and zzso structures of each zzso were zzso This observation also implied that the primary binding sites on zzso and zzso for the zzso were zzso by zzso domain zzso zzso the site on the zzso zzso that zzso zzso binding to the zzso and higher affinity binding to the zzso must constitute an additional interaction site to that used by both zzso and zzso to bind to the zzso These studies define a maximum of 15 zzso acid differences between zzso and zzso that are responsible for the different properties of these zzso
