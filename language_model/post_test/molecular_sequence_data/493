The zzso zzso coli zzso zzso zzso a remarkable zzso modification of the zzso zzso during the zzso of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso The approximately zzso zzso region of zzso is zzso to zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is reminiscent of the zzso zzso zzso However, unlike E1 zzso which are zzso with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is a short zzso with an essential zzso zzso Furthermore, after an zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso a second, unique reaction, producing a stable zzso analogue of zzso zzso zzso We report zzso structures of zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and kinetic analyses reveal a zzso clamping mechanism for zzso binding to zzso zzso and a zzso site for zzso dual zzso zzso zzso The results provide insight into how a distinctive member of the E1 zzso carries out zzso zzso for generating the zzso zzso
