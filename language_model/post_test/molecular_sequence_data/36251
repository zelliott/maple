The expression and distribution of two cell zzso zzso zzso and zzso at the surface of cultured leg muscle cells from zzso chicken zzso were studied and zzso zzso which was expressed by fusing zzso was zzso on old zzso while zzso was still zzso Both zzso as viewed by zzso zzso appeared to have zzso at the areas of contact between fusing zzso However, zzso electron zzso did not reveal significant zzso of zzso and zzso and their segregation after zzso zzso suggested the absence of direct interactions between zzso and zzso The role of the zzso dependent cell zzso zzso zzso in zzso was zzso zzso fusion was inhibited zzso with a synthetic zzso containing the zzso sequence and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso demonstrating that zzso cell zzso is required for zzso zzso Under the same conditions no effect of zzso zzso was zzso Taken together these observations suggest that zzso acting independently from zzso is a major cell zzso zzso involved in embryonic zzso fusion in zzso
