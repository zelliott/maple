zzso zzso zzso by zzso mouse zzso tumor viruses zzso interact with the V beta domain of the T cell zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso can lead to stimulation and/or deletion of the zzso T cells, but little is known about the quantitative aspects of zzso zzso Although zzso zzso have been raised against zzso zzso they have not been useful in zzso zzso zzso which is present in very low amounts in normal zzso Alternative attempts to zzso zzso zzso zzso expression are complicated by the fact that zzso zzso occurs from multiple zzso and in different overlapping reading zzso In this report we describe a novel competitive zzso chain reaction zzso which allows the zzso zzso of zzso expression at the zzso level in zzso zzso from mouse strains with multiple zzso zzso zzso In B cells as well as T cells zzso or zzso zzso zzso is expressed at the highest levels, followed by zzso zzso and (to a much lesser zzso zzso zzso with functional zzso zzso presentation studies, we find that zzso zzso expression is higher in B cells than in zzso T cells and very low in the zzso zzso The overall hierarchy in zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was also observed for zzso isolated from zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso of zzso deletion of the corresponding zzso beta zzso during zzso correlated with the levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso our data suggest that T cell responses to zzso zzso are largely controlled by zzso expression levels on presenting zzso
