zzso affect a wide array of biological processes including protein zzso zzso and immune zzso It is becoming clear that many of these effects are zzso by direct binding to proteins such as neurotransmitter receptors and signaling zzso This review summarizes the unique chemical properties of alcohols which contribute to their biological zzso It is concluded that alcohols act mainly as hydrogen bond donors whose binding to the zzso chain is stabilized by zzso zzso The zzso of the O atom may also play a role in stabilizing contacts with the zzso Properties of alcohol binding sites have been derived from X-ray crystal structures of zzso complexes and from zzso studies of zzso channels and zzso that bind zzso Common zzso acid sequences and structural features are shared among the protein segments that are involved in alcohol zzso The alcohol binding site is thought to consist of a hydrogen bond zzso in a turn or loop region that is often situated at the zzso end of an zzso The zzso chain of the alcohol zzso appears to be zzso by a zzso groove formed by two or more structural zzso frequently a turn and an zzso zzso at these sites may alter the local protein structure or zzso bound zzso molecules and zzso the function of key zzso
