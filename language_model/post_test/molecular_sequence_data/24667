The complexity and specificity of many forms of signal zzso are widely suspected to require spatial zzso of protein zzso and zzso activities, yet current relevant imaging methods such as zzso zzso or fluorescent zzso zzso require fixation or zzso and lack zzso or spatial zzso We present a genetically zzso fluorescent reporter for protein zzso A zzso consisting of zzso of zzso fluorescent zzso a zzso acid binding domain zzso a consensus zzso for zzso and yellow fluorescent zzso zzso zzso cause zzso changes in the ratios of yellow to zzso emissions in live cells caused by zzso changes in zzso resonance energy zzso The reporter response was accelerated by zzso to zzso zzso and slowed by zzso to the zzso We demonstrate that deliberate zzso of a zzso or zzso a zzso and zzso can zzso its zzso to zzso by the zzso The successful design of a fluorescent reporter of zzso activity and its application for studying zzso and dynamic zzso of zzso lays a foundation for studying targeting and zzso of zzso and other zzso and zzso
