The zzso responsive zzso and zzso zzso zzso selected lines of mice differ significantly in zzso zzso zzso By comparison with the zzso line, the zzso line has a lower zzso density in the zzso aspect of the lateral zzso zzso but a higher zzso density in both the zzso zzso zzso zzso area zzso In the present study, the rates of zzso zzso synthesis and degradation were zzso from the zzso zzso after zzso zzso zzso The higher zzso zzso density in the zzso zzso of the zzso line was associated with an increase in zzso zzso with no change in zzso zzso As determined by zzso protection zzso this increase in zzso synthesis was not associated with an increase in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso turnover was decreased across the entire zzso axis in the lateral zzso the decrease in the apparent rate of zzso synthesis was not associated with a change in zzso zzso zzso By contrast with the decrease in zzso zzso zzso D1 zzso turnover in the zzso line was significantly zzso Overall, the data suggest that the changes in zzso zzso density correlated with the selection of the zzso and zzso lines may involve zzso or zzso zzso
