The zzso zzso zzso expressed early in the life cycle of human zzso to protect the virus from the zzso response of host cells, zzso cell death zzso by zzso and zzso zzso To better understand its role in cell death zzso we have sought to characterize the zzso properties of the protein from zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso or simply zzso through a variety of zzso To obtain sufficient quantities of zzso expressed protein for zzso zzso we explored the use of various expression zzso and zzso fusion to zzso was by far the most effective at generating soluble zzso Using limited zzso mass zzso and zzso interaction zzso we demonstrate that the zzso two-thirds of the zzso predicted to be composed of five zzso and one zzso is highly structured and binds its putative cellular zzso Furthermore, using atomic zzso and zzso zzso we have studied the metal binding properties of the zzso providing insight into the observation that zzso zzso of zzso lack in zzso zzso zzso Lastly, results from size exclusion zzso dynamic light zzso zzso zzso zzso chemical zzso and electron zzso experiments revealed that zzso exists in a stable zzso zzso state zzso in zzso
