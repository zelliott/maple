Using zzso zzso chain reaction and in zzso zzso methods to study the status of zzso interactions at hypersensitive site zzso zzso of the locus control region in zzso and zzso cells, we found that there was protein occupancy in zzso at zzso in both cell lines and the status of zzso interaction was different between zzso and zzso These data provide direct evidence that specific nuclear zzso complexes form in zzso at functionally important sequence motifs of the zzso in zzso zzso This indicates that zzso may play an important role in the regulation of the zzso gene zzso zzso is a human zzso cell line in which the embryonic zzso gene is predominantly zzso while the zzso cell line expresses predominantly the fetal zzso zzso Thus, zzso might also be involved in the regulation of zzso zzso expression of zzso zzso Our results are also consistent with the model that each hypersensitive site acts as a functional unit and zzso may facilitate the formation of the zzso functional zzso
