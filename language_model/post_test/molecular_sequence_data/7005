We report here the production of active zzso zzso human zzso zzso in zzso coli and development of a continuous zzso for this zzso In order to produce the human zzso zzso zzso for structural studies and accurate kinetic analysis, zzso of zzso 143 at an internal zzso site was introduced to prevent zzso The resulting soluble zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso as a stable zzso protein by zzso interaction and zzso zzso The in zzso protein zzso assembly protein zzso was also expressed and zzso for activity zzso To develop a continuous zzso zzso fluorescent synthetic zzso zzso similar to the zzso sequence zzso to zzso of the maturation site containing zzso acid and zzso as a resonance energy transfer zzso pair were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso assembly protein precursor with zzso and zzso values of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso for zzso zzso is at least zzso higher than for the natural protein zzso but the zzso values are zzso A sensitive zzso was developed using fluorescent zzso zzso which can detect zzso zzso zzso zzso
