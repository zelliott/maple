zzso virus zzso enters cells either through the signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expressed only in immune cells or through the zzso expressed regulator of complement zzso zzso To identify zzso on the attachment protein zzso zzso essential for fusion support through either zzso we devised a strategy based on analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso cycles of zzso protein production followed by zzso functional zzso and a novel zzso H three-dimensional zzso This model uses the zzso disease virus zzso protein structure as a zzso We identified seven zzso acids important for zzso and nine for zzso zzso cell zzso zzso The zzso H three-dimensional model suggests zzso that zzso and zzso zzso are located in zzso areas in zzso zzso 5 and 4, zzso zzso that two clusters of zzso zzso exist and that they are accessible for zzso zzso and zzso that several zzso zzso acids may be zzso from direct zzso zzso It appears likely that certain zzso support zzso zzso zzso zzso To verify the importance of the H zzso identified with the zzso fusion zzso for virus entry into cells, we transferred the relevant zzso into zzso zzso zzso Indeed, we were able to recover zzso zzso and we showed that these replicate selectively in cells expressing zzso or zzso zzso zzso viruses will be used to study zzso zzso and may have applications for the production of novel vaccines and zzso
