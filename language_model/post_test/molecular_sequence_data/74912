Von zzso factor zzso is a zzso zzso product of zzso cells and zzso that is important for normal zzso Recently the complete primary structure of the zzso precursor was deduced from cloned complementary zzso zzso To approach the analysis of DNA elements that mediate zzso zzso we have characterized the region of the human zzso gene surrounding the zzso initiation site, and including the first five zzso The putative zzso promoter region includes an (A + zzso zzso element approximately 30 zzso upstream of the zzso start site, but no zzso or zzso box elements zzso motifs of other zzso A zzso repeat element of uncertain significance is located about 650 zzso farther zzso The DNA sequence of the zzso zzso region suggests the presence of potentially novel elements involved in regulation of the restricted expression of zzso
