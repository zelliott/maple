zzso spin a functionally diverse array of silk zzso each composed of one or more unique zzso Most of these zzso in turn, are zzso by members of a single gene family thought to have arisen through zzso and divergence of an ancestral silk zzso Because of its remarkable mechanical properties, zzso zzso zzso silk, a composite of 2 proteins zzso and zzso is the best zzso Here, we demonstrate that multiple zzso zzso zzso in widow zzso zzso Because these copies may be the result of more recent zzso events than those leading to the currently recognized silk gene zzso they offer insight into the early evolutionary fate of silk gene zzso In addition to 3 presumed functional zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso black zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we find a zzso zzso in zzso zzso demonstrating the potential for zzso extinction of silk gene zzso We also document zzso events among zzso zzso zzso zzso and between zzso zzso zzso and zzso This result supports the hypothesis that concerted evolution occurs not only within an individual silk gene but also among silk gene zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso copies encodes a protein that has zzso in zzso acid composition and potentially zzso on the secondary structure of zzso Based on the presence of multiple zzso zzso and the zzso distribution of zzso versus zzso we propose that zzso is derived from an ancestral zzso zzso Finally, divergence has occurred in the upstream zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the region most likely to contain regulatory zzso providing ample opportunity for differential zzso However, the benefits associated with increased protein production may be the primary mechanism maintaining multiple functional zzso copies in widow zzso
