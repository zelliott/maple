A zzso zzso was generated against a zzso corresponding to a region opposite the regulatory face of zzso zzso b zzso providing a probe for detecting and zzso zzso when it is bound to its zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Using both direct and competition zzso zzso zzso zzso we have measured the extent of direct binding to zzso of various forms of zzso including different zzso induced by zzso zzso as well as forms differing at the zzso site zzso by zzso Strong interactions with zzso were observed for both zzso a truncated form lacking the site for zzso and zzso the zzso form of zzso Further, the binding of zzso zzso and zzso was zzso a similar amount by zzso or by zzso (both being zzso of zzso Our results suggest that the presence and zzso of zzso zzso zzso site do not fully account for the zzso affinity for zzso and that regions distinct from that site may also interact with zzso zzso zzso detected the binding of zzso by a truncated form of the zzso gamma zzso of zzso consistent with the necessary interaction of zzso zzso zzso with its zzso zzso In contrast, zzso bound very poorly to the truncated gamma zzso suggesting that the zzso zzso region of zzso may be critical in directing zzso to zzso zzso zzso and that the binding of zzso by the zzso zzso may involve more than just its zzso zzso The sum of our results suggests that structural features outside the zzso domain of zzso and outside the zzso region of zzso may both be necessary for the zzso interaction of these two zzso
