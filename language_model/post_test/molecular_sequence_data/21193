To obtain new zzso producing zzso screened and identified a strain zzso showing high zzso zzso We provided a new strain with zzso activity for producing clinical zzso 

zzso and ITS zzso sequences zzso analysis were performed to identify the strain zzso The zzso was zzso to zzso zzso by the steps of ammonium zzso zzso and zzso zzso column zzso We studied the zzso properties and the mechanism of the zzso and activities of zzso were measured with zzso 70 zzso as the zzso 

The isolated strain zzso was zzso as zzso zzso precisely by ITS zzso sequences zzso zzso Its molecular mass was estimated to be about 66 zzso by zzso The optimal reaction temperature was 35 degrees C, and the optimum pH was zzso it was stable in the condition of pH zzso - zzso and under the temperature of 50 degrees zzso The optimum zzso concentration was zzso zzso The final zzso zzso product was zzso which proved that the zzso was zzso and only had activity with zzso joined mainly by continual zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso for zzso was calculated to be zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso activity was enhanced by zzso and zzso and the low concentration of zzso could improve the zzso activity to zzso However, the zzso was strongly inhibited by zzso 

We isolated a new strain zzso producing high zzso activity and the zzso was zzso These results may provide an important basis for industrial zzso
