Alzheimer's zzso zzso precursor contains a zzso zzso inhibitor domain zzso potentially involved in zzso events leading to cerebral zzso zzso To facilitate the identification of the zzso target of the zzso the crystal structure of zzso has been determined and refined to zzso zzso zzso in the zzso interface of the correct zzso target will reflect the molecular details of the zzso zzso While the overall zzso fold of zzso is very similar to that of the zzso inhibitor zzso a significant zzso occurs in the backbone zzso of one of the two zzso binding zzso A number of zzso zzso have similar loop zzso indicating the structural zzso is zzso and potentially an important zzso of inhibitor zzso In a separate region of the zzso binding zzso zzso side chains zzso and zzso create an exposed zzso surface in place of zzso and zzso in zzso The restriction this change places on zzso target sequences is seen when the structure of zzso is superimposed on zzso zzso to zzso zzso where the zzso surface of zzso faces a complementary group of zzso side chains on zzso A versus polar side chains on zzso
