The fragile zzso zzso zzso gene is localized on zzso zzso and spans the common fragile site zzso Even though its role in zzso is still zzso this gene is frequently zzso by zzso zzso deletions in many types of zzso and zzso abnormal transcripts are found in many primary tumors and zzso cell zzso We evaluated zzso gene involvement in 39 zzso zzso (18 zzso zzso 21 zzso cell zzso zzso by both reverse zzso chain reaction zzso amplification and loss of zzso analysis zzso Thirty cases zzso displayed either zzso zzso transcripts (12 zzso and/or zzso (24 zzso among these, only 6 samples displayed both zzso transcripts and zzso thus suggesting that the two events are probably zzso Moreover, zzso was significantly higher in SCC zzso than in zzso zzso and because most of our patients are heavy smokers and/or alcohol consumers, these results suggest that the zzso gene might be a common target for zzso also in the zzso
