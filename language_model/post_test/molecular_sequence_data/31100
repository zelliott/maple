Three zzso cell surface collagen receptors of apparent molecular mass zzso 87, and zzso zzso were zzso from zzso with salt zzso or zzso zzso To understand how the collagen receptors are involved in zzso cell spreading on collagen we investigated the effects of zzso zzso and zzso peptides on zzso to zzso since zzso cells behave similarly on both native type I collagen and gelatin zzso and also whether zzso zzso would substitute for gelatin in zzso cell zzso zzso peptides in solution inhibited zzso cell spreading onto gelatin and promoted only partial zzso cell spreading when bound to tissue culture zzso Both partial spreading of zzso cells on the zzso zzso and full spreading on gelatin was dependent on zzso but not on zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso collagen receptors to zzso was increased fourfold in the presence of zzso and subsequent zzso of the collagen receptors and a zzso zzso protein not thought to be involved in zzso cell spreading was achieved with zzso In contrast, affinity zzso on zzso zzso predominantly the zzso zzso protein and the zzso collagen zzso In zzso the zzso interaction of the collagen receptors with the zzso sequence in collagen appears to be essential for the initial events in zzso cell spreading but is not sufficient for full cell zzso
