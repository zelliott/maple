The aim of the present study was to identify specific, novel germ cell markers that could be used to monitor normal and abnormal zzso Of several cloned zzso isolated from an adult rat zzso zzso library using an expression screening strategy, clone zzso zzso base zzso zzso exclusively to three zzso transcripts in samples isolated from rat zzso on and after Day 21 of life and to zzso from some, but not all, adult zzso After further zzso two identical clones zzso a zzso zzso zzso were isolated and found to contain an open reading frame of zzso zzso acids including two zzso zzso zzso On Northern zzso zzso zzso was abundant in samples from round zzso and zzso zzso were present in zzso from mice and zzso A zoo zzso revealed that the zzso gene is zzso in humans, zzso mice, dogs, and zzso On sections of rat zzso zzso zzso was first zzso in zzso zzso at stage zzso and thereafter was abundant in round and zzso zzso until step zzso zzso of zzso was not altered by ethane zzso zzso zzso withdrawal, but in rats treated 14 days previously with zzso acid, a marked reduction in zzso was noted associated with the depletion of round zzso In conclusion, the present study identified a zzso gene expressed in zzso and zzso germ zzso database searches have shown it to be zzso to recently published sequences for an outer dense fiber protein of the zzso tail zzso
