zzso zzso zzso is a zzso inherited condition zzso by short zzso zzso skeletal zzso and advanced bone zzso zzso is both clinically and zzso heterogeneous, and two zzso have been distinguished based on the presence zzso 1) or absence zzso 2) of an accessory zzso zzso In addition, an apparently distinct zzso without additional zzso bone but with short zzso and long zzso zzso zzso has been described zzso zzso in the gene that encodes for zzso zzso zzso 1) have been identified in a subset of patients with zzso type zzso 

A series of 11 subjects with zzso from eight families (one type 1, two type 2, five Kim zzso were examined for zzso zzso by direct sequencing of all coding zzso and their zzso zzso 

Eight distinct zzso were identified in seven families (one type 1, one type 2 and all 5 Kim zzso three were nonsense and five were zzso All zzso zzso occurred at highly zzso zzso acids in the zzso zzso regions of zzso zzso of zzso activity in zzso showed that the zzso zzso were all associated with zzso 

The zzso spectrum produced by zzso zzso must be extended to include zzso type 2 and Kim zzso While presence or absence of an additional zzso zzso zzso has been used to distinguish zzso of zzso this sign is not a distinctive criterion to predict the molecular basis in zzso
