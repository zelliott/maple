Green algae of the family zzso are a model lineage for studying the molecular evolution of zzso and cellular zzso The zzso zzso zzso is intermediate in organizational complexity between its zzso relative, zzso and its zzso relatives with differentiated cell types, such as zzso zzso zzso consists of approximately 16 zzso cells arranged in a flat zzso The detailed molecular analysis of any species zzso its accessibility to genetic zzso but, in zzso algae, transformation procedures have so far only been established for zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

zzso nuclear transformation of zzso zzso was achieved using a zzso dominant zzso resistance zzso the zzso zzso VIII gene zzso of zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso including zzso were from zzso zzso or from zzso zzso After particle gun zzso of wild type zzso cells with zzso gold zzso zzso were zzso The zzso were able to grow in the presence of the zzso zzso and produced a zzso level of the zzso zzso The plasmids integrated into the zzso and stable integration was verified after propagation for over zzso colony zzso zzso were recovered with a frequency of approximately zzso when cells were zzso with zzso zzso marker plasmids along with zzso plasmids containing zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso genes was zzso After zzso expression of the zzso gene from the marine zzso zzso zzso which was previously engineered to match the zzso usage in zzso zzso zzso zzso show zzso activity through light zzso in zzso zzso 

zzso sequences that include promoters from zzso zzso and from zzso zzso work in zzso zzso and allow the functional expression of zzso zzso such as the zzso marker gene zzso of zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which turned out to be a suitable reporter gene in zzso The availability of a method for transformation of zzso makes genetic engineering of this species possible and allows for detailed studies in molecular evolution using the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso
