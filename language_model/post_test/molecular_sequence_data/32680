During investigations of zzso in the coastal Arctic zzso zzso different species of the ubiquitous zzso zzso were isolated from the extreme zzso zzso A group of zzso strains was obtained that did not belong to any known zzso zzso This species was isolated in high numbers from the zzso zzso ice and was not detected in the surrounding zzso A detailed analysis of secondary zzso profiles, zzso and zzso zzso and partial zzso gene sequences showed that the proposed new species zzso zzso is closely related but not identical to zzso zzso and zzso zzso It differs in the production of secondary zzso and in the zzso features of zzso and zzso and it is therefore described as a new zzso
