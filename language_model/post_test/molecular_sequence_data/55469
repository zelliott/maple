The zzso zzso regulates a variety of zzso processes in animals through zzso and/or repression of numerous target zzso Here we have identified a zzso zzso of zzso channel zzso domain containing 15 zzso as an zzso zzso zzso expression is first detected at the zzso stage and gradually increases until the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso reveals that the spatial expression of zzso is tightly regulated during early zzso While zzso is zzso expressed throughout the zzso zzso at the early zzso stage, its expression becomes restricted to the zzso zzso and is excluded from the neural plate at the early zzso zzso At the zzso stage, zzso shows a more restricted distribution pattern in regions that are located at the zzso lateral or zzso edge of the neural fold, including the zzso zzso the zzso neural crest and the prospective roof zzso At the zzso stage, zzso expression is mainly detected in neural zzso or zzso zzso that are located around the eye, including the zzso arch, zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in zzso zzso and the zzso of zzso zzso with a chemical compound dramatically expands the region expressing zzso in whole zzso zzso depletion of zzso in zzso zzso leads to bent axes with reduced head structures, defective eyes and abnormal zzso while zzso depletion causes defects in zzso and zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso is an zzso zzso gene required for both zzso and zzso zzso
