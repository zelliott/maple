zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an invasive bacterial toxin that delivers its zzso zzso domain into the zzso of zzso cells bearing the zzso zzso zzso such as zzso zzso zzso This allows use of engineered zzso for targeted delivery of zzso T cell zzso into the zzso class I zzso of zzso and induction of robust and protective zzso zzso In this study, we demonstrate that zzso can efficiently zzso both a zzso T cell zzso zzso and a zzso T cell zzso zzso into, respectively, the conventional zzso or zzso routes of processing of zzso bone zzso zzso zzso Upon zzso delivery, a strong zzso of the zzso zzso T cell zzso presentation is observed as compared with the zzso zzso which depends on zzso interaction with its zzso zzso and its subsequent zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso strong and specific zzso zzso and zzso T cell responses zzso respectively, the zzso and zzso zzso These results underscore the potency of zzso for design of new zzso
