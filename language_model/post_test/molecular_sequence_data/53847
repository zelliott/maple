A zzso zzso gene zzso from zzso zzso zzso was identified on a zzso zzso insert by zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso of a zzso zzso resulted in the identification of a zzso open reading frame that could zzso a zzso zzso zzso analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence revealed zzso identity to zzso of zzso zzso and high similarity to zzso from a variety of organisms found in zzso classified as class IV zzso Under zzso growth in complex zzso zzso is transcribed zzso as a zzso zzso zzso plot analysis of the deduced zzso acid sequence and the lack of a signal zzso sequence suggest zzso is a zzso zzso A zzso of zzso lacking zzso activity was constructed by gene zzso zzso of the zzso zzso ability to grow in defined media lacking an zzso acid but containing its zzso acid zzso precursor to that of the zzso strain indicated that zzso is the only zzso capable of synthesis of zzso and Val from their zzso zzso zzso of the zzso activity of the zzso zzso to zzso revealed that the zzso retained zzso zzso 43, 40, and zzso of its zzso activity with zzso zzso zzso Met, and zzso zzso No difference in growth or zzso rate between zzso and the zzso strain was observed in zzso
