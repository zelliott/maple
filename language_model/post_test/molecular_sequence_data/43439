The present study concerns the use of zzso zzso experiments to zzso a three-dimensional model of the neutral zzso of zzso zzso zzso An initial model of zzso was constructed using the crystal structures of the zzso neutral zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso as zzso The largest portion of zzso could be zzso zzso using standard techniques, but several zzso regions could only be zzso with a high degree of zzso In order to make the model more reliable in these regions a zzso building by zzso approach was zzso zzso were designed such that their effect on zzso stability could indicate how their local environment should be zzso This approach provided insight in the local structure of several regions in zzso that were hard to model on the basis of zzso with the two known structures zzso
