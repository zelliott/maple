zzso 1 zzso is a tumor zzso and the most important zzso that can induce zzso T zzso zzso reside in the zzso tandem repeats zzso Heat shock protein zzso complexes isolated from tumors have been shown to induce specific zzso zzso zzso alone can also induce zzso zzso To explore the possibility to zzso the specific zzso immunity induced by zzso zzso and the zzso immunity induced by zzso we constructed a zzso protein zzso by fusing zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso and tested its ability to induce zzso activities in a tumor challenge zzso The growth of zzso tumors was significantly inhibited in mice zzso with zzso both before and after tumor zzso A much larger percentage of zzso mice survived the tumor challenge than zzso zzso zzso with the zzso activity, zzso was shown to induce zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso In the human system, zzso human DC induced the generation of zzso zzso zzso in zzso These results suggest that zzso applied zzso may be used to treat zzso tumors by inducing the zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso responses zzso by the zzso part of the fusion zzso
