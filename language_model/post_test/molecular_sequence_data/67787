The zzso zzso zzso is a commonly occurring zzso often found in symbiotic zzso We investigated the potential of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso DNA was screened for the zzso domain of the toxin zzso gene zzso Five zzso carrying the gene were screened for zzso zzso of two zzso inhibited protein zzso 2A and were further analyzed using zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both contained zzso High performance liquid zzso zzso zzso analysis confirmed the presence of zzso at zzso zzso zzso a in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso a in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Further scans indicated the presence of the rare zzso zzso zzso which contains zzso instead of zzso zzso was also present at zzso zzso zzso per g plant zzso in the methanol root extracts of zzso zzso zzso while the presence of zzso zzso in the roots of zzso zzso zzso was suggested by zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso zzso regions were zzso to confirm the presence of the hybrid zzso gene zzso A seven zzso zzso into the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso protein was observed in all zzso zzso suggesting the transfer of the zzso cluster from zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso This study demonstrates the synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso in a zzso species and the production of zzso zzso by a zzso in zzso
