zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso vary, particularly in their mid region (which may be type zzso or zzso and their signal zzso coding region zzso zzso or zzso We investigated zzso diversity among zzso zzso in strains from several locales in Asia, South America, and the zzso zzso analysis of zzso mid region sequences from 18 strains validated the division into two main groups zzso and zzso and showed further significant divisions within these zzso zzso site analysis demonstrated one example of zzso between zzso and zzso zzso and several examples of zzso among zzso within these zzso zzso was not sufficiently extensive to destroy zzso structure zzso zzso zzso substitution rates were markedly different between regions of zzso suggesting different evolutionary divergence times and zzso horizontal transfer of genetic elements within zzso zzso rate ratios were greater between zzso and zzso sequences than among zzso zzso consistent with zzso and zzso zzso zzso functions fitting strains for slightly different ecological zzso
