Although many Brazilian sugar zzso initiate the zzso process by zzso selected commercial zzso zzso zzso the zzso conditions of the industrial sugar cane ethanol zzso process permit the constant entry of native zzso zzso Certain of those native strains are better adapted and tend to predominate over the initial strain, which may cause problems during zzso In the industrial zzso process, zzso cells are often exposed to stressful environmental conditions, including prolonged cell recycling, ethanol toxicity and zzso zzso or temperature zzso Little is known about these zzso zzso zzso although recent studies have demonstrated that zzso zzso architecture is exhibited by some selected zzso Brazilian indigenous zzso strains that display high performance in zzso zzso In this study, 11 zzso markers were used to assess the genetic diversity and population structure of the native zzso zzso zzso strains in various Brazilian sugar zzso The resulting zzso data were used to build a zzso zzso tree and to perform a zzso population structure zzso The tree revealed the presence of great genetic diversity among the zzso which were arranged according to the place of origin and the collection zzso The population structure analysis revealed zzso differences among zzso in certain zzso these zzso differences are combined to yield notably zzso diverse zzso The high zzso diversity observed among native zzso zzso strains provides new insights on the use of zzso zzso strains with industrial characteristics as starter cultures at zzso zzso
