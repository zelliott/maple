Host zzso peptides are a zzso component of the innate immune response in all complex life zzso In humans, the major classes of host zzso peptides include the zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso These peptides are expressed in the zzso of zzso and by a wide variety of tissue zzso They have many roles in the immune response including both indirect and direct zzso activity, the ability to act as zzso as well as induce zzso production leading to recruitment of zzso to the site of infection, the promotion of wound healing and an ability to zzso zzso zzso It appears that many of these properties are zzso though direct interaction of peptides with the cells of the innate immune response including zzso zzso cells, T cells and zzso zzso The importance of these peptides in immune responses has been demonstrated since animals defective in the expression of certain host zzso peptides show greater zzso to bacterial zzso In the very few instances in which human patients have been demonstrated to have defective host zzso zzso zzso these individuals suffer from frequent zzso Although studies of the zzso properties of these peptides are in their zzso there is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the zzso properties of these small, naturally occurring molecules might be harnessed for development as novel therapeutic zzso
