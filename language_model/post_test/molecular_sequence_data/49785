Efforts have been made to develop a method that uses zzso zzso zzso reactions and mass zzso zzso to identify the binding site of copper in zzso This method uses zzso reactions to zzso the zzso acids in the zzso site and zzso to identify the zzso acids that have been zzso Several reaction conditions, including zzso zzso and zzso have been tested at varying zzso to find the optimum conditions for specific zzso of only the zzso acids bound to zzso For small zzso such as zzso I zzso I) and zzso zzso zzso (A zzso the optimum conditions for specific modification involve the use of zzso For a larger zzso zzso the speed and specificity of the zzso reactions are enhanced by the presence of a relatively high concentration of zzso zzso zzso and a small concentration of zzso (1 zzso zzso reaction conditions combined with zzso and zzso analysis on a zzso zzso trap mass zzso allow the zzso sites to be specifically zzso For zzso I and A zzso the zzso acids bound to copper can be identified without any false zzso For zzso four of the five zzso acids bound to copper are identified with one false zzso This false positive, however, zzso to the zzso of zzso which is probably due to its zzso to zzso and its proximity to the only zzso not identified zzso zzso The results altogether suggest that zzso reactions and zzso provide a very promising approach for identifying the zzso acid zzso bound to copper in zzso
