The zzso zzso of zzso and mouth disease virus strains A5 zzso and zzso zzso has been zzso and cloned in zzso or zzso Identification of zzso containing zzso sequences was achieved by zzso restriction zzso and sequence zzso zzso zzso were zzso into the expression zzso zzso which led to synthesis of fusion proteins with zzso These fusion proteins reacted with zzso zzso on a Western zzso but were not capable of inducing zzso zzso to zzso This seemed to suggest a zzso structure of the zzso unlike those of native zzso Other attempts are discussed to construct zzso proteins folding similarly to the native viral protein zzso
