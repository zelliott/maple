An zzso from the zzso family from zzso zzso zzso with zzso to zzso has been shown to exhibit activity against both zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have characterized the physical properties of zzso and have found it to be a highly zzso zzso remaining active after 3 h of incubation at 60 degrees C and withstanding incubation at temperatures up to 70 degrees zzso In addition, it can withstand zzso of at least 200 zzso These properties make zzso a promising candidate for development in commercial zzso However, compared to the most widely studied zzso zzso that from zzso zzso zzso has low zzso activity against certain zzso zzso zzso we sought to improve the zzso activity of zzso specifically toward the pesticides zzso and zzso zzso using zzso and random zzso zzso zzso random zzso and zzso zzso were zzso to increase the zzso activity of zzso Out of a screen of more than 30,000 potential zzso a total of 26 zzso zzso were zzso and characterized zzso Crystal structures of zzso zzso of zzso in complex with a product zzso and of 7 zzso zzso were determined to resolutions between zzso and zzso zzso Information from these structures directed the design and production of 4 additional zzso for zzso In total, our zzso efforts improved the zzso activity of zzso toward zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso and raised the specificity for these two zzso by zzso and zzso zzso Our work highlights the importance of an zzso approach to zzso proving that large rate enhancements are achieved when zzso are made in already active zzso In addition, the relationship between the kinetic parameters and the introduced zzso has allowed us to zzso on those factors most important for maintaining the structure and function of the zzso
