In this study, the light chain and a part of the heavy chain zzso segment of human zzso zzso were cloned with zzso and other DNA zzso techniques from zzso zzso The size of the cloned zzso was zzso zzso A segment about zzso of the zzso was analyzed by DNA sequencing and showed no difference from the human zzso zzso sequences published zzso The zzso zzso was used as a probe to study the zzso gene expression in zzso zzso The Northern zzso analysis and slot zzso analysis of zzso isolated from zzso cell lines and blast cells of acute leukemia showed that zzso gene expression correlated with zzso lineage and might be used as a marker for the zzso of acute zzso
