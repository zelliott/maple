zzso oxygen species, produced in cells by a variety of mechanisms, damage DNA and cause zzso To characterize the types of zzso produced in zzso cells, we copied DNA damaged by zzso oxygen species with zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso circular zzso DNA containing a zzso zzso gap within the zzso gene was damaged by zzso incubation with zzso and zzso The gap then was filled by zzso zzso rat DNA zzso zzso and the DNA was zzso into zzso zzso zzso within the zzso zzso gene for zzso were identified by reduced zzso In this system, zzso damage increased the zzso frequency within the target region by an average of zzso At certain sites, the base substitution rate is nearly 300 times greater than would be expected to result from a random distribution of zzso The zzso induced zzso fall into two zzso those apparently caused by direct zzso of modified DNA and those associated with enhanced zzso at zzso zzso hot zzso The latter group may be due to a zzso change in the DNA caused by zzso modification and could be indicative of a novel zzso zzso
