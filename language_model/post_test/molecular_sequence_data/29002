zzso is the major zzso in zzso triggered by various zzso Previous studies demonstrated a significant increase in zzso activity of the zzso gene during zzso zzso Recent findings suggest that differential expression of the zzso gene may zzso the regulation of zzso zzso during brain development and after acute injury to the mature zzso We identified and cloned the rat zzso gene promoter, determined its structure, and examined its regulation during a course of zzso in zzso zzso zzso demonstrate that this promoter lacks a zzso and contains a cluster of zzso elements and multiple zzso start zzso The first identified zzso start site is located zzso upstream from the first zzso zzso A role of zzso elements in the regulation of zzso promoter activity is demonstrated by the zzso of zzso binding using zzso zzso zzso of deletion analysis show that an zzso element located between zzso zzso and zzso relative to the most extended zzso start site is necessary to achieve sustained zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso region of the human zzso gene exhibits significant similarity to a regulatory region of the rat zzso
