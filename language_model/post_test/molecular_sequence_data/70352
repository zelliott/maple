zzso is a thin zzso protein that is implicated in the regulation and maintenance of smooth muscle zzso zzso cloning of chicken gizzard zzso indicated the presence of two zzso alpha and zzso the expression of the zzso being zzso more abundant in various smooth muscle zzso zzso zzso & zzso zzso (1991) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso For the long-range goal of understanding of the structure and function of zzso we have started bacterial expression and zzso zzso of alpha zzso The zzso acid composition and zzso sequence of the zzso alpha zzso were found to be identical to those deduced from its zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso is capable of binding to zzso zzso C, zzso and zzso and of zzso skeletal muscle zzso zzso zzso A zzso alpha zzso with a replacement in the putative zzso region zzso zzso has impaired ability to inhibit the zzso zzso activity, suggesting that this region of zzso may be involved in the zzso of the zzso zzso
