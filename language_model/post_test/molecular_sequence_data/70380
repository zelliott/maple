zzso instability in zzso zzso zzso zzso is correlated with zzso instability characterized by multiple zzso zzso and/or zzso occurring in a large unstable zzso We have focused on one of the two zzso DNA zzso which were mapped in this zzso the zzso unit of DNA locus 6 zzso The zzso sequence of one zzso zzso of zzso zzso reveals the presence of two open reading frames zzso and zzso on the basis of the typical zzso base composition at each of the three positions within zzso zzso shows some similarity with a gene zzso a regulatory zzso The presence of potential genes in this unstable locus was unexpected because deletions occurred with high frequency within this region in the genetic zzso zzso zzso However, zzso analyses by zzso zzso protection experiments on the zzso strain showed zzso of both zzso and zzso Moreover, the amplified strain reveals increased zzso of zzso but no zzso of zzso The amplification therefore results in a switch in zzso The unstable region of zzso zzso zzso zzso therefore is not a zzso region because at least some zzso are zzso
