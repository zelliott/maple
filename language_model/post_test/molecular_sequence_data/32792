zzso stress has been implicated as one of the primary mechanisms inducing DNA damage and believed to mediate aging and progression of numerous age-related diseases, including zzso zzso a gene previously described to mediate differentiation of zzso cells, is also involved in cellular responses to environmental zzso linked to heat shock and zzso zzso zzso However, the precise pathways and mechanisms underlying these phenomena remain to be zzso Our studies demonstrated that zzso is the primary zzso product responsible for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso In zzso stress cell culture models, zzso was zzso zzso expression regulated a parallel rise in the base zzso repair protein zzso but a reduction in zzso in response to zzso DNA zzso Furthermore, we found that both zzso and zzso exposure activated nuclear zzso factor I zzso in zzso cells, which specifically bound to the zzso element in the zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso and thereby induced zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso which prevented zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso may serve as a novel environmental stress sensor to protect cells against zzso oxygen zzso DNA zzso
