zzso analysis of zzso zzso the zzso agent of pitch zzso disease of zzso historically has been thwarted by a low frequency of mating success in the zzso We describe two findings that should facilitate genetic analysis of this fungus and related zzso First, we determined that previously described zzso zzso could be used to amplify a portion of the zzso mating type gene from zzso zzso This led to the cloning and sequencing of a zzso of the zzso zzso which in turn made it possible to distinguish between zzso zzso zzso of opposite mating zzso Second, we discovered that of the 18 zzso zzso field zzso in our collection, the 1 female fertile isolate expressed its fertility at 15 and 20 degrees C but not at 25 degrees C, the temperature used for crossing many zzso zzso It is zzso therefore, that when sexual reproduction in other closely related species is initially being investigated, the crosses should be established at a variety of zzso Once we learned that female fertility in this zzso zzso isolate was expressed at 20 degrees C, a high frequency of mating success was zzso
