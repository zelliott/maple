The zzso zzso zzso encodes two zzso zzso zzso and zzso Of the two, zzso shares significantly higher sequence identity with zzso zzso from other species, including zzso zzso zzso zzso In this study, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were isolated from zzso coli, and their zzso properties zzso zzso was found to cleave established zzso zzso including the zzso zzso zzso and insulin zzso A novel internally zzso zzso zzso zzso based on the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso zzso mating zzso was determined to be a suitable zzso for both zzso and zzso and was used to conduct comparative zzso zzso Both zzso were most active at 37 degrees C, in alkaline buffers and in high salt zzso In addition, the zzso activities of both zzso towards the zzso zzso were inhibited by metal zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso of zzso expression were also zzso Our analysis indicates that the zzso zzso of the zzso gene has been zzso with the zzso relevant zzso corresponding to zzso zzso of the publicly zzso protein zzso Finally, we demonstrate that, unlike zzso zzso zzso is expressed in both zzso and zzso cell zzso Our study presents the first comprehensive zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso and provides evidence that zzso zzso zzso has zzso properties that are highly consistent with zzso zzso and other zzso zzso
