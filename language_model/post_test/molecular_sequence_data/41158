zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the gut of the African mole zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that the strains belonged to the family zzso All four strains were most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene sequence zzso These zzso were zzso zzso (by zzso zzso and exhibited zzso zzso Their zzso properties included zzso as the major respiratory zzso zzso as the zzso zzso acid, zzso as the zzso type of the zzso zzso as the major fatty acid and zzso and zzso as the major polar zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we propose a new zzso in the family zzso zzso zzso zzso with three novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the type species of the zzso Additionally, we propose that zzso zzso should be reclassified in the zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
