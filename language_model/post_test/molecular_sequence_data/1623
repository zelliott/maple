In order to identify genes related to zzso zzso the zzso differential display method was employed to compare zzso populations from suspension cultured zzso zzso cells before and after beginning to produce zzso From a total display of about zzso zzso products, 104 were derived from cells during the zzso synthesis phase but not the zzso synthesis zzso These products were zzso and one such zzso zzso named zzso was confirmed to be specifically expressed in the zzso synthesis phase by northern zzso zzso The length of the transcript corresponding zzso was approximately zzso zzso DNA sequencing and zzso search showed the sequence of zzso contains a partial open reading frame and has no zzso with other known zzso zzso this report demonstrated the potential of zzso differential display for the isolation of genes specific for the period of secondary zzso production as well as the feasibility of the approach for the identification of genes potentially related to the synthesis of secondary zzso in higher zzso
