Three novel human sequences showing striking zzso to the recently described bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso channel zzso have been identified in an expressed sequence tags zzso zzso clones were isolated using a zzso zzso zzso The zzso predicted proteins display zzso overall zzso to zzso zzso expression patterns of the corresponding zzso designated as zzso zzso and zzso appear to be highly zzso with the first two genes primarily expressed in the zzso zzso Another original feature as compared to the zzso family members is the fact that zzso also shows expression in the zzso Taken together these findings demonstrate the existence of several zzso genes in humans, some of which display distinct tissue specificity patterns within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
