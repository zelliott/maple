zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso and tumor cell zzso via zzso degradation of zzso zzso zzso Plasma zzso is inhibited by the zzso zzso inhibitor protein C inhibitor zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso site loop into the active site of the zzso To better understand the structural aspects of this zzso 15 zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso were zzso for differences in zzso zzso These zzso revealed that zzso at the zzso zzso and zzso zzso sites of zzso were zzso to zzso activity, while zzso zzso zzso had little effect upon the zzso zzso However, replacement of the zzso zzso with small zzso like Ala and zzso increased the effectiveness of zzso three- to four zzso To explain these altered rates of zzso a zzso molecular model of zzso was generated and zzso to a model of zzso to simulate complex zzso The changes made by zzso were then recreated in the model of zzso In accordance with the kinetic data, the poor performance of zzso zzso is primarily attributable to charge zzso while zzso of zzso hindrance at zzso produces the observed increase in zzso zzso In the model, zzso at zzso interact with zzso rather than zzso consistent with zzso zzso demonstrating that little variation from zzso zzso Ultimately, this combination of zzso and molecular modeling will further refine our understanding of the interaction between zzso and zzso
