We use a replica approach to investigate the zzso properties of the random zzso with persistent zzso correlations in zzso zzso We show that this type of sequences possess zzso zzso In particular, we show that they can fold into stable unique three-dimensional structure (the zzso structure, in protein zzso through two different types of zzso One is a fast folding zzso and leads directly to the native zzso Another one, a more slower pathway, passes through the zzso separated zzso state and includes a number of intermediate glassy zzso The scale and the magnitude of the zzso are zzso The frozen state can be reached only by sequences with weak long-range zzso The critical value for the correlation zzso is found, above which zzso zzso freezing is zzso
