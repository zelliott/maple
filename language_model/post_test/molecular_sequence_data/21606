zzso climate fluctuations have shaped the patterns of genetic diversity observed in many extant zzso In zzso zzso zzso ranges may have expanded and contracted along an zzso zzso in response to environmental fluctuations leading to alternating periods of genetic isolation and zzso Because zzso responses to climate change are influenced by interactions between zzso characteristics and local topography, diversification pattern differs between species and zzso The eastern Himalayas is one of the world's most prominent mountain zzso Its complex topography and environmental zzso present an ideal system in which to study how zzso changes during zzso have influenced species zzso genetic diversification, and zzso The zzso laughing zzso zzso zzso is largely restricted to zzso zzso in eastern zzso We used zzso DNA and zzso to investigate how genetic diversity in this species was affected by zzso zzso 

zzso data detected two partially zzso zzso and southern zzso zzso data, however, identified three distinct lineages zzso with the geographically separated zzso northern and eastern zzso of the eastern zzso zzso breaks occur in steep mountains and deep valleys of the zzso zzso zzso time estimates and zzso simulations indicate that lineage diversification occurred on two different geographic and zzso zzso recent zzso associated with geographic isolation into individual zzso and historical zzso associated with displacement into multiple zzso Despite long-term isolation, genetic zzso among these zzso populations was observed, indicating historic periods of zzso The demographic history of zzso zzso shows continuous population growth since late zzso (about zzso zzso 

While zzso isolation is typical of many species in other zzso regions, our results suggest that zzso in the eastern Himalayas exhibiting zzso characteristics appear to have determined the diversification of zzso zzso During the zzso these populations became isolated on zzso during zzso periods but were connected when these expanded to low altitude during cooler zzso The zzso genetic zzso of lineages might obscure pattern of genetic zzso Our results provide new insights into sky island diversification in a previously zzso region, and further demonstrate that zzso zzso changes can have profound effects on lineage diversification and demography in zzso zzso
