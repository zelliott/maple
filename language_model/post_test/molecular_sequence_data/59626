Two receptors that contain the so-called zzso zzso have been described to date: tumor necrosis factor zzso 1 zzso and zzso zzso both belong to the zzso gene zzso The death domain of zzso mediates the zzso of programmed cell death zzso and of the zzso factor zzso B, whereas the death domain of zzso only appears to activate zzso 

We have identified an additional member of the zzso family, which we have named zzso zzso is a zzso protein of approximately 47 zzso that has similarity of members of the zzso family in its zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso resembles zzso and zzso in that it contains a zzso death zzso The zzso gene mapped to human zzso zzso and zzso zzso was detected in several human zzso including zzso zzso peripheral blood zzso small zzso and zzso zzso expression of zzso in zzso or zzso cells induced marked zzso zzso a zzso inhibitor of zzso zzso which blocks death signaling by zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso also induced the zzso of zzso zzso zzso did not specifically bind to the zzso zzso suggesting the existence of a distinct zzso for zzso 

These results identify zzso as a third member of the zzso family that activates zzso and suggest that zzso zzso and zzso engage a common zzso zzso zzso zzso resembles zzso because it can stimulate zzso B activity and regulate zzso zzso zzso is expressed in various zzso consistent with the possibility that this zzso may regulate multiple signaling zzso
