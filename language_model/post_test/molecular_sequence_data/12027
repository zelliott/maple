zzso with zzso proteins usually fails to zzso zzso T cells in zzso Here we report that chicken zzso zzso zzso by heat or sodium zzso zzso zzso effectively induced zzso zzso T cells in zzso The zzso zzso zzso population generated recognized zzso target cells zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso with the zzso zzso zzso To zzso the mechanisms of how zzso zzso enters the class zzso zzso of zzso zzso we took advantage of the fact that zzso zzso zzso target cells in zzso for zzso by zzso zzso We found that neither zzso of protein synthesis (by zzso nor blocking of transport via the zzso apparatus (by zzso zzso zzso with the class zzso presentation of zzso zzso in zzso In addition, zzso associated with zzso presentation zzso transport into the zzso zzso zzso was not required for effective zzso as zzso cells zzso could be zzso effectively by zzso zzso for recognition by class zzso zzso In contrast, class zzso presentation of zzso zzso was sensitive to zzso agents zzso zzso and zzso indicating that zzso compartments are involved in the presentation of zzso zzso zzso was inhibited at low temperature, yet took place in the presence of zzso and in the absence of zzso indicating that zzso zzso enters the cell via zzso zzso Hence the results provide further evidence for an alternative class zzso zzso of zzso presentation for zzso zzso As that zzso seems to be effective in zzso it offers a new and effective way of vaccination of zzso zzso
