Analysis of zzso DNA sequence variation has been used extensively to study the evolutionary relationships of individuals and zzso both within and across zzso So ubiquitous and easily acquired are zzso data that it has been suggested that such data could serve as a zzso zzso for an objective species zzso zzso However, there are technical pitfalls associated with the acquisition of zzso zzso One problem is the presence of zzso pieces of zzso in the nuclear zzso of many zzso that may be mistaken for authentic zzso zzso We assessed the extent to which such zzso sequences may pose an overlooked problem in analyses of zzso from humans and zzso Using long-range zzso chain reaction zzso we generated necessarily authentic zzso sequences for comparison with sequences obtained using typical methods for a segment of the zzso control region in humans, zzso zzso gorillas and zzso zzso revealed that gorillas are notable for having such a variety of zzso sequences bearing high similarity to authentic zzso that any analysis of zzso using standard approaches is rendered zzso Studies on humans, zzso zzso or orangutans are apparently less zzso One implication is that explicit measures need to be taken to zzso zzso sequences in newly studied zzso or when any irregularities zzso Furthermore, some zzso may not be amenable to analysis of zzso variation at zzso
