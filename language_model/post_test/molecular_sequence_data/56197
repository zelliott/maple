zzso is an zzso protein with the abilities to sever and cap the barbed end of zzso filaments and to promote the assembly of zzso zzso It has been identified in zzso both as a zzso protein and as a protein zzso into the blood zzso Here we report the zzso acid sequence of the full-length complementary DNA for a zzso form of zzso from zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of 790 zzso zzso zzso zzso contains a predicted signal zzso of 20 zzso acid zzso zzso of the zzso zzso sequence with other members of the zzso family of zzso proteins reveals the characteristic zzso repeat structure found in this class of zzso A zzso identity is observed between zzso zzso zzso and human plasma zzso when their primary structures are zzso Northern blots resolve a single zzso base message in third zzso zzso larvae, a message that appears to be zzso by a single gene located at zzso B on the right arm of the third zzso
