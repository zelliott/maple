zzso activates the zzso zzso product zzso zzso by stimulating conversion of the inactive zzso form of Ras to the active zzso zzso The protein zzso (for abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 89, zzso is composed of one zzso zzso zzso and two zzso zzso and highly zzso to the zzso zzso protein zzso that couples a zzso zzso to a Ras zzso We have studied an interaction of zzso with zzso zzso proteins in Chinese zzso zzso cells zzso human insulin receptors zzso zzso In an zzso zzso zzso zzso we detected a zzso zzso that was recognized by an zzso zzso and an zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso zzso We failed to detect the zzso zzso of the protein zzso These data suggested that insulin stimulates zzso complex formation in intact zzso zzso of an zzso fusion protein with the zzso of zzso zzso cells revealed that the fusion protein of zzso was able to bind the zzso zzso protein that was recognized by alpha zzso We also demonstrated that fusion protein of zzso was able to bind the fusion protein of zzso zzso fragments, suggesting that zzso is able to bind zzso zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso complex formation may play a role in zzso the insulin zzso zzso to a Ras signaling zzso Furthermore, we observed an zzso zzso zzso zzso activity in alpha zzso zzso suggesting the formation of an zzso zzso zzso This complex formation was detected as early as 10 s after insulin stimulation in intact zzso zzso This is the first report that supports the notion that zzso binds several signal zzso molecules containing zzso zzso thus serves as an zzso zzso protein that zzso zzso signal zzso
