zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is an essential, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso deletion zzso of zzso were genetically engineered to determine the minimal domain necessary to maintain zzso zzso zzso activity was assessed by zzso zzso inducing zzso or its zzso derivatives and one of two zzso zzso for the wild type zzso zzso zzso zzso and rat Go zzso in zzso coli, a zzso with no zzso zzso activity, and monitoring zzso incorporation of zzso zzso into the G protein alpha zzso or zzso an in zzso zzso zzso using zzso prepared from bacteria producing wild type or zzso zzso The data indicate that the minimal zzso domain of zzso is located between zzso and zzso zzso of the ability of zzso zzso to rescue the lethal zzso of an zzso zzso zzso in a zzso strain of zzso grown on rich media, with or without blockade of cellular fatty acid zzso suggest that the zzso 59 zzso of zzso may play an important zzso role, functioning as a targeting signal so this zzso zzso can access cellular zzso pools generated from zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso Moreover, there appear to be differences in the location or accessibility of zzso pools derived from fatty acid zzso and zzso zzso The zzso coli zzso system was used to map structural elements that determine differences in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso human zzso zzso Go alpha is a zzso for both zzso whereas human zzso alpha is a zzso only for human zzso Studies of a series of zzso zzso composed of elements from the zzso or zzso portions of human and zzso zzso indicate that zzso zzso of zzso alpha involves elements distributed from the zzso half through the region defined by zzso of the 416 zzso human zzso and zzso formation of a fully functional zzso binding site and a fully functional zzso binding site in either of these zzso requires contributions from both their zzso and zzso zzso
