A reverse zzso chain reaction zzso amplification procedure was developed for the detection of zzso viruses in zzso zzso Ninety-nine zzso specimens collected in the United Kingdom and containing small zzso virus particles as determined by electron zzso were zzso They came from 50 outbreaks and 16 sporadic cases of viral zzso zzso products of the appropriate size for Norwalk virus zzso were detected in 15 specimens from three outbreaks, suggesting that viruses closely related to Norwalk virus have not been circulating widely in the United Kingdom in recent zzso From four zzso the zzso amplification products of two zzso regions were zzso and the degree of zzso variation was zzso DNA sequencing of the zzso products revealed strong similarities among strains from the United Kingdom zzso zzso for both regions zzso but significant differences from Norwalk virus zzso to zzso All of the viruses detected by zzso were classified as zzso zzso by zzso immune electron zzso or zzso zzso zzso These findings provide evidence of a zzso relationship between Norwalk virus and zzso zzso small zzso zzso
