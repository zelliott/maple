We have identified two novel human zzso zzso zzso proteins of the zzso zzso zzso The two zzso called zzso transcripts 1 and 2 zzso and zzso are expressed in zzso and zzso cells and are zzso to bovine zzso zzso human killer cell zzso receptors zzso human zzso zzso and mouse zzso Furthermore, zzso and zzso are zzso on zzso 19, as are zzso zzso and zzso While the zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso the zzso and zzso zzso differ zzso zzso has an zzso within the zzso region, followed by a short zzso tail, similar to human zzso zzso and bovine zzso zzso zzso has a long zzso tail, which contains two zzso and two zzso pairs similar to the zzso zzso zzso motifs in zzso that are known to bind the zzso zzso zzso These zzso features suggest that zzso and zzso may mediate novel zzso signals by which zzso and zzso cell responses can be either activated or zzso
