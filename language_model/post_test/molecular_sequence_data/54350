For the past 50 years, it was believed that all zzso like humans and guinea zzso did not zzso vitamin C zzso because they lacked activity of zzso zzso zzso in their zzso zzso and guinea pigs lack the activity due to zzso of zzso in their zzso but there is no genetic evidence to show whether such loss in bats is caused by zzso zzso our successful molecular cloning in one zzso bat zzso zzso and one zzso bat zzso zzso zzso that no zzso occurs in these zzso Furthermore, we find normal zzso protein expression using zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso evaluated by Western zzso Most surprisingly, zzso activity zzso reveal that these two bat species have retained the ability to zzso zzso but at low levels compared with the zzso It is known that bats in the zzso zzso have lost zzso zzso We then found that functional constraints acting on the zzso of zzso zzso (which lost its zzso are zzso These results imply that the ability to zzso zzso in bats has not been lost completely in species as previously zzso We also suggest that the evolution of bat zzso genes can be a good model to study genetic processes associated with zzso
