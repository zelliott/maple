The zzso portion of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso was amplified with the zzso chain reaction zzso using zzso derived from the highly zzso sequences of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of the product shares high similarity to the 430 zzso acid zzso portion of zzso zzso of zzso zzso and the corresponding portions of another zzso zzso zzso catalyzing the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso As the zzso portions show only local similarity to motifs apparently zzso within zzso the segments of zzso zzso involved in the zzso of zzso peptides represent a new class of zzso dependent zzso
