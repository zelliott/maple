We have isolated a tiger zzso virus zzso from diseased tiger zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso was a linear zzso DNA of zzso zzso in length with a base composition of zzso zzso About 105 open reading frames were identified with coding capacities for zzso ranging from 40 to zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of the deduced zzso acid sequences revealed that 39 of 105 putative gene products showed significant zzso to functionally characterized proteins of other species in the zzso zzso These proteins included zzso and structural proteins involved in virus zzso transcription, zzso and zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences of zzso gene products showed more than zzso identity to zzso but a low degree of similarity among zzso zzso and zzso The results from this study indicated that zzso may belong to the zzso zzso of the family zzso
