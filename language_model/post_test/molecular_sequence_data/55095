zzso faults are geological structures that interrupt the continuity of zzso zzso and can act as zzso barriers for zzso zzso zzso In the equatorial Atlantic Ocean, it has been hypothesized that long transform faults impede gene flow between the northern and the southern Mid-Atlantic Ridge zzso and disconnect a northern from a southern zzso zzso To test if there is a barrier effect in the equatorial Atlantic, we examined zzso relationships of zzso zzso and their bacterial zzso from the recently discovered southern zzso zzso vents at zzso and zzso We examined zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso clams using the zzso zzso c zzso zzso I zzso gene as a zzso marker for the hosts and the bacterial zzso zzso gene as a marker for the zzso zzso zzso from the two southern sites were genetically divergent from the northern zzso species zzso zzso and zzso zzso but all four host lineages form a zzso group indicating that they radiated after divergence from their northern Atlantic sister group, the zzso zzso species zzso This suggests zzso of zzso species from north to south across the equatorial zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso were inconsistent and did not match the host zzso zzso indicating disconnected zzso zzso The zzso clam zzso zzso from zzso shared an identical zzso zzso with zzso zzso from the zzso zzso field on the northern zzso and their zzso shared identical zzso zzso suggesting gene flow across the zzso Our results indicate genetic connectivity between the northern and southern zzso and suggest that a strict zzso barrier does not zzso
