The zzso zzso is a key protein implicated in copper zzso in human zzso Using as zzso based zzso completed with zzso studies, we provided evidence that zzso forms zzso in the presence of zzso zzso analysis allowed us to determine the kinetic parameters of this interaction, zzso by an apparent affinity constant of zzso Moreover, we demonstrated that zzso zzso interacts independently with each of the six individual zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Finally, the zzso of the zzso was confirmed in living cells by using zzso resonance energy zzso zzso have been discussed in the context of zzso copper zzso
