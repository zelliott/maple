zzso of an Ewing's family of zzso zzso zzso library using formerly described zzso zzso led to the isolation of a zzso zzso zzso named Ewing's zzso zzso 16 zzso The zzso zzso shows no zzso to any functionally zzso human zzso Only a bovine zzso expressed in bovine zzso and zzso is functionally zzso as it encodes for a junction plaque associated protein and showed a zzso of zzso at zzso acid level to zzso The human zzso encodes for a zzso zzso acid zzso zzso with a calculated molecular weight of 103 zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso zzso covers the central region of the protein which is part of an extra cellular zzso The human zzso gene locus has been assigned to zzso zzso by FISH analyses and is confirmed by the human zzso sequencing zzso As demonstrated by flow zzso the cell surface expression of zzso zzso is restricted to zzso cell lines and not expressed on other small blue round cell zzso or other kind of zzso zzso analysis revealed a high expression of zzso in brain, liver and kidney while lung and heart were zzso zzso showed an zzso expression of zzso in different kind of zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso may function as a zzso cell surface zzso in zzso
