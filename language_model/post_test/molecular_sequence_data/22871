zzso zzso is the zzso agent of zzso zzso zzso is used for therapy of this disease, and zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso coding for an zzso protein that reduces the zzso zzso level, has been described zzso Of the 46 zzso zzso Spanish zzso zzso zzso used in this study, 32 zzso carried the zzso zzso and 30 of these genes were associated with zzso Eight zzso zzso carried the zzso zzso two zzso zzso carried either the zzso or the zzso zzso and all these genes were associated with zzso This is the first description of these zzso genes in zzso zzso The last two zzso zzso carried none of the zzso genes zzso Except for zzso zzso the other 34 zzso plasmids were zzso into an zzso coli zzso Two plasmids were completely zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso was zzso zzso and included a rep zzso zzso a zzso zzso and two open reading frames zzso with zzso to zzso genes of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso carrying the zzso zzso was zzso zzso and, based on its zzso content, consisted of two regions, one of putative zzso origin containing the zzso gene and the other zzso four zzso organized in an zzso structure with zzso to zzso genes in other plasmids of zzso zzso
