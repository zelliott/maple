zzso express a family of related outer membrane proteins designated protein II zzso These surface proteins are subject to both phase variation and zzso zzso The zzso gene repertoire of zzso zzso strain zzso was found to consist of at least ten zzso eight of which were zzso zzso analysis and DNA zzso studies revealed that one particular zzso sequence is present in three zzso but almost zzso copies in the zzso zzso These genes zzso the zzso protein that was previously identified as zzso zzso of their sequences shows that the multiple copies of this zzso gene might have been generated by both gene conversion and gene zzso
