Human zzso has evolved multiple strategies to interfere with immune recognition of the zzso A variety of mechanisms target zzso presentation by zzso class I molecules resulting in a reduced class I zzso zzso This zzso of class I molecules is expected to trigger zzso zzso which would have to be zzso by the virus to establish long-term zzso Here we describe that the human zzso open reading frame zzso encodes a zzso zzso for zzso identical with the zzso signal zzso zzso zzso of zzso in zzso target cells zzso resistance to zzso cell zzso via the zzso zzso Generation of the zzso zzso zzso was also observed in zzso zzso The presence of a functional zzso zzso zzso in the zzso signal sequence implicates this viral gene as an important negative regulator of zzso zzso
