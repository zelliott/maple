Biological properties of zzso zzso zzso modified in the region zzso were examined using zzso zzso zzso zzso had a zzso lower binding affinity for the zzso zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso zzso than zzso or zzso zzso zzso for both: 2 zzso zzso zzso Moreover, it is only a weak partial zzso despite completely zzso zzso zzso zzso 8) and zzso had similar zzso affinities zzso zzso 5 zzso zzso M and 8 zzso zzso zzso while that of zzso was more than zzso lower zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso These changes in biological properties suggest that high affinity zzso binding requires both zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso sequence and/or zzso interactions which are impaired by the zzso substitution for zzso
