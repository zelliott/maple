Many zzso that digest zzso contain separate zzso zzso zzso have been previously determined for a number of zzso zzso zzso from zzso 

The family zzso zzso domain 1 zzso from zzso zzso zzso D is shown to bind zzso but not zzso Its structure is similar to that of the zzso family zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso consisting of two zzso beta sheets that form a twisted zzso zzso The zzso site is a groove made from two zzso zzso that stack against the faces of the sugar rings, plus several zzso polar zzso 

The biggest difference between the family zzso and zzso zzso is that in the former the zzso zzso zzso are zzso whereas in the latter they are zzso forming a twisted binding zzso The binding sites are therefore complementary to the secondary structures of the zzso cellulose and zzso zzso and zzso represent a striking example of two proteins that have high sequence similarity but a different zzso
