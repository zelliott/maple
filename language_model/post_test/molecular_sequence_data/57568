The zzso zzso protein forms zzso species in zzso through its zzso zzso zzso is required for efficient binding to DNA containing multiple recognition sequences and increasing the number of binding sites stimulates binding in a cooperative zzso zzso that can only form zzso still bind to a zzso site, but with lower zzso zzso or progressive deletions from the zzso show that when even zzso formation is zzso zzso activity is zzso Surprisingly, binding activity is regained with larger deletions that leave only the zzso zzso Additional protein sequences apparently inhibit DNA binding unless they permit zzso The zzso domain peptides bind strongly even to isolated recognition sequences and they bind as zzso The ability of various zzso peptides to stimulate white gene expression in zzso shows that zzso forms are the functional species of the zzso product in zzso The zzso domain zzso binds well to DNA in zzso but it cannot stimulate white gene expression in zzso This failure may reflect the need for an zzso domain or it may be caused by indiscriminate binding of this zzso to zzso isolated zzso zzso increases binding zzso selecting only sites with multiple recognition zzso
