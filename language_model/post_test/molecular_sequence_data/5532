A novel gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso has been cloned and zzso from zzso zzso zzso a clinical isolate from zzso This gene mediates resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso gene is zzso zzso in length and encodes a putative protein of 190 zzso zzso zzso is most closely related to zzso and zzso demonstrating zzso and zzso zzso respectively, at the protein level, suggesting these proteins share a common zzso The zzso zzso sequences demonstrated zzso to zzso and zzso elements which are often found associated with resistance zzso zzso studies performed with an zzso probe specific for zzso indicate that this gene is prevalent within Venezuela but has not been observed outside of the zzso Furthermore, the zzso gene was found in 10 different species of zzso zzso
