We characterize zzso quantum dot zzso binding to genetically modified zzso as a model for bacterial zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso coli are examined by several zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso clarify fluorescent labeling of bacteria, with zzso zzso additionally reporting the number of decorated zzso bound to zzso zzso electron zzso zzso zzso and zzso differential mobility analysis allow zzso of zzso attached to each zzso zzso zzso and show that zzso zzso used in this study exhibits enhanced zzso binding to the zzso by nearly a factor of four compared to zzso zzso Additionally, the characterization methodology presented can be applied to the quantitative characterization of other fluorescent zzso zzso
