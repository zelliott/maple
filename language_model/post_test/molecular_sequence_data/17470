The cerebral neuroendocrine Light Green zzso of the zzso snail zzso zzso which control body growth and associated zzso stain positively with an zzso zzso raised to a large part of the zzso of zzso zzso zzso At the zzso level, the rough zzso zzso is zzso the zzso apparatus is slightly positive and zzso zzso in the process of budding from the zzso apparatus are strongly zzso These observations indicate that the Light Green zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which are processed before packing by the zzso apparatus into zzso zzso The two zzso distinct zzso zzso types, zzso with pale and dark zzso respectively, are equally zzso with zzso raised to the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within zzso structures reveal various degrees of zzso indicating their graded zzso The Light Green zzso release zzso material by the process of zzso into the zzso from zzso zzso terminals located in the periphery of the median lip zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso released contents are clearly zzso The same holds for zzso zzso contents released from Light Green zzso zzso profiles in the zzso of the lip zzso Some zzso is also present in the zzso space between these zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso zzso peptides may act in two ways, namely zzso as zzso via the zzso at peripheral targets and zzso in a zzso zzso fashion at targets within the central nervous zzso
