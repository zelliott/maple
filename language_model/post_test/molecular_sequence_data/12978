We measured the nuclear transport of zzso fusion proteins consisting of zzso of the zzso zzso 40 large T zzso nuclear zzso sequence region linked to zzso itself a zzso zzso We zzso the fusion protein zzso into the zzso of living zzso zzso or supplied them to the surface of zzso zzso zzso via paired beads or zzso zzso of the zzso zzso site zzso on the zzso flank of the nuclear zzso sequence zzso greatly enhances facilitated transport through the nuclear pore complex; additional presence of the zzso zzso II site zzso enhances subsequent zzso zzso
