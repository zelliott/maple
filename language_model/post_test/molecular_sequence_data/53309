zzso a zzso zzso factor isolated from the human seminal zzso is identical to the gross zzso disease fluid zzso a specific marker for primary and zzso breast zzso We previously demonstrated that zzso binds to zzso with high affinity and strongly zzso T zzso zzso induced by sequential zzso of zzso and T cell zzso zzso To further characterize the zzso interaction and map the zzso binding site, we produced a zzso form of zzso zzso fused to human zzso zzso zzso We showed that zzso exhibits a binding affinity for zzso similar to that of native zzso As no information about zzso structure is presently available, 99 overlapping zzso peptides were zzso by the Spot method, which allowed the mapping of two zzso binding zzso zzso scanning of zzso peptides identified critical zzso selected for zzso zzso Nine zzso zzso were generated and zzso Three zzso within the zzso region were identified as the major binding domain to zzso The Spot method combined with zzso represents a refined approach to distinguish the contact zzso from the ones contributing to the zzso of the zzso zzso
