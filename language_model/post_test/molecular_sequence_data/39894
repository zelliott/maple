Several zzso bacterial zzso with an optimum growth temperature of about zzso degrees C, were recovered from the zzso at zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence of strains zzso and zzso indicated that these organisms represent a new species of the zzso zzso The major fatty acids of strains zzso and zzso are zzso and zzso zzso zzso 8 is the major respiratory zzso the major polar lipids are zzso and zzso The new zzso are zzso zzso is oxidized to zzso in the presence of a zzso carbon zzso The zzso assimilated organic acids and zzso zzso but did not zzso carbohydrates or zzso On the basis of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso we propose that strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso represents a new species for which we recommend the name zzso zzso
