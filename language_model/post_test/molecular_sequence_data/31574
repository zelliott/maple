Pepper mild zzso virus zzso is a plant virus that has been recently proposed as a potential indicator of human zzso contamination of environmental zzso however, information on its geographical occurrence in surface water is still zzso We aimed to determine the seasonal and geographic occurrence of zzso in drinking water sources all over zzso Between July 2008 and February 2011, 184 source water samples were collected from 30 drinking water treatment plants zzso viruses from 1 to 2 zzso of each sample were concentrated by using an zzso zzso followed by zzso extraction and reverse zzso Using quantitative zzso zzso was detected in 140 zzso samples, with a concentration ranging from zzso to zzso zzso At least one of the samples from 27 zzso zzso or 8) was positive for zzso samples from 10 of these zzso were always zzso There was a significant difference in the occurrence of zzso among geographical regions but not a seasonal zzso zzso was frequently detected in samples that were negative for human enteric virus or zzso zzso A zzso analysis based on the partial zzso sequences of the zzso coat protein gene in 12 water samples from 9 zzso indicated that there are genetically diverse zzso strains present in drinking water sources in zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the occurrence of zzso in environmental waters across wide geographical zzso
