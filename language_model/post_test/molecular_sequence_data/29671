The zzso of the zzso family of proteins recognizes zzso tails with specifically zzso zzso Here, we present zzso energetic, and zzso analyses of the complex between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso tail with a zzso at zzso 9, a modification associated with zzso zzso The zzso tail zzso as a beta zzso completing the zzso architecture of the zzso The zzso group is zzso by three aromatic side zzso whereas adjacent zzso form discerning contacts with one face of the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso complexes suggests a role for zzso and van der zzso zzso with zzso slightly improving the binding zzso
