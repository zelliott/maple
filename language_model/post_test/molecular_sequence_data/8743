zzso zzso are ubiquitous in zzso and serve to anchor a variety of proteins to the zzso leaflet of cellular zzso zzso are zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in excess of the amount needed for protein zzso The fate of the excess zzso is unknown, but they may be retained in the zzso transported to other zzso and/or zzso In relation to this problem, we were interested in determining whether zzso were transported to the plasma membrane and whether, like zzso zzso their presence was confined to the zzso plasma membrane domain in polarized zzso zzso zzso zzso canine kidney zzso cell zzso were incubated with zzso or zzso to label zzso and then infected with enveloped zzso We used influenza virus zzso and zzso zzso virus zzso for these experiments as these viruses are assembled at the cell surface and acquire their envelope lipids from the plasma zzso Furthermore, flu and zzso bud specifically from the zzso and zzso plasma membrane zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated from the zzso and zzso media, respectively, and subjected to zzso zzso zzso zzso were found in both zzso Moreover, the membrane concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to membrane zzso in the two viruses was essentially the zzso These observations suggest that zzso zzso zzso are located at the plasma zzso zzso since zzso are zzso in the zzso they must be transported from the zzso to the plasma zzso and zzso transport of zzso zzso is not influenced by the sorting processes that target zzso proteins exclusively to the zzso plasma zzso
