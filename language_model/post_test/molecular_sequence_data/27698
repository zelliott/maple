The analysis of the zzso pattern of the alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso and beta zzso genes during fetal and zzso development of the rat shows that the differential regulation of zzso synthesis relies on differential gene shutdown rather than differential gene zzso that is, all zzso genes are active during early development but turn off at different zzso The only two exceptions to this rule are the alpha zzso and beta zzso zzso The alpha zzso gene transcript becomes first zzso at 18 days of fetal development, while the beta zzso gene appears to be active only in the zzso zzso We also determined the absolute numbers of the alpha zzso alpha zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta zzso beta s-, and zzso gene transcripts present in the lens at various times after zzso zzso of these zzso data with the published protein data shows that the alpha zzso and beta zzso zzso are relatively zzso suggesting the possibility that these two zzso species are not used as efficiently as other zzso zzso zzso of the known zzso alpha zzso sequence and zzso of the zzso beta zzso sequence yielded no evidence for zzso zzso zzso These two zzso have one sequence motif in common: they are the only zzso zzso in which the translation initiation zzso is preceded by zzso
