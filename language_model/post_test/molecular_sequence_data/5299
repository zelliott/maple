zzso is a zzso zzso inhibitor of the zzso family that has been identified as an zzso zzso zzso in zzso cultures of chicken zzso root zzso To obtain an indication for possible functions of zzso we analyzed its expression in the developing and the adult zzso of the zzso In the adult zzso zzso was most strongly expressed in the zzso the zzso formation, the zzso bulb, and the zzso In contrast, most zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso cells were devoid of zzso zzso During embryonic development, zzso zzso was not zzso in zzso but it was expressed in the zzso fields of most zzso regions concurrent with their zzso In the zzso the zzso cells and a zzso of zzso cells were zzso during zzso zzso As a further step toward the zzso of zzso function, we performed a study to identify potential target zzso In zzso zzso formed zzso complexes and inhibited the zzso activity of tissue zzso zzso zzso and zzso In contrast, no complex formation with or zzso of zzso was zzso zzso pattern and zzso specificity zzso zzso as a candidate regulator of zzso zzso which have been suggested to participate in the zzso or reorganization of synaptic connections in the zzso During development, zzso may zzso zzso zzso related to processes such as zzso migration, zzso or the formation of mature synaptic zzso
