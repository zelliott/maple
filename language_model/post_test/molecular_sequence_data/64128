A zzso human zzso zzso display library by zzso zzso acid zzso at zzso was constructed using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were rescued by zzso the zzso zzso coli library stock with zzso the zzso zzso helper zzso containing amber zzso at zzso The library was composed of 2 zzso zzso independent zzso and selected for the specific zzso against zzso zzso zzso by zzso Five soluble zzso clones specific for zzso were finally identified and classified into two groups based on the difference in their binding pattern to zzso Two clones zzso and zzso showed good binding zzso to zzso in zzso but not in Western zzso zzso the rest three clones zzso zzso and zzso reacted to the zzso in Western zzso but not in zzso zzso they bound to somewhat different zzso on zzso DNA sequencing analysis of zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed that zzso of all clones were belonged to zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso I, and zzso and zzso used zzso zzso IV, suggesting that difference in binding pattern between zzso and zzso against zzso might come from the different zzso gene zzso In conclusion, human zzso zzso zzso specific for zzso were successfully isolated and we demonstrated that distinct populations of zzso zzso specific to the target zzso could be isolated by zzso zzso
