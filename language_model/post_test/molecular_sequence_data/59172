The coding region for a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was isolated and zzso Using a pair of zzso designed on the basis of two highly zzso zzso zzso sequences in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a zzso of zzso was amplified by the zzso chain reaction zzso This zzso product was used as an zzso probe to isolate a zzso zzso identified as the central region of zzso zzso by zzso I of this zzso allowed two zzso to be obtained to isolate the zzso and the 3' ends of zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso gene was determined and found to consist of an open reading frame zzso of zzso base pairs zzso coding for a zzso protein with an zzso of zzso The zzso sequence exhibited a high similarity with other zzso The two zzso previously described in zzso are zzso in zzso an zzso zzso domain and a zzso domain composed of a series of zzso Surprisingly, the expected signal zzso was not zzso The entire gene was reconstructed and the activity of zzso was zzso The zzso produced appeared to be composed of zzso alpha zzso and zzso alpha zzso linkages and the zzso zzso in the presence of zzso were mainly composed of alpha zzso zzso This zzso is a novel zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso producing no alpha zzso linkages and is the first zzso having no signal zzso zzso
