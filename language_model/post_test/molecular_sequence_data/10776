The role of the zzso segment zzso of zzso II, a 20 zzso zzso protein from the sea zzso zzso zzso was studied by zzso zzso A part of this segment was classified as being zzso and membrane zzso zzso zzso II and its zzso lacking 5, 10 and 33 zzso acid zzso respectively, were produced in zzso coli using zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso proteins were isolated from bacterial zzso and zzso for their zzso by zzso binding to red blood cells and zzso zzso The zzso deletion of 33 zzso acids resulted in an zzso zzso while zzso lacking 5 and 10 zzso expressed increased relative zzso for zzso and red blood cell zzso Their specific zzso activity was zzso however, with increasing zzso The results suggest that the zzso which has been found to be zzso in sea zzso zzso zzso contributes to the zzso of the zzso II, but it is not essential for binding to zzso zzso It is very likely that the zzso play a role in the formation of functional zzso
