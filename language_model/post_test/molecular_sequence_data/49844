zzso for zzso of bacterial protein synthesis zzso Factor 2 zzso binding to zzso zzso zzso identified a series of zzso that included zzso and zzso zzso as zzso of this zzso zzso testing revealed that zzso displayed a wide range of zzso zzso However, the failure of these compounds to completely inhibit binding of zzso to zzso the known ability of zzso to bind zzso and the ability of the zzso to zzso zzso bound to zzso suggest these compounds act by binding zzso This hypothesis is further supported by zzso zzso experiments that failed to show any interaction between the zzso protein and the zzso
