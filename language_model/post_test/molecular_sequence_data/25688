The zzso effect of zzso zzso located within one strand of zzso DNA, on the zzso activity of the restriction zzso zzso was zzso zzso incorporation of a zzso group at the site of zzso yielded the sequence zzso This modified sequence was zzso at a relative rate of zzso compared to the unmodified zzso zzso zzso and zzso both containing one additional zzso zzso were zzso at a rate of zzso relative to unmodified zzso However, under the same conditions, fully zzso DNA was found to be virtually resistant to the zzso activity of zzso Further experiments showed that zzso DNA fragments generated by zzso containing zzso groups within both strands are potent zzso of zzso zzso The zzso was independent of whether the inhibitor zzso contained an zzso recognition zzso We concluded that substitution of the zzso group at the site of zzso by a zzso zzso decreases the rate of zzso zzso most zzso zzso of other zzso groups within the recognition sequence plays a limited role in zzso zzso The presence of multiple zzso zzso at regions of the DNA removed from the zzso recognition site may decrease the amount of zzso available for zzso by zzso binding to zzso
