zzso zzso zzso is required for rapid degradation of the zzso proteins zzso and zzso by the zzso zzso We have shown elsewhere that zzso interacts with zzso acids zzso of zzso Here we test the hypothesis that this region, rich in zzso zzso acid, zzso and zzso zzso zzso serves as the zzso protein degradation domain zzso An zzso protein lacking this region, zzso was significantly more stable than zzso zzso of more than 6 h versus 55 zzso zzso of the zzso zzso had no effect on the zzso and zzso activity of zzso We mapped two discreet zzso regions within the zzso zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso zzso zzso with zzso but not with human zzso zzso zzso or the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso central zzso zzso with basic zzso abolished interaction with zzso Also, full-length zzso lacking the second zzso region was significantly more stable than zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso into the zzso naturally occurring zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso it, suggesting that this domain can transfer a degradation signal to a zzso zzso zzso zzso protein was stabilized by the zzso inhibitor zzso indicating the role of the zzso system zzso degradation through the zzso degradation zzso Our experiments indicate that the zzso zzso mediates zzso protein interactions with the zzso system and that the zzso zzso is required for metabolism of these widely expressed zzso
