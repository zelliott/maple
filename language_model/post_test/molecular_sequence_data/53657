A new zzso zzso protein zzso from zzso zzso zzso was zzso and zzso The molecular mass of zzso was estimated to be zzso zzso by gel zzso fast protein liquid zzso The zzso sequence was zzso zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas it did not inhibit zzso zzso zzso The zzso value of zzso against zzso zzso was determined to be zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso zzso protein was identified by screening a zzso library using an zzso probe with a sequence based on the zzso sequence of zzso Analysis of the zzso sequence revealed that the gene was zzso base pairs in length and zzso a mature protein of 157 zzso acid zzso preceded by a zzso acid signal zzso zzso comparison of the deduced zzso acid sequence showed 38% identity with zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, the 49th zzso acid zzso of zzso was identical to zzso of zzso that was characterized to be an important zzso for the zzso activity of zzso A modified zzso in which zzso was replaced by zzso zzso was obtained by zzso zzso The zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso coli, were zzso The zzso value of zzso against zzso zzso was similar to that of zzso zzso but the zzso zzso increased the zzso of zzso zzso approximately zzso A disruption zzso of the zzso gene in zzso zzso zzso was obtained by replacing the zzso zzso gene with a copy zzso by inserting a zzso resistance zzso The disruption zzso showed a bald zzso indicating that the zzso gene plays a role in zzso zzso
