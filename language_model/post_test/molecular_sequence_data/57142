The zzso zzso zzso and kinetic properties of the zzso from zzso zzso have been zzso The zzso demonstrates activity towards a wide range of zzso zzso and zzso zzso which terminate with a zzso zzso zzso and zzso exclusively an alpha 2-3 zzso zzso zzso which terminate in Gal beta zzso alpha zzso Gal beta zzso alpha zzso or Gal alpha zzso are not zzso The zzso zzso alpha zzso zzso acid when the donor species is an zzso and can also transfer, at a low rate, zzso acid from synthetic zzso such as zzso acid, but zzso alpha zzso beta zzso alpha zzso is not a zzso The zzso has an apparent pH optimum of zzso and a temperature optimum of 13 degrees zzso The kinetic properties of the zzso suggest that the zzso reaction may occur via a rapid equilibrium random or zzso ordered zzso A method for zzso the zzso is described together with examples of its use for the synthesis of zzso and zzso precursors of zzso and zzso
