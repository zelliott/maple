Human zzso were generated by zzso zzso zzso zzso of B cells derived from tumor draining zzso zzso of cancer zzso zzso were screened for zzso in zzso against a synthetic zzso corresponding to the protein core of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso within this region are in fact considered to be tumor specific since they are selectively exposed on tumor cells due to zzso zzso Human zzso thus selected react in zzso and zzso with zzso tumor zzso This is the first demonstration of the existence of B cell immune response against selected zzso of zzso and, in association with the zzso T cell zzso response already demonstrated, represents the basis for the use of synthetic peptides as vaccines in cancer zzso
