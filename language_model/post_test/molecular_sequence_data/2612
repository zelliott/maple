The zzso zzso immunity protein gene was zzso in the expression zzso zzso and several zzso zzso and point zzso were constructed in the zzso and zzso regions of the zzso The zzso stability, zzso export and protective capacity of the native and zzso immunity proteins were studied by zzso zzso and an in zzso activity zzso In the absence of zzso the zzso native immunity protein was stable produced by zzso coli cells and released after zzso zzso The expression of most of the zzso immunity proteins was strongly reduced and non of the proteins were found to be zzso All zzso in the zzso region strongly affected expression of the zzso probably by causing protein instability and zzso zzso One of these zzso immunity zzso with an zzso zzso in its zzso region, still caused an intermediate immunity of susceptible cells against zzso added zzso zzso zzso in the zzso region of the immunity protein had less effect on its expression and did not affect the protective capacity of the zzso
