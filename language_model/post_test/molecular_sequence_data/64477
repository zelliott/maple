This study established the utility of zzso application of the zzso zzso technique for investigating differential gene zzso Using both total zzso and zzso samples recovered from two zzso cell lines derived from zzso melanoma, we analyzed expression of zzso zzso genes on the human zzso DNA zzso The signals generated on the zzso were clear, strong, and zzso A zzso dot zzso consisting of zzso expressed genes representative of different functional clusters was used to validate the zzso zzso We also cloned a zzso zzso zzso 18 zzso and characterized its expression patterns in tumor samples of different progression zzso zzso expression was observed for the zzso gene in advanced zzso a finding consistent with the zzso zzso These results provide evidence that zzso application of zzso zzso is a useful strategy for investigating gene expression patterns in animal models for which zzso zzso zzso are not zzso
