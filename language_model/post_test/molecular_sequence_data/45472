Here we report a novel domain, zzso zzso involved in bacterial zzso surface proteins and other zzso also present in zzso zzso proteins and zzso zzso which is present in bacteria, zzso and zzso zzso is about zzso zzso acids in length with one zzso motif and some highly zzso zzso including zzso zzso Ala and zzso Secondary structure prediction indicated that this domain contains two zzso and one zzso Identification of zzso will provide an opportunity to develop new strategies to combat zzso zzso especially zzso zzso
