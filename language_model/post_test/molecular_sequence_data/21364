zzso zzso is a globally important zzso The zzso zzso is a leading cause of pneumonia, zzso media, zzso and meningitis, and zzso resistant strains have become increasingly common over recent zzso zzso zzso is a ubiquitous zzso among bacteria and provides the essential cell wall zzso zzso Since it is absent in humans, this zzso is an attractive target for the development of drugs against zzso zzso and other bacterial zzso 

Here we report the crystal structure of zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to a resolution of zzso zzso and belong to the space group zzso with the unit cell parameters a zzso b zzso zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso comparisons show that zzso shares both an overall fold and key active site zzso with other bacterial zzso zzso The active site cavity is similar to other Gram positive zzso zzso featuring a restricted but zzso zzso 

We have solved the structure of zzso an essential step towards the development of an accurate zzso model of the zzso and an important contribution towards our zzso zzso zzso zzso drug design zzso We have identified three regions on the zzso that could be targeted for inhibitor design, the active site, the zzso zzso and the active site zzso
