zzso is a zzso zzso that plays an important role in inflammation and host responses to zzso We have previously shown that imbalances in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso system cause the development of inflammatory zzso To explore the role of the zzso system in zzso disease, we analyzed zzso zzso zzso zzso experimental zzso zzso zzso in mice bearing targeted disruptions of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso mice exhibited significant resistance to zzso induction with a significant reduction in disease severity, while zzso or zzso mice developed zzso in a manner similar to zzso zzso zzso mice also developed zzso zzso normally with zzso toxin zzso zzso In contrast to zzso mice, however, these mice were highly susceptible to zzso induction in the absence of zzso zzso We found that both zzso and zzso production and proliferation were reduced in zzso T cells upon stimulation with zzso while zzso zzso and tumor necrosis zzso production and proliferation were enhanced in zzso T zzso These observations suggest that the zzso system is crucial for zzso T cell induction and contributes to the development of zzso
