The reaction between human zzso zzso and the zzso drug zzso an irreversible inhibitor of the zzso has been studied using the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was found to lose zzso over a period of a few days at 37 degrees C but even in the presence of the zzso zzso zzso no zzso activity zzso At 4 degrees C the zzso inhibitor remained zzso zzso The amount of zzso zzso was significantly less than would be expected if one zzso of inhibitor was bound per zzso of active zzso zzso phase zzso of a zzso digest of the zzso zzso showed that, apart from material zzso at the front of the zzso all of the zzso was in a single zzso This fraction contained a zzso the sequence of which indicated that it included the zzso that binds the zzso and that the major release of zzso occurred in an zzso degradation cycle corresponding to this zzso
