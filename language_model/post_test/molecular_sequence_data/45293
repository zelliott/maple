In plants, type I and II zzso zzso zzso catalyze most zzso group zzso of small zzso A zzso zzso strategy using zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso previously identified six new type I plant zzso family zzso We now describe the molecular and zzso characterization of a seventh zzso It shares zzso identity with zzso acid zzso zzso but it failed to zzso zzso zzso and had no activity with zzso However, the in zzso zzso revealed unusually high background levels without added zzso A search for the responsible component revealed that the zzso zzso zzso zzso the reducing agent added for zzso zzso zzso product analysis revealed that the zzso occurred on a zzso zzso not on a zzso zzso Analysis of 34 compounds indicated a broad zzso range, with a preference for small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 220 zzso and zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso were the best zzso zzso better than zzso Small zzso zzso zzso with zzso groups, like zzso and zzso were also zzso but the activities were at least zzso lower than with zzso The zzso was named zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso Models based on the zzso crystal structure suggest that zzso is mechanistically identical to zzso zzso so far is the only recognized example of an zzso in this protein zzso Its properties indicate that a few changes in key zzso are sufficient to convert an zzso into a zzso zzso Future functional investigations of plant zzso should consider the possibility that the zzso may direct zzso at zzso zzso
