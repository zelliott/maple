We have previously demonstrated the conversion of human zzso zzso to tissue zzso by zzso with the zzso zzso zzso virus zzso zzso The zzso TM have been characterized both zzso and zzso including their zzso potential against colon zzso zzso zzso zzso The present results show that zzso TM produced significant zzso of zzso zzso cells, but essentially no zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cells by the zzso TM was considerably more effective in zzso than in zzso zzso zzso of zzso caused only a slight increase in the extent of zzso of zzso zzso cells by the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso TM with zzso cells in zzso medium resulted in the zzso of zzso cell zzso The results indicate that zzso TM are potent zzso agents of zzso zzso cells, but are considerably less effective against the zzso zzso zzso
