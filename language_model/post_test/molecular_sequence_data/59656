We have studied a family of long repetitive DNA sequences zzso zzso in the large zzso of the European zzso zzso zzso The sequence analysis of a zzso zzso zzso of one member has revealed significant similarities with zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso The similarity of the reverse zzso domain and the gene organization identifies zzso as a member of the zzso class of zzso We zzso that zzso sequences are zzso of an invasion of the zzso zzso that occurred early in the evolutionary history of these European zzso About zzso zzso sequences are present in the large zzso zzso This is the highest number of copies so far discovered for zzso elements in zzso zzso
