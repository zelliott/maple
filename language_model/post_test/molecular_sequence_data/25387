The three zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso were zzso by an original zzso zzso sequence analysis demonstrated that they are two different zzso zzso and zzso and a hybrid zzso zzso arising from the zzso of duplicated zzso The three forms have the same zzso same zzso activity and zzso zzso but different zzso form zzso being more resistant than form zzso with form AB showing intermediate zzso zzso of zzso and the control bovine zzso was enhanced by a tenfold increase in protein zzso It is suggested that the higher heat sensitivity of the AA zzso is related to the presence of an extra zzso zzso and to an easier zzso of the protein zzso into zzso
