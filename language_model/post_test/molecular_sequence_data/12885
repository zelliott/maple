The zzso strain zzso was previously reported to have been isolated from a bank zzso in zzso and associated with the occurrence of zzso fever with zzso syndrome zzso in zzso The complete zzso zzso sequences of the small zzso and medium zzso zzso zzso segments of this virus were zzso Major open reading frames were found in the S and M segment between zzso positions 43 and zzso coding for a zzso of 433 zzso acid zzso and between zzso positions 41 and zzso coding for zzso zzso acid zzso zzso The analysis and the alignment of the zzso and the derived zzso acid sequences with known sequences of other zzso strains demonstrate that zzso resembles Swedish strains and represents a new virus zzso of the zzso zzso distinct from the zzso represented by virus strains zzso and zzso
