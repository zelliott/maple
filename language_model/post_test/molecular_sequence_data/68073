The effect of zzso on the zzso zzso and zzso activities of the so-called zzso form of the rat liver zzso zzso was zzso zzso them with the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively zzso acids are shown as their zzso zzso For the most part neither zzso nor zzso at 20 zzso have any effect on the activity of the zzso zzso at 50 zzso zzso except for zzso which activates zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso which zzso by zzso the zzso of zzso By contrast, zzso zzso is a strong zzso of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso at zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is due to an increase of the affinity of the zzso for the zzso and to an increase in the zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso is explained by suppressing the zzso for this zzso producing zzso zzso with a zzso of 60 zzso and a zzso increase in the zzso of the zzso This zzso by zzso was completely suppressed by zzso zzso of zzso a drug known to inhibit other zzso zzso zzso zzso and the known zzso by zzso are zzso either at zzso or optimal zzso of both zzso zzso also activates the in zzso degradation of some proteins from metabolically zzso total cellular extracts by the zzso zzso zzso These results clearly show that zzso is a natural positive zzso of the zzso and zzso activities of the zzso zzso probably acting through a binding site different from that of zzso
