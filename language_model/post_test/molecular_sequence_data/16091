In two previous studies we described the properties of a zzso zzso protein present in rat liver zzso This zzso zzso termed zzso is capable of selective binding to the zzso zzso of several viral promoters zzso et zzso zzso as well as the core zzso common to many viral enhancers zzso et zzso zzso We now report the isolation of a zzso clone of the gene that encodes zzso zzso of the clone in bacterial cells yields a protein that binds in zzso to both the zzso zzso and the zzso core zzso providing conclusive evidence that a single gene product accounts for both binding zzso By examining the properties of zzso fragments of zzso we have localized its zzso domain to a zzso zzso A zzso segment located within the zzso domain of zzso bears sequence similarity to the products of the zzso and zzso zzso
