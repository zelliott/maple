This paper investigated the envelope protein zzso zzso genetic characterization of 4 zzso positive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso acid was extracted and zzso zzso zzso coding genes were obtained by zzso positive clones were randomly selected for zzso The zzso relationships and the zzso of zzso and zzso acid were analyzed based on zzso coding zzso and some vital functional regions of zzso were zzso A total of 43 sequences zzso 10; zzso 12; zzso 13; zzso 8) were obtained showing high genetic zzso in zzso and zzso regions, while sequences of the zzso zzso zzso domain I, II and zzso zzso were comparatively zzso Single base zzso zzso zzso at zzso ( E1 region, zzso resulting in a zzso E1 coding protein zzso at zzso zzso and interruption at N zzso zzso zzso of zzso region of zzso was dominant zzso zzso found in serum 283 zzso This is the first report on zzso zzso in Chinese zzso patients and this novel pattern of zzso zzso provides important information for further study on zzso zzso and immune zzso
