zzso C zzso particles zzso have been generated from cloned zzso A zzso of the green fluorescent protein zzso gene in zzso orientation was flanked by the zzso and 3' zzso regions of zzso segment 5 of the influenza C zzso The zzso cassette was inserted between an zzso zzso I promoter and zzso of the Pol I zzso This zzso DNA was zzso into zzso cells together with plasmids zzso virus proteins of zzso zzso or zzso Transfer of the zzso of the zzso zzso cells to zzso cells resulted in zzso expression in the zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso cells indicated the presence of approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in length were observed on zzso zzso cells, although the cords were not observed when the zzso for zzso protein of zzso zzso was replaced with that of zzso A series of zzso experiments with plasmids zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso or zzso showed that an zzso acid at zzso 24 of the zzso protein is responsible for zzso zzso This finding provides direct evidence for a previous hypothesis that zzso protein is involved in the formation of zzso structures protruding from the zzso zzso Evidence was obtained by electron zzso that zzso cells bearing cords produced zzso zzso suggesting the potential role of the zzso protein in determining the zzso zzso of influenza C zzso
