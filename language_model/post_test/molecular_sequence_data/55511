The target range of a bacterial zzso system can be defined by zzso zzso specificity or by the efficacy of zzso zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of zzso a type VI zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso with its role as a zzso zzso has a more accessible active site than related zzso zzso The activity of zzso against isolated zzso shows its capacity to act broadly against zzso bacteria and even certain zzso zzso Studies with intact cells indicate that zzso bacteria can remain vulnerable to zzso despite cell wall zzso However, zzso competition studies demonstrate that zzso zzso is restricted to zzso zzso We propose that the previously observed specificity for zzso against zzso bacteria is a consequence of high local zzso concentration achieved by zzso targeting to its site of action rather than inherent zzso zzso zzso
