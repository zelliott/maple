zzso as well as chemical modification studies have implicated the presence of an active site zzso in zzso zzso whose function is to stabilize zzso binding by interacting with the zzso of the zzso A zzso In order to identify this zzso seven zzso zzso in rat zzso zzso were converted to zzso by zzso zzso and the properties of these zzso were compared with the wild type zzso zzso of zzso zzso with zzso resulted in a zzso increase in the zzso for both zzso and zzso as well as zzso with little change in the zzso for zzso zzso zzso studies showed zzso to be a competitive inhibitor with respect to zzso indicating zzso follows the same zzso kinetic mechanism as the wild type zzso Similar results were obtained with zzso and zzso with the latter showing the largest changes in kinetic zzso These findings are consistent with zzso zzso increasing the rate constant, zzso for zzso of the zzso from the zzso zzso evidence that zzso zzso is involved in zzso A binding was obtained by showing a zzso decrease in affinity of the zzso zzso for zzso A as determined by the ability to protect against zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso
