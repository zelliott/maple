Chemical modification of proteins with substances such as zzso zzso can add useful properties to zzso Currently zzso is done in a random manner utilizing zzso zzso dispersed throughout a zzso For proteins such as zzso which have several different functional zzso random modification leads to zzso To determine if we could produce an zzso with a diminished number of zzso zzso so that chemical modification could be restricted to certain regions of the zzso we chose the zzso zzso zzso that has 13 zzso zzso in the zzso portion and 3 in the zzso We prepared a series of zzso with zzso zzso in the zzso and 0 or 3 in the zzso Almost all of these molecules retain full biological zzso Our data indicate that replacement of zzso zzso can be achieve without loss of biological zzso These molecules are a useful starting point to carry out zzso zzso zzso
