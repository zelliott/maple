A novel human gene zzso with properties of a zzso zzso gene for small cell lung zzso zzso is zzso zzso is an evolutionary zzso gene that is expressed zzso in human zzso zzso zzso is absent in a subset of zzso cell lines known as zzso zzso that are derived from tumors characterized by highly aggressive zzso zzso Introduction of zzso into a zzso zzso line results in significant suppression of its zzso in zzso When deprived of growth factors in zzso zzso cells modified to express zzso undergo rapid and massive cell death that at least partially could be ascribed to the zzso of the zzso zzso In addition, expression of zzso in zzso cells increases induction of zzso by zzso zzso Loss of zzso in highly zzso cells such as zzso might render them resistant to zzso signals and thus help to ensure their survival under zzso conditions encountered in the zzso zzso
