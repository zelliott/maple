zzso zzso in zzso zzso frequently involve the zzso zzso zzso locus at zzso zzso Although zzso abnormalities are found in about zzso of adult zzso leukemia zzso cases, until now there has been no direct evidence showing involvement of the zzso locus in zzso zzso closely associated with zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso most commonly occur within the zzso or zzso region of the zzso zzso In ATL, however, despite extensive searching no zzso has yet been found in that zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso with a panel of zzso and bacterial artificial zzso zzso derived from zzso 14, including the variable region of the zzso zzso comprehensive analysis of an ATL patient carrying zzso revealed that the zzso locus was indeed involved in this zzso zzso cloning of the zzso revealed the juxtaposition of zzso zzso to the zzso region as a result of two consecutive zzso zzso and zzso We also found a gene near the zzso at the zzso region that is zzso in this ATL patient and is assigned in the database as a zzso of zzso (a zzso and zzso domain zzso Our expression analysis, however, showed that this zzso was actually expressed and was capable of zzso a protein similar to zzso thus we have named this gene zzso zzso
