zzso channels allow bacteria to survive rapid increases in zzso zzso zzso questions remain as to how these channels sense and respond to mechanical zzso Here we describe a set of zzso with zzso in their zzso channel zzso The zzso were detected zzso by their enhanced ability to modify the zzso of zzso zzso Some zzso acid changes lie in the putative pore region of zzso but others affect sequences that lie zzso to the domain aligning with zzso We demonstrate that the zzso in zzso cause the channel to open more frequently in the absence of excessive mechanical zzso This is zzso in changes in sensitivity to external zzso by cells expressing the zzso zzso zzso analysis highlighted a range of gating zzso zzso at lower pressures than the wild type, inability to achieve the fully open state or a modified requirement for zzso Thus, the dominant zzso zzso of these zzso may result from a zzso in their ability to regulate the gating of zzso The locations of the zzso zzso suggest that the overall gating mechanism of zzso is comparable to that of zzso but with subtleties introduced by the additional protein sequences in zzso
