We describe the generation of an zzso zzso zzso that zzso the zzso activity of zzso in zzso and in zzso The zzso was derived from a zzso mouse that was zzso with a zzso zzso zzso is one of the highest affinity and specific zzso zzso reported to zzso The zzso for zzso was approximately 300 zzso and zzso toward zzso other than zzso was less than zzso The addition of zzso to zzso blocked the binding of zzso to cell zzso zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso In functional studies, zzso neutralized the capacity of zzso to suppress T cell proliferation induced by a zzso zzso zzso in zzso In contrast, zzso by the zzso zzso zzso was not zzso In an in zzso model of zzso zzso substantially reduced the zzso response of mice to zzso This response is associated with zzso production and is blocked by zzso of zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that this zzso response is largely due to zzso In the absence of zzso that prevent zzso from zzso a diverse family of zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso should represent useful zzso to delineate the zzso properties of this zzso in zzso
