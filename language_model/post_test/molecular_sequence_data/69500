zzso inhibitor is a zzso protein that tightly binds and zzso zzso of the pancreatic zzso zzso The primary sequence of this inhibitor contains zzso repeats zzso these motifs are present in many proteins that participate in zzso interactions and have different functions and cellular zzso In zzso zzso inhibitor may have a role in the regulation of zzso turnover in zzso cells and in zzso To define the structural features of zzso proteins and to understand better the nature of the tight interaction of zzso inhibitor with zzso we have determined the crystal structure of the zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first three-dimensional structure of a protein containing zzso and represents a new class of zzso protein zzso Individual repeats constitute zzso structural units that probably also occur in other proteins containing zzso The zzso shape of the structure and the exposed face of the parallel zzso may explain why zzso are used to achieve strong zzso zzso A possible zzso region incorporates the surface formed by the parallel zzso and the beta alpha zzso
