The zzso shepherd zzso zzso shows expanded shoot zzso zzso zzso and floral zzso zzso zzso root zzso zzso and defects in zzso tube zzso We have discovered that zzso encodes an zzso of zzso an zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso in SAM and zzso are similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso we have explored the possibility that zzso complex members could be zzso zzso The SAM and zzso zzso of zzso zzso double zzso are indistinguishable from those of zzso single zzso and the zzso zzso zzso is completely zzso to the zzso zzso indicating that zzso and zzso act in the same genetic zzso to suppress zzso zzso Moreover, the effects of zzso zzso that result in the elimination of SAM activity were abolished in the zzso zzso indicating that zzso function is dependent on zzso zzso zzso we conclude that the zzso protein is required for the correct folding and/or complex formation of zzso zzso
