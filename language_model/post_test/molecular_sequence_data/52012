zzso melanoma is frequently characterized by the deletion of the long arm of zzso 6 (usually encompassing zzso In an effort to zzso this region with DNA zzso zzso and molecular cloning of DNA from banded human zzso recent development of a novel zzso zzso scheme that omits zzso manipulation of zzso zzso was targeted on band zzso zzso zzso amplification of dissected DNA was first used as a probe in zzso in zzso zzso of normal zzso to confirm the specificity of material excised for zzso A zzso library of 20,000 zzso which is highly enriched for sequences encompassing zzso was then zzso zzso from this library have been mapped against a zzso zzso cell hybrid mapping panel that divides zzso 6 into seven regions, confirming the zzso of zzso within the target zzso zzso zzso amplification of DNA excised by zzso greatly zzso and zzso this zzso zzso cloning zzso The isolation of zzso from this region of zzso 6 should assist in establishing a physical map of the melanoma deletion zzso
