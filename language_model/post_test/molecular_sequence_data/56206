A large number zzso of human zzso fragments reacting with zzso surface zzso zzso have been generated by selection from a zzso zzso zzso library displayed on the surface of zzso The library was prepared from a long term zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the sequences from these zzso shows the heavy chains can be placed in groups, many of which contain zzso zzso almost certainly corresponding to chains used in zzso Further zzso can be zzso via chain zzso experiments in which a given light chain is zzso with a library of heavy zzso Heavy chain zzso zzso the ability of heavy chains to pair with different light chains with retention of zzso zzso is dependent on the particular heavy chain considered and probably excludes the identification of in zzso light chain zzso The zzso examined here are primarily to the zzso binding site on zzso and broadly reflect the serum profile of the zzso The zzso show evidence of extensive zzso modification indicative of an zzso zzso The heavy chain zzso regions of the zzso show a remarkably zzso extended zzso A number also show strong sequence conservation in zzso against a background of considerable diversity in the rest of the zzso gene supporting a central role for this region in zzso zzso
