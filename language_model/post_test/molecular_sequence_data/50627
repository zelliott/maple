The gene zzso the major zzso zzso zzso of minute virus of mice zzso was transferred into a zzso zzso virus zzso in place of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene was placed under control of a zzso zzso promoter and expressed in cells zzso with another zzso zzso virus, zzso which encodes the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was further enhanced by the presence of a zzso untranslated region, derived from zzso virus, which allows efficient zzso zzso This system was used to produce and analyze zzso zzso and two zzso forms of the zzso zzso and zzso in which the highly zzso zzso zzso located in the putative zzso zzso binding site of zzso was changed to zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed efficiently in both human and mouse cells infected with each of the three zzso zzso and in each case the zzso was rapidly and efficiently zzso into the zzso zzso zzso expressed in this way was biologically zzso It was able to zzso an zzso zzso promoter located in a host zzso site, whereas the two zzso forms of zzso showed no significant activity in this zzso and it was capable of resolving zzso junction fragments cloned from zzso zzso zzso form DNA zzso These zzso representing zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were resolved in a DNA zzso in zzso reaction supplemented with nuclear extracts containing zzso zzso zzso Neither of the two zzso forms of the zzso had any zzso activity in this zzso
