The genetic zzso of the envelope surface domain zzso of zzso zzso virus zzso of African green monkeys was zzso To assess the zzso diversity of zzso zzso were obtained from 19 animals living together in a monkey zzso The monkeys had been imported from Kenya prior to being placed in long-term housing in the research zzso In addition, a zzso zzso isolate and zzso DNA were obtained from an animal caretaker infected in this zzso DNA of the complete zzso zzso to zzso zzso was analyzed by zzso and zzso The sequences revealed four clusters with high zzso zzso Between the zzso zzso ranged from 3 to zzso Obviously, the clusters reflect four different strains or zzso of zzso zzso type 3 that were prevalent in the zzso In contrast to zzso zzso regions could not be detected in the zzso zzso Furthermore, to analyze the zzso diversity of zzso we investigated the virus population within an individual monkey at a given time point and its evolution over 13 zzso For this purpose, 22 zzso zzso clones generated by zzso from one oral zzso and seven zzso obtained from the same animal between 1982 and 1995 were zzso These sequences revealed exceptionally high zzso rates zzso to zzso and only a minimal genetic drift was recognized within the series of zzso In conclusion, the low in zzso zzso of zzso zzso suggests that genetic zzso is not important for the maintenance of zzso zzso
