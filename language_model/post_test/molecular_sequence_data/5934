zzso zzso is a zzso zzso discovered through its ability to zzso the zzso zzso zzso Although found in all zzso in zzso and in both zzso and zzso the normal cellular function of this zzso is not zzso We had previously reported the zzso of zzso zzso from zzso based on its unexpected ability to bind zzso Recently we collaborated in solving the crystal structure of this zzso revealing a zzso ring zzso We now report that the molecular characterization of the gene zzso zzso zzso zzso is also zzso The zzso of the gene is regulated by zzso Furthermore, this regulation is conveyed by a binding site for the zzso regulatory protein in its promoter, prompting the designation of this gene as zzso zzso also appears to have a negative effect on the zzso system as a deletion of the gene leads to a zzso higher expression of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso deletion does not affect the expression of another zzso zzso zzso Neither the zzso nor the zzso acid binding activity of zzso as zzso is apparently required to convey this regulation, zzso yet another function for this new member of the zzso zzso
