zzso zzso is zzso in zzso cells by two zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso primarily uses zzso as a zzso for exchange with zzso whereas zzso uses zzso zzso We previously expressed zzso zzso in McArdle zzso zzso The activity of zzso in zzso and the synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso were increased, whereas zzso synthesis from the zzso zzso was inhibited zzso zzso and Vance zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now cloned and zzso expressed a zzso zzso zzso in McArdle cells and zzso cells zzso are zzso zzso Chinese zzso zzso zzso cells defective in zzso zzso of the zzso in zzso cells reversed the zzso zzso However, the zzso content was not zzso unless the culture medium was supplemented with zzso In both zzso and zzso cells zzso with zzso zzso the rate of synthesis of zzso and zzso zzso did not exceed that in parental zzso cells or control McArdle cells respectively, in contrast to cells expressing similar levels of zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso synthesis via zzso zzso but not zzso is regulated by zzso zzso Moreover, expression of zzso zzso in McArdle cells did not inhibit zzso synthesis via the zzso pathway, whereas expression of similar levels of zzso activity inhibited this zzso by zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso and zzso which are apparently derived from different zzso independently zzso zzso zzso In addition, zzso zzso the two zzso are zzso expressed in several zzso zzso supporting the idea that zzso and zzso might perform unique zzso
