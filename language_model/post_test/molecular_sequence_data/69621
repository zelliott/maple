The genes zzso two of the zzso of the zzso zzso origin recognition complex zzso have been zzso zzso of a zzso zzso in the gene zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso indicates that this protein complex functions early in the DNA replication zzso Moreover, zzso derived from zzso cells is defective for DNA zzso Others have shown a zzso in zzso cells in zzso zzso at the silent zzso zzso zzso with this finding, zzso specifically binds to each of the four zzso zzso identified in zzso These findings support the hypothesis that zzso acts as an zzso protein at zzso origins of DNA replication and suggest that zzso also functions in the determination of zzso zzso
