We have identified a novel member of the zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso as a gene product that is induced in the mouse zzso during fear memory consolidation and examined a possible function of this zzso in neural zzso zzso of zzso zzso was detected in various cortical and zzso brain regions, as well as zzso zzso Its expression in the zzso was increased 6 h after zzso fear conditioning training and returned to control levels within 24 zzso To study zzso zzso and functions of zzso zzso fusion proteins were expressed in rat zzso zzso cells and acutely isolated cortical zzso thereby revealing an association of zzso with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso in spines and at sites of cell zzso zzso and pull-down experiments support this zzso Evidence for an involvement of zzso in zzso cellular functions further comes from the observation of decreased cell spreading and changes in zzso outgrowth that were associated with protein zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Together, our data suggest that zzso is an interesting candidate gene for the regulation of structural processes in zzso and mature zzso zzso
