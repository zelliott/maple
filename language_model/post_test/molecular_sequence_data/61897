We report the cloning and zzso of full-length zzso complementary to zzso zzso zzso two zzso zzso zzso from a plant zzso zzso the potato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One protein has a functional signal zzso that targets the protein for zzso from animal cells while the other is predicted to be zzso Both genes are expressed in all zzso stages zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso is present throughout the zzso second stage juvenile and is particularly abundant in metabolically active zzso including the zzso zzso The zzso zzso the zzso zzso is restricted to the zzso the zzso cellular layer of the zzso a location from which it is likely to be zzso to the zzso zzso zzso studies confirmed the zzso protein as a functional zzso and showed that, like zzso zzso of other zzso zzso it does not zzso hydrogen zzso but has a preference for larger zzso zzso The zzso protein is likely to have a role in metabolism of active oxygen species derived from internal body metabolism while the zzso protein may protect the zzso from host zzso Other functional roles for this protein are zzso
