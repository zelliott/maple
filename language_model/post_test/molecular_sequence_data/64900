zzso shuttle zzso that contain both zzso zzso zzso and zzso origins of replication are routinely used in molecular biology since zzso coli is generally the zzso of choice for manipulation of zzso zzso zzso transformation of the shuttle zzso into zzso coli allows production of zzso quantities of DNA suitable for transformation of zzso zzso A zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso allows zzso protein fused to the killer toxin signal sequence to be zzso to the zzso The zzso genes are transcribed under the control of the zzso zzso zzso promoter, which is tightly regulated in zzso zzso However, in zzso coli the zzso promoter functions zzso and as a result, uncontrolled zzso and translation of genes that are toxic in zzso coli can result in cell death, and subsequent failure to recover intact zzso coli zzso We have constructed and tested a modified shuttle zzso that contains a zzso zzso zzso zzso that acts as a zzso zzso in zzso coli, preventing or reducing the expression of zzso proteins and avoiding zzso When transcribed in zzso zzso the zzso is spliced from the zzso allowing the translation of intact zzso active zzso gene zzso
