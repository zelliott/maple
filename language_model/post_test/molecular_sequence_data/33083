The zzso zzso group includes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso The small acid soluble spore protein zzso beta has been previously demonstrated to be among the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso beta of zzso zzso most commonly exhibits one or two zzso acid zzso when compared to zzso zzso zzso alpha is zzso in sequence among these two zzso Neither zzso alpha nor beta for zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been previously characterized as zzso zzso In the current work molecular weight zzso variation of these zzso were determined by zzso assisted laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso for representative strains of the 5 species within the zzso zzso zzso The measured zzso also correlate with calculated zzso of translated zzso acid sequences generated from whole zzso sequencing zzso zzso alpha and beta demonstrated consistent zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains zzso zzso However zzso zzso zzso 2) and zzso zzso zzso alpha and beta were quite distinct making them unique among the zzso zzso zzso Limited sequence changes were observed in zzso alpha (at most 3 zzso and 2 zzso indicating it is a more zzso protein than zzso beta (up to 6 zzso and a zzso Another even more zzso zzso zzso zzso type, was described here for the first zzso
