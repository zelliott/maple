Several groups have emphasized the likely implication of the zzso C virus zzso in a fraction of zzso zzso zzso Since only a minority of patients with zzso infection and zzso mixed zzso develop overt lymphoma, the identification of zzso factors has relevant clinical zzso The replication error zzso zzso as revealed by widespread zzso instability, is caused by defects in DNA mismatch repair zzso and has been frequently disclosed in zzso of zzso zzso with underlying infection and chronic zzso We therefore investigated the occurrence of the zzso zzso in a series of eight consecutive zzso zzso in patients with chronic infection by zzso A zzso chain zzso zzso was used to zzso an extended panel of 15 zzso zzso zzso instability was not observed in six zzso samples in any zzso the two remaining cases showed instability at only one zzso Therefore genetic instability by defects in DNA mismatch repair genes should not represent the general mechanism zzso to overt zzso in zzso zzso Although a clearer definition of zzso zzso disorders should better address future studies on genetic instability in larger series, we recommend additional zzso pathways as the target of further zzso
