zzso are among the smallest and simplest of all zzso but they are relatively poorly zzso Here, we zzso sampled two zzso zzso populations from zzso over a period of 11 years and screened for the zzso zzso and feather disease virus zzso During the sampling period, a severe outbreak of zzso beak and feather disease, which is caused by zzso occurred in Echo zzso zzso this data set presents an ideal system for studying the evolution of a pathogen in a natural population and to understand the zzso changes that cause zzso zzso we discovered that the outbreak was most likely caused by changes in functionally important regions of the normally zzso zzso protein gene and not the zzso zzso Moreover, these zzso were completely fixed in the Echo zzso host population very shortly after the zzso Several zzso zzso were linked to the zzso protein outbreak zzso suggesting that whereas the key changes occurred in the latter, the scope of the outbreak and the selective sweep may have been influenced by positive selection in the zzso We found evidence for viral transmission between the two host populations though evidence for the invasive species as the source of the outbreak was zzso Finally, the high evolutionary rate that we estimated shows how rapidly new variation can arise in zzso and is consistent with recent results from other small zzso DNA zzso
