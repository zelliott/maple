In zzso cells, zzso plays a key role in zzso control of cell proliferation in response to growth zzso Because of the reliance on zzso control in early zzso development, we cloned a zzso zzso of zzso and investigated the activity profile of zzso during zzso zzso maturation and early zzso zzso activity is high in resting zzso and decreases to background levels upon stimulation of maturation with zzso During embryonic development, three zzso of activity were zzso immediately after zzso shortly before the zzso transition, and during zzso zzso an inhibitor of zzso zzso caused zzso to undergo zzso zzso breakdown earlier than control zzso and sensitivity to zzso was zzso zzso of a zzso zzso active zzso of zzso reversed the effects of zzso However, increases in zzso zzso were not significantly affected by zzso during zzso zzso zzso which does not contain a zzso zzso tract zzso was translated earlier, and a larger amount of zzso protein was produced in zzso zzso In zzso eggs zzso treatment increased the translation of the zzso zzso which lacks a zzso zzso zzso in zzso using both DNA and zzso reporter zzso with the zzso from zzso factor 2 showed decreased zzso activity with zzso whereas zzso without a zzso or with an internal zzso entry site were translated more efficiently upon zzso zzso These results suggest that changes in zzso activity during zzso maturation and early zzso selectively alter the zzso capacity available for zzso lacking a zzso zzso
