We recently reported the enhanced zzso of a zzso zzso when it was presented as a fusion protein with zzso B core zzso In those experiments the fusion protein was expressed in zzso zzso We have now refined the system so that large amounts of highly zzso particles can be produced using a simple bacterial expression zzso We describe the expression of three different viral zzso as zzso particles that induce good zzso responses to each zzso after one dose of low amounts of zzso Finally we demonstrate that the zzso is a reflection of both T helper cell sites within the core protein and also the particulate nature of the zzso
