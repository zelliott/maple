The zzso factor zzso plays a key role in the zzso of many cellular and viral gene zzso including those that are regulated during the cell zzso However, recent evidence indicates that zzso belongs to a larger family of factors which bind zzso box elements in order to either activate or repress zzso zzso a member of this family, functions to repress zzso zzso in two viral zzso most likely by competing with zzso for zzso zzso binding zzso However, the zzso role of zzso in the repression of zzso cellular promoters has not been zzso zzso In the present study, we analyze the activity and binding of zzso on several zzso promoters that contain zzso boxes and are known to be regulated during cellular proliferation and the cell zzso Using zzso specific for zzso and zzso we observe that both of these factors zzso to the cell nucleus and have a similar, dispersed zzso zzso Further, using gel mobility shift zzso we show that both zzso and zzso interact specifically with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso cells with zzso and zzso expression zzso and with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso promoters show that only the zzso promoter, containing multiple functional zzso boxes, displays zzso repression of zzso zzso In contrast, the single zzso boxes within the zzso zzso or zzso zzso which zzso zzso zzso via zzso zzso are not responsive to repression by zzso zzso we demonstrate that the zzso cellular zzso promoter is selectively responsive to zzso zzso The data suggest that zzso may contribute to the control of zzso and/or zzso promoters depending upon the context and/or number of functional zzso binding zzso
