The results of this study suggest that the zzso zzso zzso zzso 3 zzso is expressed in human white zzso zzso A beta zzso zzso zzso could be detected in human zzso fat zzso zzso by zzso chain reaction amplification with appropriate zzso The expression of the beta zzso zzso in human fat was confirmed by Northern zzso zzso however, the level of its zzso was lower than those of the beta zzso and beta zzso zzso Two populations of zzso zzso zzso sites were identified in human zzso fat zzso one with a high affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso and the other with a low affinity zzso zzso 22 zzso The low affinity binding site population, which should represent the beta zzso zzso was zzso zzso of the total binding zzso
