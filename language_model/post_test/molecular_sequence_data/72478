zzso vascular smooth muscle cells zzso in healthy vessels are zzso distinct from their zzso counterparts in vascular zzso To compare the genes expressed in these zzso we have previously performed a differential zzso library screen on cultured rat zzso The aim of this study was to identify and zzso a zzso zzso transcript, zzso which was highly expressed in freshly dispersed rat zzso zzso and zzso in multiply zzso cultured zzso 

zzso analysis was used to identify the zzso zzso rat zzso After zzso of zzso cultured rat and human zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso media, total zzso zzso was isolated from zzso by zzso in zzso zzso and extraction in zzso 15 zzso of total zzso zzso was used in Northern zzso analysis with a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in zzso to frozen sections of normal and diseased human coronary zzso 

DNA sequencing identified zzso as a rat zzso which is zzso to the human zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that this zzso was more highly expressed in zzso freshly dispersed rat and human zzso zzso compared with their zzso zzso zzso This also identified a zzso zzso transcript zzso with the zzso probe which is specific to differentiated rat zzso zzso However, expression in growth arrested and zzso zzso was zzso suggesting that zzso does not have a role in zzso growth zzso In zzso zzso of the zzso zzso to sections of diseased human coronary arteries indicated much higher expression in zzso than in zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso from the developing rat zzso showed that zzso expression increased substantially after week 2 of zzso life, zzso with expression of zzso zzso zzso 

The greater expression of a zzso zzso transcript in zzso differentiated zzso compared with proliferating, synthetic zzso provides a new gene marker for the zzso zzso of zzso in zzso This, and the finding that the zzso induction of expression of zzso zzso mirrors that of zzso zzso zzso suggests that zzso a protein known to associate with and degrade zzso proteins in skeletal muscle, is involved in the function or maintenance of the zzso zzso of zzso
