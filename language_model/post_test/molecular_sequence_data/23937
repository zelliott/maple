zzso of replication fork progression often occurs during DNA zzso and repairing and zzso stalled replication zzso are essential events in all organisms for the maintenance of zzso zzso The repair system employs processing zzso to restore the stalled zzso In zzso zzso is a well zzso protein that specifically zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso This zzso contains two distinct zzso that are similar to the zzso zzso family and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of truncated zzso proteins consisting of each domain revealed that the zzso zzso domain independently recognized and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso domain also specifically zzso zzso DNA and Holliday junction DNA in the presence of zzso Moreover, the zzso activity of the whole zzso protein was clearly zzso by zzso zzso zzso by the zzso zzso These zzso properties suggest that zzso efficiently resolves stalled replication zzso by two steps, which are branch point transfer to the zzso of the nascent lagging strand by the zzso zzso followed by template strand incision for leading strand synthesis by the zzso zzso
