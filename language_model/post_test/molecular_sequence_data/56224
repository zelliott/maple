Single zzso acid zzso for zzso zzso in zzso E of the zzso gene zzso protein zzso of zzso coli have been reported to abolish zzso of zzso without zzso binding to the zzso site of the zzso zzso The negative charge of zzso was proposed to transmit the zzso signal from zzso to zzso zzso However, this idea has been challenged by later zzso We set up a system to re-examine this zzso We zzso the ability of zzso zzso and zzso proteins to bind a zzso zzso site in zzso and found it to be diminished fourfold relative to wild type in each zzso zzso of zzso zzso by these zzso proteins remains the same as with zzso zzso Thus our results confirm that zzso in zzso E of zzso is not involved directly in the zzso of zzso Yet zzso does not activate zzso as well as zzso zzso under all zzso zzso reasons for this absence of zzso are zzso
