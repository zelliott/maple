zzso disease zzso is an inherited neurodegenerative disease caused by expansion of a zzso repeat in the HD protein zzso zzso zzso within the cell includes an association with zzso elements and zzso We previously identified a protein zzso which binds to zzso in a zzso repeat zzso zzso We now report that zzso interacts with zzso zzso namely the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and the zzso protein zzso zzso predictions indicate that both zzso and the interacting proteins have a high probability of forming coiled zzso We examined the interaction of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso to zzso zzso zzso acids zzso was confirmed in zzso by binding of zzso zzso to a zzso fusion protein immobilized on zzso zzso Also, zzso zzso with zzso zzso from brain zzso indicating that the interaction occurs in zzso zzso Like zzso zzso zzso is highly expressed in zzso in brain and both proteins are enriched in a nerve terminal zzso zzso Double label zzso experiments in zzso zzso cells using zzso zzso revealed that zzso and zzso zzso partially zzso These results suggest that zzso might function as an zzso protein using coiled coils to mediate interactions among zzso zzso and motor zzso Thus, zzso and zzso may play a role in zzso trafficking within the cell and disruption of this function could contribute to the zzso dysfunction and death seen in zzso
