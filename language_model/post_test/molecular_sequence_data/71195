The zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso is essential for muscle organization and embryonic zzso zzso evidence suggests the zzso gene product controls muscle thick filament zzso We report here on the determination of the zzso zzso location and the isolation and sequencing of its zzso The zzso zzso of the predicted zzso protein contains three tandem repeats that belong in the zzso repeat zzso zzso motifs have been shown to be involved in protein zzso and some of the closest zzso have zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the protein has zzso with the related zzso zzso zzso and zzso which have been zzso to play a role in assembly of or interactions with a zzso zzso We have also determined the sequence of the zzso gene from zzso zzso which demonstrates a high level of zzso We show that the zzso gene promoter can drive reporter gene zzso which is limited to muscle zzso zzso body wall, zzso and zzso zzso consistent with a role for the zzso gene in muscle development or zzso
