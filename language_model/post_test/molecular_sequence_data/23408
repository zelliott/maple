Can sequence segments coding for zzso targeting or for zzso modifications occur in proteins that are not zzso in either of these zzso Although considerable effort has been invested in achieving low zzso prediction rates, even accurate zzso tools for the recognition of these motifs generate a small but noticeable number of protein hits that lack the appropriate biological context but cannot be rationalized as false zzso 

We show that the zzso zzso of a set of definitely zzso proteins with predicted zzso targeting signals interact with the zzso zzso protein zzso zzso 5 zzso in a zzso zzso zzso Moreover, we show that examples of these proteins - chicken zzso human zzso and the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso by zzso - are imported into zzso in zzso if their original sorting signals are zzso We also show that even zzso proteins can contain zzso targeting zzso 

Thus, functional zzso signals can evolve in unrelated protein sequences as a result of neutral zzso and zzso targeting is zzso zzso with signal accessibility playing a decisive zzso The occurrence of silent functional motifs in unrelated proteins is important for the development of zzso function prediction tools and the interpretation of their zzso Silent functional signals have the potential to acquire importance in future evolutionary scenarios and in pathological zzso
