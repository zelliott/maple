The zzso zzso gene is expressed by various stimuli including zzso or viral infections, such as human zzso leukemia virus type I zzso However, it has not been well established how zzso zzso the expression of the zzso zzso In the present study, we demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso zzso could stimulate zzso zzso gene zzso Furthermore, we showed that the zzso B binding site zzso zzso B zzso located between zzso and zzso upstream of the cap site of the zzso gene was an essential zzso element for zzso zzso of the zzso gene expression by utilizing a series of zzso deletion zzso of the zzso zzso zzso region as well as a construct with a zzso zzso zzso B zzso We identified the presence of two nuclear factor complexes that bound to the zzso zzso B zzso One was zzso zzso and the other was zzso by zzso Taken together, zzso zzso directly zzso zzso gene expression through the zzso zzso B site, indicating the close association between zzso overproduction and zzso zzso
