Among zzso zzso present in 90 nurse shark zzso light chain zzso zzso 338 constitute 2-4 zzso stretches of adjacent zzso An absence of zzso in zzso sequences and the bias for one mutating V gene in adults suggest that the diversification is zzso zzso The zzso shared no patterns, and the absence of donor zzso including from family members, supports the idea that most changes arose from zzso zzso The tandem zzso as a group are distinguished by consistently fewer transition changes and an A zzso We suggest this is one of several pathways of zzso diversifying shark zzso zzso zzso tandem zzso and zzso with a zzso zzso zzso with or preceded gene zzso
