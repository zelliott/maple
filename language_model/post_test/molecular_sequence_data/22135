zzso contains a zzso zzso and is a secondary zzso produced by zzso zzso In the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso and zzso zzso a protein similar to copper zzso for zzso are zzso An expression study of zzso and zzso in zzso coli showed that zzso activated zzso by transferring copper zzso to zzso as has been observed for a zzso zzso system in which the zzso copper zzso transfers copper zzso to zzso zzso In contrast with zzso zzso showed no zzso activity, although it oxidized various zzso as preferable zzso rather than zzso zzso zzso of the zzso locus on the zzso resulted in zzso of zzso zzso and its zzso compound, zzso zzso oxidized zzso to yield an zzso zzso zzso which was then zzso coupled with another zzso of the zzso zzso to form a zzso The coexistence of zzso in the in zzso zzso of zzso by zzso resulted in the formation of zzso A, suggesting that the zzso group of zzso is zzso to the zzso zzso formed from zzso and that the zzso is presumably coupled with another zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is thus a novel zzso zzso that is responsible for the formation of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso
