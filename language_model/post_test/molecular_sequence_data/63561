The investigated green sulfur zzso strain M, was isolated from a zzso spring on the Black Sea Coast of the zzso The cells of strain M are straight or curved rods zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso According to the cell wall structure, the bacteria are zzso zzso are located along the cell zzso zzso M is an zzso zzso capable of zzso growth on zzso zzso and zzso It zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as nitrogen sources and zzso zzso and zzso sulfur as sulfur zzso zzso c and the zzso zzso are the main zzso The optimal growth temperature is zzso degrees zzso the optimal pH is zzso The strain does not require zzso Vitamin B12 stimulates zzso The content of the zzso base pairs in the DNA of strain M is zzso zzso zzso In the zzso tree constructed on the basis of analysis of zzso sequences of zzso zzso zzso strain M forms a separate branch, which occupies an intermediate position between the zzso cluster containing representatives of the zzso zzso zzso and the cluster containing species of the zzso zzso zzso According to the results of analysis of the zzso acid sequence corresponding to the zzso zzso strain M represents a branch which, unlike that in the zzso tree, falls into the cluster of the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso acid sequence corresponding to the zzso gene placed species of the zzso zzso and zzso into a single zzso whereas strain M formed a separate zzso The results obtained allow us to describe strain M as a new species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
