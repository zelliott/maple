Evidence suggests that zzso terminal extensions of zzso affect the zzso terminal zzso region of zzso Cat zzso was zzso by low pressure reverse phase and zzso zzso steps and several reverse phase zzso zzso The zzso zzso and its zzso fragments were characterized by mass spectral analysis and zzso zzso The structure of cat zzso is: zzso zzso Cat and dog zzso are identical except for position 40 which is zzso in cat and zzso in zzso zzso detected cat zzso about zzso as well as dog zzso indicating a marked effect on zzso zzso Cat zzso with a zzso at position 40, the same zzso found in zzso zzso cow and rabbit zzso can be used as a unique zzso for defining how zzso terminal zzso acids influence the structure and zzso of the zzso terminal region of zzso
