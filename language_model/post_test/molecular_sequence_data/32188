How species respond to an increased availability of habitat, for example at the end of the last zzso has been well zzso In contrast, little is known about the opposite process, when the amount of habitat zzso The hypothesis of habitat tracking predicts that species should be able to track both increases and decreases in habitat zzso The alternative hypothesis is that populations outside zzso become extinct during periods of zzso zzso To test these zzso we used ancient DNA techniques to examine genetic variation in the arctic fox zzso zzso through an zzso zzso The results show that the arctic fox in zzso Europe became extinct at the end of the zzso and did not track the habitat when it shifted to the zzso Instead, a high genetic similarity between the extant populations in zzso and zzso suggests an eastern origin for the zzso population at the end of the last zzso These results provide new insights into how species respond to climate change, since they suggest that populations are unable to track decreases in habitat zzso This implies that arctic species may be particularly vulnerable to increases in global zzso
