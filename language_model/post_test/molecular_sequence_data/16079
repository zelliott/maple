zzso The bovine zzso gene has been isolated as a series of overlapping zzso clones and shown to consist of five zzso distributed over a total length of approximately 13 zzso Most of the mature zzso sequence is contained in a single large zzso zzso zzso zzso of the gene has been zzso together with portions of the zzso and zzso zzso The immediate zzso sequence contains several motifs which are characteristic of upstream regions including a zzso box, a zzso box, a sequence similar to that recognized by zzso factor zzso and a zzso sequence resembling that found upstream in all other zzso zzso Other possible regulatory sequences are found upstream of zzso zzso zzso The organization of the zzso zzso together with its upstream zzso confirms previous conclusions that it is unrelated to the zzso gene family to which it is zzso Evidence is presented which supports a previous suggestion that zzso and the zzso are zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences contain several examples of the A family of the zzso zzso repeated zzso together with a single example of a zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso of the zzso zzso compared with the repeat elements and zzso are A + zzso zzso Among the zzso clones isolated, representatives were found of the A and B genetic zzso which can be distinguished by zzso zzso Several other examples of zzso in the zzso region were zzso
