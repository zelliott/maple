zzso is a zzso important in animal development and regulatory processes and is found selectively localized at the zzso site of the mouse zzso To better understand the role of zzso at the zzso zzso a binding partner was isolated and zzso zzso of zzso tissue were incubated with immobilized zzso zzso and specifically bound proteins were zzso using zzso The principal zzso zzso had an zzso of 400,000 in zzso Physical properties of zzso and zzso acid sequences of seven zzso peptides were similar to zzso from rats, humans, and dogs, identifying zzso as the zzso zzso of zzso This was further supported by the tissue distribution observed only in zzso zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso for zzso zzso occurred in zzso zzso zzso throughout pregnancy, but zzso was there only during the last zzso zzso zzso was found only in zzso zzso of zzso natural killer zzso cells, although zzso occurred throughout the cell zzso In zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso but not zzso cells, zzso that zzso zzso zzso is zzso by zzso cells via zzso This is consistent with zzso being an zzso partner of zzso at the zzso interface and suggests an important role for zzso in zzso cell zzso
