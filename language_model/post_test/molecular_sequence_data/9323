zzso counting is a major problem faced by analysis of zzso zzso The most popular method relies on analysis of zzso zzso zzso but some studies employ also protein based zzso It would be advantageous to have a method that is zzso directly to short zzso of the kind extracted from samples in modern zzso zzso This is achieved by the technique proposed zzso 

We employ specific zzso deduced from zzso zzso zzso as markers for the occurrence of single genes in zzso zzso carrying these markers are aligned and compared with each other to provide a lower limit for zzso counts in zzso zzso The method is compared with zzso zzso searches on a set of known zzso The zzso counting problem is analyzed zzso and a zzso zzso is zzso When applied to zzso zzso of a recent human gut zzso study, the zzso counting method provides information on numbers of different species and zzso We then apply our method to short read data and demonstrate how it can be zzso to cope with zzso zzso to known databases leads to estimates of the percentage of zzso and the type of zzso zzso 

A major advantage of our method is its zzso it relies on searching sequences for the occurrence of just zzso specific peptides belonging to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso When compared to other methods, it provides additional insight into the zzso contents of zzso zzso Furthermore, it can be directly applied to short read data, avoiding the need for zzso zzso zzso and taking into account short reads that are otherwise discarded as zzso Hence it is very suitable for a fast analysis of next generation sequencing zzso
