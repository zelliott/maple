The autonomously replicating sequences zzso of zzso a cryptic circular DNA zzso detected in a strain of zzso zzso were zzso by zzso and deletion analysis and by the isolation of zzso substitution zzso A 30 zzso zzso sequence from zzso repeat 1 zzso and presumably the same region from zzso of zzso functions as an zzso in the native host, zzso zzso and in a zzso host, zzso zzso Thus, zzso has two zzso per zzso either of which is sufficient for replication of the zzso zzso in both zzso These zzso however, respond differently to zzso zzso in the 30 zzso zzso suggesting that the sequences required for zzso function in the two organisms are not exactly the zzso In addition, a 137 zzso sequence that zzso the 30 zzso sequence by 11 zzso also functions as an zzso in zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso However, this 137 zzso sequence enhances the stability of plasmids carrying the zzso zzso in zzso zzso The 30 zzso and 137 zzso sequences each contain a single copy of the 11 zzso zzso consensus zzso which is essential for zzso function in zzso zzso Small insertions between the 11 zzso overlapping region and the 11 zzso zzso consensus sequence showed that a proper distance between these two 11 zzso sequences is essential for the zzso function of the 30 zzso zzso Point zzso that zzso zzso function show that the zzso consensus zzso as well as a short zzso segment in the overlapping zzso is required for the zzso function of the 30 zzso zzso
