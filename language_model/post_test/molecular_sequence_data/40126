We examine here the role of the red, green, and blue human zzso structures in modulating the zzso properties of zzso bonded to the protein via a zzso Schiff base zzso We built the three-dimensional structures of the human red, green, and blue zzso using zzso modeling techniques with the crystal structure of bovine zzso as the zzso We then used quantum mechanics zzso combined with molecular mechanics zzso zzso as zzso techniques in conjunction with molecular dynamics to determine how the room temperature molecular structures of the three human color zzso proteins zzso the zzso frequency of the same bound zzso zzso to account for the differences in the observed zzso zzso We find that the zzso twisting of the zzso zzso plays an important role in the green to blue zzso shift, whereas the zzso side chains in the binding pocket play a surprising role of zzso the blue zzso with respect to the green zzso as a fine adjustment to the zzso zzso The zzso side chains play a large role in the zzso shift from red to zzso
