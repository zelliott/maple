zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 are the primary zzso involved in the zzso processing of zzso zzso zzso zzso to give rise to zzso and other proposed biologically active zzso zzso Previous evidence suggests that zzso is responsible for most zzso zzso zzso Here, we used the zzso and zzso knockout zzso mouse models to examine the effects of zzso or zzso loss on zzso zzso The zzso mouse presented a decrease in five zzso zzso whereas the zzso mouse showed only lesser reduction in three zzso zzso zzso zzso and the short forms zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso Also, zzso and not zzso showed a decrease in zzso indicating that zzso is more important in generating this zzso in the zzso which differs from previous studies using rat zzso Furthermore, downstream effects on zzso hormone levels were evident in zzso mice, but not zzso mice suggesting that zzso plays the more critical role in producing zzso zzso zzso Yet loss of zzso did not abolish zzso entirely indicating a complementary action for both zzso in the normal processing of zzso We also show that zzso alone is responsible for catalyzing the conversion of zzso to zzso and zzso all peptides implicated in regulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso results characterize the specific roles of zzso and zzso in zzso processing in zzso
