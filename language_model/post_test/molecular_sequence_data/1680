zzso is a zzso zzso that zzso zzso from the zzso so that they can move into the zzso zzso is broadly distributed in the zzso and therefore presumably also zzso zzso zzso Such severing would generate multiple short zzso from longer zzso resulting in more zzso ends available for assembly and interaction with other zzso In addition, shorter zzso are thought to move more rapidly and undergo organizational changes more readily than longer zzso In dividing cells, the levels of zzso (the zzso with severing zzso increase as the cell transitions from zzso to zzso This suggests that zzso is regulated in part by its absolute levels, given that zzso activity is high during zzso In the zzso brain, zzso vary significantly in zzso levels, depending on their zzso zzso zzso are high during rapid zzso of zzso growth but diminish as zzso reach their zzso Similarly, in zzso cultures, zzso levels are high when zzso are allowed to grow avidly but drop when the zzso are presented with target cells that cause them to stop zzso zzso of a zzso zzso construct in cultured zzso zzso zzso severing and is deleterious to zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso results in excess zzso severing and is also deleterious to zzso growth, but this only occurs in some zzso Other zzso are relatively unaffected by zzso zzso these observations indicate that zzso growth is sensitive to the levels of zzso but that other factors contribute to modulating this zzso
