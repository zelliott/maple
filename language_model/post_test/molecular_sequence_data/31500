Two novel zzso zzso zzso and zzso strains of bacteria zzso and zzso were isolated from zzso a soda lake in zzso Based on zzso zzso gene sequence similarity studies, strains zzso and zzso belong to the family zzso of the class zzso and were most closely related to zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Polar lipids of strains zzso and zzso include zzso zzso zzso zzso and two unidentified lipids zzso and zzso Both strains have zzso zzso an unidentified zzso zzso and zzso derivatives zzso and 2) as major zzso and an unidentified zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of both strains was zzso zzso zzso fatty acid analysis of both strains revealed that zzso was the zzso cellular fatty acid and significant proportions of zzso summed feature 3 zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also zzso The DNA zzso content of strains zzso and zzso was zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso (based on zzso zzso of strains zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was about zzso while between zzso and zzso it was about zzso On the basis of zzso zzso and zzso properties, strains zzso and zzso are differentiated from the other two members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso represent a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso An zzso description of the zzso zzso is zzso
