zzso acid zzso searches of the human zzso revealed three members of the zzso zzso family that had not been described in the literature in addition to the 14 known zzso One of these three, named zzso is present in a gene cluster with zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso The zzso zzso a mouse zzso of human zzso was isolated from a zzso library and zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of human zzso has highest zzso acid sequence identity zzso to zzso Modeling analysis shows the overall structure to be very similar to that of other members of the zzso zzso of zzso The active site of zzso is predicted to cleave zzso with zzso zzso zzso as do zzso zzso and zzso Using Northern zzso analysis, zzso zzso is detected in zzso but not in zzso liver, brain, or zzso In zzso zzso analysis shows that zzso is localized to zzso germ zzso Mouse zzso protein expressed in zzso cells using the zzso system was retained in the particulate fraction of the cells and was not zzso into the zzso zzso was not zzso active toward standard zzso zzso but after incubation with zzso zzso 4 the resulting protein was able to cleave zzso with zzso greater activity at pH zzso than at zzso Two additional members of the human zzso gene family were also zzso Modeling analysis indicates that both contain the necessary zzso acids required for zzso zzso The zzso on zzso 8 is predicted to have a zzso specificity for zzso zzso zzso and was named zzso The zzso on zzso 2 is predicted to cleave zzso with zzso zzso zzso and was named zzso
