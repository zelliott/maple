To better understand the accelerated zzso of fatty acid zzso zzso message that occurs after zzso deprivation zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso we characterized the 3' zzso of the human message and the zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso gene was localized to human zzso zzso and to zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso zzso of the zzso message in human zzso was ubiquitous with high levels in liver, zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso 3' untranslated region of the human zzso contained two regions with the instability zzso zzso Unlike short-lived messages containing zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso after zzso deprivation was not first order, and there were no zzso changes in the zzso zzso zzso deprivation zzso caused zzso message to zzso more rapidly than control message in density zzso In zzso treatment with different zzso zzso showed that translation per zzso was not necessary for zzso zzso zzso association of zzso with zzso message protected it from zzso In zzso zzso experiments, zzso zzso zzso was more rapid using components from zzso than zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso regulates zzso zzso zzso zzso stability by zzso the message between a translated pool not subject to degradation and a zzso zzso features reminiscent of regulated stability for other zzso zzso
