Twenty strains (including eight phase zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso bacteria were examined for the production of zzso zzso by using a combination of several methods, including gelatin zzso zzso coupled to native and sodium zzso zzso gel zzso and activity measurement with two zzso zzso zzso Four zzso activities zzso 74, approximately 55, approximately 54, and approximately 37 zzso could be zzso The zzso sequences of three of the zzso were determined, and a comparison with sequences in databases allowed identification of these zzso as zzso zzso Thus, the zzso zzso zzso formerly as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 2004) is an zzso of zzso a member the zzso zzso family, and the zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso a zzso zzso in clan zzso zzso while the zzso zzso zzso belongs to the zzso zzso in clan zzso The zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso and they occurred in several smaller forms as zzso zzso could not be detected by zzso zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso in contrast, was an zzso zzso zzso activity was found in every strain tested, while zzso was detected only in the zzso zzso There was significant strain variation in the zzso of zzso and zzso activities, but reduced activity or a lack of activity was not specific to zzso zzso The presence of zzso zzso and zzso activities could be detected in the zzso of zzso zzso larvae 20 to 40 h zzso These zzso appear not to be directly involved in the zzso of zzso since strains or phase zzso lacking any of these zzso do not show reduced zzso when they are injected into zzso zzso zzso
