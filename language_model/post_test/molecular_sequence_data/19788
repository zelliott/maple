It has been suggested that zzso gene segment expression is zzso in multiple myeloma zzso due to a zzso zzso We cloned and zzso a zzso gene segment from bone zzso zzso cells of a stage III zzso zzso We show that zzso was expressed by the serum zzso myeloma zzso as demonstrated by zzso with the zzso specific zzso zzso and mass zzso zzso The zzso had weak zzso with zzso These results demonstrate that zzso may be expressed in zzso zzso zzso with weak zzso Thus, zzso of zzso is pronounced but not absolute in zzso zzso of how zzso can occasionally be expressed in zzso and clinical implications are zzso
