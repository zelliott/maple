zzso is a zzso zzso responsible for zzso unwinding during zzso zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso each of which is followed by a zzso domain with unknown zzso We determined the crystal structure of the second zzso domain, which unexpectedly resembles zzso 4 and 5 of DNA zzso zzso This, together with sequence similarities between zzso zzso zzso and zzso 1-3 of zzso led us to zzso that zzso contains two consecutive zzso zzso zzso and zzso Our structural model and zzso data suggest that zzso shares a similar zzso mechanism with zzso We demonstrate that zzso interacts with zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso We further find that the zzso region of zzso zzso zzso the binding of the zzso complex to zzso Our results have important implications for the mechanism and regulation of zzso activity in zzso
