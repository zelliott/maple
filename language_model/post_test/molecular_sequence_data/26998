A zzso zzso rod was isolated from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso Lake (East zzso at a depth of 6 zzso The novel strain zzso zzso was zzso and zzso zzso and zzso a variety of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of strain zzso had an absolute requirement for artificial seawater or zzso zzso growth occurred at 16 degrees C and at pH values ranging from zzso to zzso A large in zzso zzso band at zzso zzso indicated the production of zzso zzso zzso The zzso cellular fatty acid of strain zzso was zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso present in lower zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso were probably zzso The main polar lipids were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso 10 was zzso The zzso zzso acid was zzso zzso The DNA zzso content of strain zzso was 61 zzso zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons indicated that the novel isolate was zzso most closely related to zzso zzso and zzso species zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso The zzso had no particular relationship to any other cultivated members within the zzso The distinct zzso zzso and zzso differences from the previously described zzso studied supported the description of a new zzso and novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
