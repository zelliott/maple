The contributions of specific zzso to the delicate balance between function, stability and folding rates could be determined, in part by zzso comparing the sequences of structures having identical zzso but insignificant sequence zzso Recently, we have devised an experimental strategy to thoroughly explore zzso zzso consistent with a specific class of zzso Using this approach, the zzso acids tolerated at virtually all zzso of the zzso zzso binding domain zzso zzso an zzso of the common zzso zzso zzso were obtained and used to define the sequence zzso of this zzso zzso we present analyses suggesting that more subtle sequence selection pressure, including propensity for secondary structure, the zzso core organization and charge distribution are imposed on the zzso zzso zzso zzso using the Gibbs free energies zzso obtained for 51 zzso of zzso zzso we demonstrate a strong correlation between zzso acid conservation and the zzso induced by zzso zzso In addition, four zzso are shown to significantly stabilize zzso zzso native zzso Two of these zzso including the well-studied zzso are known to severely compromise binding affinity for zzso Another stabilized zzso consisted of a deletion of zzso acid zzso zzso This deletion naturally occurs in the zzso zzso and zzso and could indicate functional zzso Finally, the combination of zzso affecting five of 78 zzso of zzso zzso results in stabilization of the structure by approximately 12 zzso zzso zzso is zzso and zzso zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso The sequence zzso approach combined with zzso analysis of the zzso fold provide a basis for the identification of zzso requirements for function, stability and folding rate of the zzso zzso and structural zzso highlighting the utility of conservation profiles as zzso tools of structural zzso
