In the program, zzso we provide a methodology for choosing synthetic zzso zzso to be used in zzso mapping zzso The package serves the purpose of presenting a series of short zzso zzso that are chosen based on constraints with respect to frequency of occurrence within a particular zzso and the zzso content of the zzso The four programs contained within the zzso zzso convert zzso files to a format zzso by the zzso zzso calculate zzso and zzso zzso in available sequence data on a particular zzso zzso present the user with upper and lower bounds on the zzso of zzso sites for zzso zzso of length zzso zzso allow the user to place constraints on site frequency and zzso content and provides a list of short probe sequences that fit these zzso These sequences can then be zzso produced and used in zzso experiments to carry out zzso zzso
