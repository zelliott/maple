zzso B surface zzso zzso is not only critical to the biology of zzso B virus zzso it is also the basis of the currently available vaccines, zzso to detect it in serum are crucial for diagnosis of infection and zzso against it are used clinically to suppress infection of transplanted zzso All of these rely on zzso interactions between zzso and zzso Thus, it should not be surprise that changes in zzso will affect all these zzso It is useful to zzso such changes zzso as zzso found in natural zzso and zzso which are observed to emerge, usually under zzso pressure, often medical in zzso The former tend to affect the sensitivity of diagnostic zzso and the latter allow escape of viruses in zzso and those being treated with zzso The majority of these changes cluster in the zzso central core of zzso from zzso up to zzso They are gaining importance as causes of mistaken diagnosis and are associated with infection of zzso and transplanted zzso There is a danger that they will become the dominant strains as vaccination becomes zzso More data are required on the epidemiology and zzso of these zzso
