The zzso virus zzso has been increasingly detected in Hodgkin's disease zzso but its role in zzso remains zzso We analyzed 20 specimens of HD known to contain zzso DNA by a sensitive reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso The cases were assessed for the presence of zzso transcripts of the zzso gene zzso for the viral zzso membrane protein zzso and the late zzso gene zzso zzso for the principle envelope zzso zzso zzso zzso transcripts were found in 9 of 20 zzso cases, mostly those containing many copies of viral DNA and of mixed zzso zzso zzso zzso Only one zzso zzso case was also positive for zzso transcripts of the active replication gene zzso Our results show that viral burden in HD is not primarily related to active viral zzso but is associated with zzso gene zzso
