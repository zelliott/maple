The zzso zzso zzso zzso a member of zzso family, could promote zzso invasion and zzso via inducing the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso have exhibited obvious zzso effect on zzso zzso However, none of the zzso of these zzso has been zzso We previously prepared five zzso against zzso named zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso To map the zzso of these zzso a series of truncated fragments of zzso region of zzso was expressed in zzso coli and the zzso affinity to these fragments was examined with an zzso zzso zzso and Western zzso The zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined to be the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso respectively, which were further proved by a zzso analysis with zzso peptides and zzso zzso zzso The binding regions of zzso zzso and zzso were located at zzso zzso Then we constructed and expressed full-length zzso and truncated zzso without zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso chamber zzso showed that the zzso cells expressing truncated zzso failed to induce zzso production and enhance the zzso invasive potential, compared with the cells expressing full-length zzso Taken together with the obviously zzso effects of zzso on the function of full-length zzso these findings suggest that zzso zzso may play a critical role in the functions of zzso on zzso zzso and zzso zzso These key zzso can be used as potential drug target in cancer zzso
