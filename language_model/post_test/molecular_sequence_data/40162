zzso zzso zzso is shown to be a producer of zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene cluster spans at least 21 open reading frames zzso and covers a zzso region of approximately 83 zzso In zzso analysis of zzso zzso in conjunction with genetic studies suggests the involvement of four type I zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso one major hybrid zzso zzso and a number of zzso zzso similar to the ones involved in type II zzso zzso zzso Whereas deletion of either zzso or zzso causes a dramatic drop in zzso production, deletion of both genes zzso leads to the complete loss of zzso zzso These results suggest that both zzso and zzso zzso might act in conjunction with a zzso zzso and a zzso to produce the zzso starter that is proposed to act as the zzso primer in the initial zzso reaction with zzso zzso of the remaining 11 zzso required for zzso formation is directed by 12 zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso All zzso except for the first module of zzso lack zzso zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, deletion of a discrete tandem zzso by zzso zzso zzso this suggests an zzso zzso mode of zzso To embellish the zzso with zzso and zzso zzso assembly of the zzso scaffold is proposed to switch twice from zzso to zzso zzso zzso during zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso shifts production toward two novel zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso zzso revealed the loss of the zzso carbon zzso This novel analogue lacks zzso against zzso zzso
