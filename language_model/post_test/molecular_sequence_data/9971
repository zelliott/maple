The zzso zzso zzso zzso which codes for zzso protein zzso was cloned from zzso zzso zzso using a screening procedure based on zzso chain reaction amplification of a gene segment that subsequently allowed the isolation of the complete gene from a gene zzso zzso lies between the zzso zzso zzso a protein involved in zzso of transcription, and the zzso zzso which encodes the zzso protein zzso zzso of the zzso gene sequences of the zzso strain and the presumed zzso zzso strain 3-3 zzso isolated as a zzso zzso revealed a zzso deletion within the zzso gene from the zzso flanked by a zzso repeat sequence in the corresponding region in the wild zzso When the zzso zzso gene was zzso on a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso the ability to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso and submerged spores was completely restored to parental zzso The impaired ability to form aerial zzso was, however, zzso Western zzso analysis showed that the zzso from the zzso zzso 3-3 incorporate the zzso zzso protein zzso although the level of incorporation is approximately one-third that of the zzso zzso protein in zzso of the parent zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene in the zzso strain resulted in marked defects in growth, zzso production, and aerial zzso formation, indicating that the zzso zzso protein exerts certain negative effects in the zzso
