zzso gains reportedly are very rare during evolution of zzso and the mechanisms underlying their creation are largely zzso Previous investigations have shown that, during zzso radiation, the zzso patterns of zzso zzso genes were subject to massive changes, in contrast to many other zzso 

Here we investigated zzso dynamics in the zzso zzso in lineages zzso and zzso the split of zzso Multiple zzso gains were detected in a group of zzso fishes, once the zzso groups of zzso zzso had been zzso In two zzso zzso of zzso zzso was observed, zzso that zzso gains in zzso may even happen zzso or in a rapidly consecutive zzso DNA zzso processes associated with zzso zzso are introduced as a novel factor potentially favoring zzso gain, since all zzso zzso were found in a lineage of zzso zzso that experienced zzso zzso 

Multiple zzso acquisitions were identified in zzso genes of a lineage of zzso fishes, but not in any other zzso suggesting that zzso rates for zzso may be zzso zzso The zzso of zzso zzso within the same gene zzso the possibility that zzso may be gained zzso The sequences zzso the zzso zzso points zzso to the zzso site consensus sequence zzso upward zzso previously proposed to serve as zzso zzso zzso The association of zzso gains in the zzso zzso with a group of zzso that underwent zzso zzso may indicate that DNA zzso processes might foster zzso zzso
