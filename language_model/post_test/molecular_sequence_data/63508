The zzso zzso zzso zzso family are novel zzso zzso zzso The twin C1 zzso of zzso designated zzso and zzso have been shown to bind zzso or zzso zzso However, their zzso activities and zzso have not been fully zzso Here, binding activities of isolated zzso zzso and intact zzso zzso to zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The isolated zzso zzso of zzso zzso bind zzso zzso 12, zzso with similar high zzso while they exhibit weaker affinities towards a synthetic zzso zzso DOG zzso as compared to the zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso at position 22 to zzso in zzso of zzso fully restores its affinity to zzso indicating that this zzso accounts for its weaker affinity to zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso in the isolated zzso domain of zzso mainly contribute to maintaining the zzso structural fold, since converting these zzso in zzso of zzso to those in zzso or zzso drastically reduces the zzso number of active zzso while only minimally zzso zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activities of zzso and zzso are sensitive to the structural context in an intact zzso domain and exhibit unique patterns of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the intact zzso of zzso are opposite in selectivity for zzso and zzso In contrast, zzso of zzso exhibits zzso higher affinity to DOG as compared to zzso although both zzso bind zzso with equivalent zzso zzso mutating zzso of a full-length zzso greatly reduces zzso plasma membrane zzso but does not affect that induced by zzso In zzso individual C1 zzso of zzso zzso differ in zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso regulation of zzso by zzso zzso and zzso
