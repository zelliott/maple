There are at least two different mechanisms for the transport of zzso proteins into the zzso zzso zzso Both mechanisms depend on the presence of a signal zzso on the respective precursor protein and involve a signal zzso zzso on the zzso and signal zzso on the zzso of the zzso Furthermore, both mechanisms involve a membrane component with a zzso exposed zzso The decisive feature of the precursor protein with respect to which of the two mechanisms is used is the chain length of the zzso The critical size seems to be around 70 zzso acid zzso (including the signal zzso The one mechanism is used by precursor proteins larger than about 70 zzso acid zzso and involves two zzso zzso and their receptors on the zzso zzso The other one is used by small precursor proteins and relies on the mature part within the precursor zzso and a zzso zzso
