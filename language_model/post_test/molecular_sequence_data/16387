All zzso zzso possess a zzso zzso that is recognized by a family of zzso zzso These participate in various zzso such as zzso transport and stabilization, as well as in assembly of the translation initiation zzso The zzso of zzso is complex; in addition to zzso zzso it includes unique modifications on the first four transcribed zzso and is thus zzso zzso Here we analyze a zzso protein of zzso in an attempt to understand the structural features that promote its binding to this unusual zzso zzso a zzso of zzso contains the zzso zzso pocket, similar to its mouse zzso The mouse zzso has a higher zzso for all cap zzso tested, as compared with zzso However, whereas the mouse zzso shows a fivefold higher affinity for zzso than for a chemically zzso zzso structure, zzso shows similar affinities for both zzso A sequence alignment shows that zzso lacks the region that parallels the C zzso in the zzso zzso zzso of this region in the mouse protein reduces the difference that is observed between its binding to zzso and zzso prior to this zzso We zzso that variations in the structure of zzso possibly also the absence of a region that is zzso to the C zzso of the mouse zzso promote its ability to interact with the zzso zzso zzso is distributed in the zzso but its function is not clear yet, because it cannot substitute the zzso zzso in a rabbit zzso in zzso translation zzso
