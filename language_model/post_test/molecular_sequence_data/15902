zzso zzso genes contain multiple metal regulatory elements zzso that are responsible for metal zzso A protein zzso procedure and a synthetic zzso have been used to identify nuclear factors interacting with a zzso zzso of the mouse zzso zzso We report the specific binding of the probe to a protein of apparent Mr zzso zzso The specificity of the interaction was demonstrated by zzso analysis and competition zzso Furthermore, the probe contains the zzso consensus binding sequence zzso in addition to the zzso consensus zzso zzso and we show that a zzso zzso 40 DNA zzso which contains six zzso binding sites did not bind zzso nor did it compete for the zzso interacting with zzso in a DNA zzso zzso These results show that a metal regulatory element of the mouse zzso gene interacts specifically with a nuclear protein of Mr zzso and that this protein is distinct from the zzso factor zzso
