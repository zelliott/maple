zzso zzso protein interactions are critical for cellular recognition zzso but existing methods to detect them are limited in scale, making zzso interaction screens technically zzso To address this, we report here the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso interaction zzso zzso by using protein zzso zzso To achieve this, we have developed protein tags and sample preparation methods that enable the parallel zzso of hundreds of zzso proteins expressed in zzso zzso We zzso the protein zzso zzso against a set of known zzso zzso pairs and show that it is sensitive enough to detect even very weak interactions that are typical of this class of zzso The increase in scale enables interaction screening against a dilution series of immobilized proteins on the zzso enabling the observation of zzso binding behaviors to show interaction specificity and also the zzso of interaction affinities directly from the primary zzso These zzso improvements now permit screening for novel zzso zzso interactions on a zzso zzso
