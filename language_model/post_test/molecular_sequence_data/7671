This study was aimed at evaluating the influence of zzso medium zzso and human zzso zzso on both expression and function of zzso zzso in zzso a zzso acute zzso leukemia cell line which zzso expresses functional zzso zzso expression was measured by flow zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso function was measured by zzso 123 zzso zzso zzso zzso When zzso cells were cultured with zzso zzso zzso both zzso expression and zzso zzso capacity were increased in a zzso manner with a zzso increase in zzso expression level at day 6 whereas zzso cell differentiation status remained unchanged as assessed by zzso studies, zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso including zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso stem cell factor, zzso erythropoietin, and zzso had no effect on zzso expression whereas zzso alpha induced zzso and zzso zzso and zzso gene zzso However, zzso zzso zzso zzso had no influence on zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, when zzso cells were exposed to zzso for periods longer than 1 month, we found that zzso zzso capacity was increased as compared to cells cultured with zzso whereas zzso expression was zzso Both zzso alpha and zzso did not induce zzso zzso zzso these results suggest that zzso may influence both expression and function of zzso in zzso cells without interfering with their differentiation zzso In contrast to zzso zzso zzso enhanced expression and zzso capacity of zzso in parallel with zzso cell zzso zzso Finally, our study suggests that zzso and/or zzso zzso of zzso may interfere with zzso activity in some acute zzso leukemia zzso
