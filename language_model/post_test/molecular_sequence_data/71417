zzso is a natural product that zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso T zzso cell line zzso and zzso a zzso zzso zzso activity that has been detected in cell extracts and is thought to initiate zzso zzso Because zzso has never been zzso zzso and a comprehensive appraisal of zzso proteins has not been conducted, we isolated specific targets using zzso affinity zzso 

zzso derivatives were zzso and evaluated using zzso proliferation and zzso activity zzso zzso by these results, affinity zzso zzso were prepared and two specific zzso proteins were isolated from zzso zzso zzso of these zzso establish zzso that they are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of two zzso proteins that have been genetically linked to zzso zzso 

The ability of zzso zzso to bind factors that have zzso activity and the exclusive isolation of zzso and zzso as zzso proteins demonstrates that the two proteins are directly responsible for zzso activity and that zzso acts directly upon these zzso
