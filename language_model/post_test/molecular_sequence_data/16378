The molecular zzso of zzso human zzso gene zzso zzso channel blockade by zzso include two aromatic zzso zzso and zzso on the inner zzso zzso and zzso on the pore zzso that face into the inner zzso but zzso for zzso zzso zzso may be zzso In this study, zzso zzso channel zzso of inner cavity zzso were expressed in zzso zzso zzso and were used to characterize the zzso channel binding site of the zzso zzso zzso blockade of zzso was strongly dependent on zzso zzso but was insensitive or zzso sensitive to zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso and did not require functional zzso zzso models of zzso based on zzso and zzso crystal structures, representing the closed and open forms of the channel, respectively, suggest zzso is trapped in the inner cavity and is unable to interact exclusively with zzso in the closed state zzso exclusive interactions between zzso and zzso are found in the zzso zzso These findings are supported by very slow recovery of zzso zzso channels from block at zzso zzso but extremely rapid recovery of zzso channels that reopen at this zzso The experiments and modeling suggest that the zzso zzso zzso may be formed by the zzso zzso zzso The binding site for zzso (which may involve zzso interactions with two or more zzso zzso is either zzso or becomes less accessible because of zzso zzso This provides further evidence for the existence of zzso changes in the spatial location of zzso side zzso
