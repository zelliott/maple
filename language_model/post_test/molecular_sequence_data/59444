zzso coli zzso is a 39 zzso zzso DNA zzso and 3' zzso (AP) zzso that is active on DNA zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso is a major stable product of zzso damage, and zzso zzso may be particularly important biological zzso for zzso zzso zzso of zzso using zzso was found to produce two relatively stable fragments of 25 and 12 zzso The 25 zzso zzso begins at the N zzso of zzso and spans the region zzso with zzso coli zzso III, a DNA zzso zzso that repairs zzso damaged zzso The 12 zzso fragment, which consists of much of the rest of zzso had no zzso zzso The zzso 25 zzso zzso zzso had nearly zzso binding and zzso activities with zzso zzso zzso to zzso DNA, however, was dramatically reduced in zzso compared to that in intact zzso zzso zzso zzso which is a hallmark of the reaction of several DNA zzso that possess zzso zzso zzso activity, was also substantially reduced when zzso was allowed to react with zzso zzso The significant differences in zzso recognition and zzso with zzso and zzso zzso suggest that the zzso region of zzso a region with no zzso counterpart in zzso coli zzso III, plays an important role in the repair of mismatched DNA arising from zzso zzso
