The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso system zzso zzso bond reduction in the zzso and zzso zzso h is suggested to play an important role in seed development, zzso and zzso zzso Plants have multiple zzso of zzso h and zzso however, little is known about the roles of the individual zzso zzso h zzso from barley zzso zzso seeds zzso and zzso were characterized zzso In this study, two zzso zzso zzso and zzso were identified, enabling comparison of gene zzso protein appearance, and interaction between individual zzso and zzso h zzso in barley zzso and zzso zzso Although zzso zzso both zzso h zzso is present in zzso and zzso zzso the corresponding proteins differed in zzso zzso zzso but not zzso gene expression seems to be regulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso exhibited virtually the same affinity toward zzso and zzso whereas zzso has slightly higher zzso activity than zzso with both zzso h zzso and zzso has slightly higher zzso activity toward zzso than zzso zzso both zzso reduced zzso h at the zzso conditions residing in the starchy zzso during zzso zzso reactions between the barley proteins and zzso coli zzso or zzso zzso zzso respectively, occurred with zzso to zzso weaker zzso This first investigation of regulation and interactions between members of the zzso system in barley seed zzso suggests that different zzso are zzso regulated but may have overlapping roles, with zzso and zzso being the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
