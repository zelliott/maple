The coronavirus family of zzso zzso viruses includes important pathogens of zzso companion animals, and humans, including the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus that was responsible for a worldwide outbreak in zzso The unusually complex coronavirus zzso is comprised of 15 or 16 zzso zzso that are zzso derived from two large zzso In line with zzso predictions, we now show that zzso coronavirus zzso zzso protein 16 zzso possesses an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity that is capable of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso selectively binds to short capped zzso zzso an zzso zzso cap zzso is a prerequisite for zzso zzso liquid zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso mediates zzso transfer from zzso to the zzso position of the first transcribed zzso thus converting zzso into zzso The characterization of 11 zzso zzso supported the previous identification of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as the putative zzso zzso zzso of the zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso which may be the functional counterparts of aromatic zzso involved in zzso recognition by the zzso virus zzso zzso were found to be essential for both zzso binding and zzso zzso Finally, the weak zzso profile of different zzso zzso indicates that zzso has evolved an zzso zzso binding zzso Our results suggest that coronavirus zzso carries a zzso onto which zzso zzso follows an order of events in which zzso transfer must be preceded by zzso zzso zzso with the latter step being performed by a zzso zzso zzso
