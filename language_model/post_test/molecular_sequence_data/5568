zzso protein zzso only 87 zzso acids in zzso is a potent inhibitor of protein zzso in zzso cells, blocking zzso protein traffic from the zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The function of viral protein 3A in blocking protein zzso is extremely sensitive to zzso near the N zzso of the zzso zzso of the first 10 zzso acids or zzso of a single zzso acid between zzso acids 15 and 16, a zzso that causes a zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso abrogates the zzso of protein zzso although zzso amounts of the zzso proteins are zzso zzso light zzso and zzso zzso demonstrate that 3A zzso expressed in the absence of other viral zzso zzso with zzso derived from the zzso The precise zzso of 3A with respect to zzso zzso is not known, but it is likely to be associated with the zzso surface of the zzso Although the zzso of 3A in translation extracts has been reported, we show that zzso under conditions in which zzso of cellular proteins is zzso has no effect on zzso zzso zzso zzso of 3A plays no functional role in the viral zzso zzso zzso zzso reveals that the zzso zzso dramatically in the presence of 3A zzso The absence of accumulated zzso and the swelling of the zzso zzso argues that zzso traffic is inhibited at the step of zzso formation or budding from the zzso
