The solution structure of the potent 95 zzso zzso protein zzso has been determined and two zzso sites have been zzso This unique zzso containing five structurally important zzso bonds, demonstrates a novel fold with no elements of extended regular secondary zzso zzso contains two 39 zzso sequence repeats, differing in only three zzso acid zzso and each repeat has primary sequence similarity to zzso binding zzso Both sequence repeats form similarly structured zzso with the exception of one zzso The result is two zzso sites with substantially different zzso The unusual fold clusters aromatic zzso in both sites, suggesting a binding mechanism similar to other known zzso zzso proteins but differing in zzso zzso zzso originally isolated from the zzso zzso zzso holds potential as an zzso entry inhibitor for both therapeutic and zzso zzso zzso The high-resolution structural studies reported are an important initial step in unlocking the therapeutic potential of zzso
