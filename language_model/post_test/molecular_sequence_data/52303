A region in the skeletal muscle zzso zzso between zzso acids zzso and zzso was expressed as a zzso fusion zzso zzso studies revealed that this region bound zzso and zzso red, an indicator of zzso zzso zzso binding was mapped to zzso zzso between zzso acids zzso and zzso encompassing a predicted high affinity zzso site, and to zzso zzso between zzso acids zzso and zzso encompassing two predicted high affinity zzso zzso zzso binding was then mapped to three shorter zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids long, each encompassing one of the three predicted zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were raised against these three short sequences and zzso on zzso affinity zzso The zzso against sequence zzso lying between zzso zzso and zzso specifically recognized both zzso and native forms of the zzso zzso suggesting that at least part of the 35 zzso acid sequence containing the zzso site is zzso The affinity zzso zzso increased the zzso sensitivity of zzso zzso channels incorporated into zzso zzso zzso resulting in increased open probability and opening time without altering channel zzso The zzso channel was still modulated by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These observations suggest that sequence zzso may be involved in zzso zzso zzso
