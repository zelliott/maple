The barrier imposed by zzso zzso in the outer membrane of zzso bacteria presents a significant challenge in treatment of these organisms with otherwise effective zzso zzso The absence of zzso in the zzso zzso is associated with a dramatically increased bacterial zzso to zzso antibiotics and thus zzso in the zzso zzso zzso are of significant zzso zzso zzso the zzso of zzso zzso into zzso zzso the first committed step in the formation of zzso Here we report structures of zzso from zzso coli and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and zzso forms, which together suggest that zzso adopts two distinct zzso during zzso through reorganization of zzso zzso zzso characterization of zzso zzso combined with in zzso analysis of zzso zzso and zzso zzso identifies key zzso zzso We zzso zzso acts through an zzso zzso zzso
