A set of 19 zzso of the zzso II from zzso zzso zzso was determined by zzso energy zzso using constraints derived from experimental zzso zzso zzso The zzso average zzso zzso were zzso A for the backbone heavy atoms and zzso A for all heavy atoms of these zzso A model of the zzso II zzso is proposed to account for the relatively slow zzso exchange rates of the zzso and zzso zzso zzso which are exposed to the zzso in the calculated zzso of zzso zzso zzso Both the zzso and zzso models of zzso II may be useful for detailed studies of the functional, zzso and zzso properties of this zzso
