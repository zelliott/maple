zzso zzso is a gene family possessing multiple copies located within the zzso zzso zzso is related to the zzso class I, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The zzso class I family is complex in terms of its zzso arrangement, expression and function, and available evidence suggests that the zzso family may be similarly zzso We have adopted an approach to study the expression of such complex gene families by zzso with multiple peptides and by screening the resulting zzso against a large range of zzso The zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso as well as those of other related molecules were zzso and zzso zzso were chosen for zzso based upon zzso loop formation within the equivalent known structure of the zzso class I zzso zzso zzso by computer zzso and zzso evolutionary zzso zzso in serum from zzso rabbits bound to three out of six peptides used for zzso zzso and zzso demonstrated binding both to the peptides and to the zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso of various zzso of several species, the three zzso generated overlapping profiles of zzso These included reactions with zzso small and large zzso zzso zzso zzso and human zzso This is the first description of zzso induced by the zzso zzso The extreme complexity of these profiles requires further investigation, but may be explained in terms of zzso against diverse products of the zzso gene family and/or related zzso
