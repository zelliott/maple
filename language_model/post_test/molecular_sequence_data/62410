Most cells contain high levels of zzso and multiple zzso which zzso the reducing power of zzso to catalyze zzso reductions in the presence of zzso and zzso zzso (the zzso zzso zzso like zzso may operate as zzso zzso and are involved as alternative pathways in cellular functions such as formation of zzso for DNA synthesis (by reducing the essential zzso zzso zzso the generation of reduced sulfur (via zzso zzso signal zzso and the defense against zzso zzso The three zzso zzso of zzso coli with the zzso sequence zzso and a zzso binding site in a zzso fold display surprisingly different zzso These include the zzso zzso zzso zzso or the highly abundant zzso zzso zzso zzso (with zzso it accounts for zzso of total zzso zzso uniquely reduce mixed zzso with zzso via a zzso mechanism where only an zzso low zzso zzso zzso is required, by using their zzso binding zzso zzso also catalyze formation of mixed zzso zzso which is an important zzso regulatory zzso particularly in zzso cells under zzso stress conditions, to sense cellular zzso zzso
