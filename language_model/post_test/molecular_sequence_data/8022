Among zzso zzso zzso primary zzso zzso zzso represent a consistent group of zzso and zzso zzso We investigated the arrangement of zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso together with the involvement of several zzso and the zzso gene zzso in a panel of primary zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso Southern zzso analysis was performed to detect zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso genes in 52 cases of zzso and of the zzso zzso and zzso genes in 38 cases of zzso zzso gene deletions were analyzed in zzso by means of zzso chain reaction zzso zzso gene zzso were zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis, and direct DNA sequencing in zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes or zzso were found in 25 of the 52 zzso In particular, we detected zzso of the zzso locus (2 zzso the zzso gene (2 zzso the zzso gene (2 zzso and the zzso gene (1 zzso interestingly, 4 of these cases showed a zzso arrangement of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes were detected in 37 of the 38 zzso zzso of the zzso gene were present in 2 cases and zzso gene deletions in 3 zzso zzso zzso gene zzso were detected in 1 zzso zzso Overall, our data indicate that zzso zzso zzso of zzso genes is frequently zzso by means of Southern zzso in zzso zzso zzso genetic zzso are involved in a limited but significant fraction of primary zzso showing a molecular marker of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso or zzso zzso associated with specific zzso of zzso zzso zzso are rarely observed in zzso Moreover, our results suggest that zzso gene deletions may play a zzso role in zzso zzso zzso and that, in the context of zzso zzso zzso may represent a favorable target for the possible zzso potential of the zzso zzso
