Seven replication origins from resident plasmids of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were cloned in zzso zzso Three of these replication origins, originating from plasmids of 43, 44, and 60 zzso were used to construct a set of compatible shuttle zzso that exhibit structural and zzso stability in the zzso strain zzso zzso zzso These shuttle zzso zzso zzso and zzso were designed with rare restriction sites that permit various zzso including the construction of small zzso plasmids lacking zzso resistance zzso The zzso and zzso zzso crystal protein genes were inserted into these zzso to demonstrate crystal protein production in zzso zzso Introduction of a cloned zzso gene from strain zzso into a zzso zzso zzso zzso strain exhibiting good zzso activity against zzso zzso resulted in a zzso strain with an improved spectrum of zzso zzso zzso zzso of this sort should be valuable in future genetic studies of zzso zzso as well as in the development of zzso zzso strains for use as microbial zzso
