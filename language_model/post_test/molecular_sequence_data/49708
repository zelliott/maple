There is a geographical overlap between the two main rabies zzso cycles maintained by dogs and vampire bats in Latin zzso The geographical and zzso coincidence of rabies outbreaks of respective origins is not unusual in rural areas of Latin zzso These circumstances make it difficult to discriminate the zzso and zzso transmission pathways of zzso 

This study was conducted to develop techniques to discriminate zzso and vampire zzso rabies virus zzso zzso and zzso zzso in zzso 

The zzso zzso of the zzso gene of a total of 27 zzso and zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso were developed based on these zzso zzso rabies virus strains isolated from animals and humans in several parts of Brazil were examined by reverse zzso chain reaction zzso with SS zzso These rabies viruses were also amplified by zzso with general rabies zzso and the zzso products were cut by three restriction zzso zzso I, zzso I and zzso zzso 

All the zzso and zzso were distinguished by zzso with SS zzso The zzso products obtained from zzso were cut at one site by zzso I, but not by zzso zzso The zzso products obtained from zzso were cut at one or two sites by zzso I, but not by zzso zzso zzso I and zzso I clearly zzso zzso and zzso in restriction zzso length zzso zzso zzso The results of SS zzso and zzso were zzso 

SS zzso and zzso zzso have been developed for determining the origins of rabies virus zzso in zzso These zzso are simple and zzso and will be useful for identifying the rabies virus reservoirs of field zzso in Brazil, especially when used zzso
