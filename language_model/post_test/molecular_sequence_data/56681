zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso originates in human cells from a zzso acid precursor zzso Big zzso an intermediate form of 38 zzso zzso is generated by zzso at zzso zzso of zzso while a specific zzso zzso was proposed to process the unusual zzso site at positions 21 and 22 of big zzso We have previously shown that expression of synthetic zzso zzso human zzso in zzso zzso results in zzso of putative zzso and big zzso Here, to further dissect the processing zzso of zzso we designed and expressed in zzso a set of zzso zzso Four zzso affecting the zzso site always originated putative zzso at levels comparable to the wild type, suggesting that there is only a zzso requirement for zzso at this zzso An zzso zzso at the zzso site after the C zzso of big zzso fully inhibited the formation of both big zzso and zzso indicating that processing at this site is an early event and that big zzso is an zzso intermediate for the synthesis of zzso in zzso Also, a truncated zzso bearing a stop zzso after the C zzso of the big zzso sequence was totally stable and further processed into mature big zzso and zzso indicating that the second part of the precursor is not necessary for zzso
