Evidence of spotted fever group zzso zzso was obtained from flea pools and individual ticks collected at three sites in northwestern Peru within the focus of an outbreak of zzso disease in humans zzso in part, to zzso zzso zzso zzso identification of the zzso agents from these samples was determined after partial sequencing of the zzso common zzso gene zzso as well as zzso zzso sequence zzso with one or more of the following zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and sequencing of portions of the zzso and zzso genes in pooled samples (2 of zzso taken from zzso identified the pathogen zzso zzso Four tick samples yielded molecular evidence of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes were amplified from a single zzso zzso tick zzso zzso and an zzso zzso tick zzso zzso The zzso relationships between the zzso in these samples and other zzso were determined after comparison of their zzso sequences by the zzso zzso The zzso generated showed that the zzso exhibited close zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso values supported zzso adjacent to this zzso of the zzso zzso While the agents identified in the flea and tick samples have not been linked to human cases in the area, these results demonstrate for the first time that at least two zzso zzso agents were circulating in northern Peru at the time of the zzso Furthermore, molecular analysis of sequences derived from the two separate species of hard ticks identified a possibly novel member of the zzso zzso
