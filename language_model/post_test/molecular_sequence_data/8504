zzso zzso to many zzso diseases, including zzso diabetes zzso zzso is statistically linked to the zzso class II region of zzso zzso However, a distinguishing feature of patients with zzso class zzso zzso disease is an zzso low density of zzso correct, zzso filled zzso class I molecules on the zzso cell zzso The zzso associated with zzso processing zzso and zzso are essential for normal class I expression and presentation of zzso zzso and these genes are located within the zzso class II zzso The aims of this project were to determine if Tap genes could be implicated in the defective class I expression associated with zzso by using a novel zzso virus zzso gene transfer system to introduce a zzso normal zzso or zzso gene into B cell lines from normal and zzso patients and analyzing the effect on zzso dependent class I zzso The results show that zzso gene transfer in B cells from zzso of randomly selected zzso patients increased expression of zzso correct, zzso class I molecules to levels comparable with similarly treated B cells from normal control zzso B cells from another zzso of zzso patients responded to zzso gene zzso These effects were specific because B cells from normal individuals did not respond to zzso or zzso gene transfer with increased class I zzso and B cells from zzso patients responding to zzso gene transfer did not respond to zzso gene transfer and vice zzso Thus, these zzso studies identify zzso zzso zzso of zzso patients whose class I zzso in B cells can be reversed by zzso or zzso gene zzso The increase in class I expression induced by Tap gene transfer is associated with a reduction in the number of zzso class I molecules as demonstrated by the response to zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the increase in zzso filled class I molecules induced by Tap gene transfer into B cells from zzso patients is associated with restored zzso presentation to zzso T zzso These studies conclude that Tap gene zzso may contribute to the zzso in class I zzso and zzso presentation demonstrated by zzso zzso zzso presentation of zzso by zzso presenting cells can lead to the failed T cell education and tolerance to self zzso evident in zzso These studies functionally identify zzso class II region genes that contribute to an zzso zzso in zzso
