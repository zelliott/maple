zzso coli zzso is an important zzso which is often associated with zzso zzso coli zzso We zzso the genes responsible for its synthesis and identified genes for zzso zzso zzso zzso four zzso involved in zzso zzso and three zzso all by comparison with known zzso zzso of the normal zzso region there is a zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso for converting zzso to zzso and is essential for zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso product has only 20 and zzso identity to the zzso genes of zzso zzso and zzso coli zzso zzso We also found evidence for the zzso gene zzso having evolved from another gene cluster by gain and loss of zzso Only three of the zzso zzso genes are in the usual location, the other two being zzso although zzso It is thought that the zzso coli zzso clone evolved from the zzso clone in part by transfer of the zzso gene cluster into an zzso zzso zzso of genes zzso the zzso gene clusters of the zzso and zzso clones revealed one zzso site within the zzso gene and located the other between the zzso and zzso zzso Genes outside the zzso sites are zzso to zzso identical in the two zzso while most genes thought to have transferred with the zzso gene cluster are 95 to zzso zzso
