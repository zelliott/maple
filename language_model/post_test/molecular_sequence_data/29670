Animal zzso is a component of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso that target regulatory proteins for zzso zzso in one zzso of two highly zzso zzso zzso genes zzso early plant defenses zzso by multiple resistance zzso zzso Loss of zzso function in resistance is not compensated for by zzso R genes differ in their requirements for zzso and a second resistance signaling zzso zzso that was previously implicated as an zzso zzso Moreover, zzso and zzso contribute zzso to zzso pathogen zzso These data imply both zzso distinct and cooperative functions of zzso and zzso in plant disease zzso
