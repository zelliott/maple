The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso seed zzso II zzso was determined using a protein zzso After zzso of zzso with zzso zzso or zzso the resulting peptides were zzso by zzso high performance liquid zzso zzso and then subjected to sequence zzso zzso of the complete zzso acid sequence of zzso with the sequences of other zzso seed zzso revealed regions of extensive zzso The zzso acid zzso of zzso A zzso zzso involved in the metal binding site are highly zzso among those of zzso A zzso zzso of zzso was obtained from the zzso zzso digest of zzso by affinity zzso on a column of zzso This zzso was retained on the zzso column and was presumed to have affinity for the zzso The zzso acid sequence of the retarded zzso was determined using a protein zzso The retarded zzso was found to zzso to the putative zzso region of Con zzso These results strongly suggest that this zzso represents the zzso and metal zzso sites of zzso
