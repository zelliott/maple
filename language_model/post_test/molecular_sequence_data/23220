We report quantitative analysis of zzso interactions on a 27 zzso zzso crystal zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso factor zzso zzso zzso response element binding zzso is known to interact with the zzso domain of zzso zzso zzso binding zzso facilitated by zzso at zzso of the zzso The zzso domain zzso zzso zzso was immobilized on the QCM gold zzso surface by means of a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso was detected by frequency decreases zzso zzso of the zzso Both maximum binding amount zzso and association zzso zzso obtained from the QCM zzso increased as a result of zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso values for zzso zzso to the zzso zzso and zzso zzso peptides were zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso This difference was explained by the zzso rate constant zzso of the zzso being 20 times smaller than that of the KID, while association rate zzso zzso were independent of zzso
