The zzso sequences from the human zzso zzso gene zzso were analyzed using zzso reporter gene zzso This analysis identified important zzso sequences needed for selective expression in zzso zzso Over 50 zzso reporter clones were constructed and analyzed in two zzso and two zzso cell zzso The zzso sequences analyzed extended from the zzso start to zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso A zzso region from the zzso 3' untranslated region was also examined for its effect on reporter gene zzso The zzso promoter was located between bases zzso and zzso of the zzso start zzso zzso between zzso and zzso were essential for expression from the zzso zzso zzso of sequences between zzso and zzso resulted in copy zzso increases in both expression level and selectivity for zzso zzso Two upstream regions of zzso zzso to zzso zzso or zzso to zzso zzso when linked to the zzso promoter led to zzso selective expression in zzso cell zzso Several zzso zzso demonstrated zzso to zzso higher expression in zzso cell lines compared to expression in zzso zzso zzso The expression from these zzso was quite strong in zzso cells, being two- to zzso higher than an zzso zzso zzso The most promising zzso zzso regulatory sequences were used to regulate the expression of zzso zzso zzso in stable cell zzso The expression of CD was assessed directly by an zzso zzso and indirectly by determining the in zzso zzso to zzso zzso The zzso gene zzso displayed the desired expression zzso expression in the zzso cells and low-level expression in zzso zzso CD expression from this zzso correlated well with the expression of the zzso zzso zzso Treatment of mice bearing zzso zzso zzso tumor zzso with zzso lead to significant zzso effects in zzso The zzso zzso gene should be useful for zzso suicide gene therapy of zzso zzso
