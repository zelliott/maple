The zzso zzso zzso promoter zzso zzso also known as zzso plays a key role in the signal zzso of the zzso zzso to induce the production of zzso zzso and other zzso In the present study, Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from Japanese zzso zzso using zzso zzso The full-length zzso has zzso zzso and encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso The putative Japanese zzso zzso protein contains an zzso zzso domain, a central zzso domain, a zzso zzso domain, and exhibits similarity to other zzso counterparts ranging from zzso to zzso zzso zzso showed that Japanese zzso zzso zzso was expressed in all zzso zzso The expression level of zzso zzso gene was unchanged in viral zzso zzso virus zzso kidney as measured by quantitative real-time zzso zzso In addition, Japanese zzso zzso cells were protected against zzso zzso zzso and zzso infection as zzso by the delayed appearance of zzso effect zzso and decreased viral zzso zzso of zzso genes including zzso zzso and zzso were also induced in the zzso zzso These results suggest that Japanese zzso zzso is involved in the zzso immunity as a one of the zzso in fish zzso zzso
