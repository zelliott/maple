The primary sequence of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso DC seeds was zzso This inhibitor consists of a single zzso chain of 182 zzso zzso including four zzso zzso and an zzso zzso of zzso zzso The sequence of zzso showed 57% identity to the basic zzso inhibitor zzso and 50% identity to the zzso inhibitor zzso of winged zzso and zzso identity to the zzso inhibitor zzso from zzso zzso zzso The similarity to the soybean zzso zzso inhibitor zzso and the other zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso and wheat zzso was much zzso zzso comparisons indicate that the zzso and zzso zzso are more closely related to each other than to other members of the zzso inhibitor zzso
