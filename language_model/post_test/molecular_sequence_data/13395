During zzso zzso a variety of genetic zzso such as zzso zzso or loss of zzso genes have been zzso zzso 12 zzso of the zzso gene has been seen with a high frequency in several human zzso but its participation in the development of zzso zzso has not been fully zzso Using the DNA restriction fragments zzso zzso technique enhanced by a zzso chain reaction zzso a study has been made of zzso 12 zzso at the zzso gene in 55 patient with zzso cancer undergoing surgery between 1991 and zzso The zzso stage was superficial zzso in 24 cases, zzso zzso in 28 cases and unknown in 3 zzso Two patients zzso showed zzso 12 zzso at the zzso zzso One case was a fast evolving zzso zzso zzso which caused death of the patient after 4 months while the other case was a surface zzso zzso which relapsed early, the pathological anatomy revealing a stage zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest that zzso 12 zzso at the zzso gene is not a meaningful genetic change in the genesis of zzso zzso Its zzso however, appears to be related to a more aggressive zzso zzso
