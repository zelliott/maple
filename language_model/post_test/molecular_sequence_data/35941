A gene coding for human nerve growth factor zzso was constructed for expression under control of the zzso promoter in zzso zzso The zzso zzso contained a synthetic zzso gene zzso in frame, to the region zzso the zzso signal zzso The zzso zzso contained the same coding sequence as zzso attached downstream from the zzso zzso of the zzso L zzso zzso coli cells harboring zzso produced an amount of zzso zzso zzso of the total cellular zzso and removed the zzso signal zzso The mature protein zzso was biologically active in the zzso zzso for zzso zzso This biological activity was comparable to that of authentic mouse zzso zzso coli cells harboring zzso produced an amount of fusion protein zzso zzso zzso of the total cellular zzso Although the fusion protein zzso formed inclusion bodies in cells, dissolved fusion protein zzso was active in zzso outgrowth from zzso zzso
