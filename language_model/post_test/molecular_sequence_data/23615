zzso are zzso zzso peptides isolated from the zzso zzso zzso These zzso peptides were found to display strong zzso activity and weak zzso zzso When zzso into zzso zzso zzso zzso developed highly zzso zzso zzso under zzso ramps and formed, in single-channel experiments, zzso zzso zzso channels according to the barrel stave zzso The zzso activity and zzso properties of these molecules were well zzso Similar experiments performed with zzso truncated fragments showed that the zzso domain of zzso is strongly implicated in the formation of zzso zzso in the membrane whereas the largely zzso zzso region is likely to anchor zzso on the zzso zzso
