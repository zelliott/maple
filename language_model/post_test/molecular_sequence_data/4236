zzso necrosis factor zzso sites of action in the generation of zzso inflammation have been defined by targeted disruption of zzso in the zzso mouse zzso zzso mice are susceptible to an zzso zzso form of experimental zzso zzso zzso induced by the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso targeting of a strain in which zzso was zzso was necessary, as the location of the zzso gene renders segregation of the zzso zzso from the original major zzso complex by zzso virtually zzso In this way a single gene effect was zzso We show here that zzso is obligatory for normal initiation of the neurological deficit, as demonstrated by a significant (6 zzso delay in disease in its absence relative to zzso zzso zzso During this zzso comparable numbers of zzso were isolated from the zzso central nervous system zzso of zzso and zzso zzso However, in the zzso mice, zzso analysis of zzso tissue indicated that zzso failed to form the typical mature zzso cuffs observed in zzso mice at this same time zzso Severe zzso including paralysis and widespread zzso zzso zzso eventually developed without zzso zzso and zzso mice recovered from the acute illness at the same time, such that the overall disease course in zzso mice was only zzso of the course in control zzso zzso zzso occurred in both zzso and zzso mice, although it was of variable zzso These results are consistent with the zzso dependence of processes controlling initial zzso movement within the zzso Nevertheless, potent alternative mechanisms exist to mediate all other zzso of zzso
