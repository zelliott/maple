In zzso zzso mice, most zzso class II molecules are bound by a single zzso zzso derived from the class zzso zzso zzso Previous studies showed that zzso cells are defective in presenting synthetic peptides to class zzso T zzso In sharp contrast, however, the same peptides zzso strong zzso T cell responses in zzso zzso We now provide an explanation for this apparent zzso zzso zzso T cells from zzso mice were efficiently zzso by zzso but not by zzso cells zzso with the zzso zzso In sharp contrast, zzso T cells from zzso animals specific for the same zzso combination recognized zzso zzso and zzso cells equally zzso In addition, unlike zzso T cells from zzso animals, the zzso of zzso T cells from zzso animals could not be efficiently blocked by zzso specific for the zzso zzso class zzso zzso We further demonstrated that the distinct zzso of zzso T cells from zzso and zzso mice are due to differences in zzso zzso zzso these findings indicate that the zzso T cell zzso of zzso and zzso mice are remarkably zzso
