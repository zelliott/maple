To identify the zzso zzso in two large Bulgarian Romani zzso zzso one with zzso dominant zzso zzso zzso with partial zzso and the other with severe zzso zzso zzso 

zzso clinical investigations were undertaken and zzso DNA was extracted from blood zzso DNA was analyzed by zzso amplification with zzso zzso and direct zzso zzso 

Analysis of the complete coding sequence of zzso in the zzso family led to the identification of a new zzso zzso site zzso zzso zzso zzso screening in affected male individuals in the zzso zzso family identified a zzso zzso zzso Interestingly this zzso was found in a zzso state in one severely affected female from the zzso 

In this first report of molecular genetic analysis of zzso zzso in Romani families, we describe a novel zzso zzso and present the first case of a zzso zzso in the zzso gene in a female zzso
