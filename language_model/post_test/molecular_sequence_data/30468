The conversion of zzso to zzso is zzso by a complex of zzso that includes a specific zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper we describe the high level expression of zzso activity in the rat zzso cell tumor line, zzso We also report the isolation of zzso clones zzso the rat zzso zzso from a zzso library prepared from this cell zzso Analysis of these zzso clones predicts a protein sequence with a high degree of sequence conservation when compared to the chicken and human zzso zzso zzso four of the zzso clones were found to lack the last coding zzso that contains the zzso domain, a structural feature essential for zzso zzso These clones were found to contain instead a segment of zzso DNA derived from an zzso zzso Northern analysis using a zzso of the coding region of the rat zzso zzso as probe revealed that three species of zzso zzso are expressed in rat zzso that are similar to those identified in zzso samples prepared from the rat zzso cell zzso Analysis of the same samples of zzso using a probe derived from the 3' terminal zzso segment of the rat zzso zzso clones that lack the zzso domain indicates that two of the species of zzso zzso transcripts present in both rat zzso and zzso cell lack the zzso domain and thus must zzso a zzso zzso zzso These findings have important implications for the measurement of zzso zzso and appear to explain why three sizes of rat zzso zzso exist on Northern analysis and why previous studies failed to demonstrate a clear relationship between zzso zzso zzso and zzso activity in the rat zzso
