A zzso for zzso zzso zzso group C zzso has recently been zzso We have now isolated a zzso artificial zzso clone containing the zzso zzso and used zzso zzso to determine its zzso zzso The zzso coding sequence of the gene is highly zzso and contains 14 zzso ranging in size from zzso zzso All zzso donor and zzso zzso sites fit well with consensus zzso zzso of the zzso zzso boundaries and adjacent zzso sequences was used to design zzso chain reactions for amplification of all 14 zzso from zzso zzso zzso of zzso site zzso in zzso zzso patients with abnormal zzso transcripts and screening of large numbers of patients for zzso by amplification of the coding sequence from zzso DNA will now be zzso
