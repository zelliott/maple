A pedigree of transgenic mice has been characterized that contains a zzso fusion gene that exhibits integration zzso expression from the earliest stages of lung development through zzso zzso and zzso studies indicate that the zzso reporter appears throughout the pulmonary zzso by embryonic day 11 zzso A zzso wave of extinction of zzso expression occurs during zzso that parallels the wave of zzso of the pulmonary zzso By zzso the zzso reporter is restricted to the zzso portion of zzso zzso and by birth to scattered cells located in zzso Crude zzso cell suspensions were prepared from lungs harvested from zzso and 14 day zzso transgenic mice, labeled with the fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso expressing population isolated by zzso cell zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies of this zzso cell population establish that type II zzso are the only cell lineage that support zzso expression in the mature zzso zzso zzso cell sorting of zzso lung suspensions yielded a homogeneous population of cells that produced zzso protein A, that could be maintained in cell culture, and that are likely precursors of adult type II zzso Together these studies indicate that zzso expression of the zzso in this pedigree of mice provides a marker for describing early differentiation of the pulmonary zzso zzso the zzso may be useful as an zzso trap to isolate zzso sequences that regulate gene zzso within this zzso zzso the zzso reporter expression can be used to purify specific embryonic pulmonary zzso cell zzso and zzso primary cultures of these embryonic populations represent a potentially useful model system for analyzing the cellular components and signaling pathways necessary to support and complete passage through the type II zzso differentiation zzso
