zzso zzso the zzso of zzso into zzso IX zzso This seemingly simple reaction also is potentially one of the most interesting and crucial steps in the zzso zzso pathway, zzso to its position at the zzso between zzso and zzso zzso Up until the level of zzso zzso and zzso synthesis share a common zzso However, at the point of zzso zzso there are two zzso zzso zzso to make zzso zzso by zzso or zzso zzso to make zzso zzso by zzso Thus the relative activities of zzso and zzso must be regulated with respect to the zzso requirements for these end zzso How is this regulation zzso For zzso the recent design of an in zzso zzso combined with the identification of zzso zzso genes has now made it possible to address this zzso In all zzso organisms studied to date, zzso is a zzso zzso and in several species these proteins have been cloned and expressed in an active zzso The reaction takes place in two steps, with an zzso zzso followed by an zzso zzso zzso The zzso step may be the key to regulation, although variations in zzso levels during zzso growth may also play a role in determining the flux through the zzso and zzso branches of the zzso
