The zzso activities of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were examined in the zzso zzso pig zzso mouse zzso zzso and rabbit zzso zzso Because zzso showed the most potent zzso activity of the peptides tested, the biological activities of two kinds of zzso zzso zzso and zzso were determined and compared with those of zzso and zzso in the three zzso in the zzso binding zzso and in the mouse tail pinch test after subcutaneous zzso The results suggest that the extension of the zzso in the zzso chain of zzso zzso by zzso is ineffective for increasing the zzso activities, zzso selectivity and/or zzso effects of the zzso
