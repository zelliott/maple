zzso tumor cells are characterized by multiple zzso changes as a result of the large number of zzso being zzso expressed in tumor cells compared to normal zzso zzso zzso focuses on changes at the zzso level with the aim of identifying functionally important genes whose zzso expression in cancer cells is regulated at the level of zzso These genes were named class II genes and are distinguished from class I zzso which are characterized by zzso zzso zzso or other zzso Reversal of the tumor cell zzso accompanying zzso of the expression of such genes may be exploited zzso if gene expression can be specifically modulated by drugs or other zzso Considering that genes are zzso regulated in complex networks, it is likely that the expression of multiple genes can be simultaneously modulated in tumor cells by drugs acting on the signal zzso zzso that regulates their zzso The zzso gene is associated with differentiation and its expression is zzso or zzso in zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso promoter showed that zzso of zzso expression in breast tumor cells occurs at the level of zzso zzso presents an example of class II zzso since its expression was zzso in tumor cells by zzso zzso zzso zzso or by ultraviolet zzso zzso 

The zzso gene was identified by differential display on the basis of its reduced or absent expression in human breast tumor cell lines compared to normal zzso zzso cell zzso zzso expression was confirmed by Northern zzso analysis employing multiple normal and tumor cell zzso The promoter region zzso to zzso of the zzso gene was zzso and analyzed by zzso zzso deletion analysis, and zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso and zzso zzso was monitored by Northern analysis and analyzed by zzso zzso 

The mechanism of zzso of zzso expression in breast tumor cells was zzso It was found that the zzso to zzso upstream promoter region is sufficient for zzso expression in normal breast cells, but it is zzso silent in most breast tumor cell zzso By deletion analysis and zzso two upstream zzso promoter elements were zzso Our data indicate that the zzso element located between zzso and zzso acts as a major zzso of zzso zzso only in normal zzso zzso cells but not in corresponding tumor cells, whereas the sequences zzso the zzso site do not affect its promoter enhancing zzso In addition, a zzso zzso was identified that binds unknown zzso and is active in both normal and tumor breast zzso zzso function was mapped to a zzso element located from zzso to zzso upstream of the human zzso zzso start zzso The expression of zzso could be induced in the zzso zzso breast tumor cell line by zzso treatment or by short zzso zzso via a zzso zzso zzso is the zzso element zzso the zzso zzso of zzso by zzso which zzso the expression of zzso factors in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso site zzso the induction of zzso expression by zzso 

Our results demonstrate that loss of zzso expression in breast tumor cells results from impaired zzso through the zzso site in the zzso promoter, as well as from the presence of a negative regulatory element active in both normal and tumor zzso Furthermore, our results provide a basis for therapeutic manipulation of zzso zzso such as zzso in human zzso
