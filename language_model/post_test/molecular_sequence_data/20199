zzso has a complex root system composed of different root types formed during different stages of zzso The zzso zzso concerning crown and seminal zzso zzso is impaired in the initiation of the embryonic seminal roots and the zzso zzso root zzso The primary root of the zzso shows a reduced zzso response, while its zzso lateral root density and reaction to zzso applied zzso is not zzso We report here the zzso cloning of the zzso gene which encodes a zzso zzso zzso domain protein located on zzso zzso The zzso gene has been duplicated during zzso The zzso zzso gene displays zzso sequence identity on the protein zzso Both genes are zzso expressed in zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso is confined to emerging zzso root zzso zzso analyses of the zzso and zzso upstream zzso regions identified zzso response zzso zzso zzso revealed that both genes are zzso zzso zzso analyses between zzso and rice zzso revealed zzso of 14 genes in the zzso zzso We conclude from our data that zzso and zzso are zzso genes involved in the early events that lead to the initiation and maintenance of seminal and zzso root zzso zzso
