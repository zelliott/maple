zzso zzso transfer protein zzso mediates the exchange of neutral lipids among plasma zzso and is expressed predominantly in liver and zzso In band shift zzso employing nuclear extracts of zzso cells we identified zzso as the zzso zzso zzso involved in binding to the zzso consensus sequence within the zzso upstream region of the zzso zzso This was demonstrated by zzso experiments using zzso specific for zzso zzso and zzso and an zzso containing a single point zzso zzso in this zzso zzso of a zzso zzso construct in zzso zzso zzso and zzso cells and enhancement of promoter activity by zzso with human zzso in zzso cells could be influenced neither by the zzso in the consensus sequence nor by elimination of this site together with a second potential binding site for zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso with human zzso did not influence the synthesis of zzso by these zzso Our results indicate that the expression of zzso in zzso cells is not able zzso to influence specifically the expression of a zzso zzso promoter dependent reporter through binding to zzso sites in the promoter region and zzso to significantly enhance expression of the zzso zzso zzso
