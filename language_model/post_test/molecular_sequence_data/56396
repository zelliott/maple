The survival of zzso zzso zzso zzso was investigated in sterile and zzso lake zzso In sterile lake water zzso and zzso it was found that cells of zzso zzso entered a zzso but viable zzso zzso was determined by flow zzso with the dye zzso zzso which is taken up and maintained within cells with a membrane zzso For survival studies in zzso lake water, zzso zzso was marked with the zzso gene by using the zzso zzso zzso cells were detected by growth on zzso soy zzso and zzso soy zzso supplemented with zzso zzso were also detected by zzso chain reaction DNA amplification of the zzso gene and a zzso DNA zzso specific for zzso zzso zzso The results indicated that zzso zzso entered a zzso condition in zzso lake water over a zzso zzso The viability of zzso cells could not be determined in mixed zzso however, the presence of zzso cells containing both zzso and zzso DNA was zzso
