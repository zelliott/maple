The most common causes of zzso zzso are deletions that remove a part, or one or both of the functional zzso zzso These deletions cause diminished expression of the zzso zzso which may result in relatively low zzso zzso and/or mean zzso volume zzso zzso We here report the identification of a 970 zzso deletion in the zzso gene that encompasses the entire promoter region of the zzso gene and 26 zzso zzso the zzso end of the zzso Thus, the affected zzso gene is prone to be zzso We therefore nominated the newly identified deletion zzso zzso The zzso values of four related carriers of the zzso zzso were slightly zzso consistent with the presence of three functional zzso zzso
