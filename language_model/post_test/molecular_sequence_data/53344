We describe the generation of three zzso that recognize the complex of the class II zzso zzso zzso bound to a zzso derived from the zzso zzso of zzso zzso c zzso zzso zzso of these zzso are sensitive to single zzso in the sequence of both zzso of the zzso zzso and to the bound zzso The zzso of these zzso are distinct but overlap zzso One of these zzso specifically blocks zzso release by T cells responsive to this complex but not zzso We have used another to examine how the number of complexes on an zzso is related to its ability to stimulate T zzso We find that zzso complexes per cell are necessary and sufficient to induce a degree of zzso whereas maximum stimulation is achieved only if more than zzso complexes are zzso The analysis indicates that T cell zzso is a zzso zzso
