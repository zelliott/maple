A detailed analysis of the zzso end of the zzso gene of zzso zzso is zzso zzso transcripts are zzso at their zzso ends indicating that zzso is initiated at multiple sites within a region of approximately 50 zzso These zzso initiation sites are within a region that is zzso susceptible to zzso zzso in isolated zzso Additional zzso hypersensitive regions were found within the first zzso and the first zzso Within these internal zzso hypersensitive regions are the zzso sites for previously identified P element zzso which disrupt zzso zzso One of these P element zzso located in the first zzso is removed from the zzso transcript with the zzso of this zzso Another P element zzso within the first zzso is removed from the zzso transcript by novel first zzso zzso involving a cryptic zzso donor site, located zzso to the zzso and either the normal zzso site or a cryptic zzso zzso site within the second zzso
