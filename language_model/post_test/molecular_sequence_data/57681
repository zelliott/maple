A highly sensitive zzso chain reaction zzso was used to zzso serum samples from zzso patients in zzso zzso chronic carriers were tested, five of whom were of Swedish zzso Of the total, there were 13 zzso and 27 zzso patients, while 1 patient was negative for both zzso and zzso and one was positive for both zzso Nine of the 13 zzso carriers and only 7 of the 27 zzso carriers had elevated zzso zzso zzso levels zzso zzso zzso Two zzso tests of marginally different sensitivity were used on all patient zzso All 13 zzso patients and the patients with and lacking both zzso and zzso zzso respectively, were positive in both zzso zzso One zzso patient was shown to shed zzso B virus zzso DNA in both saliva and zzso Twelve of the 27 zzso carriers, 6 of whom had elevated zzso levels, were zzso zzso The remaining 15 had no evidence of zzso DNA and all but 1 had normal zzso zzso A positive zzso result was more common in those zzso patients with elevated zzso levels zzso zzso zzso The zzso gene from 18 samples was zzso and, with a few exceptions, showed a high degree of zzso We suggest that in the absence of optimal tests for zzso of serum from zzso patients, and until zzso becomes more widely available, all zzso patients with elevated zzso levels be considered highly zzso
