This review describes work aimed at the improvement of the zzso value of grain and forage zzso using gene transfer zzso Two traits which are amenable to manipulation by genetic engineering have been zzso These are plant protein quality and zzso zzso In order to increase the quality of protein provided by the zzso grains peas and zzso we are attempting to introduce into these species zzso genes zzso a sunflower seed protein rich in the zzso zzso acids zzso and zzso These genes are designed to be expressed only in developing seeds of transgenic host zzso zzso genes incorporating a similar zzso region, but different zzso controls, are being introduced into the forage zzso zzso and subterranean zzso In this case the genes are highly expressed in the leaves of transformed plants, and modifications have been made to the sunflower seed zzso sequences in order to increase the stability of the zzso protein in leaf zzso Another approach to increasing plant zzso value is represented by attempts to reduce the content of zzso zzso in zzso
