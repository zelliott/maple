A newly recognized zzso was recently found to be associated with an outbreak of acute respiratory illness in the southwestern United zzso The disease, which has become known as zzso pulmonary syndrome, has an unusually high mortality zzso zzso isolation attempts have been unsuccessful thus far, resulting in a lack of zzso zzso for use in diagnostic zzso For this reason, a molecular approach was initiated to produce zzso zzso zzso The virus zzso zzso protein was selected, since N has been shown to be a sensitive zzso target in other zzso zzso The N protein open reading frame of the virus S zzso segment was zzso from frozen autopsy tissue by zzso chain reaction amplification, followed by cloning and expression in zzso cells zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso N zzso zzso cells served as excellent zzso for an improved indirect zzso zzso Use of the zzso zzso N protein in an zzso zzso zzso improved the sensitivity and specificity when compared with zzso zzso used zzso zzso analysis also indicates that the higher sensitivity could result in earlier detection of infected zzso These data demonstrate that even in the absence of a virus zzso the necessary zzso zzso can be produced and can serve to improve the detection and diagnostic capabilities needed to combat this newly recognized fatal respiratory illness in the United zzso
