zzso and the zzso zzso are zzso with similar folds that differ in function and zzso To determine if the lower stability of zzso results from specific zzso required for its adaptation to a new function, the effects of zzso and other zzso on zzso stability were zzso zzso the upper zzso in zzso by replacing zzso with Ala, zzso stability and structure but zzso which also generates an open zzso is compatible with normal structure and zzso These effects appear to reflect alternative zzso and zzso forms of structural stabilization by zzso and zzso Of 23 zzso only three, which involve zzso for zzso in flexible zzso adjacent to the functional site, increase zzso Two are zzso zzso for zzso a component of a region with alternative zzso and loop zzso and one is zzso for zzso a zzso whose zzso changes when zzso interacts with its target zzso While all zzso for zzso zzso activity, a zzso to zzso zzso increases zzso by more than 10 degrees C and reduces activity, but two other zzso zzso do not affect zzso It is proposed that increased stability and reduced activity in zzso result from reduced flexibility in the functional site of zzso
