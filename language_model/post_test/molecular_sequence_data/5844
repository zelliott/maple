Some zzso reducing bacteria can induce nitrate zzso when grown on nitrate containing media being involved in zzso reduction of zzso an important step of the nitrogen zzso Previously, it was reported the zzso of the first soluble nitrate zzso from a zzso bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Liu, zzso Payne, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, zzso The present work provides further information about this zzso zzso nitrate zzso zzso zzso It has a molecular mass of 74 zzso zzso U specific activity, zzso zzso zzso 32 zzso and a zzso in the range zzso zzso zzso has peculiar properties relatively to zzso strength and zzso activity zzso It is shown that zzso zzso zzso and zzso stimulate zzso activity and zzso zzso and zzso inhibited zzso zzso zzso also acts as an zzso in zzso zzso zzso native form is protected by zzso zzso from cyanide zzso In the presence of zzso cyanide even stimulates zzso activity (up to 15 zzso This effect was used in the zzso procedure to differentiate between nitrate and zzso zzso activities, since the later is effectively blocked by zzso zzso has an zzso effect at zzso higher than 1 zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence has a zzso motive zzso that is most probably involved in the coordination of the zzso center detected by zzso zzso The active site of the zzso consists in a zzso which is capable for the zzso of zzso nitrate zzso of zzso zzso The oxidized product of the zzso zzso obtained by zzso zzso of native zzso with zzso acid was identified by zzso zzso and characterized as a zzso zzso zzso zzso
