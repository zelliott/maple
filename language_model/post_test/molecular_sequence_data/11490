The complete DNA sequence of zzso clone zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from zzso X was determined from an ordered set of zzso The sequence contains 14 open reading frames zzso containing at least 100 consecutive sense zzso Four of the zzso represent already known and zzso zzso zzso zzso is identical to the zzso gene zzso a protein zzso required for induction of zzso in zzso zzso represents the zzso gene probably zzso a second zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is identical to the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso is identical to the zzso zzso which plays an as yet unidentified role in zzso zzso and/or its zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso is zzso identical to the zzso zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso and more than zzso identical to zzso factor 55 from zzso zzso as well as to a number of proteins belonging to the zzso zzso zzso Open reading frame zzso exhibits zzso to two regions of the zzso gene located on zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso negative regulatory zzso In addition, extensive zzso was detected in three regions including parts of zzso zzso zzso and the incomplete zzso zzso to three consecutive zzso of unknown function in the middle of the right arm of zzso zzso Finally, the sequence contained a zzso zzso zzso
