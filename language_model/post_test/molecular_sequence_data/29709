WW zzso are universal protein zzso for binding zzso zzso They are classified into four groups according to their binding zzso zzso and zzso on the WW domain of zzso are thought to be important for the binding of Group IV zzso that have zzso zzso We have applied surface zzso resonance to determine the zzso specificity of several WW zzso containing zzso Among these WW zzso zzso and zzso bound only to the Group I zzso containing zzso with zzso values of 11 and 55 zzso zzso The WW zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bound to Group IV zzso with zzso values ranging from 22 to 700 zzso zzso and zzso do not have zzso unlike zzso and zzso The modeled structures of the WW zzso of zzso and zzso revealed that the structure and the network of hydrogen bonds of zzso I, which are also formed in zzso and zzso are zzso We propose that this zzso of zzso I zzso to as the zzso zzso is necessary for binding Group IV zzso and that it can be used to predict the specificity and functions of other WW zzso
