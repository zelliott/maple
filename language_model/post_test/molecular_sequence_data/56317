In a variety of disorders, zzso cells are exposed to high levels of zzso generated within the cells and/or zzso to local zzso In the context of the sensitivity of zzso cells to zzso stress, particularly related to zzso we have designed a replication deficient zzso zzso containing the human zzso zzso zzso to transfer the zzso zzso to the zzso cells, in order to augment zzso zzso zzso Human zzso vein zzso cells that were not infected or infected with control zzso maintained low levels of zzso zzso zzso cells infected with zzso expressed zzso zzso zzso zzso as early as 24 zzso and at least for 7 zzso zzso protein levels were increased significantly over controls in cells infected with zzso as were zzso activity levels, with zzso activity correlated closely with levels of zzso zzso zzso when the zzso cells were exposed to 500 zzso zzso all the zzso infected zzso cells survived, compared to only 37% of the control zzso Thus, a zzso zzso containing the human zzso zzso is able to zzso human zzso cells in zzso and express high levels of functional zzso zzso protecting the cells against zzso zzso zzso These observations support the feasibility of the transfer of zzso zzso to human zzso to protect against zzso zzso
