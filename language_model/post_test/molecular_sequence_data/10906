zzso A zzso is a zzso zzso light zzso responsible for initiating numerous zzso plant growth and zzso responses, especially in zzso zzso zzso We previously showed that the first 70 zzso acids of the zzso contain at least two regions with potentially opposite functions zzso Jordan, zzso Cherry, zzso Walker, zzso zzso zzso Plant J zzso zzso One region is required for activity and correct zzso zzso whereas the second appears to regulate zzso zzso We have further resolved these functional regions by analysis of zzso deletion and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso in transgenic tobacco zzso zzso The results indicate that the region involved in zzso interactions contains two separate segments zzso zzso and zzso also required for biological zzso The region that regulates zzso activity requires only five adjacent zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso of these zzso generates a zzso that increases the sensitivity of transgenic zzso to red and zzso light more than intact zzso Taken together, these data identify three distinct regions in the zzso domain necessary for zzso activity, and further define the zzso region as an important site for zzso zzso
