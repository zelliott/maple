To investigate the genetic changes in zzso E virus zzso strains in the zzso valley of Nepal, we compared the 412 zzso sequence within open reading frame 2 of zzso among zzso zzso recovered from 16 patients in 1999, 14 patients in 2000 and 38 patients in 2002, and additional zzso recovered from 48 patients in 1997 whose zzso sequences have been previously zzso All 116 zzso samples were zzso as 1 and zzso further as zzso zzso 73 zzso zzso zzso 25 zzso and mixed infection of zzso and zzso zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso was detected only in zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso sequence identity with the representative zzso isolate of zzso was zzso % zzso in 1997, zzso % in 1999, zzso % in 2000 and zzso % in 2002, indicating gradual diversification of zzso zzso When zzso analysis of the 87 zzso zzso zzso was performed, they further zzso into five zzso with two zzso clusters of zzso and zzso the annual frequency of cluster zzso zzso decreased from 63 % in 1997, to 50 % in 1999, to 7 % in 2000 and no cases in zzso cluster zzso zzso were observed in all four years and its annual frequency increased from 5 % in 1997 to 95 % in zzso Of the remaining three zzso cluster zzso was zzso only in 1997 and clusters zzso and zzso emerged in 2000 and 2002, zzso These results indicate that genetic changes and take over of zzso strains may contribute to the genetic zzso of zzso in the zzso
