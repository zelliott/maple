zzso is a member of the zzso zzso of zzso and is one of only three human zzso known to contain an zzso third zzso zzso The three-dimensional solution structure of zzso was determined by zzso nuclear magnetic resonance zzso and dynamic simulated zzso The structure of zzso which remains zzso at high zzso was determined on the basis of zzso experimental zzso The zzso region of zzso was zzso as has been previously observed for the zzso zzso zzso but not others such as zzso and zzso This was followed in zzso by a zzso region between zzso 13 and 69 that consisted of a zzso a zzso zzso zzso and finally a zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso were observed for the backbone and heavy zzso zzso A comparison of zzso to zzso and zzso revealed a significant structural change in the zzso region of the zzso The zzso normally present in zzso was terminated early and was followed by a short section of extended zzso These changes were a direct result of the additional zzso bond present in this zzso An examination of the zzso structure will aid in an understanding of the specificity of this protein with its zzso zzso
