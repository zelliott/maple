zzso finger proteins comprise a large family and play key roles in regulating zzso zzso hormone signaling and responses to zzso and zzso stresses in zzso A rice zzso zzso zzso a putative zzso finger zzso was cloned and zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso acid protein belonging to the ATL family characterized by a zzso zzso finger domain zzso a zzso domain at the zzso a basic zzso acid rich region and a characteristic zzso zzso zzso of zzso was zzso in rice zzso after treatment with zzso salicylic acid, zzso acid and zzso acid, and was induced zzso in incompatible but not compatible interactions between rice and zzso zzso the zzso agent of blast zzso zzso tobacco plants that zzso express zzso exhibit enhanced disease resistance against tobacco mosaic virus and zzso zzso zzso zzso and elevated expression levels of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso transgenic tobacco plants show increased zzso stress tolerance to zzso treatment with zzso zzso and zzso and zzso expression of zzso stress-related zzso zzso zzso sensitivity in root zzso and increased drought tolerance in seed zzso were also observed in zzso transgenic tobacco zzso Furthermore, the transgenic tobacco plants show longer roots and higher plant heights as compared with the zzso plants, suggesting that zzso of zzso promote plant zzso These results demonstrate that zzso has zzso effects on growth and defense response against multiple zzso and zzso zzso
