zzso are a family of zzso zzso antibiotics with zzso activities through zzso of the zzso zzso in bacterial cell wall zzso The zzso gene cluster for zzso has recently been identified through zzso mining of the producer zzso zzso and the highly zzso zzso zzso assembly line for the zzso zzso scaffold of zzso has been zzso In this work a hypothetical protein zzso zzso in known zzso zzso antibiotics gene zzso has been characterized by both genetic deletion and zzso analysis of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the transfer of the zzso zzso from zzso to the N zzso of the zzso intermediate yielding a zzso on the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso assembly line protein zzso zzso thus represents a new group of zzso zzso zzso zzso in secondary zzso zzso in addition to the recently identified zzso zzso The characterization of zzso completes the assembly line zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso bridging the primary and secondary zzso pathways by zzso an zzso to the zzso zzso zzso
