zzso is a zzso zzso involved in many cellular functions including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and tumor zzso suggesting that zzso may play an important role in breast cancer zzso In this study, we examined whether zzso zzso 2 zzso are associated with increased zzso to breast zzso zzso zzso sequencing analysis showed that multiple single zzso zzso were present in the zzso zzso 2 coding region in female patients with breast zzso There was no significant difference in the frequency of any one single zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 2 coding region between patients with breast cancer and normal zzso However, zzso zzso in the zzso zzso 2 coding region were identified in approximately zzso of patients with breast cancer, which was significantly higher than in normal donors zzso ratio, zzso zzso confidence zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso The zzso test analysis showed that the patients with the zzso zzso in zzso zzso 2 coding sequence had breast cancer at earlier ages, 49 zzso 3 versus 62 zzso 2 years zzso zzso zzso and larger tumor burdens zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso P zzso zzso at the time of zzso Interestingly, African-American female patients having the zzso zzso in zzso zzso 2 coding sequence were diagnosed with breast cancer at very young age (41 zzso 2 zzso Our results show that zzso zzso 2 zzso are associated with breast cancer development, and such analysis may be effectively used in the evaluation of risk, prediction of cancer, zzso diagnosis, and zzso studies of breast zzso
