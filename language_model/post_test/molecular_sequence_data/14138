zzso of reduced zzso coli zzso by the zzso zzso derived from zzso zzso at zzso pH resulted in at least three different zzso zzso These zzso were separated by reverse phase zzso zzso with zzso and zzso The zzso containing the active site zzso was collected and zzso by tandem mass zzso zzso indicate that the site of zzso was at zzso exclusively with no zzso at zzso Raising the pH above the zzso of zzso to zzso the zzso before reacting with the zzso zzso of zzso did not lead to zzso at zzso suggesting that a zzso factor prevents the zzso zzso of zzso from zzso this zzso A zzso digest of a minor zzso yielded an zzso zzso which contained zzso an zzso acid known to be zzso at its zzso group by zzso zzso by tandem mass zzso however, was unsuccessful due to fragmentation of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of this study confirm that the zzso zzso of zzso can zzso zzso at the active site and may have important zzso significance regarding the mechanism of zzso zzso
