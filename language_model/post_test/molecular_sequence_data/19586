X-ray and zzso experiments were performed with simple zzso models based on zzso zzso and zzso to understand the binding properties and structures of the complexes formed between this zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso derivatives with zzso provided zzso complexes which upon further treatment with excess zzso generated complexes possessing two zzso zzso rings involving the zzso and the zzso group of the two individual zzso zzso
