Thirty-one strains of two new zzso species zzso species 1 and 2) of zzso isolated from root zzso of zzso zzso and originating from various locations in France were compared with reference strains of zzso by performing a zzso analysis of 64 zzso zzso Each zzso species formed a distinct zzso and was separated from the other zzso zzso A comparison of the complete zzso zzso gene sequences of a representative of zzso species 1 zzso zzso and a representative of zzso species 2 zzso zzso with the sequences of other zzso and related bacteria revealed that each zzso species formed a lineage independent of the lineages formed by the previously recognized species of zzso zzso species 1 clustered with the species that include the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso strain zzso which was isolated from root zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso species 2 was zzso related to all other zzso species and related zzso and the most closely related organisms were zzso zzso and several zzso zzso On the basis of the results of zzso and zzso analyses and zzso data previously published and reviewed in this paper, two new species of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are proposed for zzso species 1 and 2, zzso Each species could be divided in two zzso on the basis of symbiotic zzso as shown by zzso zzso range and nitrogen fixation zzso and zzso zzso For each species, one zzso had the same symbiotic characteristics as zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The other zzso had a zzso symbiotic zzso and zzso zzso we propose that each species should be subdivided into two zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso
