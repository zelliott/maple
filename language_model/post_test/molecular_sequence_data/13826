We have targeted the zzso zzso zzso gene in embryonic stem cells and generated zzso as well as mice with TM zzso The zzso zzso zzso mice as compared to zzso zzso zzso exhibit 50% reductions in the levels of TM zzso and TM zzso However, zzso mice appear normal and are free of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso die before zzso An overall zzso in growth and development of zzso zzso is first evident on zzso zzso zzso zzso However, no specific zzso abnormalities are zzso These initial changes take place at a time when TM is normally expressed in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso The removal of zzso zzso zzso from maternal zzso and their subsequent culture in zzso allows development to proceed to stages not observed in zzso zzso zzso with the appearance of normal blood vessels in the visceral zzso zzso and zzso The results of our studies suggest that the failure of zzso zzso to survive at zzso is a consequence of dysfunctional zzso interactions caused by the absence of TM in the zzso zzso zzso and demonstrate that the zzso is necessary for normal embryonic development in zzso
