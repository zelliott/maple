Modern zzso zzso zzso is an important grass that contributes zzso of the raw sugar produced worldwide and has a high zzso production zzso It was created about a century ago through zzso of two highly zzso species, namely zzso zzso and zzso zzso We investigated zzso dynamics in this highly zzso context by analyzing two zzso sequences zzso and 126 zzso in a region that has already been studied in several zzso Our findings indicate that the two zzso species zzso zzso million years ago from one another and zzso million years ago from zzso The two zzso zzso zzso show perfect zzso as well as high gene structure zzso Apart from the zzso of a few zzso zzso high zzso was also observed for the zzso zzso Relative to zzso the zzso sequences displayed zzso with the exception of two genes present only in zzso and striking zzso in most zzso parts of the zzso The gene distribution highlighted high zzso and zzso with rice, and partial zzso with each zzso zzso region, which became perfect when the sequences were zzso The zzso observed in zzso may thus closely represent the ancestral zzso zzso This analysis of zzso zzso organization at the sequence level suggests that the high zzso in zzso did not induce generalized zzso of its zzso thus challenging the idea that zzso quickly zzso generalized zzso of zzso These results also confirm the view that zzso is the model of choice for zzso
