zzso in zzso zzso is controlled by a cascade of four zzso factors that are held into inactive form until the proper stage of zzso The zzso zzso zzso by zzso is able to strongly inhibit the activity of one of these factors, zzso in zzso The zzso gene is present in a large number of zzso zzso but the various zzso zzso show little zzso in striking contrast to their zzso zzso We have carried out a zzso analysis of the zzso protein in order to understand its zzso zzso By measuring zzso zzso in the presence of zzso in zzso assessing zzso ability to bind zzso in a zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso interaction in zzso zzso we have identified specific zzso that play an essential role in binding zzso or in preventing zzso zzso zzso Two zzso pairs, zzso in all zzso zzso are essential for zzso zzso zzso in the first pair are partially zzso by zzso in the second pair, suggesting that zzso exists in zzso form, at least as a zzso zzso is consistent with our in zzso analysis of a zzso zzso zzso zzso which shows that zzso contains zzso zinc atom per zzso Altogether, these results indicate that the zzso zzso play a structural role, whereas another less zzso region of the protein is involved in interacting with zzso Interestingly, some zzso have kept most of their ability to bind zzso but are completely unable to inhibit zzso zzso activity, raising the possibility that zzso might act by a mechanism more complex than just zzso of zzso
