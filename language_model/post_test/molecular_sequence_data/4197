We identified a population of mature sympathetic zzso in which zzso the zzso for zzso cell zzso zzso factor zzso is zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In a complementary population the nerve growth factor zzso zzso is zzso with the zzso zzso In accordance with these in zzso results, zzso and zzso promote the expression of zzso marker genes in sympathetic chain zzso similar to zzso and zzso zzso factor zzso To define zzso signaling mechanisms commonly activated by zzso zzso or zzso to promote zzso zzso we have analyzed the zzso of zzso signaling zzso Signal zzso and zzso of zzso zzso was strongly activated by zzso but not by zzso or zzso and hence is not essential for zzso zzso We conclude that zzso properties can be regulated by zzso factors from three different protein families, whereas zzso properties are promoted by zzso
