The zzso zzso zzso gene is required for accurate zzso zzso during growth and zzso We have characterized the zzso zzso of zzso protein by zzso and, in living cells, by use of a zzso zzso We show that the zzso protein forms discrete stable zzso usually located close to the cell zzso The zzso replicate in concert with the initiation of new rounds of DNA zzso after which the daughter zzso migrate apart inside the zzso This migration is independent of cell length extension, and presumably serves to direct the daughter zzso toward opposite poles of the cell, ready for zzso During zzso the zzso move to the extreme poles of the cell, where they function to position the zzso region of the zzso ready for polar zzso These observations provide strong evidence for the existence of a zzso zzso apparatus responsible for zzso zzso in zzso
