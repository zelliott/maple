zzso dynamics simulations of zzso in methanol were carried out with either a regular zzso zzso or the zzso crystal structure as starting zzso The structures rapidly zzso to a zzso zzso pattern with mixed zzso and zzso hydrogen bonds, consistent with zzso structural zzso and did not unfold throughout the zzso zzso despite some sizable backbone fluctuations involving zzso breaking of zzso hydrogen zzso zzso of the zzso structure around zzso zzso was associated with zzso flips of the zzso bonds involving zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso yielding discrete structural states in which the zzso zzso or zzso the zzso zzso was oriented away from the zzso zzso These zzso bond zzso could be zzso without greatly zzso the adjacent zzso structure, and zzso hydrogen bonding was generally maintained in bent states through the formation of new zzso or zzso hydrogen bonds with good zzso zzso zzso CO zzso gamma zzso zzso zzso CO zzso and, rarely, zzso zzso Q7 zzso zzso These observations may reconcile potentially conflicting zzso structural information for zzso in zzso in which evidence for zzso flexibility in the zzso sequence before zzso zzso contrasts with the stability of backbone zzso zzso groups to exchange with zzso Similar zzso zzso of the zzso zzso bond of zzso is also observed in dynamics simulations in methanol zzso zzso zzso zzso Gibbs, and zzso zzso Dempsey, zzso This phenomenon may have some role in the orientation of the zzso zzso in zzso the channel zzso in membrane zzso channel states of these zzso
