We report here the isolation, cloning and characterization of two abundant zzso satellite sequences zzso I and zzso zzso what are not related to each other, and that of a divergent zzso zzso zzso of rabbit zzso zzso The zzso I zzso had a 375 base pair zzso average zzso while repeat units zzso II and zzso zzso were approximately zzso zzso zzso zzso amounts of zzso I were detected by FISH at the zzso region of 11 zzso pairs of the zzso zzso II zzso to the zzso of 12 different zzso and two of these were labeled also with the zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso with the satellite zzso and zzso revealed that the zzso zzso carried different zzso zzso I was abundant on zzso 20 and 21, but it was zzso on zzso 13 and zzso Large zzso II zzso were found on zzso 16, 20 and 21, but reduced amount was detected on zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was prominent on zzso 16, but was absent from the other zzso zzso The zzso signal on zzso 21 was localized to the zzso region, what can be a useful zzso marker in comparative zzso zzso These data show that rabbit zzso form at least four distinct groups based on the satellite composition of their zzso The differences in the zzso distribution of satellite families will help easy FISH identification of individual zzso as well as to unveil the evolutionary history of the zzso zzso
