We demonstrated that zzso and zzso acid sequences in the zzso regions of zzso zzso and human zzso zzso exhibit a high degree of zzso whereas the zzso zzso are highly zzso To understand the molecular basis of this divergence and zzso we determined the zzso sequence of the rat pancreatic zzso gene from an zzso zzso library and compared it with that of the human zzso zzso 2 of the rat gene encodes the signal zzso and pancreatic zzso zzso 3 encodes the zzso region, and zzso 1 and 4 zzso the zzso and zzso untranslated regions of the zzso zzso zzso 1 and 2 of rat and human genes are well zzso The rat and human zzso however, have zzso 3 and 4 of different lengths and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso 3 and 4 and zzso 3 of the rat gene appears to have caused zzso junction sliding and zzso zzso resulting in a structural divergence in the zzso zzso Available evidence indicates that the zzso of structural conservation and divergence in pancreatic zzso genes may have been caused by a difference in the evolutionary rates of the zzso zzso
