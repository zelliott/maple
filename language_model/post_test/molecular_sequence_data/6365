zzso is a highly specific zzso zzso of the zzso system initially zzso as zzso zzso human zzso was produced in cell factories from zzso zzso zzso cells, a dog zzso cell zzso The equivalent of zzso zzso of zzso human zzso was zzso in the zzso from each cell zzso Following a single affinity zzso step using a zzso inhibitor as the zzso a zzso zzso was achieved with zzso recovery of the zzso zzso This highly pure zzso zzso having a specific activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for kinetic zzso The kinetic parameters were determined with the natural zzso zzso and a zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso at their respective optimum pH of zzso and zzso Although there was a zzso increase in both zzso and zzso values for the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), when compared with values for the natural zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso the zzso efficiency zzso zzso of the zzso for both zzso was the zzso However, the zzso value with zzso at the zzso pH zzso was zzso lower than that observed at the optimum pH zzso The zzso human zzso displayed similar optimum pH and kinetic parameters with zzso and the zzso zzso when compared with human kidney zzso
