zzso zzso zzso is a rare complex genetic disease affecting East Asians and is strongly associated with the class I human zzso zzso zzso in Japanese and zzso in zzso We recently showed that an zzso major zzso gene for zzso is probably located within the zzso in the class I region zzso zzso of the zzso locus on the zzso zzso We cloned two novel zzso genes designated zzso related zzso 1 and 2 zzso and zzso in the candidate region, which form a zzso gene cluster together with two adjacent zzso zzso and zzso zzso gene expression was remarkably zzso by zzso acid zzso stimulation in normal human zzso zzso cells zzso at the zzso zzso We found genetic zzso in zzso gene which were associated with zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso 2 single zzso zzso zzso was positively associated and variable numbers of tandem repeats zzso zzso in zzso 3 zzso pair zzso was zzso zzso Despite a strong association with zzso in the Japanese, the zzso gene zzso is also one of the candidate genes of zzso zzso
