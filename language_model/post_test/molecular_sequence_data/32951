zzso finger protein zzso factors zzso are emerging as powerful novel tools for the treatment of many different zzso zzso are zzso motifs and consist of modular zinc finger zzso Each domain can be engineered to recognize a specific DNA zzso and zzso six zzso together results in the recognition of a zzso zzso zzso of gene expression can be achieved by fusing a zzso domain to these zzso zzso In this study, we engineered zzso to zzso the activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The protein zzso is zzso in a wide variety of cancer types and zzso zzso has been shown to result in a decreased zzso potential of tumor zzso zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso provides a novel zzso zzso Using a straightforward strategy, we engineered a zzso that could bind a 9 zzso sequence within the zzso zzso After the addition of a zzso domain, this zzso could efficiently zzso zzso promoter activity by zzso To demonstrate the flexibility of this technology, we coupled an zzso domain to the engineered zzso resulting in a nearly zzso increase in zzso promoter zzso To inhibit the zzso zzso promoter, we engineered zzso Although none of the constructed zzso could convincingly zzso the zzso promoter, efficient and specific zzso of the zzso promoter was zzso Overall, zzso are versatile zzso zzso of gene expression and zzso of zzso promoter activity using zzso can ultimately result in a novel zzso zzso
