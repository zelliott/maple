This study sought to clarify the responsible zzso factor for zzso in allergic inflammation in zzso When the zzso collected from the zzso fluid 4 h after injection of the zzso solution into the air zzso were zzso the zzso zzso activity in the zzso medium increased zzso with higher levels for the zzso from the zzso rats than the zzso zzso The zzso activity did not result from zzso zzso zzso zzso because zzso zzso in the zzso medium were zzso zzso zzso factors in the zzso medium were separated by zzso focusing into two factors, zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso The activity of zzso was more than zzso of the total zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso was zzso by gel zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid sequence zzso of the zzso zzso was identical to the zzso zzso acid sequence of the zzso of rat zzso inflammatory protein zzso Higher levels of zzso zzso in the zzso from the zzso rats than that from the zzso rats were proved by the reverse zzso chain zzso In zzso zzso of zzso in the zzso fluid were low, and did not represent the zzso activity in the zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso is an important zzso factor for zzso in the allergic inflammation in zzso
