zzso is an zzso zzso sequence zzso of the zzso zzso zzso strain zzso and it is the first zzso IS to be characterized at the molecular zzso We determined the zzso zzso sequence of zzso and investigated its genetic organization, relationship to other zzso and zzso zzso zzso belongs to a distinct branch of the zzso family that includes zzso zzso and zzso based on zzso sequence zzso The zzso sequence of zzso encodes open reading frames zzso designated here as zzso and zzso and their relative organization and zzso acid sequences of the predicted protein products are very similar to those of zzso and zzso of other zzso family zzso zzso zzso protection zzso identified an zzso zzso and its zzso end maps approximately 16 zzso upstream of zzso and about six zzso downstream of a sequence that is similar to the consensus sequence of zzso zzso zzso zzso Evidence is presented that zzso is capable of precise zzso from the zzso and zzso from the zzso to a zzso zzso insertions of zzso occurred within sequences with a relatively high G + C content, and they were usually, but not always, flanked by a zzso direct repeat that matches a sequence at the site of zzso We also determined the zzso sequence zzso the four zzso zzso elements that reside in the zzso of zzso zzso Our findings demonstrate that zzso is a zzso IS that belongs to a branch of the zzso zzso
