A new disease of epidemic proportions caused by fish viruses within the zzso family zzso serious damage on red sea zzso zzso zzso and striped jack zzso zzso populations grown in zzso in zzso A partial segment of the fish zzso DNA was directly amplified using the zzso chain reaction zzso with synthetic zzso designed from well zzso zzso sequences between the zzso virus 3 zzso and the zzso zzso virus type zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence from the zzso sequence of the zzso zzso demonstrates a high correlation with a partial sequence from the zzso virus zzso Using the zzso method with specific zzso we could detect three of four different known types of fish zzso in diseased zzso To construct more reliable detection methods specific for this viral family, DNA fragments which can specifically zzso with all of the four known zzso viral zzso were screened from the zzso library of one zzso zzso The zzso zzso using a specific zzso which contains regions which are highly zzso with a characterized partial sequence from the zzso virus 3, proved to be a reliable diagnostic tool for fish zzso zzso
