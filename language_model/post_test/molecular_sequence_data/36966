The detection of human zzso zzso type 16 early zzso zzso zzso and the late zzso zzso was attempted in 42 zzso cervical zzso (35 cervical zzso and 7 cervical zzso using the zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was detected in 19 zzso of 35 zzso and in 5 zzso of 7 zzso zzso gene was detected in 7 zzso of 35 zzso and in 5 zzso of 7 zzso zzso gene was detected in 18 zzso of 35 zzso and in 5 zzso of 7 zzso zzso In order to zzso the zzso pattern of zzso type 16 in each of the clinical zzso the expression of zzso for zzso zzso and zzso genes was examined in zzso DNA positive cases using the reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was detected in 18 zzso of 19 cervical zzso whereas zzso and zzso genes zzso were detected in only 4 zzso of 7 and in one zzso of 18 zzso zzso In cervical zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes zzso were detected in all zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were zzso active in all zzso whereas zzso and zzso genes were not always zzso active in zzso These results suggest that the zzso type 16 early gene zzso is present zzso as integrated form and zzso active in the zzso cell, and plays an important role in the development of zzso On the other hand, zzso and zzso genes are present and transcribed in the zzso cell but their zzso activity is less frequent in the zzso zzso
