The crystal structure of zzso virus protein zzso an analog of cellular zzso zzso has been determined at the resolution of zzso A and refined to an zzso zzso The structure of this zzso is similar to that of human zzso zzso forming an zzso zzso of two 17 zzso zzso related by a zzso zzso symmetry zzso zzso exhibits novel zzso of the zzso zzso and of the loop between zzso A and B compared to zzso These regions are likely to be involved in binding of one or more components of the zzso zzso system, and thus the structural differences may account for the lower binding affinity and limited spectrum of biological activities of viral zzso compared to zzso
