The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso gene of a zzso zzso zzso isolate was zzso Like those of other zzso the zzso P gene zzso P and C proteins in overlapping open reading frames and V protein by editing the P gene zzso Among P zzso based clones the editing site zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso predicting a P zzso and the zzso zzso and zzso predicting a V zzso were zzso Surprisingly, the three zzso zzso zzso and zzso were also found among clones generated from zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Thus, more than one viral zzso type appeared to be present in cells infected with the zzso zzso By a similar analysis of the virus zzso in the tissue from which the zzso isolate was zzso only the zzso type was found, indicating that the zzso and zzso types arose during adaptation of the virus to growth in cell zzso No editing site zzso likely to have arisen by editing the zzso type were encountered, and it remains zzso be determined whether zzso zzso V protein can be transcribed from zzso with this editing zzso Using zzso raised against the common N zzso and unique C zzso of the predicted P and V zzso the in zzso expression of these proteins was zzso
