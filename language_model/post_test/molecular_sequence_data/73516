zzso zzso I is a zzso zzso of the zzso type that recognizes up to 20 zzso of DNA and is zzso by an zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A combined zzso and DNA zzso approach was employed to investigate the specificity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The results indicate that the zzso binds primarily to short base paired regions that border the sites of DNA zzso and zzso zzso The minimal zzso spans no more than 15 zzso and while sequence zzso is tolerated in the DNA binding regions, the sequence and size of the zzso region is highly zzso The zzso has a slow turnover rate and cuts the coding strand with a slight preference over the zzso zzso Complex formation produces some distortion of the DNA double zzso within the zzso zzso The data are compatible with the two zzso zzso of zzso zzso I bridging the minor groove, where zzso occurs, and interacting within the major groove on either side, thereby stabilizing a distorted DNA double zzso This may provide a general mode of DNA interaction at least for the zzso zzso zzso
