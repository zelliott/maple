An increasing body of evidence points to zzso modifications of the thin filament regulatory zzso cardiac zzso T zzso and cardiac zzso I zzso by protein zzso C zzso zzso as important in both long- and short-term regulation of cardiac function and potentially implicated in the transition between compensated zzso and zzso The main sites for zzso zzso on zzso are zzso zzso and zzso and on zzso are zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso We analyzed the function of each zzso zzso using a zzso mimic approach introducing zzso zzso at zzso zzso sites and then measuring the zzso tension of fiber zzso exchanged with these zzso We also directly zzso zzso and zzso by zzso incorporated the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and determined the zzso tension at varying zzso zzso We followed the experimental data with zzso analysis prediction of zzso content of zzso and zzso peptides that undergo zzso Here we zzso our recent data on the specific functional role of zzso zzso sites of zzso and zzso
