A previously zzso zzso zzso II heavy chain zzso zzso which constitutes a distinct branch of the zzso muscle zzso II family, has recently been revealed in zzso data zzso We characterized the zzso properties and expression patterns of this zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso we found that the distribution of zzso zzso zzso and protein zzso is widespread in human and mouse zzso but is zzso and zzso distinct from zzso zzso and zzso In contrast to zzso zzso and zzso the zzso level in human fetal zzso is substantially lower than in adult zzso zzso zzso showed distinct patterns of expression for all three zzso zzso zzso zzso contains an alternatively spliced zzso of 24 zzso in loop I at a location analogous to where a spliced zzso appears in zzso zzso and in the smooth muscle zzso heavy zzso However, unlike zzso expression of the zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso inserted zzso has widespread tissue zzso zzso expression of zzso and inserted zzso zzso heavy zzso zzso zzso zzso resulted in significant quantities of expressed protein zzso of zzso for zzso zzso but not for zzso zzso zzso characterization of zzso zzso by zzso zzso activity demonstrated a zzso of zzso + zzso zzso which was zzso activated at an zzso concentration of zzso + zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso filaments at a rate of zzso + zzso zzso in the absence of zzso and at zzso + zzso zzso in the presence of zzso in an in zzso zzso zzso
