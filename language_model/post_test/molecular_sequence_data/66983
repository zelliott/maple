zzso sequences of the zzso zzso gene zzso for eight strains of zzso zzso were determined by constructing zzso zzso A striking finding was that all eight strains of zzso zzso examined had identical zzso zzso including those of the two zzso zzso The length of zzso 2 was nearly three times the size of zzso in strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso but zzso 1 was comparable in size to the number of zzso present in zzso 1 and 2 of zzso zzso and zzso zzso A high degree of zzso acid zzso zzso existed for the zzso genes of the strains of zzso zzso when compared with sequences of zzso zzso and zzso zzso There were many zzso differences present, but they did not affect the zzso acid sequence because they were present in the third zzso The identity of the zzso zzso zzso was confirmed by sequencing the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Four zzso zzso strains were zzso for production of zzso a zzso found primarily in apple juice and other fruit zzso The zzso zzso strains produced zzso in amounts comparable to zzso zzso zzso Interest in the zzso zzso is related to the ability of its zzso to survive zzso and cause zzso of zzso fruit products zzso
