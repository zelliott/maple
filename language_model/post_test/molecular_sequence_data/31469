A zzso zzso rod was isolated independently from clinical specimens in New York State, USA, once in 2009 and twice in zzso The three zzso had identical zzso zzso gene sequences and, based on their zzso zzso gene zzso are most closely related to the type strains of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The partial zzso zzso gene sequences of the three strains were also zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis suggests that the new zzso belong to the family zzso Additional zzso and zzso characteristics of the strains support the family designation and suggest that the three zzso represent a single zzso In each of the zzso the zzso zzso is zzso the diagnostic zzso acid is zzso acid and the major cellular fatty acids are zzso zzso and zzso The polar lipids are zzso zzso zzso four unknown zzso four unknown zzso and an unknown zzso It is proposed that the novel zzso represent a single novel species within a new zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is strain zzso zzso zzso zzso
