Combined factor V and factor VIII zzso zzso is a rare, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is genetically linked to zzso in the zzso zzso zzso and its soluble interaction partner zzso The zzso protein complex functions as transport zzso of zzso factors V and VIII by zzso their export from the zzso zzso zzso Here, we studied a zzso patient who was found to be a compound zzso for 2 novel zzso in zzso a large deletion of zzso zzso eliminating the zzso of the gene and a nonsense zzso resulting in the deletion of only 3 zzso acids zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso and structural analysis of the zzso zzso demonstrated impaired binding to zzso due to modification of the zzso structure of zzso Our results highlight the importance of the zzso protein interaction for the efficient zzso of zzso factors V and zzso
