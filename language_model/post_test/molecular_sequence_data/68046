An zzso zzso zzso designated zzso was identified as a regulatory gene associated with zzso zzso The zzso gene was cloned on the basis of overproduction of zzso zzso following transformation of zzso strains with zzso DNA containing the zzso zzso genes zzso and zzso Transformation of an zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso with a zzso zzso DNA zzso containing zzso resulted in overproduction of all zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activities associated with the conversion of zzso acid and zzso were increased approximately zzso The zzso gene was found to complement an zzso zzso zzso zzso strain for zzso production, suggesting that zzso is functionally zzso to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene DNA sequence with that of the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso Payne, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cleveland, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 1993) showed that they shared zzso zzso DNA zzso Physical mapping of zzso zzso placed zzso approximately 8 zzso from zzso
