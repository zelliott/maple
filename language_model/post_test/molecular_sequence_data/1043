zzso zzso play an important role in many zzso either in zzso activity or by zzso zzso or zzso zzso The zzso zzso plays a critical role in zzso zzso in retinal rod zzso and cone zzso zzso by zzso zzso that enters rod and cone cells via the zzso zzso zzso and zzso contain five highly zzso zzso zzso The objectives of this study were zzso zzso to examine the importance of zzso zzso in zzso protein zzso zzso to examine their role in the interaction between zzso and the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso to generate a functional zzso zzso zzso The latter will facilitate structural studies taking advantage of the unique chemistry of the zzso group following zzso of zzso zzso at specific positions in the zzso zzso We generated a zzso zzso zzso protein that showed normal protein synthesis and processing and approximately 50% zzso zzso transport zzso zzso zzso were also not critical for the formation of zzso zzso or zzso zzso with the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Our results appear to rule out a critical importance of an zzso zzso linkage in zzso protein synthesis and folding as had been reported zzso
