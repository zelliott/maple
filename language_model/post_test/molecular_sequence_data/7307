zzso 3 of alfalfa mosaic virus encodes the movement protein zzso and the viral coat protein zzso zzso is translated from a zzso zzso messenger, zzso zzso To characterize the zzso promoter that is responsible for zzso 4 synthesis in zzso putative zzso promoter sequences were inserted in a unique zzso site located between the initiation zzso of the zzso gene and a second zzso zzso zzso in an infectious zzso clone of zzso zzso zzso with an active zzso promoter insert expressed an zzso truncated zzso protein and were able to accumulate in zzso In addition, zzso promoter activity was analyzed in zzso When the zzso start site is taken as zzso the sequence of zzso zzso was found to have a zzso level of zzso promoter zzso This activity was increased to near maximum levels when the zzso promoter sequence was extended to zzso The upstream positive regulatory element was mapped to zzso zzso Engineering of point zzso and small deletions in zzso 3 around the zzso start site for zzso 4 synthesis revealed elements important for zzso promoter activity with similarity to sequences zzso in zzso promoters of zzso zzso Some of these elements appeared to be required in zzso for zzso 3 zzso A deletion of the zzso three zzso acids of the zzso protein rendered this protein zzso in zzso zzso
