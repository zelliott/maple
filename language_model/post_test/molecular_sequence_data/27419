Data on zzso zzso zzso produced by zzso bacteria including zzso zzso especially molecular types of zzso genes from India are zzso The present study was conducted to investigate the carriage and zzso contents of zzso zzso zzso recovered from patients with zzso in a rural village in southern zzso 

Nine zzso zzso zzso obtained from 45 stool samples from patients with zzso from one rural and two urban sites, in southern India were included in the zzso zzso zzso testing, zzso analysis and sequencing were conducted to characterize the zzso zzso zzso zzso was assessed by zzso gel zzso zzso 

All the zzso were found to be resistant to at least one of the third generation zzso zzso All the study zzso were confirmed to produce zzso zzso and sequencing revealed the responsible gene to be zzso zzso and zzso were zzso zzso indicated that fi zzso of seven zzso from villagers were genetically closely zzso and in turn were related to zzso from patients in two urban areas in this zzso 

Our findings showed that zzso zzso of zzso zzso producing zzso were present in multiple areas in southern zzso zzso studies need to be done in various geographical regions of the country to better define the molecular epidemiology of zzso zzso zzso and its clinical zzso
