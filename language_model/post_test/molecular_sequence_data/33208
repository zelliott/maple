The zzso zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso peculiar zzso surrounded by a zzso layer between their inner and outer envelope zzso Although the zzso zzso zzso zzso higher plant zzso zzso in coding capacity by about 50 protein zzso these primitive zzso still have to import zzso zzso across their unique zzso zzso One such protein is zzso an essential zzso of the Calvin zzso We report the sequence of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso and in zzso import experiments of precursor zzso into zzso and into pea zzso The transit sequence clearly indicates the zzso of the gene product to zzso and is more similar to the transit sequences of the plant zzso than to transit sequences of other zzso precursor zzso with the exception of a zzso consensus sequence at the zzso The mature sequence reveals conservation of the zzso zzso binding zzso A zzso zzso graph suggests that zzso higher plants, and the zzso zzso zzso zzso acquired their zzso zzso genes via zzso gene transfer from the zzso zzso of zzso in the case of zzso probably zzso two zzso once from the zzso in the green zzso lineage and once again in the secondary zzso underlying the origin of zzso zzso By contrast, zzso genes in some zzso with secondary zzso of red zzso origin, such as zzso zzso have retained the pre-existing zzso gene germane to their secondary zzso
