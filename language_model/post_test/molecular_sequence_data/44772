To improve the efficiency of the zzso conversion of zzso acid zzso to zzso acid zzso we attempted to increase the activity of the conversion zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by the zzso gene in zzso zzso By connecting the zzso promoter of zzso zzso the zzso sequence of zzso of zzso coli, and zzso at a suitable position upstream of the zzso zzso we obtained zzso zzso zzso of the zzso of the upstream region of the zzso gene on zzso showed that the zzso region of the zzso zzso which encodes zzso zzso was zzso and a short zzso consisted of 14 zzso acids was zzso zzso coli zzso showed an increase in the activity of approximately 370 times when compared with that of the strain zzso and the amount of the zzso protein represented zzso zzso of the total cellular zzso zzso zzso was cultivated in a 5-liter jar zzso using a medium which contained mainly corn steep zzso The culture broth had high zzso zzso zzso In the conversion reaction using mixed zzso consisted of 600 zzso of zzso broth of zzso zzso zzso and 30 zzso of cultured broth of zzso coli zzso a zzso zzso zzso and zzso were added to the reaction mixture to make the cell membrane permeable to zzso After 23 h of the reaction, 70 zzso (131 zzso of zzso was accumulated from 83 zzso zzso zzso of zzso without addition of zzso The zzso conversion yield was zzso zzso The facts that the cell membrane was treated to allow zzso to zzso and that the conversion reaction proceeded well enough in spite of a small amount of zzso coli cells indicate zzso was zzso from zzso by zzso zzso cells and supplied to zzso coli zzso zzso it was considered that the zzso reaction between these two kind of strains was zzso
