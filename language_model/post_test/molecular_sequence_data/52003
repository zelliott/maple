zzso 22 of the human factor VIII gene was recently found to contain a zzso associated with a zzso island, which is transcribed in the direction opposite to factor zzso We now report that another transcript emanates from the island and is transcribed in the same direction as factor zzso The divergent transcripts originate within 122 bases of each zzso The newly identified zzso zzso in zzso 22 potentially codes for eight zzso acids and is spliced to zzso zzso with the factor VIII reading frame zzso The protein zzso by this transcript would include the factor VIII C2 domain, responsible for zzso binding and essential for zzso zzso
