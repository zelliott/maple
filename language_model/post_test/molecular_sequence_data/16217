A complete 120 zzso zzso consensus sequence for the mouse minor satellite has been determined from enriched zzso zzso zzso The extensive sequence zzso existing between the major and minor satellite suggests an evolutionary zzso Some sequences zzso the minor satellite has also been identified and they provide insight into zzso DNA zzso zzso in zzso zzso analysis of the minor satellite to mouse zzso and zzso zzso zzso spreads showed that this repetitive DNA class is localized specifically to zzso of all zzso of the zzso With the use of high resolution zzso zzso in zzso zzso the minor satellite is further localized to the outer surface of the zzso in a discrete region at or immediately adjacent to the zzso Our zzso data suggests that the minor satellite might play a role in the organization of the zzso region rather than, as previously suggested, sites for general zzso of the zzso to the nuclear zzso
