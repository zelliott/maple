zzso of primer zzso is a small zzso protein that zzso in the mechanism that controls the copy number of zzso of the zzso family by increasing the affinity between two complementary zzso The zzso zzso is a bundle of four tightly packed zzso that are held together by zzso zzso We have systematically altered, by site directed zzso most of the zzso exposed zzso acids of the zzso bundle and we have identified the zzso that cause a decrease of the activity of the regulatory zzso We conclude that zzso folding is rather insensitive to zzso acid zzso and to other zzso as drastic as deletions and zzso Looking along the zzso symmetry axis the zzso acid side chains whose zzso affect the function of zzso are all located on one side of the zzso zzso they are clustered at the zzso of the zzso zzso the only exception being the aromatic ring of zzso
