Two zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso L and zzso sharing zzso similarly but differing in ability to break zzso resistance in zzso were zzso zzso clones corresponding to these two zzso and their zzso clones resulting from swapping different regions of zzso zzso between L and zzso were zzso Only zzso or zzso containing the middle zzso of zzso zzso showed zzso on zzso zzso zzso comparison analysis revealed that the middle zzso region of L and zzso encodes four different zzso zzso Point zzso demonstrated that a single zzso acid substitution zzso in the zzso protein determined zzso toward zzso zzso In addition, six new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of the second passage on Williams 82 infected with the zzso or zzso zzso on soybean carrying zzso were zzso zzso data indicated that these new zzso contain either the zzso zzso or a new substitution zzso in zzso zzso zzso confirmed the zzso role of the zzso zzso on zzso zzso Taken together, these data suggest that zzso of the zzso zzso strain is an zzso zzso for zzso and one single zzso zzso in zzso may be sufficient to compromise its zzso zzso
