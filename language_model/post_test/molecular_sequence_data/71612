zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso with high zzso activity as to zzso acid zzso In this study, we provide direct evidence that retinal zzso is identical to zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso from rabbit liver zzso using the original methods, showed completely identical zzso patterns and zzso acid sequences for three corresponding zzso zzso zzso zzso The primary structural information obtained from the zzso zzso permitted molecular cloning of the full-length zzso of rabbit liver retinal zzso zzso zzso We also cloned and zzso the full-length zzso of mouse retinal zzso The zzso of rabbit and mouse retinal zzso have a common sequence approximately zzso zzso long, zzso zzso coding zzso The open reading frames of the zzso predict single zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the calculated minimum molecular mass of each is approximately zzso Northern zzso analysis showed that the rabbit retinal zzso zzso was widely expressed in zzso Finally, we successfully constructed a zzso expression system for mouse retinal zzso The zzso zzso retinal zzso from zzso coli showed a typical spectrum of zzso zzso and a lower zzso zzso zzso for retinal and a higher zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso acid synthesis than those of rabbit retinal zzso (8 zzso and zzso zzso zzso This represents the first zzso zzso zzso to be expressed in an active form in a zzso zzso
