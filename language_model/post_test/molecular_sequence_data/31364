zzso is located at the nuclear periphery in zzso and is essential for cell zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso cells, we show that zzso is located at the nuclear zzso The molecular analysis of the zzso protein points to a two domain model: a zzso domain (the first zzso zzso zzso composed of repetitive sequences common to other nuclear proteins and an essential, zzso domain zzso zzso zzso the vital function of zzso The zzso zzso domain, which shows a zzso repeat organization, affected the correct location of two nuclear zzso zzso zzso acid zzso within a predicted zzso structure of this domain caused a zzso growth arrest at 37 degrees C and the appearance of zzso and zzso a zzso zzso in the zzso
