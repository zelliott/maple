A defined set of zzso and zzso containing zzso zzso were used to examine the specificity of the immobilized zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso also known as zzso zzso zzso containing the Lewis zzso zzso zzso Gal beta zzso alpha zzso beta zzso were significantly retarded in zzso from high density zzso zzso The zzso also bound the zzso zzso zzso zzso beta zzso alpha zzso The zzso did not bind zzso containing either zzso or zzso zzso nor did it bind the zzso zzso Gal beta zzso alpha zzso Although zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso was retarded in zzso from the zzso larger zzso containing the zzso zzso alpha zzso beta zzso zzso poorly with immobilized zzso Our results demonstrate that immobilized zzso is effective in zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso and is useful in analyzing specific zzso of zzso
