The mechanism by which the zzso zzso limits the damaging effects of zzso that are released from zzso late zzso does not depend upon zzso zzso in the systemic circulation since these proteins are excluded from the zzso zzso by the zzso zzso The purpose of this study was to identify the major zzso inhibitor of the zzso and determine its cellular zzso zzso cells, the major zzso component of the zzso zzso release a zzso zzso zzso alpha zzso in zzso zzso using zzso and a zzso zzso zzso prepared against zzso zzso alpha zzso establishes that this protein is actively zzso and zzso by zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso zzso collected by zzso suggest that alpha zzso rather than alpha zzso is the major zzso inhibitor in the zzso zzso in zzso The ability of alpha zzso to zzso zzso and growth factors such as zzso by a common mechanism suggests that this protein may have a dual function in the zzso
