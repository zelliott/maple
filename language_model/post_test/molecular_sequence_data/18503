Based on the zzso interaction with zzso zzso zzso a zzso penetration zzso zzso was initially introduced to modify zzso zzso zzso zzso against different breast cancer cell zzso irrespective of their zzso expression or zzso zzso The zzso characteristics of zzso were determined with approximately 100 zzso size, satisfactory distribution and high zzso In addition, drug release experiments demonstrated that modification with zzso has a negligible influence on the release profile of zzso Surface zzso resonance zzso analysis revealed that zzso zzso could increase the binding proportion of zzso with a model cell zzso It was demonstrated that modification with zzso highly facilitated the zzso delivery of zzso zzso and enhanced zzso via a zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso revealed a combination of cellular zzso mechanisms for zzso involving zzso raft and zzso zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso displayed more lasting zzso in the tumor and better tumor growth zzso with relatively low systemic and cardiac zzso In conclusion, zzso might be a promising delivery system for the delivery of different therapeutic or imaging agents to zzso zzso More significantly, this study provides a new perspective on developing zzso drug delivery system for zzso zzso
