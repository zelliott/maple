zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso associated with zzso of the DNA replication complex is zzso selectively in zzso center B zzso We studied promoter activity of the zzso region involved in the zzso zzso expression in B lineage cells by zzso reporter zzso Selective regulation of zzso expression was observed in the zzso promoter region in B and plasma cell lines but was significantly low in zzso and T cell zzso The deletion zzso displayed a gap decrease after zzso the region from zzso to zzso zzso Further narrowing suggested the involvement of the zzso consensus sequence at zzso zzso by zzso mobility shift zzso The protein component zzso complex is not inhibited with zzso zzso at the consensus site but is inhibited with the known zzso probe of zzso and with zzso zzso Moreover, introduction of zzso zzso enhanced the reporter gene activity in a zzso manner in B cells, whereas the reporter construct with the zzso zzso site did not zzso zzso stimulation induced the reporter activity with a zzso increase, which is not observed with the zzso reporter zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso DNA zzso expression is partly regulated by the zzso factor zzso expressed in B lineage zzso
