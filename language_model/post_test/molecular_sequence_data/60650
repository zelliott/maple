The zzso gene zzso a zzso zzso from zzso zzso strain zzso was cloned and zzso It is located upstream of two genes zzso an zzso zzso of nascent zzso complex alpha zzso and a zzso zzso This gene organization is not zzso in several zzso zzso The multiple sequence alignments of the zzso gene product suggest significant sequence similarity of the zzso core fold to that of a low potential zzso zzso zzso without a zinc zzso The tightly bound zinc site of zzso zzso from two zzso zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain 7, was further investigated by zzso zzso zzso The zinc zzso zzso zzso zzso of both zzso zzso are zzso similar, demonstrating that the same zinc site is found in zzso zzso zzso as in zzso zzso zzso which suggests the structural conservation of isolated zinc binding sites among zzso zzso zzso The sequence and zzso data provide the common structural features of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
