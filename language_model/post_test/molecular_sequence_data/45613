To develop a simple and inexpensive DNA detection method, we prepared a zzso imprinted zzso zzso gel for recognizing a specific zzso DNA zzso target sequence in zzso gel zzso zzso During zzso migration of the target sequence of zzso should be hindered by the capture effect of the binding sites in the zzso zzso This migration hindrance of target zzso was determined by plotting the relationship between the migration distance in the zzso gel and that in zzso zzso commonly used in gel zzso Using this plot, detection of a target zzso from a mixture of zzso zzso fragments was zzso Moreover, we found the detection method successfully distinguished between a target and its zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso could be employed for detection of a target zzso zzso
