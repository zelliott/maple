The structure and structural dynamics of zzso and zzso in zzso and replication were studied by zzso zzso A general strategy has been designed and a number of methods have been developed to map proteins bound to the zzso DNA, to sequence the arrangement of such proteins along DNA in zzso complexes, and to identify interacting zzso and zzso acid zzso Perspectives for large-scale mapping of proteins associated with zzso DNA are zzso
