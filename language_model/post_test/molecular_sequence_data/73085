zzso 2 is an zzso zzso found in the skin of zzso zzso To find a reversed zzso comparable to the zzso activity of zzso 2 zzso we have zzso three reversed zzso the zzso zzso zzso and zzso corresponding to the normal zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We examined their ability to inhibit the growth of zzso coli and zzso zzso Among the zzso the zzso that is, the reverse of zzso enhanced the zzso and the zzso tendency of zzso 2, showed not only almost the same zzso activity against the bacteria as zzso but also stronger activity than other zzso 2 zzso In addition, at the zzso zzso zzso zzso value, zzso shows no zzso to human red blood cells, while both zzso and zzso cause strong zzso at the zzso zzso This result indicates that a novel reversed zzso comparable or superior to normal zzso 2 zzso is zzso
