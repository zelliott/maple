Heat shock proteins are molecular zzso linked to a myriad of zzso functions in both zzso and zzso In this study, we show that the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso genes are zzso expressed in an zzso zzso whose expression is dependent on the zzso zzso background under optimal temperature for zzso zzso Heat shock induction of these three zzso genes showed different patterns in response to zzso pH changes in the zzso zzso However, their zzso upon heating for zzso was almost unaffected by ambient pH changes in the zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein is a member of a zzso signaling cascade that is involved in the zzso regulation of gene zzso Moreover, we identified several genes whose expression at zzso is also dependent on the zzso zzso zzso These results reveal novel aspects of the zzso and zzso networks of zzso zzso
