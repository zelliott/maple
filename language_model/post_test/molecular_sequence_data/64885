The zzso zzso is buried near the selectivity filter in the zzso zzso channel and forms a zzso bridge with zzso We have investigated the importance of zzso by examining zzso zzso at this position using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso destabilize the zzso zzso among them, the zzso zzso zzso has a relatively subtle zzso The zzso channel displays electrical activity when zzso into zzso zzso zzso In single channel recordings, the zzso retains zzso zzso and its zzso in the outward direction is zzso Some zzso properties are zzso inward zzso is zzso Our results show that that the zzso side chain is not a primary zzso of zzso selectivity or zzso in the zzso channel, either directly or through the zzso zzso zzso
