zzso zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from developing zzso seed zzso zzso characterization using zzso zzso raised against this protein indicates that the zzso is located in the zzso and that there is no zzso related zzso in the zzso from this zzso Isolation and sequence determination of full-length zzso clones for zzso and tobacco zzso demonstrate that the protein is highly zzso in these plants and is closely related to the zzso zzso A comparison of the zzso acid sequence of peptides derived from zzso zzso zzso with the zzso zzso from higher plants demonstrated that they are related and may have zzso from a common ancestral zzso The previously proposed relationship between zzso zzso and alkaline zzso is not supported by sequence analysis of the zzso and tobacco zzso zzso of the single zzso zzso zzso gene zzso well with other zzso zzso genes in developing and zzso zzso seeds, and with the appearance of zzso activity and zzso zzso in these zzso
