zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso causes citrus zzso and the completion of the zzso zzso sequence has opened up the possibility of investigating basic cellular mechanisms at the zzso zzso zzso compounds have been extensively used in agriculture to control plant zzso The zzso and zzso zzso identified by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of proteins involved in copper zzso A gene expression zzso by Northern zzso revealed that zzso and zzso are expressed as a unique transcript specifically induced by zzso zzso of the gene products was also induced by copper, reaching a maximum level at 4 h after addition of copper to the culture zzso zzso was a zzso protein and zzso was detected in the zzso zzso The gene zzso zzso was disrupted by the zzso of a zzso leading to zzso strains that were unable to grow in culture medium containing copper, even at the lowest zzso concentration tested zzso zzso whereas the zzso strain was able to grow in the presence of 1 zzso zzso Cell suspensions of the zzso and zzso strains in different copper zzso were zzso in lemon leaves to zzso their ability to induce citrus zzso zzso zzso of zzso strains showed higher sensitivity than the zzso strain in the presence of copper, zzso they were not able to induce citrus zzso symptoms at high copper zzso and exhibited a more retarded growth in zzso
