We have identified a novel putative protein zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso designated zzso by using a highly zzso zzso acid zzso sequence motif to design amplification of DNA fragments using zzso The putative translation product of zzso contains zzso zzso with a molecular mass of zzso zzso A single zzso was identified by zzso Southern zzso analysis, and the zzso mapping indicated that zzso was localized in zzso zzso zzso Growth of zzso zzso cells was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso oxide, a protein zzso zzso zzso but zzso cells were relatively resistant to this zzso
