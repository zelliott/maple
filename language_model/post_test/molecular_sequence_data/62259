The interaction of zzso protein zzso II zzso with the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is thought to be one of the important events leading to synaptic zzso zzso binds zzso by its zzso site and by the zzso site binding pocket zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso a zzso in the zzso of zzso that is likely to be interacting with zzso influences zzso of zzso The zzso of zzso a classical zzso site zzso of zzso is influenced to a much lesser extent by this zzso Taken together these results indicate that interaction of zzso at the zzso site of zzso influences zzso Our data suggest that kinetic models of zzso zzso zzso by zzso should incorporate the zzso mode of binding of peptides that is dependent on the sequence of the zzso
