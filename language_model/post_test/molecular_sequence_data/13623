zzso of an zzso agent into an zzso zzso has the potential to enhance binding affinity upon duplex formation, to increase zzso zzso and to enhance resistance to zzso zzso zzso zzso has been achieved through the synthesis of zzso and its incorporation into the zzso zzso zzso Melting temperature, CD zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and molecular models were obtained and compared with the unmodified zzso The data clearly establish that zzso of the zzso ring into a predominantly zzso zzso occurs between the zzso and zzso base pairs, significantly stabilizing the duplex and enhancing the zzso of the zzso
