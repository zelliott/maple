zzso zzso is one of the zzso sheath proteins which presumably has a role in determining the zzso structure of growing zzso zzso There may therefore be a relationship between the molecular evolution of the zzso gene and the development of zzso zzso zzso To investigate whether such a relationship exists, it was necessary to identify the zzso of the zzso gene in a zzso whose teeth lack an zzso zzso zzso To this end, several clones containing zzso zzso were isolated from zzso jaws using the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso revealed an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso starts at the zzso corresponding to the second of two putative start zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso The zzso part of the zzso zzso shows high zzso acid sequence similarities to human, zzso zzso rat and mouse zzso zzso as well as several other features that have been zzso throughout the evolution of zzso and zzso zzso the zzso sequences of the 3' untranslated region zzso are also zzso not only within zzso genes but also between zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene is a zzso zzso transcribed only in the zzso presumably in zzso
