The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying drought zzso in coffee plants by the identification of candidate genes zzso using different zzso The first approach used the data generated during the Brazilian Coffee expressed sequence tag zzso project to select 13 zzso by an in zzso analysis (electronic zzso The second approach was based on screening zzso spotted with zzso DNA zzso zzso with separate zzso using leaf zzso zzso from zzso and susceptible clones of zzso zzso zzso zzso grown under different water zzso This allowed the isolation of seven additional zzso The third approach used two-dimensional gel zzso to identify proteins displaying differential zzso in leaves of zzso and susceptible clones of zzso zzso Six of them were characterized by zzso zzso laser zzso of zzso mass zzso and the corresponding proteins were zzso Finally, additional zzso were selected from the literature, and quantitative real-time zzso chain reaction zzso was performed to zzso the expression of all identified zzso Altogether, zzso genes presenting differential gene expression during drought zzso were identified, some of them showing different expression profiles between zzso and susceptible zzso Based on the obtained results, it can be concluded that factors involved a complex network of responses probably involving the zzso zzso zzso and zzso oxide are major molecular zzso that might explain the better efficiency in controlling zzso closure and zzso displayed by zzso clones of zzso zzso
