The remarkable diversity of the zzso of viruses found in zzso zzso environments with temperatures zzso degrees C is unprecedented for aquatic zzso The zzso viruses from these zzso have been assigned to novel viral families: zzso zzso and zzso They all have zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the orders zzso and zzso Representatives of the different viral families share a few zzso zzso zzso reading zzso However, about zzso of all zzso in the seven zzso zzso show no significant matches to sequences in public zzso This suggests that these zzso viruses have exceptional zzso solutions for biological zzso zzso features of zzso organization, as well as strategies for DNA zzso suggest that zzso relationships exist between zzso zzso and the large zzso DNA zzso zzso the African zzso fever virus and Chlorella zzso zzso patterns at the ends of the linear zzso of the zzso zzso are reminiscent of the zzso ends of linear zzso zzso and suggest that a primitive zzso mechanism operates in this zzso
