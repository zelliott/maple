We investigate zzso patterns of differentiation between parental populations of two zzso butterfly species that differ at a number of ecologically important zzso zzso Using a new zzso approach, we show that there is significant zzso in estimated divergence times among five zzso zzso rejecting a purely zzso zzso zzso We zzso that the Z zzso is a mosaic of regions that differ in the extent of historical gene flow, potentially due to zzso barriers that prevent the zzso of zzso traits that result in hybrid zzso Surprisingly, a candidate region for a strong barrier to zzso zzso does not show a significantly deeper divergence time than other markers on the Z zzso Our approach can be used to test alternative models of zzso and can potentially assign zzso order to the appearance of factors contributing to zzso isolation between zzso
