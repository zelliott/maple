zzso acid receptors zzso and zzso receptors zzso activate or repress zzso by binding as zzso to zzso elements that generally consist of two direct repeat zzso of consensus sequence zzso On response elements consisting of direct repeats spaced by five base pairs zzso + 5 zzso zzso zzso activate zzso in response to zzso zzso such as zzso acid zzso In contrast, on elements consisting of direct repeats spaced by one base pair zzso + 1 zzso zzso zzso exhibit little or no response to zzso zzso and repress zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso by zzso on DR + 5 elements requires the zzso of a new nuclear zzso zzso zzso and recruitment of the putative zzso zzso and zzso Surprisingly, on DR + 1 zzso zzso remains associated with zzso zzso even in the presence of zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso These observations indicate that zzso elements can zzso regulate zzso interactions to determine positive or negative regulation of gene zzso
