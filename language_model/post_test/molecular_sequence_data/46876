It was shown by Southern zzso that zzso zzso and common zzso New World zzso carry three or more genes zzso zzso also known as zzso In contrast, the zzso of Old World zzso as represented by zzso zzso and sacred zzso contain a single zzso zzso containing three different genes zzso zzso were isolated from a zzso zzso zzso zzso They carry two complete genes of four zzso and a third gene lacking the first zzso The structure suggests that the three genes are functionally active and give rise to transcripts that are approximately zzso similar in zzso By sequencing one gene in full, it was shown that the zzso carry an excess of zzso repeats, on average zzso of the zzso consist of zzso zzso A zzso analysis demonstrated that the genes probably arose in New World monkeys after the separation from Old World zzso
