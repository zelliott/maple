A novel human zzso named zzso (a clone number of fetal liver zzso zzso has been identified from more than 14,000 expressed sequence tags zzso based on our large scale sequencing of human fetal liver zzso zzso Although sequencing of this novel human gene indicates that it is a zzso zzso zzso the function of zzso and its zzso genes among species is unknown zzso To find out zzso functional clue of zzso the zzso zzso system was used to screen the zzso zzso and one clone containing a zzso insert with almost the entire coding sequence zzso acids 39 zzso of human zzso zzso domain binding protein 1) that zzso specifically with zzso was zzso A specific association between zzso and zzso was shown by zzso and zzso zzso Furthermore, the data indicated that zzso appeared to enhance zzso zzso activity in a zzso manner and zzso may be involved in the zzso signaling zzso from zzso to zzso
