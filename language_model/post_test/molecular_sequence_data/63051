Previous studies evidenced that zzso zzso gene is specifically expressed and induced in large circulating zzso cells following bacterial challenge in the zzso zzso zzso In order to understand the role of that zzso zzso inhibitor during immune response, we investigated the existence of members of zzso zzso We cloned a zzso zzso gene and studied its tissue zzso zzso studies using zzso L and zzso B zzso and zzso results demonstrated the presence of three distinct zzso cell zzso zzso the zzso which were initially defined as large zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso small zzso zzso Among those cells, while zzso contain zzso B and zzso zzso zzso zzso contain only zzso L and the third cell population contains neither zzso nor zzso Finally, results evidenced that zzso L zzso zzso zzso are zzso to the site of injury and zzso zzso
