The zzso zzso and zzso are structures on the zzso leaf that develop at the boundary of the sheath and zzso In the absence of zzso zzso gene zzso zzso and zzso are not formed, and the zzso boundary does not develop as an exact line between sheath and zzso By using the zzso zzso zzso element as a molecular tag, a novel zzso zzso zzso was isolated and zzso Analysis of zzso zzso sectors confirmed that the zzso gene product functions in a zzso zzso zzso cloning as well as zzso analysis of the zzso zzso indicate that the zzso gene is expressed at very low levels in the zzso region of developing zzso leaf zzso perhaps as early as zzso 6 or zzso Cellular zzso studies in a zzso system indicate that the zzso product zzso exclusively to the zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence of the zzso protein is largely novel but contains an internal domain of 77 zzso acids with significant similarity to a domain present in two recently identified zzso zzso proteins 1 and 2 zzso and zzso in zzso zzso
