zzso protein (AP) complexes are essential components for the formation of coated zzso and the recognition of cargo proteins for zzso zzso Each zzso complex exposes two zzso zzso with that function to bind regulatory accessory proteins in the zzso Secondary structure predictions, sequence alignments and CD zzso were used to relate the zzso of all human zzso complexes to the previously published crystal structure of zzso The results suggested that the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso have similar structures, consisting of two zzso whereas that of zzso lacks the inner zzso zzso and overlay zzso showed partial overlap in the binding zzso of the zzso of zzso and zzso whereas the corresponding domain of zzso displayed a unique binding zzso That zzso may have a zzso zzso domain was indicated by its apparent inability to bind any proteins from zzso Of several novel zzso proteins zzso one that had affinity exclusively for zzso was identified as sorting zzso 9 zzso zzso which contains a zzso and an zzso zzso 3 domain, was found in large complexes and was at least partially associated with zzso in the zzso zzso may function to assist zzso in its role at the plasma zzso
