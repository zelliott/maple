An outer membrane zzso class 2 protein from zzso zzso has been zzso in zzso coli, isolated from inclusion bodies, and zzso in the presence of zzso zzso The zzso zzso and native zzso zzso counterpart exhibit most of the typical functional and structural properties that are characteristic of bacterial zzso Channel forming activity has been monitored by incorporating class 2 into zzso zzso and measuring the zzso rates of various zzso through the zzso to derive a pore diameter of approximately zzso zzso zzso studies employing a combination of zzso and zzso techniques reveal that zzso and native class 2 are identical in terms of overall zzso zzso Both proteins form stable zzso in zzso zzso and retain significant secondary and zzso structure in the presence of zzso The zzso unfolding of zzso class 2 zzso zzso zzso 88 degrees zzso is zzso and characterized by zzso exposure of aromatic zzso with zzso disruption of zzso and partial loss of secondary zzso zzso zzso and irreversible unfolding of the native zzso assembly occurs at temperatures above 60 degrees zzso Our zzso studies of zzso class 2 protein furnish significant insight regarding the structural and functional properties of this zzso outer membrane protein within the zzso zzso
