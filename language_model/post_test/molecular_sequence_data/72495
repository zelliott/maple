zzso T cell lines may be zzso used to identify relatively zzso zzso zzso that dominate zzso recognition of zzso zzso Using a combination of zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and overlapping peptides that span the coding regions of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso we have mapped the zzso relatively zzso zzso zzso recognized by 25 zzso individuals with zzso counts between 100 and zzso and no history of AIDS opportunistic zzso We could characterize at least 1 zzso zzso zzso recognized by the T cell lines of 18 of 25 of the zzso the T cell lines from 2 additional subjects recognized zzso presenting targets, but no dominant zzso zzso was zzso zzso zzso were most frequently zzso by gag zzso by 16 of 25 patient T cell zzso followed by zzso and zzso (11 of 25 each), and the zzso region of pol (9 of zzso zzso and Rev were rarely the sites of zzso zzso The identified zzso occurred predominantly in relatively zzso regions of zzso The mean number of zzso peptides identified at a single time for each cell line was zzso zzso zzso Although no single zzso dominated zzso recognition in more than four individuals, clusters of zzso were found in the zzso region of zzso and in two central regions of zzso The dominant zzso zzso zzso in infected patients were not predictable on the basis of zzso expression and varied widely in an zzso zzso
