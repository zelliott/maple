As with most zzso zzso repeated zzso stimulation of the zzso factor zzso zzso results in its zzso zzso and zzso In this report, we show that zzso zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso but is dependent on zzso and involves the interaction of zzso with a limited region of the zzso C zzso In zzso zzso cells, both zzso and zzso could be zzso with zzso and zzso stimulation of zzso induced the zzso of both zzso and zzso Furthermore, zzso of zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso zzso zzso was inhibited by a dominant negative zzso of zzso The zzso of a zzso zzso the zzso segment of the zzso abolished zzso zzso zzso and inhibited zzso zzso Using C zzso deletion zzso we determined that the association of zzso with the zzso was dependent on the region between zzso zzso and zzso 330 because zzso could be zzso with the zzso zzso but not zzso zzso zzso could mediate zzso zzso zzso whereas zzso could zzso Two other deletion zzso with slightly longer regions of the C zzso zzso and zzso also failed to induce zzso zzso Finally, the zzso zzso zzso containing a single substitution in the putative zzso motif zzso in the seventh zzso domain (which we had shown to be able to zzso but not to couple to zzso could efficiently induce zzso zzso Taken together, our results indicate that zzso zzso zzso is dependent on zzso that zzso can associate with both zzso and zzso and that their zzso involves interaction with the region of zzso zzso in the zzso C zzso but is independent of zzso zzso
