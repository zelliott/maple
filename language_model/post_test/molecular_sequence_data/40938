By binding to the surface of ice zzso type III zzso protein zzso can zzso the freezing point of fish blood to below that of freezing zzso This zzso zzso protein is zzso by a zzso family that produces two major zzso SP and zzso which are zzso zzso zzso zzso on the zzso site of type III zzso lower zzso activity but can also change ice crystal zzso By attaching green fluorescent protein to different zzso and zzso and by examining the binding of these fusion proteins to zzso ice zzso we show that type III zzso has a compound zzso zzso There are two zzso flat, zzso surfaces at zzso to each zzso One binds the primary zzso plane of zzso the other, a zzso zzso zzso zzso on the latter surface cause zzso of the ice crystal as primary zzso plane binding becomes zzso SP zzso naturally have a greatly reduced ability to bind the zzso planes of zzso zzso that make the SP zzso more zzso slow down the rate of ice zzso On the basis of these observations we zzso that other types of zzso also have compound zzso sites that enable them to bind to multiple planes of zzso
