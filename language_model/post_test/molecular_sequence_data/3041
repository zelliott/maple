Two different type II zzso are known in zzso DNA zzso zzso introduces negative zzso into zzso zzso IV zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso of bacterial type II zzso are involved in breakage and reunion of zzso The spatial structure of the zzso zzso in zzso is not zzso We zzso zzso between the zzso domain of zzso and a regulator of zzso zzso zzso a zzso protein that functions as a zzso factor for the nuclear G protein zzso This zzso zzso by detection of 6 sequence repeats with 4 predicted zzso each in zzso zzso allows us to predict that the zzso zzso domain folds into a zzso zzso The prediction zzso available experimental data and sheds light on the spatial properties of the largest zzso domain that lacks structural zzso
