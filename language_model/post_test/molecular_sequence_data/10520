The human zzso protein zzso interacts functionally with serum response factor zzso to impart serum responsive zzso activity to zzso sites in a zzso cell zzso zzso However, stable zzso complexes composed of zzso zzso and DNA, which presumably mediate the zzso effects of zzso in zzso have not been observed in zzso Here, we report the zzso zzso and molecular cloning of a human protein that promotes the formation of stable zzso complexes of zzso and zzso We show that this zzso termed zzso interacts with zzso and zzso in zzso and in zzso Furthermore, zzso binds specifically to multiple sequences in the zzso promoter and interacts zzso with zzso to promote zzso zzso of a reporter gene driven by the zzso serum response element zzso zzso is identical to the zzso protein zzso zzso with this hypothesis, zzso exhibits modest affinity for a characterized zzso sequence in zzso We propose that this zzso protein coordinates the formation of an active promoter complex at the zzso zzso including the linkage of specific signal responsive zzso complexes to the general zzso zzso
