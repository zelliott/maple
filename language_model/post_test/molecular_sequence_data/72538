zzso in the human zzso genes zzso and zzso are associated with early onset familial zzso zzso The zzso genes zzso integral membrane proteins with similar structures, which suggests that they may have closely zzso but as yet unknown zzso Analysis of the zzso upstream sequence and the structure of the zzso gene reveals that the zzso sequence contains multiple putative zzso regulatory elements including clusters of zzso elements involved in zzso zzso in response to signal zzso The first four zzso contain untranslated zzso with zzso 1 and 2 representing alternate initial zzso zzso The function of these alternate initial zzso is zzso zzso 4 bears the first zzso zzso The last 12 zzso of zzso 4 is used as an alternative zzso donor zzso zzso 9 is alternately spliced in zzso but not in most other zzso zzso of zzso 9 is predicted to cause significant structural changes to the zzso The majority of transcripts expressed in most zzso are zzso zzso zzso from the zzso stop zzso in zzso zzso A small proportion of transcripts contain the same zzso and zzso but are zzso zzso zzso from the stop zzso The longer zzso transcripts contain three additional zzso and at least one additional zzso structure with zzso greater than zzso zzso
