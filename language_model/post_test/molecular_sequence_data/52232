Human zzso zzso clones have been isolated from zzso and zzso zzso zzso libraries utilizing a previously cloned rat partial zzso zzso as the zzso zzso analysis of all zzso clones indicates the presence of intervening sequences in several zzso zzso This has been confirmed by sequencing human zzso zzso zzso zzso sequences can be removed from the zzso clones by restriction with zzso at unique sites within the proposed open reading zzso This results in a zzso pair zzso proposed to contain the entire zzso open reading frame, which would zzso a zzso acid zzso with a predicted zzso molecular mass of zzso zzso zzso and predicted zzso acid comparisons with the 264 base pairs of proposed coding sequences in the rat zzso zzso demonstrate zzso similarity and identity, zzso A comparison of the predicted human zzso and zzso zzso demonstrates zzso in their zzso zzso Included in this region is the zzso zzso zzso proposed to be part of the zzso site of all zzso zzso In contrast, the predicted zzso zzso of the human zzso and zzso zzso are zzso When placed in a zzso expression zzso the human zzso zzso expresses zzso zzso activity which can be zzso with zzso zzso specific for zzso zzso
