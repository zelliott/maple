Human zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso play an important role in catalyzing the metabolism of many environmental chemicals including zzso zzso and several zzso zzso Both zzso and zzso proteins are composed of zzso zzso acid zzso Although zzso shares a zzso identity with zzso in the zzso acid zzso it is only about one-tenth as active as zzso in catalyzing zzso zzso To identify the key zzso acid zzso that account for such a remarkable difference, we generated a series of zzso and zzso zzso by zzso zzso expression and compared their zzso zzso zzso In zzso the zzso acid zzso at position 117 and zzso are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso whereas in zzso they are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed that the zzso efficiency zzso of the zzso zzso Ala and zzso His zzso was drastically reduced zzso and zzso versus zzso for the zzso zzso zzso In contrast, the zzso efficiency of the zzso zzso zzso Val and zzso zzso zzso zzso was greatly increased zzso and zzso versus zzso for zzso zzso zzso These results clearly demonstrate that the Val at position 117 and zzso at position zzso are critical zzso acid zzso for zzso zzso Based on the crystal structure of zzso we have generated the zzso models of zzso and zzso and zzso the zzso zzso to the active zzso Together with the kinetic zzso our structural modeling provides explanations for the zzso acid substitution results and the insights of detailed zzso zzso
