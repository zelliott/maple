A zzso zzso and faintly zzso bacterial strain, zzso was isolated from soil samples collected from a desert in zzso zzso The zzso was found to be resistant to zzso radiation but sensitive to gamma radiation and zzso The optimum growth zzso zzso concentration and temperature were pH zzso zzso % zzso and 30 degrees zzso zzso analysis based on the zzso zzso gene sequence indicated that strain zzso is member of a novel species belonging to the zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso as its closest relative zzso % zzso The DNA zzso content zzso zzso zzso type zzso major cellular fatty acids (16 : zzso 16 : 0 and 17 : 1 iso zzso the presence of zzso with zzso and the dominant polar zzso zzso and zzso support the affiliation of strain zzso with the zzso zzso A novel species is proposed, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso AB zzso zzso zzso
