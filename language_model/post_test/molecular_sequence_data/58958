zzso growth factor zzso binds several discrete membrane zzso Of these, a type 1 zzso appears indispensable for signal zzso Previous examination of zzso zzso expression has been limited to changes in cell surface zzso and more recently, zzso zzso In order to learn more about zzso function and zzso expression during zzso we have now cloned a 4 zzso zzso DNA zzso zzso zzso to the coding region of the rat zzso type I zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed multiple elements compatible with zzso zzso including a properly positioned and oriented zzso box, six zzso binding sites (three defining zzso zzso and two strong zzso binding sites within a zzso zzso span directly upstream of the coding zzso The 3' terminal zzso zzso span comprises a zzso zzso so-called zzso island that, like other similarly organized zzso lacks a zzso zzso zzso extension and zzso protection studies with zzso from this area show multiple initiation sites within 220 zzso zzso zzso to the initial zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso deleted, and zzso promoter sequences demonstrated zzso reporter expression by a 1 zzso zzso encompassing all of these zzso zzso of the 1 zzso zzso from the zzso and 3' ends indicated the need for several elements for peak promoter zzso These results, and zzso in fetal rat bone and zzso cells, suggest that this promoter contains elements that specify zzso and conditional expression of the zzso type I zzso in zzso
