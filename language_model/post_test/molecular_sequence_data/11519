As part of a systematic search for a major genetic locus for schizophrenia we have examined zzso 22 using 14 highly zzso markers in 23 disease zzso The markers were distributed at an average distance of zzso zzso covering zzso of the zzso We analyzed the data by the zzso score method using five plausible genetic models ranging from dominant to zzso after testing the power of our sample under the same genetic zzso The most positive zzso score found was zzso under a zzso model for the marker zzso which is insufficient to conclude zzso However, an excess of shared zzso in affected siblings zzso zzso zzso was found for both zzso and zzso For zzso the A statistic was equal to the zzso score zzso and therefore did not provide additional evidence for linkage allowing for zzso but the Liang statistic was more significant zzso zzso zzso Our results suggest the possibility that the region around zzso and zzso contains a gene which contributes to the zzso of zzso
