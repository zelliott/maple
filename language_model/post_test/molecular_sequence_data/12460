The crystal structure of the zzso domain of rat DNA zzso beta revealed that zzso is located in proximity to the previously identified active site zzso zzso and zzso We have prepared and zzso characterized the zzso transfer activity of wild type and several zzso forms of human and rat pol zzso zzso we report zzso kinetic zzso of zzso zzso and zzso for zzso in zzso zzso and two neighboring zzso zzso and zzso all centrally located on strand beta 7 in the pol beta zzso zzso of zzso to zzso abolished the zzso activity of pol zzso Conservative replacement with zzso acid zzso led to a zzso reduction of zzso compared to wild zzso Replacement of zzso with an zzso zzso resulted in a zzso reduction of zzso compared to wild zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso increased about zzso relative to wild zzso Replacement of zzso with a zzso resulted in a zzso decrease in zzso and a zzso increase in the zzso These kinetic observations support a role of zzso and zzso in the positioning of zzso metal zzso and zzso in precise geometrical orientation for efficient zzso The zzso of zzso to zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increase in zzso and a zzso increase in zzso but resulted in no change of zzso These observations are discussed in the context of the three-dimensional structures of the zzso domain of pol beta and the zzso complex of pol zzso zzso and zzso
