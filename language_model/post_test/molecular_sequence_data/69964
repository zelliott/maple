The effect of the zzso zzso proliferation zzso substance zzso zzso on the promotion phase in zzso zzso was zzso zzso could be the active component in what has been called zzso zzso zzso mice were given an initial application of 100 zzso zzso in 200 zzso zzso One week later promotion was started with topical applications of 17 zzso zzso zzso twice a zzso zzso minutes before each zzso application the control group received a topical application of 200 zzso zzso grade zzso and the two experimental groups were given either zzso or zzso zzso in 200 zzso zzso The mice were observed for time of occurrence and time of zzso of zzso The number of tumors produced by the group given the zzso substances before zzso increased, and so did the percentage of zzso zzso There was also a tendency towards a higher degree of zzso zzso in the animals treated with zzso before zzso We have previously shown that zzso enhances zzso zzso zzso Since we regard zzso as a zzso promoter with weak zzso zzso very different from zzso the fact that zzso has the same enhancing effect on promotion as it has on complete zzso zzso raises some very interesting questions, and may indicate a similarity between the mechanisms in promotion and complete zzso Some possible explanations of the results are discussed, zzso whether the transit zone late zzso of the cell cycle is the most sensitive one for zzso or zzso zzso
