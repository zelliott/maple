To develop a zzso display of zzso zzso zzso zzso of total cell DNA and zzso were obtained from zzso of zzso zzso The DNA fragments zzso variable regions of light and heavy zzso chains were amplified and isolated using zzso specific to the conservative regions of these zzso The construction of the library was based on the principle of zzso combining of the DNA fragments zzso the light and heavy zzso chains with the DNA zzso whose structure corresponded to the zzso zzso The zzso library was constructed using the zzso coli zzso strain and the zzso zzso zzso The repertoire of the library exceeded 5 zzso zzso independent zzso zzso The clones producing zzso to the zzso zzso human factor were zzso The affinity zzso of the resulting zzso were in the range of 2 zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso
