zzso possessing zzso induced by zzso zzso is known as an zzso protein induced after administration of bacterial zzso zzso to zzso In the present study, we cloned bovine zzso zzso and examined its zzso expression in white blood cells isolated from zzso zzso zzso zzso had more than zzso zzso acid identities with zzso and human zzso highly zzso zzso motifs and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in isolated peripheral white blood cells, but rapidly induced zzso after stimulation by zzso and zzso A in zzso in a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was found in zzso cells, zzso and total zzso but not in zzso zzso zzso was also induced in zzso in peripheral blood zzso of cows after zzso injection of zzso coli derived from zzso zzso Thus, bovine zzso as zzso zzso is induced by inflammatory stimuli in specific immune cells in zzso and in zzso suggesting a role in inflammatory responses to bacterial infection in zzso
