Millions of people die every year in the tropical world from diseases transmitted by zzso zzso Failure of conventional zzso measures emphasizes the need for additional approaches, such as transformation of zzso insects with genes that restrict zzso zzso The availability of an efficient promoter to drive foreign genes in transgenic insects is a necessary tool to test the feasibility of such zzso Here we characterize the putative promoter region of a black fly zzso zzso gene and show that these sequences correctly direct the expression of a zzso reporter in zzso zzso By zzso zzso and zzso analysis, we found that the gene is expressed strongly and zzso in the transgenic zzso This zzso black fly zzso promoter provides a valuable tool for the study of disease zzso
