zzso factors zzso are crucial for oxygen zzso during both embryonic development and zzso zzso Here we show that a novel zzso family basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is expressed predominantly during embryonic and zzso stages and thereby designated zzso zzso and embryonic zzso acts as a negative regulator of zzso gene zzso zzso zzso is derived from the zzso gene by alternative zzso replacing the first zzso of zzso with that of zzso zzso zzso can zzso with zzso and exhibits only low levels of zzso activity, similar to that of zzso zzso suppressed reporter gene expression driven by zzso and zzso By generating mice with a targeted disruption of the zzso zzso we found that zzso zzso mice zzso were viable but displayed enlargement of the right zzso and impaired lung zzso The expression of zzso 1 and zzso growth factor beta was increased in the lung zzso cells of zzso zzso These results demonstrate a novel regulatory mechanism in which the activities of zzso and zzso are zzso regulated by zzso in zzso cells, which is pertinent to lung and heart development during the embryonic and zzso zzso
