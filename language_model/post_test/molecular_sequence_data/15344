Sexual communication between male and female zzso involves the visual detection of zzso In the present study, we isolated two different types of zzso zzso from an adult of the Japanese zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis indicated that these genes zzso to long zzso and zzso zzso This is in agreement with the prior findings, in which the spectral sensitivity of the zzso zzso eye showed two peaks, zzso and long zzso and the latter substantially matched the zzso spectrum of zzso zzso zzso changes in both zzso zzso levels were determined by quantitative zzso zzso In adult zzso the zzso level of long zzso zzso was higher at night than in the day, and peaked at zzso the time when the zzso behavior was most zzso On the other hand, the expression level of zzso zzso was not significantly changed during the zzso In adult zzso zzso changes in the expression of both zzso were not zzso The results suggest that the expression level of zzso zzso in female zzso zzso is linked to their mating zzso
