zzso zzso zzso and zzso are involved in cellular stress response and development of several diseases, including zzso Our aim was to examine the involvement of the zzso proteins in acute zzso stress response induced in zzso kidney by zzso treatment, and in zzso caused by prolonged zzso of male Syrian zzso We used zzso zzso to estimate the zzso and zzso zzso levels in kidney zzso and Western zzso to monitor the amount of the zzso zzso Within the first five hours following zzso administration both zzso zzso and the protein levels were increased zzso No changes in the expression of zzso were zzso This indicates that zzso may be involved in the response against zzso stress induced by zzso treatment in zzso zzso During prolonged zzso a significant reduction of the zzso zzso and protein levels was observed after 6 months of zzso treatment, while the expression of zzso was significantly elevated starting from the third zzso This suggests an involvement of the zzso proteins in zzso zzso in zzso Using zzso in zzso zzso we localized the zzso gene at the zzso region of Syrian zzso zzso 2, the region known to undergo a zzso deletion upon prolonged zzso It is possible that the reduced level of zzso expression is due to this zzso zzso A full-length zzso sequence of the zzso zzso gene was zzso It codes for a 50 zzso protein which has 98 and zzso identity with mouse and human counterparts, zzso
