zzso is a member of the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain proteins found in zzso zzso zzso and zzso It has been implicated in the zzso of the zzso and has been reported to mediate zzso repression of zzso B1 zzso 

In the present study, we report that zzso zzso is zzso zzso at the level of initiation in stage 4 zzso and becomes activated in stage 6 zzso The zzso repression of zzso zzso zzso with the presence of a short zzso tail on this zzso in stage 4 zzso The zzso zzso zzso of zzso can zzso the zzso regulation to a reporter zzso and so can the zzso of human zzso A zzso zzso repeat element was found to repress translation in both stage 4 and stage 6 zzso but deletion of this element did not abrogate repression in stage 4 zzso zzso zzso experiments indicated that overlapping sets of proteins bind efficiently to both the zzso and the zzso B1 zzso As reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to the zzso B1 zzso but its binding to the zzso zzso is zzso By zzso affinity zzso and zzso we identified the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso as one of the proteins binding to both the zzso and the zzso B1 zzso 

zzso zzso is zzso regulated by at least two zzso elements and an zzso zzso One of the zzso elements is the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso binds to both the zzso and zzso B1 zzso indicating it may be involved in the zzso of these zzso
