zzso pancreatic zzso inhibitor zzso is a zzso protein with three zzso bonds that belongs to the zzso family of zzso zzso zzso zzso is an extremely potent inhibitor of zzso but it also specifically binds to various active and inactive zzso zzso zzso with zzso values that range over eight orders of zzso We previously described an interaction of zzso at an zzso site that results in the production of discrete zzso events in large zzso zzso activated zzso channels zzso zzso and zzso zzso 1996, zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper, we zzso a variety of accumulated evidence which suggests that zzso binds to a site on the zzso channel protein that structurally resembles a zzso zzso One line of evidence includes the finding that the complex of zzso and zzso in which the zzso loop of zzso is masked by interaction with zzso is completely ineffective in the production of zzso events in the zzso zzso To further investigate this notion, we performed a sequence analysis of the zzso of cloned zzso zzso channels from zzso and zzso This analysis suggests that a region of approximately 250 zzso near the zzso zzso of the zzso channel is zzso to members of the zzso zzso family, but is zzso inactive because of various zzso of key zzso zzso The sequence analysis also predicts the location of a zzso loop that is found in many zzso zzso zzso We zzso that this zzso domain of the zzso zzso channel adopts the characteristic zzso fold of zzso zzso is involved in zzso of the channel, and may also bind other zzso components that regulate zzso channel zzso
