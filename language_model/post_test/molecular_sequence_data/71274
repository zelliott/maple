zzso zzso are essential for the development of fertile flowers in tomato, and may also be required immediately after zzso In the zzso pathway, the reactions zzso by zzso zzso have been implicated as site of zzso To study the regulation of zzso zzso in flower and early fruit development, we isolated three tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The three genes showed different zzso patterns of zzso zzso Analysis of the transcript levels of the three zzso zzso zzso as well as those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 zzso zzso during flower bud and early fruit development, revealed temporally distinct patterns of zzso zzso Up until zzso transcripts were observed for zzso zzso zzso and zzso with an zzso of zzso zzso In contrast to the high level of zzso transcripts in the fully open zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso were reduced at this zzso After zzso zzso and zzso transcripts increased zzso In addition, zzso increased whereas the transcripts of zzso decreased to an zzso zzso In zzso zzso results demonstrated that during early stages of bud development, zzso transcripts were localized in the zzso and zzso The presented results supply novel data about zzso of zzso zzso gene zzso and indicate that transcript levels of zzso zzso genes are all highly regulated during flower bud zzso
