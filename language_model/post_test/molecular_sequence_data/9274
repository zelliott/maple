zzso are a group of toxic secondary zzso produced mainly by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso during the infection of crop plants, including zzso zzso zzso zzso rye and zzso Some zzso genes involved in zzso zzso have been shown to zzso regulatory zzso However, the global regulation of toxin zzso is still zzso In addition to the production of secondary zzso belonging to the zzso family, zzso zzso produces the red zzso zzso The gene regulation underlying the production of zzso is not well zzso The velvet gene zzso is zzso in various zzso of zzso zzso Recently, the zzso gene from zzso zzso has been shown to be the key component of the velvet complex regulating development and secondary zzso Using blast zzso we identified the velvet gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso causes several zzso zzso However, the zzso of this zzso with the zzso gene restores the zzso zzso The in zzso zzso include zzso of the zzso suppression of aerial zzso formation, reduced zzso of the zzso and highly reduced zzso Our data also show that zzso zzso the production of the zzso zzso and is essential for the expression of zzso genes and the production of zzso zzso studies performed on flowering wheat plants indicate that zzso is a positive regulator of zzso in zzso zzso
