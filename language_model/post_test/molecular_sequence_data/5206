Although self peptides bound to zzso and, especially, zzso zzso have been described in some detail, few zzso that bind to zzso have been zzso Toward this aim, naturally processed peptides were isolated from zzso zzso molecules expressed in cultured B zzso The size distribution of the zzso repertoire is generally similar to those reported for self peptides bound to zzso and zzso zzso Twelve peptides representing individual sequences including two zzso sets were zzso by mass zzso and/or zzso zzso zzso zzso proteins included zzso molecules and other integral membrane proteins as well as zzso and serum zzso No dominant zzso acid markers suggestive of particular zzso processing events were zzso zzso specificity and affinity were examined in binding zzso using synthetic peptides and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Anchor zzso were tentatively assigned using zzso zzso of two self zzso Some structural features of zzso that may relate to zzso binding are zzso
