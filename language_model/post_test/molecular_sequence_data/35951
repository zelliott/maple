The three-dimensional structure of the zzso class I molecules has highlighted the importance of the zzso formed by the zzso We used zzso zzso to construct a series of zzso zzso with different zzso at the sites of the zzso zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso specifically zzso 77 which is thought to be critical to the binding site of the zzso and a zzso at the zzso binding zzso We formed an zzso zzso line and derived six zzso zzso Each of the six clones showed a different pattern of reaction, reflecting the diversity of the zzso zzso All nine zzso were effective in altering zzso by zzso specific zzso although positions 45 and 77 caused the most drastic zzso The zzso in position 77 is also the last zzso acid of the zzso sequence shared with zzso Our results highlight the importance of certain zzso in zzso that may have important implications for the zzso of zzso zzso
