A zzso isolate with similar zzso and zzso properties to zzso zzso the zzso bacterial agent of contagious zzso zzso zzso was referred for molecular identification by zzso amplification of the zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso failed to yield a product compatible with that of zzso zzso The direct sequencing of the universal zzso zzso zzso zzso suggested the presence of a zzso zzso probably zzso zzso with no zzso effects on the movement and transportation of the zzso zzso of such a molecular means of identification through sequencing may aid in the identification of the zzso forms of zzso zzso as recently zzso as well as zzso this species from zzso zzso
