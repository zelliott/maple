zzso zzso is a zzso acid zzso zzso from the zzso zzso honey zzso It is known to exist as an zzso zzso as an zzso zzso or as a zzso random zzso depending on zzso zzso The charge state of zzso is believed to be a major factor in determining its zzso properties and its interaction with zzso zzso contradictory, indirect zzso of the zzso values of the three zzso groups in zzso have been zzso In the present study, high-resolution zzso zzso at zzso zzso was used to directly measure the zzso values of the zzso groups of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso Specifically, the pH dependence of zzso zzso chemical shifts was measured separately for the zzso enriched backbone nitrogen of zzso and the side chain nitrogen atoms of zzso zzso and zzso at a zzso concentration of zzso zzso and a temperature of 23 degrees zzso zzso were made for zzso in zzso zzso zzso in neat water, and in zzso zzso zzso zzso The experiments showed for zzso zzso in zzso zzso buffer that the zzso nitrogen of zzso has a zzso of zzso and that the zzso zzso and zzso side chain nitrogen atoms have zzso values of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
