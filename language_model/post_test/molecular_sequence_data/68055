zzso of the zzso by zzso or zzso results in altered zzso properties of and zzso binding to the zzso In zzso zzso syndrome, the zzso of the kidney and sometimes other zzso is severely damaged, presumably by a bacterial zzso zzso zzso In zzso studies have demonstrated that zzso cells become sensitive to this toxin when they are exposed to zzso alpha or zzso inflammatory zzso which are produced by zzso and zzso cells and which may play a role in the zzso In this report we demonstrate the influence of inflammatory zzso on the binding of VT to zzso zzso zzso of human zzso cells with zzso alpha for 24 h resulted in a zzso to zzso increase of specific binding sites for zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso also markedly increased zzso zzso An exposure of only 6 h to zzso alpha was already enough to enhance the number of zzso binding sites on zzso cells for at least 2 zzso In order to demonstrate that the increases in VT binding was due to an increase in the functional VT zzso zzso extracts of zzso zzso cells were analyzed by thin layer zzso An increase of zzso zzso was observed, suggesting that that zzso of zzso cells with zzso alpha leads to an increase in zzso synthesis in these zzso zzso of protein synthesis by zzso prevented the increase in VT receptors induced by zzso zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
