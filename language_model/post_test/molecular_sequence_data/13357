In zzso zzso three temporally distinct zzso puff sets, the so-called zzso early and late zzso have been described on the zzso zzso zzso zzso We have analyzed in detail a DNA segment of the zzso zzso region, from which the originates one of the most prominent zzso zzso with the aim of identifying zzso response elements zzso Here we report that two putative zzso of identical sequence are located at this puff zzso Interestingly, these elements display a novel structural feature, being composed of directly repeated zzso Our results show that the zzso zzso known to constitute the zzso functional zzso complex is able to bind to and zzso through target elements composed of directly repeated zzso In addition, we show that these elements are also able to bind efficiently zzso alone, suggesting that zzso and zzso could compete for their binding to zzso
