The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso of zzso mosaic virus zzso was deduced from a set of zzso clones and by direct sequencing of zzso The zzso with a length of zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso contains six open reading frames zzso with the capacity to code for zzso of more than zzso with Mr values of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The first five of these putative proteins show considerable zzso to similar proteins zzso by the zzso of potato virus X zzso zzso zzso and white zzso mosaic virus zzso zzso zzso The sixth zzso is completely overlapped by the Mr zzso coat protein zzso and has some zzso with a similar zzso in zzso zzso The difference in length of the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso is due to a zzso domain of variable length in the central region of the zzso zzso of the three zzso
