We zzso zzso gene of four zzso strains and examined the diversity of zzso and its other genetic characteristics in a total of 22 Group A zzso The 22 zzso strains were derived from six different host species zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the partial zzso zzso sequences zzso zzso showed identities ranging from 49 to zzso among different zzso The zzso analysis of zzso sequences revealed segregation according to the species zzso This was further confirmed by identification of three host specific zzso within the zzso zzso Thus, the host range restriction or zzso previously shown to associate with zzso may be attributed to the zzso nature of the zzso
