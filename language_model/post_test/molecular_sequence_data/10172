The shoot zzso zzso functions to generate the lateral zzso of a plant throughout the zzso and zzso zzso zzso genes play key roles in controlling such zzso programs, but their modes of action have not been well zzso Here we describe isolation and biological functions of a novel tobacco zzso zzso designated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso from a tobacco shoot zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a zzso of zzso zzso zzso its zzso is very similar to the class 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso is mainly localized in corpus cells in the tobacco shoot zzso zzso but not in zzso layers nor in differentiated lateral zzso The zzso zzso was fused to the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso promoter and used to generate transgenic tobacco zzso Almost all transgenic tobacco plants showed abnormal leaf and/or flower zzso and were zzso into three groups depending on severity of the leaf zzso In transgenic leaves, drastic decrease of zzso and increase of zzso were observed, while the levels of other zzso were only slightly zzso Taken together, our results suggest zzso is involved in tobacco zzso and abnormal leaf zzso in transgenic plants results from altered hormone zzso
