The importance of zzso was studied in zzso zzso infecting the zzso of 7 zzso zzso The zzso zzso of 10 zzso species was amplified by zzso zzso resulting in approximately 1600 zzso zzso zzso zzso trees generated by distance zzso and zzso analyses revealed 4 main zzso zzso species all belonged to the same group, while members of 2 zzso groups were clearly distinguishable on the basis of zzso and were also zzso by differences in spore zzso On the basis of tissue zzso zzso relationships among the species examined indicate that genetic separation is a more ancient evolutionary feature than zzso
