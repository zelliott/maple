zzso zzso mosaic virus zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso virus zzso are closely related zzso with zzso zzso zzso Although zzso 1 and 2 together are sufficient for zzso replication in zzso systemic infection also requires zzso which encodes the coat protein and the zzso zzso movement zzso We have previously shown with zzso zzso that host specificity zzso in both viruses are zzso by zzso as well as by zzso and/or zzso Here, to test their possible role in host zzso the zzso movement protein genes were precisely exchanged between zzso and zzso The hybrid zzso but not zzso deletion zzso zzso infected zzso zzso a zzso host for both parental zzso The hybrids thus retain basic competence for zzso packaging, zzso spread, and long-distance zzso zzso However, the hybrids failed to zzso zzso either barley or zzso selective hosts for parental zzso Thus, the zzso gene and/or its zzso zzso protein contributes to host specificity of both zzso and zzso zzso Tests of zzso zzso leaves showed that the spread of the zzso hybrid containing the zzso zzso gene was blocked at a very early stage of zzso Moreover, the zzso hybrid containing the zzso zzso gene appeared to spread farther than zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Several zzso directing systemic infection in zzso leaves were obtained from plants zzso with the zzso zzso hybrid, suggesting that the number of zzso required to adapt the hybrid to zzso is zzso
