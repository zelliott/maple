In search of the target zzso for the zzso zzso inhibitor zzso we recently identified a zzso zzso in zzso fluid of zzso zzso tumors zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso (1988) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso We have now zzso this zzso and demonstrate that it represents zzso forms of zzso here called zzso zzso zzso The zzso procedure comprised zzso zzso exchange zzso zzso zzso with zzso to zzso and separation of the two zzso by reverse phase zzso In sodium zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso have relative molecular weights zzso of 25,000 and zzso respectively, zzso being the major zzso The zzso zzso acid sequences zzso to those of pancreatic zzso and zzso respectively, and zzso of the zzso results in zzso of a zzso zzso zzso of 8 zzso characteristic of zzso zzso focusing in the presence of zzso gives zzso values of about 5 and 4 for zzso and zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the two zzso zzso are very similar to, but not identical with, those of zzso and zzso respectively, suggesting slight differences in zzso binding zzso zzso was found to be an efficient zzso of zzso zzso zzso could take part in the zzso cascade associated with tumor zzso
