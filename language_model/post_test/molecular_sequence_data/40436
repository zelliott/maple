zzso zzso zzso play important roles during pregnancy in the farm zzso In this study, we have cloned and characterized zzso sequence zzso the zzso zzso We also studied its zzso expression in the zzso zzso The zzso zzso has an open reading frame of zzso zzso zzso identity with the zzso of other zzso livestock zzso zzso zzso zzso has been placed in the same zzso that contained other zzso zzso with a maximum identity to bovine zzso Using an zzso zzso zzso Western zzso analysis of the zzso fluid of buffalo during the early stage of pregnancy confirmed the presence of zzso of about zzso The results of quantitative real time zzso zzso as well as in zzso zzso demonstrated a stage and tissue specific expression of zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso was low during stage I zzso zzso which increased zzso during stage II zzso zzso and then subsequently declined during stage III zzso zzso of the zzso zzso During early pregnancy zzso zzso of zzso the level of zzso zzso was as high as that during stage II of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso was localized in the zzso zzso The differential zzso expression of zzso in the zzso zzso of buffalo suggests its plausible important roles in zzso
