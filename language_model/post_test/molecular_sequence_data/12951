zzso zzso are an important new class of zzso agents for zzso however, in zzso experiments have identified zzso zzso that zzso resistance to several different families of the zzso This study was undertaken to determine if these zzso zzso zzso occur in zzso strains before the application of selective zzso We determined the zzso acid sequence of the zzso gene from the 23 clinical zzso of zzso and three zzso strains using a method that detects the majority species present in viral zzso Analysis of minor zzso will require alternative zzso The clinical zzso studied contained an average of 3 zzso zzso zzso zzso as compared to the zzso zzso zzso We did not detect zzso characteristic of reported highly zzso zzso These results suggest significant variation occurs in the zzso zzso gene but pre-existing highly zzso strains are zzso
