Human zzso zzso zzso zzso at the zzso zzso bond to produce two major zzso fragments with apparent molecular weights of 10,000 and zzso zzso zzso zzso has slightly increased zzso activity, but has lost its ability to undergo nuclear zzso in zzso cells, a process essential for zzso zzso zzso appears to alter the zzso properties of zzso despite the fact that it occurs some distance from the putative zzso site, since the zzso protein fails to compete with its native counterpart for nuclear zzso in zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso zzso zzso of zzso It does not enhance zzso activity toward zzso A or the synthetic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso by zzso might be a significant event in the process of zzso zzso since zzso zzso and zzso circulate in plasma at high zzso zzso zzso especially when bound to zzso activates tissue zzso zzso to generate zzso from zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso to produce zzso a potent inhibitor of zzso and zzso zzso among zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso may provide a sensitive regulatory system to balance zzso and zzso
