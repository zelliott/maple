zzso of the zzso zzso resistance zzso genes was examined in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso genes in zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso on elements closely related to zzso from zzso zzso and designated zzso and zzso zzso The putative zzso site zzso and zzso zzso genes of zzso from zzso zzso P zzso and zzso zzso were zzso however, zzso mapped within zzso in zzso zzso and zzso was previously located downstream of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Jones, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso indicated that a strong promoter sequence was located within zzso in zzso zzso from this promoter sequence was reduced when the zzso gene was present in zzso position relative to the zzso In zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of promoter activity with zzso zzso indicated that zzso increased the expression of zzso Analysis of zzso usage patterns and percent zzso in the third zzso position indicated that zzso could have originated in a zzso zzso The data obtained in the present study help explain differences observed in the levels of zzso expressed by three zzso which share common genes for zzso Furthermore, the widespread dissemination of zzso and derivatives in zzso zzso confirms the importance of these bacteria as reservoirs of zzso resistance in the zzso
