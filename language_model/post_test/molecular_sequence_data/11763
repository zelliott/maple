zzso DNA sequences in the terminal zzso of rye zzso zzso zzso have consequences for the structural and functional organization of zzso The large-scale zzso organization of these regions was studied using the zzso repeat from zzso and clones of three zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA families with complex but contrasting higher order structural zzso zzso chain reaction analysis with a single primer showed a fraction of the repeat units of one family organized in a zzso zzso Such structures suggest evolution of zzso by zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso and pulse field gel zzso showed the order of the repeats and the zzso in the lengths of individual zzso After zzso zzso and pulse field gel zzso the zzso and two zzso clones showed strong zzso signals from 40 to 100 zzso with a maximum at 50 to 60 zzso We suggest that these fragments define a basic higher order structure and DNA loop zzso of regions of rye zzso consisting of zzso of zzso organized zzso
