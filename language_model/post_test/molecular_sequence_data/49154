The screening of zzso expression libraries from human tumors with serum zzso zzso has proven to be a powerful method for identifying the repertoire of tumor zzso recognized by the immune system of cancer patients, referred to as the cancer zzso In this regard, zzso zzso zzso are of particular interest because of their zzso and restricted expression zzso zzso zzso are striking with regard to CT zzso zzso with zzso of specimens zzso expressing zzso and zzso In the present study, 54 zzso patients were tested for serum zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Two patients had zzso zzso to CT zzso and this zzso was restricted to zzso Thus, although highly expressed in zzso CT zzso do not induce frequent zzso immune responses in zzso zzso zzso from these two patients were used to zzso zzso libraries from two zzso zzso cell lines and normal zzso resulting in the identification of 113 distinct zzso Thirty-nine zzso were previously identified by zzso analysis of other tumor types, and zzso zzso zzso had a zzso profile that was not restricted to cancer patients, indicating that only a proportion of zzso zzso are zzso A novel CT zzso zzso mapping to zzso zzso was identified among the zzso zzso and encodes a putative zzso zzso In addition to zzso zzso zzso zzso was expressed in zzso melanoma, zzso cancer, lung cancer and breast zzso zzso is therefore a potential target for cancer vaccines and zzso zzso zzso
