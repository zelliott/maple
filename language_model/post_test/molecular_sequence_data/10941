The zzso zzso of zzso zzso expressed on the cell surface are increasingly recognized as the key zzso of various biological recognition zzso The transfer of zzso acid to these zzso are zzso by zzso a group of 15 or more zzso zzso Cloning of three zzso from this laboratory, indicated for the first time, that these zzso are type II membrane proteins and share the zzso features common to other zzso However, unlike the other members of the zzso family, these zzso showed the presence of two conserve protein zzso termed zzso This unique feature was subsequently found to be present in all the zzso cloned zzso The larger zzso consisting of zzso zzso acids is present in the middle of the zzso zzso domain and has, eight zzso zzso while the zzso present closer to the zzso end of the zzso has two zzso among a stretch of 23 zzso zzso The other zzso zzso acids are also zzso and their replacement is zzso The functional role of these two zzso were investigated by zzso zzso zzso using Gal beta 1, zzso alpha zzso zzso I) as a zzso zzso kinetic analysis of the zzso indicated that the zzso contributes to the binding of the common donor zzso zzso while the zzso contributes to the binding of both the donor and zzso zzso
