zzso zzso (I zzso zzso is requisite for zzso switch zzso I zzso zzso is markedly increased by zzso of zzso and/or by zzso zzso By contrast, we found previously that stimulation through zzso zzso I zzso zzso in zzso B cell zzso To characterize the molecular mechanisms involved in these contradictory events, the promoter elements that are responsible for I zzso zzso regulation were determined using stable zzso reporter gene zzso The results define a 95 zzso zzso responsive element zzso located zzso of the previously defined zzso responsive element zzso that resides within the same 95 zzso zzso as the zzso and zzso zzso induced I zzso promoter zzso However, zzso zzso the zzso effect of zzso These results define a zzso and provide further evidence for the complex regulation of I zzso zzso by various members of the zzso alpha family of zzso
