The zzso and rabbits belonging to the family zzso have a nearly worldwide distribution and approximately zzso of the zzso have geographically restricted zzso Despite several attempts using zzso zzso and zzso DNA evidence, a robust zzso for the zzso remains zzso To provide zzso resolution within this group, a molecular zzso was constructed for 27 zzso representing all 11 zzso zzso Five nuclear zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and two zzso zzso b and zzso zzso gene fragments were analyzed zzso and in combination using zzso maximum likelihood, and zzso zzso The analysis of each gene zzso separately as well as the combined zzso data almost invariably failed to provide strong statistical support for zzso zzso In contrast, the combined nuclear DNA zzso based on zzso characters greatly increased zzso resolution among zzso zzso as was evidenced by the number of zzso in the zzso confidence zzso and the number of significantly supported zzso The final molecular zzso contained zzso genetic characters and analysis zzso consistently recovered the same zzso across a range of six arbitrarily chosen model zzso Twelve unique zzso were scored and all could be mapped to the tree to provide additional support without introducing any zzso zzso analyses suggest that the most zzso solution explaining the current geographic distribution of the group involves an Asian or North American origin for the zzso followed by at least nine zzso and five zzso zzso Of these zzso at least three intercontinental exchanges occurred between North America and Asia via the zzso Strait and an additional three independent zzso into Africa could be zzso A relaxed zzso molecular clock applied to the seven zzso used in this study indicated that most of the intercontinental exchanges occurred between 14 and 9 million years ago and this period is broadly coincidental with the onset of major Antarctic expansions causing land bridges to be zzso
