zzso zzso zzso is the major zzso form present in fetal liver tissue and may be responsible for the zzso of many drugs that reach the fetal zzso We report the development of bacterial expression systems for zzso zzso zzso yields (up to 50 zzso zzso zzso were obtained with a construct in which the zzso of the zzso zzso was modified to include the zzso zzso sequence of zzso bovine zzso zzso zzso zzso Barnes, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 88, zzso zzso and to incorporate several downstream zzso acid zzso derived from the zzso zzso zzso This sequence also appeared optimal for expression of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was partially zzso using zzso and zzso zzso and zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso comparable to that of zzso zzso was demonstrated toward a number of zzso An alternative approach was used to further characterize zzso zzso due to low yields of zzso protein in the expression and poor recovery in the zzso zzso zzso was zzso into a zzso zzso containing human zzso zzso zzso and expressed in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in bacterial zzso with zzso zzso zzso showed similar levels of activity toward zzso zzso and zzso zzso to zzso zzso and zzso expressed in the same system, whereas zzso was less active toward zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso
