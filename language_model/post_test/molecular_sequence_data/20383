A novel strategy for creating naturally derived zzso zzso has been zzso zzso are prepared from free reducing zzso and stabilized by reaction with zzso zzso to generate a zzso in which the reducing zzso has a zzso zzso zzso of the protected zzso yields an active zzso to which a zzso fluorescent zzso is coupled by reductive zzso The fluorescent derivatives are easily coupled through a residual primary zzso to generate zzso zzso This strategy preserves structural features of zzso required for zzso recognition and allows development of natural zzso of fluorescent zzso in which the zzso zzso structure of the zzso sugar zzso is zzso
