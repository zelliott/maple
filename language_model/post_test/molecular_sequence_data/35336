Human zzso zzso have recently been recognized as important viral pathogens causing zzso illness and meningitis in children, but the data on these infections in Korea is zzso zzso is emerging as a novel zzso agent of acute zzso but its role in meningitis remains zzso 

To understand the epidemiology of zzso and zzso in zzso illness and meningitis through the detection and typing of the virus in zzso fluid zzso zzso 

One hundred and zzso zzso samples collected from 183 patients ranging in the age group 1 day to 15 years were tested by using a zzso zzso for zzso zzso and zzso zzso products of the zzso and zzso region of the zzso and zzso region of the zzso were zzso to identify the zzso 

A total of 12 zzso positive samples zzso were detected from 183 zzso samples and all the samples were typed as zzso zzso were detected in 39 patients zzso in which zzso 25 and zzso were frequently zzso but mixed infection of zzso and zzso was not zzso zzso was not detected in the study zzso Most of the zzso positive patients were under 3 months of zzso zzso infection was detected mostly in the summer zzso The zzso gene of the 12 Korean strains clustered most closely to the Japan strain zzso and the zzso gene of the Korean strains also clustered to the Japan strain, which showed no evidence of zzso 

To our knowledge, this is the first report on the detection of zzso from zzso samples in Korea, which suggests the necessity of routine screening for this virus in young infants with zzso illness and zzso
