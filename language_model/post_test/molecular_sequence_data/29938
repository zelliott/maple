zzso zzso by a variety of DNA viruses activate gene expression from the promoter within the long terminal repeat zzso of the human zzso virus type 1 zzso The mechanism by which zzso zzso gene products of human zzso zzso activate expression from the zzso zzso was examined in transient expression zzso in cultures of human cells by using plasmids containing the zzso linked to the bacterial zzso zzso zzso gene and a zzso expressing the zzso zzso zzso Analysis of clustered site zzso within the zzso zzso revealed that sequences from zzso zzso to zzso zzso to the start site of zzso are critical for responsiveness to zzso by zzso zzso gene zzso This region partially zzso the zzso response element zzso to zzso required for function of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene was shown to increase the zzso levels of both prematurely terminated and full-length transcripts initiated within the zzso These results support a model in which zzso zzso gene products act through a specific regulatory element in the zzso zzso to increase viral zzso
