The zzso zzso leaf zzso locus of zzso is defined by a zzso zzso characterized by the zzso in a zzso programmed manner, of zzso zzso that expand to kill leaves cell zzso The zzso nature of all zzso zzso implies that the zzso gene is required to limit the spread of cell death in mature zzso We have cloned the zzso gene by tagging with zzso a zzso element system in zzso and we show that it encodes a novel protein highly zzso in zzso Two consensus binding motifs of aromatic zzso zzso are present in the predicted zzso zzso suggesting that it may function to degrade a zzso zzso of cell zzso
