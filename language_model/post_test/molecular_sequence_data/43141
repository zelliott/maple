zzso proteins are translated from a zzso set of zzso zzso which have common 3' zzso with unique zzso zzso Evidence suggests that coronavirus zzso are generated by a mechanism of leader primed zzso Leader zzso binds to consensus sequences upstream of each gene on full length negative strand viral zzso and zzso proceeds to the zzso end of the negative strand to produce the zzso set of zzso Even though this gives rise to zzso zzso species only the zzso extension of each zzso is translated to give the viral zzso The leader zzso for zzso is about 90 zzso long and contains the sequence which zzso the leader binding sites on the negative strand zzso Evidence suggests that the length of the leader binding sequence may be involved in zzso control of individual zzso In order to investigate this a virus specific zzso isolation method was developed to measure the relative amounts of zzso zzso during an infection of zzso cells with zzso zzso zzso Thus the relative quantity of each zzso can be determined and correlated with the variation in size of the leader binding zzso
