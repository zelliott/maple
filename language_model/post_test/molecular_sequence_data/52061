The expression of the zzso alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5 and alpha 6 was studied zzso in tissue samples from zzso pancreatic cancer, chronic zzso normal zzso and in 8 cell lines of zzso human pancreatic zzso Furthermore, zzso zzso on zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to define the function of alpha 2, alpha 3, alpha 5 and alpha 6 in pancreatic cancer zzso zzso zzso alpha 2 and zzso alpha 6 were moderately to strongly expressed on the zzso surface of zzso and zzso cells in normal pancreatic zzso while zzso cells predominantly expressed zzso alpha 3 and zzso alpha zzso zzso zzso showed intense zzso for zzso alpha 2 and zzso alpha 6 with a diffuse distribution on the cell zzso The zzso of zzso alpha 2 and zzso alpha 6 may reflect a loss of spatial arrangement of tumor cells and their ability to interact randomly with zzso zzso structures during invasion and zzso zzso of zzso alpha 3 and zzso alpha 5 in pancreatic zzso was heterogeneous, ranging from moderate to weak, and was lost in about 50% of the zzso Two pancreatic zzso cell lines zzso 3, PC zzso were further investigated in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso against alpha 2 zzso 9, zzso were able to inhibit zzso zzso to collagen IV zzso in both cell zzso A zzso against alpha 6 zzso inhibited zzso zzso to zzso zzso in both cell zzso These results suggest that alpha 2 is a zzso site and alpha 6 a zzso site in pancreatic cancer zzso The zzso zzso SAM I inhibited zzso of zzso to zzso zzso being without effect in zzso zzso of both cell lines to zzso was almost completely inhibited by zzso zzso Thus, alpha 5 is a functionally important zzso binding site in some pancreatic zzso cells, suggesting further zzso zzso binding sites in other pancreatic zzso zzso
