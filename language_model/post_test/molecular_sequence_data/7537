The human LDL zzso zzso has a binding domain which consists of seven zzso zzso zzso repeats, each approximately 40 zzso acids long with three zzso zzso The second LB zzso which is required for full binding of LDL, has been zzso zzso and folded to yield a single, fully oxidized zzso By selective reduction and zzso we have shown that the zzso zzso have a zzso zzso zzso zzso matching that recently determined for the zzso zzso We suggest that the first two LB repeats of the zzso with their unique zzso pattern, serve as a structural paradigm for other LB zzso
