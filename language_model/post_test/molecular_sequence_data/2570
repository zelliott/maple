The zzso A zzso channel is believed to consist of two head-to-head beta zzso zzso models were used to formulate the structure of new zzso channel molecules based on the zzso zzso The chemical synthesis of two zzso zzso A hybrids and single-channel analyses of their conducting properties are zzso These studies illustrate the rational design and synthesis of zzso channels with zzso zzso properties and provide support for current molecular models of the natural zzso zzso zzso
