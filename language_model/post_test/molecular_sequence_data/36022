The synthesis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso representing the zzso zzso sequence of zzso in which zzso bonds are replaced by zzso bond, is zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are also zzso The zzso were zzso in binding studies based on displacement of zzso and zzso selective zzso from rat brain membrane and in a zzso using guinea pig zzso zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso bond are zzso exhibit higher zzso and zzso selectivity than the corresponding zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not exhibit zzso and zzso zzso affinity at zzso zzso The relevance of the single zzso replacement and of its association to zzso or zzso group elimination of zzso is discussed on the basis of a zzso model for zzso and delta zzso
