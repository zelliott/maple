In order to study the organization of the zzso of zzso epidemic zzso virus zzso we constructed a zzso library in a zzso expression zzso by using zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso An zzso zzso serum was used to probe the zzso The first isolated clone mapped within the N gene and was subsequently used for zzso the zzso The selected clones allowed us to establish the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso sequences revealed a zzso zzso structure, which is typical of zzso and the presence of a zzso sequence zzso upstream of each coding zzso The zzso acid sequences deduced from four of the five zzso identified showed the characteristic features of the structural proteins zzso M, zzso and zzso Only one zzso located between the S and M genes was found to potentially zzso a zzso zzso Our data lead us to conclude that zzso is a member of zzso and belongs to the same genetic subset as zzso zzso and zzso zzso
