Recent evidence shows that the zzso zzso motif of zzso is necessary to target newly zzso proteins to the nuclear envelope zzso zzso at the zzso has been taken to explain the different fates of A- and zzso zzso during cell zzso zzso zzso which loose their zzso shortly after incorporation into the zzso structure, become freely soluble upon zzso nuclear envelope zzso zzso zzso zzso in contrast, are permanently zzso and, although zzso during zzso remain associated with remnants of nuclear envelope zzso However, zzso zzso zzso the major zzso zzso of zzso zzso and eggs, becomes soluble after nuclear envelope breakdown in zzso zzso Here we show that zzso zzso B3 is permanently zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso and eggs zzso zzso When zzso into mouse L cells zzso zzso B3 is integrated into the host zzso and responds to cell cycle signals in a normal zzso zzso the zzso expressed zzso zzso does not form zzso with the zzso zzso as revealed by a zzso experiment with zzso zzso In contrast to the situation in zzso eggs, a significant portion of zzso B3 remains associated with zzso during zzso We conclude from these data that the zzso zzso zzso although necessary, are not sufficient for a stable association of zzso with zzso and that additional factors are involved in zzso zzso
