zzso zzso and zzso zzso the two key activities of zzso molecular zzso are inherent properties of different zzso of the zzso The zzso of these two activities is critical because the bound zzso zzso in part, the affinity of zzso for protein zzso In addition, zzso of the zzso zzso class, which stimulate zzso zzso activity, have been proposed to play an important role in promoting efficient zzso zzso zzso Because little is understood about this functional interaction between zzso of zzso we investigated zzso in the region zzso the zzso domain that acted as zzso zzso of a lethal zzso zzso mapping to the zzso domain of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid substitution in the zzso domain of the zzso coli zzso zzso had a similar zzso zzso effect on the corresponding zzso zzso zzso domain zzso zzso protein had a normal zzso zzso activity and was capable of zzso zzso zzso However, the reduced affinity of zzso for zzso zzso (and zzso is likely responsible for the inability of zzso to function in zzso The zzso zzso zzso appears to partly alleviate the zzso in zzso zzso stimulation caused by zzso suggesting that zzso in the interaction with zzso may alter the zzso cycle to allow productive interaction with zzso zzso Preservation of the zzso suppression zzso between zzso zzso and bacterial zzso suggests that the phenomenon studied here is a fundamental aspect of the function of zzso zzso zzso
