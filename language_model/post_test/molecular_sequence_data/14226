To investigate the relationships between zzso plasmids zzso resistance to antibiotics isolated in Australia and those from other zzso 

zzso restriction zzso cloning and DNA sequencing were used to characterize zzso and determine their location in zzso plasmids recovered from zzso zzso zzso from Australian zzso 

zzso carrying the zzso zzso resistance zzso was found in zzso plasmids zzso and zzso recovered from zzso zzso zzso zzso from Australian cattle and in zzso plasmids from zzso zzso zzso from zzso Its location was the same as seen in the zzso reference zzso zzso The location of zzso mercury and multiple zzso resistance zzso was also the same in all of the Australian zzso and the zzso end was in the same position as the zzso module in zzso However, zzso has lost the zzso end (including most of the zzso and some adjacent zzso The sequence adjacent to the zzso end of the zzso zzso in the Australian plasmids is in the zzso zzso zzso but only 22 zzso from the zzso zzso repeat zzso These plasmids all belong to the same evolutionary zzso Neither zzso was found in zzso which represents a separate zzso 

zzso locations are useful markers for lineages of closely related zzso The zzso surrounding the zzso zzso in the Australian zzso plasmids is ancestral to those found in zzso and zzso each of which has part of the zzso and adjacent sequence replaced by other resistance zzso
