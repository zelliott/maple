Ten zzso zzso previously isolated from different zzso grape wines from the zzso zzso zzso of Spain, were characterized zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso genes were zzso and zzso analysis showed that they form a tight zzso zzso that is closely related to reference strains zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8 and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results confirmed the separation of the strains from other zzso zzso zzso the strains could be differentiated from their closest zzso by zzso amplified zzso restriction analysis and random amplified zzso DNA zzso The strains were zzso zzso zzso rods that did not exhibit zzso zzso zzso they could be distinguished from their closest relatives by several traits such as their zzso to grow at pH zzso to zzso zzso zzso and zzso or to zzso zzso The characteristics of the ten wine zzso suggest that they represent a novel species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
