In the present investigation, the zzso zzso of the zzso domain of bovine zzso and the effects of replacing the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in the 12th and last position of loop IV with a zzso are studied by zzso zzso The zzso zzso results in sequential zzso binding in this domain and has far-reaching effects on the structure of zzso zzso thereby providing further evidence for the critical role of this zzso acid zzso for the zzso zzso change of regulatory zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso under zzso conditions, such that zzso of the protein is in the zzso form, revealed two sets of mutually exclusive zzso One set of zzso is found to be consistent with the closed structure observed in the zzso state of the zzso domain of the zzso zzso while the other set supports the open structure observed in the zzso zzso In addition, several zzso in the zzso core exhibit broadened zzso We conclude that the zzso form of the zzso experiences a global zzso exchange between states similar to the closed and open zzso of the zzso domain of zzso zzso A population of 65 zzso zzso of the open zzso and an exchange rate of zzso zzso zzso zzso were estimated from the zzso data and the chemical shifts of the zzso zzso From a zzso zzso of the zzso zzso the zzso binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the inherent chemical shifts of the intermediate zzso form of the zzso were determined using zzso zzso information was also provided on the mechanism of the zzso zzso and the roles of the structural elements in the two zzso zzso zzso with the zzso protein indicates that the zzso zzso of the zzso is essentially closed but that some zzso of the empty loop IV toward the zzso form has zzso
