To test whether distances derived from zzso broadening of zzso zzso single quantum zzso zzso zzso could be used to determine the global fold of a large, zzso zzso we used zzso zzso of 5 zzso acids on the surface of zzso zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso zzso is a 25 zzso translation initiation zzso whose solution structure was previously solved in a zzso zzso zzso zzso of total molecular mass approximately zzso zzso zzso line broadening consistent with the three-dimensional structure of zzso was observed for all zzso zzso The zzso broadening effects zzso were converted into distances for modeling by a simple method comparing peak heights in zzso zzso before and after reduction of the zzso spin label with zzso zzso The zzso in combination with zzso nuclear zzso effects zzso and chemical shift index zzso angle zzso correctly determined the global fold of zzso with a backbone precision of zzso A zzso A for secondary structure zzso The global fold was not correctly determined with the zzso zzso and zzso angles zzso The combination of zzso with simulated restraints from another nuclear magnetic resonance zzso method for global fold determination of large proteins zzso highly zzso zzso improved the quality of calculated zzso In addition, the combination of the two methods simulated from a crystal structure of an all zzso protein (40 zzso zzso zzso zzso correctly determined the global fold where neither method individually was zzso These results show the potential feasibility of obtaining zzso structures for proteins in the zzso zzso range via zzso
