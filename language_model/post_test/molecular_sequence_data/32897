We obtained a full-length zzso clone for the zzso gene of zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso amplification of zzso zzso zzso chain reaction zzso amplification of zzso extracted from a zzso brain cell line zzso The zzso zzso of zzso contains an open reading frame zzso of 1875 zzso zzso a protein of 624 zzso zzso The predicted zzso zzso protein is zzso zzso and contains a zzso zzso zzso motif at the zzso terminal and a zzso zzso at the zzso zzso characteristic of all known zzso zzso Poly zzso induced the expression of zzso gene in zzso cells, and the induction level at 28 degrees C was higher than that at 20 degrees zzso Moreover, zzso gene expression was also induced by viral infection, including fish zzso zzso and zzso Among these, zzso was a stronger zzso than the other two zzso Using an zzso activity zzso we revealed that zzso zzso zzso cells had zzso activity against fish zzso and zzso but not zzso Furthermore, the replication of zzso and zzso could be restored after the expression of zzso gene was zzso by zzso zzso these results indicated that the expression of zzso zzso gene was able to inhibit the proliferation of fish zzso and zzso
