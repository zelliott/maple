This study systematically analyzed the structural and zzso basis of the regulation of zzso membrane targeting using zzso zzso as a zzso zzso zzso which mediate the recruitment of signaling and zzso proteins to zzso zzso zzso exhibit distinct zzso zzso despite minor structural variations within the zzso zzso zzso cellular imaging, and zzso analysis of various zzso zzso showed that the introduction of a single zzso zzso and a zzso loop into the membrane binding region of the zzso zzso dramatically enhanced their membrane zzso The results indicated that there is a threshold affinity for zzso zzso and that zzso targeting of zzso zzso is sensitive to small changes in membrane affinity about this zzso zzso these studies provide new insight into how zzso zzso of zzso zzso and other membrane targeting zzso can be regulated by minimal structural and environmental zzso
