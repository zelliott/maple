The basis of the specificity of interaction of zzso and U2 small nuclear zzso and their zzso binding zzso zzso and zzso has been zzso The zzso protein recognizes zzso zzso on its own, whereas zzso binds specifically to U2 zzso only in the presence of a second zzso zzso Exchange of two zzso between the two zzso or of eight zzso acids between the two proteins reverses binding zzso
