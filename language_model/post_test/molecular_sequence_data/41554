zzso 

zzso simple sequence repeat markers from transcript sequences zzso sequence repeat zzso were developed for the edible oil crop zzso zzso to facilitate the genetic study of this zzso zzso 

We found zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and zzso primer pairs were designed and zzso In total, 59 primer pairs showed zzso within 36 zzso the number of zzso per locus ranged from two to four, and the expected and observed zzso ranged from zzso to zzso and 0 to zzso zzso zzso 

These zzso markers will greatly facilitate studies of the genetic structure of zzso zzso populations as well as the identification and conservation of the zzso
