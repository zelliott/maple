The zzso silk protein zzso the unique zzso properties displayed by the capture spiral of zzso zzso To investigate molecular mechanism underlying the zzso recovery of the capture zzso a model zzso based upon the zzso repeat sequence of zzso zzso zzso silk protein has been zzso using zzso DNA zzso zzso 1 contains 11 repeats of the 25 zzso acid sequence zzso and was expressed in zzso coli strain zzso as a zzso fusion to a zzso leader zzso A combination of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was employed on zzso 1 and the zzso analogue zzso to assign the zzso and zzso zzso zzso of the zzso acid zzso zzso the zzso silk repeat zzso The zzso properties of 1 in zzso solution were investigated using a combination of CD, zzso zzso and two-dimensional zzso zzso These techniques were consistent with the presence of small but zzso population of zzso zzso between zzso and zzso of the zzso units of zzso zzso and CD studies of solid films of 1 indicated an increase in zzso population in the solid state, which coincided with the decrease in zzso level of the zzso The zzso information suggests that the zzso segments of the zzso silk protein adopt a zzso zzso in the fiber and that the mechanism of elasticity may resemble that proposed for other zzso forming zzso including zzso
