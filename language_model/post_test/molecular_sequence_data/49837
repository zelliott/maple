zzso zzso inhibitor zzso has recently been identified as a positive acute phase protein in mice, an observation that may have important implications for the interaction of the zzso zzso and inflammatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by removing the zzso zzso from partially zzso zzso that are important for zzso efficient zzso zzso In addition, zzso has been shown to be capable of removing the zzso zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso thus zzso a role for the zzso zzso in the vascular responses to zzso In the current study, we investigated the ability of acute phase zzso to zzso human zzso gene expression in cultured human zzso zzso zzso Surprisingly, we found that treatment of zzso cells with a combination of zzso zzso and zzso suppressed zzso zzso zzso abundance in zzso cells zzso zzso while treatment with zzso or zzso alone had no zzso Treatment with zzso and/or zzso had no effect on zzso promoter activity as measured using a zzso reporter zzso containing the human zzso zzso region, whereas treatment with zzso and zzso in zzso but not alone, decreased the stability of the zzso zzso zzso Treatment with the synthetic zzso zzso resulted in a zzso increase of both zzso zzso levels and promoter zzso We identified a functional zzso response element zzso in the human zzso promoter between zzso 92 and zzso The zzso was capable of binding the zzso zzso as assessed by gel mobility shift zzso and zzso of this element markedly decreased the ability of the zzso promoter to be activated by zzso
