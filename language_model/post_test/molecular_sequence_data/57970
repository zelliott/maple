We have cloned and zzso zzso for three zzso of the zzso zzso calcium channel beta zzso isolated from a normal human heart zzso zzso One of these zzso designated beta zzso zzso with a zzso message, and the other two, designated beta b and beta zzso zzso with a message of approximately zzso zzso The presence of both of these latter two messages in human heart was confirmed by zzso chain reaction zzso Considering the differences between beta a and beta zzso zzso we find it likely that these messages may be zzso by two different gene zzso beta a and beta zzso zzso and that the beta zzso c sequence can be alternatively spliced in the zzso zzso The data suggest that the human heart presents a different pattern of beta zzso expression from that found in the rat and rabbit zzso
