An extremely zzso zzso zzso strain zzso was isolated from the deep subterranean petroleum zzso in zzso oil field, zzso zzso Based on its zzso characteristics and analysis of its zzso zzso gene zzso strain zzso was identified as zzso zzso zzso zzso was able to grow at temperatures ranging from 50 to 72 degrees C and effectively zzso zzso as the sole carbon source at 70 degrees zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with different length chains zzso in crude oil, but it zzso zzso middle zzso The zzso zzso system of zzso zzso zzso was zzso It contained at least three zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso which had a high sequence similarity to the zzso cluster of zzso strains zzso zzso and zzso contained zzso two zzso and a putative zzso regulatory zzso
