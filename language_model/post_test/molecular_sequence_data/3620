zzso zzso and zzso zzso also referred to as zzso zzso and zzso an zzso gene product of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 8, zzso zzso and drives zzso zzso zzso activates the expression of zzso nuclear zzso zzso (also known as zzso or zzso of zzso This novel zzso zzso zzso is the most abundant zzso transcript of zzso therefore, studying zzso zzso expression serves as a model system for understanding how zzso zzso target genes during zzso zzso The zzso element of the zzso promoter zzso zzso was previously identified, and our data suggested direct binding of full-length zzso to the zzso zzso Here, we present a detailed analysis of specific interactions between zzso and the zzso zzso We expressed and zzso the zzso domain of zzso zzso to near zzso and measured its affinity for the zzso zzso In zzso mobility shift zzso zzso the zzso constant zzso of zzso on the zzso zzso was determined to be approximately 8 zzso zzso M, suggesting a strong interaction between zzso and zzso The specificity of zzso binding to the zzso promoter was confirmed with zzso zzso The zzso binding sequences on the zzso promoter were mapped within a zzso region of the zzso zzso by zzso interference zzso However, the minimal DNA sequence for zzso binding requires an additional 7 zzso on both sides of the area mapped by interference zzso suggesting that zzso as well as zzso interactions between zzso and DNA contribute to zzso zzso To better understand the molecular interactions between zzso and the zzso promoter, an extensive zzso study on the zzso zzso was carried out by using zzso and reporter zzso These analyses revealed base pairs critical for both zzso binding in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso of the zzso zzso The results from zzso zzso deletion analysis, and zzso using zzso and reporter zzso were closely correlated and support the hypothesis that zzso activates zzso zzso expression through direct binding to zzso
