zzso zzso zzso is a well-known proverbial protein involved in various functions in zzso The functional diversity of zzso from zzso zzso zzso may relate to the regulatory elements lying in the promoter at the zzso zzso Using zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated, and the full-length zzso sequence was obtained by zzso zzso zzso The full-length zzso sequence was zzso zzso containing an zzso zzso putative open reading frame zzso which coded a 375 zzso zzso zzso whose molecular weight was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso domain search and structural zzso found that zzso consists of two structural zzso zzso highly zzso in most zzso multiple sequence alignment discovered two positive charge zzso zzso and zzso zzso which play a critical role in the zzso interaction between zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso has a closer relationship with zzso from algae and higher plants than with those from other zzso In zzso analysis of the promoter region revealed six potential regulatory elements might be involved in four hypothesized functions characterized by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso These results might supply some hints for the functional diversity mechanisms of zzso and fresh information for further research to bridge the gap between our knowledge of DNA and protein structure and our understanding of functional biology in zzso zzso
