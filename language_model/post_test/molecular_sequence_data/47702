zzso of the zzso regulatory light chain of zzso zzso by a zzso zzso light chain zzso is important in the initiation of smooth muscle contraction and other zzso processes in zzso zzso It has been previously shown that zzso zzso of smooth muscle zzso light chain zzso are necessary for zzso binding to zzso filaments in cells zzso To further zzso the region of the zzso required for zzso a series of zzso deletion zzso as well as several zzso zzso zzso fusion proteins were zzso zzso zzso showed that a zzso containing zzso zzso binds to zzso smooth muscle zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso was sufficient for zzso binding to zzso stress fibers in smooth muscle cells in zzso zzso scanning zzso in the fusion protein identified zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso as important for binding in zzso There are two additional zzso motifs located at zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso in these three motifs were individually replaced by zzso zzso in the full-length zzso Each of these zzso significantly decreased zzso light chain zzso binding to zzso in zzso and each abolished zzso binding to zzso filaments in smooth muscle cells in zzso These results identify a unique structural motif comprised of three repeat consensus sequences in the N zzso of zzso light chain zzso necessary for zzso binding to zzso zzso
