zzso modifications of zzso from the Ras zzso enable them to associate with membrane compartments where they exert their biological zzso However, no protein acting like zzso and zzso zzso inhibitor zzso that regulate the membrane association of zzso and zzso zzso has been described for Ras and closely related zzso We report here that the delta zzso of retinal rod zzso zzso is able to interact with zzso Ras and zzso zzso and to zzso them from zzso independently of their zzso zzso or zzso zzso We show that zzso exhibits striking structural similarities with zzso namely conservation of the zzso fold and presence of a series of zzso zzso which could act as in zzso to zzso the zzso group of its target zzso thereby providing structural support for the zzso activity of zzso We observe that the zzso of zzso interferes with Ras trafficking and propose that it may play a role in the process that delivers zzso proteins from zzso once they have undergone zzso and zzso to the structures that ensure trafficking to their respective resident zzso
