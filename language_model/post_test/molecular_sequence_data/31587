The zzso gene family consists of a single gene capable of generating two functional transcripts utilizing different zzso start sites in the first zzso This results in the translation of two separate zzso zzso and zzso with different zzso peptides and approximately zzso identical zzso The second distinguishing feature of the zzso zzso is the zzso zzso zzso To date, presence of the zzso gene appears limited to zzso and there is also only limited conservation of structure or sequence of the zzso zzso Although both zzso messages are present in human zzso to date, only the zzso protein has been detected in the zzso zzso In contrast, selective expression of zzso has been detected in zzso brain, whereas zzso was expressed in skin and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso has been limited by the inability to isolate reliably active zzso from zzso or zzso zzso zzso can be expressed in zzso coli and the expressed active zzso show selectivity for zzso of zzso zzso due to the binding properties of the zzso peptides also shows high cholesterol zzso zzso Although human zzso displays significant zzso zzso with zzso the zzso have different tissue expression zzso Human zzso also shows nuclear zzso in selected zzso that appears related to zzso zzso of the zzso zzso Overall, the understanding of the properties and function of the zzso zzso is limited and the structural zzso of the unique zzso and zzso suggests significant species differences that need to be zzso
