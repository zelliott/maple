We have previously shown that specific T cell zzso zzso gamma V regions genes zzso gamma 4 and V gamma 6) are rearranged and expressed by zzso fetal liver zzso cells cultured with zzso The present studies determined that the sequences of the zzso V region gene transcripts expressed in response to zzso included diverse and functional sequences expressed by zzso and peripheral V gamma zzso and V gamma zzso T cells, indicating that the zzso expression of these genes is functionally relevant and mimics normal in zzso zzso events of gamma delta T zzso We found that more than 50% of these zzso transcripts had N region zzso The presence of N region diversity indicates that these zzso zzso took place in zzso presumably in response to zzso because fresh zzso FL cells do not produce zzso terminal zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso We also found that zzso of zzso zzso zzso transcripts from FL cells cultured with zzso had N region diversity at the zzso region, while only zzso of zzso zzso transcripts from FL cells cultured in the absence of zzso had N region diversity at this zzso FL cell cultures supplemented for 7 days with zzso had increased zzso zzso and protein zzso However, since zzso culture of FL cells with or without zzso resulted in induction of expression of zzso zzso probably does not directly stimulate zzso zzso but increases the development and expansion of zzso zzso zzso These findings zzso zzso as a regulator of the molecular signals involved in controlling zzso gamma zzso and diversity, and provide an in zzso system for studying the regulation of zzso and N region diversity in B and T zzso zzso by environmental zzso
