We have characterized two zzso zzso of apparent molecular masses of approximately 40 and 35 zzso which possess a single zzso zzso motif zzso followed by a zzso domain rich in zzso zzso Their primary structures resemble the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso however their functional effects are quite zzso The zzso protein cannot complement zzso zzso zzso cell zzso extract and showed a dominant negative effect in zzso against the authentic zzso zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, the zzso and zzso proteins antagonize zzso proteins and activate the most zzso alternative zzso zzso site of zzso zzso zzso in zzso an activity that is similar to that characterized previously for the zzso nuclear zzso particles zzso group of zzso A series of zzso zzso proteins consisting of zzso from these proteins and zzso in various combinations showed that the zzso but not the zzso domain rich in zzso zzso has a dominant role in this zzso Because of the similarity to zzso proteins we have named these proteins zzso and zzso respectively, for zzso proteins of approximately 40 and approximately 35 zzso Both factors show zzso and cell zzso patterns of zzso We propose that these two proteins are zzso zzso alternative zzso regulators that antagonize authentic zzso proteins in the zzso of alternative zzso zzso site zzso
