Using zzso zzso raised against a previously cloned potato zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a second zzso called zzso could be zzso A single locus zzso to zzso was mapped on potato zzso zzso to the two zzso identified for zzso From a zzso and structural point of view, the zzso and zzso zzso are more closely related to zzso than to zzso zzso soluble zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso electron zzso using sections from leaf zzso cells, showed that zzso and zzso are localized to the zzso Based on these zzso the likely zzso origin and the zzso significance of the zzso soluble zzso are zzso
