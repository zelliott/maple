Animals with one deleted jerky zzso are more susceptible to chemically induced zzso than zzso mice and display zzso behavioral zzso The zzso of these zzso is characterized by no apparent neurological symptoms other than zzso zzso reminiscent of human idiopathic zzso The jerky gene encodes a 60 zzso protein resembling a number of zzso zzso Here, we show that the jerky gene is expressed in all zzso zzso including brain, liver, zzso zzso zzso and zzso and study an apparent paradox of how an zzso deletion of the zzso expressed jerky gene can lead to zzso and zzso but not to other zzso We demonstrate that jerky has a zzso function zzso in brain and that this sensitivity to reduced jerky dosage could explain the occurrence of zzso in zzso However, jerky has a zzso function as well, because the total absence of jerky in zzso results in abnormalities of zzso and sexual zzso A number of idiopathic zzso are zzso zzso such as benign familial zzso zzso juvenile zzso zzso as well as benign zzso with zzso zzso and the zzso of these zzso may be based on zzso in the zzso
