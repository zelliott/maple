zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a special role in controlling free calcium zzso zzso in heart muscle zzso zzso stored in the zzso is released through the zzso release channels when the zzso membrane is zzso thereby inducing contraction, while zzso is zzso by the zzso pump to induce zzso In the latter process, the zzso pump of cardiac zzso has a regulatory system by zzso zzso of a zzso zzso zzso Recently, significant progress has been achieved in understanding the molecular mechanisms of zzso release and zzso and its zzso The structures of the zzso pump and zzso have been defined at molecular zzso A direct interaction between these two proteins was zzso The zzso release channel was identified, and turned out to be the foot structure which in zzso connects the zzso to the zzso zzso
