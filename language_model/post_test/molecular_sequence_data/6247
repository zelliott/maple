To attain zzso zzso of zzso materials, a zzso zzso zzso zzso has been zzso chemically zzso and zzso zzso high-resolution patterning of the zzso zzso zzso to zzso fluorinated zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso glass has been zzso The synthetic zzso zzso was zzso coupled to either zzso zzso or zzso zzso peptides were zzso and 20 and 300 zzso patterns were zzso by zzso The zzso interaction of zzso zzso fragments with cells was investigated by analyzing the selective attachment of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells which bear zzso cell surface zzso On zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells differentiated in zzso media within 1 zzso zzso attachment to the immobilized zzso zzso was assessed in zzso media with competitive binding studies, showing an zzso decrease in cell adherence after the cell receptors were blocked with soluble zzso
