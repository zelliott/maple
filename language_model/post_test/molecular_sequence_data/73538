zzso zzso is a major zzso protein which is 20 times more abundant in tumor or zzso cells than in normal resting zzso Recently, it was found that zzso gene is located at the zzso of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso To understand the human zzso zzso structure and regulation, four zzso clones were isolated from the human zzso 5 library and their DNA sequences zzso The human zzso gene has 12 zzso of sizes ranging from 58 to zzso zzso The zzso zzso for zzso and zzso zzso is within zzso 4 and the zzso for zzso zzso is within zzso zzso The initiation site is located 96 zzso upstream from the zzso zzso A typical zzso box (at zzso zzso and a zzso box (at zzso zzso were identified in the promoter zzso We identified two zzso bands (A and zzso with DNA zzso E zzso zzso by zzso A DNA footprint was observed at zzso zzso with the nuclear zzso A double stranded DNA with the footprint sequence zzso zzso zzso the formation of zzso bands A and B in zzso suggesting that proteins A and B bind to the footprint zzso We confirmed that protein A is zzso factor zzso These results suggest that zzso may play a role in zzso gene zzso This is the first report on human zzso gene structure and zzso
