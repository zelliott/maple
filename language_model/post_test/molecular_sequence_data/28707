The zzso group zzso of proteins zzso zzso gene expression through the assembly of zzso complexes on key regulatory zzso The mechanisms zzso complex assembly have remained enigmatic since most zzso proteins fail to bind zzso We now demonstrate that the human zzso protein zzso interacts with zzso a zzso member of the zzso family of zzso factors, in zzso and in zzso The functional consequence of this interaction is repression of zzso zzso The zzso interaction is zzso in evolution with the zzso factor zzso binding to zzso the fly zzso of zzso zzso mobility shift zzso demonstrate that the zzso complex forms on regulatory elements of genes whose expression is zzso by zzso but not on elements where zzso plays an zzso zzso These observations reveal a novel mechanism by which zzso proteins may be anchored to specific regulatory elements in zzso zzso
