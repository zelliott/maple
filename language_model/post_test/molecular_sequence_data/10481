In both zzso and zzso systems, considerable progress has been made toward the characterization of the zzso factors required for zzso by zzso zzso zzso However, whereas in zzso all of the zzso zzso III zzso have been zzso relatively little is known about the zzso itself in higher zzso For example, no higher zzso sequence corresponding to the largest zzso zzso III zzso is zzso Here we describe the isolation of zzso that zzso the largest zzso of human zzso zzso III, as suggested by the observations that zzso zzso directed against the cloned protein zzso an active zzso whose sensitivity to different zzso of zzso is that expected for human zzso zzso zzso and zzso depletion of zzso extracts with the same zzso results in zzso of zzso from an zzso zzso III, but not from an zzso zzso II, zzso zzso comparisons reveal that regions zzso in the zzso zzso I, II, and III largest zzso characterized so far are also zzso in the human zzso zzso III zzso and thus probably perform similar functions for the human zzso zzso III zzso
