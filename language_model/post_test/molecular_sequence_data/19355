A moderately zzso zzso zzso designated as strain zzso was isolated from a crude zzso sample collected near zzso in eastern zzso zzso zzso was found to grow zzso at 37 degrees C and pH zzso It was shown to be zzso zzso and capable of growth at zzso of zzso % zzso zzso zzso 12 zzso The zzso DNA zzso content was about 48 zzso The major cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso and the major zzso zzso were zzso and zzso zzso analyses based on zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that zzso is a member of the zzso zzso and has less than zzso % gene sequence similarity to the most closely related strain, zzso zzso zzso Its zzso zzso value with respect to zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso On the basis of zzso and molecular properties, strain zzso represents a novel zzso species, for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso
