zzso zzso zzso cells are efficiently immortalized by the E6 gene of human zzso zzso a virus commonly associated with cervical zzso Surprisingly, introduction of the E6 gene from zzso which is rarely found in cervical cancer, or bovine zzso zzso into normal zzso cells resulted in the generation of zzso cell zzso The establishment of zzso and zzso zzso cells was less efficient and required a longer period in comparison to zzso zzso These zzso and zzso zzso cells demonstrated dramatically reduced levels of zzso protein by zzso While the zzso of zzso protein in normal zzso zzso cells was approximately 3 zzso it was reduced to approximately 15 zzso in all the zzso zzso These results demonstrate that the E6 genes of both high-risk and low-risk zzso viruses zzso human zzso zzso cells and induce a marked degradation of zzso protein in zzso
