Fluorescence techniques are commonly and powerfully applied to monitor zzso zzso In a limited fashion, the zzso zzso intensity of zzso attached zzso has been used as a reporter of zzso zzso zzso Here, we pursue two zzso we examine the relationship between zzso identity and zzso response, and we determine the general utility of zzso zzso to monitor zzso zzso The zzso domain of the zzso group I zzso zzso was systematically modified at multiple zzso positions with zzso derivatives that provide a range of zzso lengths and compositions between the zzso and zzso Certain zzso typically lead to a superior zzso signal upon zzso zzso as demonstrated by equilibrium zzso with zzso In addition, useful zzso responses were obtained with zzso placed at several zzso positions dispersed throughout zzso This suggests that monitoring of zzso folding by zzso of zzso attached zzso will be generally zzso to structured zzso zzso
