The primary structure of a zzso zzso DNA zzso between the zzso gene zzso zzso zzso and the origin of replication of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso Two zzso of zzso and zzso zzso with opposite zzso zzso were identified on both zzso They zzso a zzso zzso zzso activity protein zzso and a 141 zzso zzso immunity zzso zzso A zzso zzso structure located between zzso and zzso can form a hairpin loop and serve as zzso zzso zzso sequences for both zzso The site for the interaction with the zzso zzso of the zzso system was found in another zzso structure preceding the zzso structural zzso A deduced zzso zzso zzso zzso is devoid of a signal zzso indicating a zzso mode of zzso zzso carries a zzso typical of zzso zzso zzso zzso that is necessary for the interaction with the zzso zzso and for active zzso transport through the outer zzso The substitution of the last five zzso zzso acids did not significantly influence the zzso activity of the truncated zzso The zzso lost its ability to kill sensitive bacteria and to bind to a zzso zzso after deletion of the last 57 zzso zzso zzso A deduced 16 zzso zzso protein has an zzso zzso zzso acid stretch with features typical of zzso signal zzso zzso is a slightly zzso protein with a basic zzso The immunity protein was localized in the zzso space and in the zzso fraction after its zzso under the zzso zzso zzso Several other zzso were identified on the zzso zzso zzso fragment, but none of them seemed to zzso a typical zzso zzso which is necessary for the release of the zzso In the promoter region and in the regions preceding and following the zzso zzso the DNA sequence has high zzso zzso identity with other zzso zzso The DNA sequence located zzso zzso upstream of the zzso gene showed more than zzso similarity to zzso zzso I of the zzso zzso This defined the location of the zzso origin of zzso zzso
