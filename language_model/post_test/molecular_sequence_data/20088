zzso zzso by zzso tuberculosis play an essential role in the zzso of zzso The culture zzso of zzso tuberculosis zzso made by zzso zzso zzso are considerably enriched for zzso proteins compared to other culture zzso zzso approaches were used to identify the zzso proteins in these culture zzso zzso zzso combined with zzso zzso and zzso zzso coupled zzso zzso derived from a total of zzso proteins were identified of which 144 were identified by more than one zzso Several members of the zzso important early zzso zzso zzso zzso family of proteins were found to be major zzso The majority of the identified zzso 159 zzso were predicted to be exported through the general zzso zzso We zzso verified that the signal zzso which mediate zzso through the cell zzso had been removed in 41 of the identified zzso and in 35 of those, there was an AXA motif zzso to the zzso site, showing that this motif is important for the recognition and zzso of signal peptides in zzso A large fraction of the zzso proteins were unknown, suggesting that we have mapped an unexplored part of the exported zzso of zzso zzso zzso
