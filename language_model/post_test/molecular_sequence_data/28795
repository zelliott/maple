We present a detailed study of the zzso of an imperfect zzso derived from the terminal regions of zzso virus DNA and contained in a zzso zzso into a zzso containing zzso zzso We monitor the course of zzso by two-dimensional gel zzso experiments as a function of temperature and linking zzso We find that zzso pauses at partially zzso states as negative zzso zzso To understand the course of zzso with changes in linking number, zzso we present a rigorous zzso statistical mechanical analysis that includes complete zzso between zzso zzso zzso formation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The imperfections in the zzso are zzso incorporated into the zzso arms as hairpin zzso single zzso zzso and complex local regions containing several zzso zzso We analyze the results to determine the free zzso zzso and zzso of formation of all local structures involved in zzso We find that, for each zzso structure, the zzso zzso and zzso of formation are all approximately zzso to the number of zzso bases contained zzso This surprising result holds regardless of the arrangement or composition of zzso bases within a particular zzso zzso have major effects on the overall zzso of zzso zzso and on the course of this zzso In particular, the extent of the zzso change necessary to zzso an imperfect zzso is considerably greater than that required for zzso of the underlying perfect zzso Our analysis also suggests that, at higher temperatures, significant zzso at the base of an imperfect zzso can successfully compete with extension of the zzso zzso
