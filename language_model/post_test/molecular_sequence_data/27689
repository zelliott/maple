zzso DNA clones for the zzso zzso have been isolated from a randomly primed zzso zzso library in zzso zzso and from an zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the zzso zzso insert includes a zzso zzso region, an open reading frame of zzso zzso corresponding to 416 zzso acids zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence includes the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso and is zzso with that determined by zzso acid sequencing of the zzso zzso light chain and of a small region of the zzso sequence of the heavy zzso The zzso zzso contains at the 3' end a zzso sequence which codes for an zzso acid sequence not yet found in any other zzso zzso This zzso acid sequence is rich in zzso zzso out of zzso zzso zzso and is suggested to be involved in the recognition and binding of the zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso The zzso for zzso is zzso as an approximately zzso zzso only in the zzso stages of zzso and bull zzso
