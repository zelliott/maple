Various protein motifs play a key role in regulating protein zzso and zzso Here, we discovered that three distinct motifs regulate the trafficking of zzso zzso channel zzso zzso the primary zzso zzso zzso which plays critical roles in neurological diseases including stroke, multiple sclerosis and zzso zzso the zzso binding motif of zzso increased its surface expression and current zzso In contrast, mutating either a zzso motif or a zzso motif reduced zzso surface expression and zzso current zzso zzso or deleting the zzso motif also reduced pH sensitivity and the rate of zzso of zzso These changes were likely due to a change in zzso zzso mutating either the zzso or zzso motif reduced zzso of zzso while mutating the zzso binding motif had the opposite zzso Our results demonstrate that these zzso motifs are important for zzso trafficking and channel zzso In addition, in contrast to multiple previous studies, which all show that zzso containing motifs lead to zzso zzso zzso zzso our findings indicate that these motifs can also be required for efficient zzso
