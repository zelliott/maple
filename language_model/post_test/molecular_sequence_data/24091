In zzso zzso zzso zzso P) family is one of the two known protein zzso families specific for zzso and zzso The role of zzso zzso in multiple signaling pathways in zzso cell has been extensively zzso Unlike zzso zzso zzso bacterial members of the family have broad zzso specificity or may even be zzso Moreover, one group of bacterial zzso are zzso zzso indicating that bacterial zzso zzso may not necessarily function as protein zzso 

We describe the presence in zzso of three groups of expressed genes zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso These zzso are more closely related to bacterial zzso zzso than to the known zzso members of the zzso One group, found exclusively in land plants, is most closely related to zzso zzso from some zzso including zzso zzso and zzso This group is therefore termed zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the other group are found in zzso zzso zzso zzso and some zzso They are structurally related to zzso from zzso bacteria zzso and zzso and are termed zzso zzso or zzso zzso of the third group are zzso related to zzso bacterial zzso zzso and are termed zzso zzso or zzso zzso distribution of zzso in animals, plants, zzso zzso and zzso suggests that these zzso were present in the common zzso of zzso but were independently lost in many zzso zzso zzso and zzso form zzso zzso as divergent from zzso zzso zzso zzso as they are from each other and from major bacterial zzso In addition, comparison of primary structures revealed a previously zzso zzso zzso zzso in all bacterial and zzso zzso zzso but not in zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

Our findings demonstrate that many zzso possess diverse zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso roles and precise evolutionary history of which have yet to be zzso
