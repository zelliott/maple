zzso and zzso zzso are zzso as precursor peptides containing zzso extensions zzso zzso which are zzso off during zzso Most zzso and also some zzso have leader peptides of the so-called zzso zzso These leader peptides share consensus sequences and also a common processing site with two zzso zzso zzso in positions zzso and zzso The zzso leader peptides are unrelated to the zzso signal sequences which direct proteins across the zzso membrane via the zzso zzso Their processing sites are also different from typical signal zzso zzso sites, suggesting that a different processing zzso is zzso zzso zzso are exported across the zzso membrane by a dedicated zzso cassette (ABC) zzso Here we show that the ABC zzso is the maturation zzso and that its zzso domain resides in the zzso part of the zzso This result demonstrates that the ABC zzso has a dual zzso zzso removal of the leader zzso from its zzso and zzso zzso of its zzso across the zzso zzso This represents a novel strategy for zzso of bacterial zzso
