The human zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso gene zzso with 285 zzso of zzso sequences was zzso into monkey kidney zzso cells as part of an zzso zzso zzso of the monkey cells to produce zzso led to a rapid zzso of zzso zzso whose zzso ends were identical to the zzso zzso of human zzso This induction occurred with all zzso zzso zzso from the zzso late promoter was also seen in zzso zzso We conclude that the regulation of the zzso gene is retained in the replicating zzso zzso zzso with high copy number, even when the gene is being transcribed from an external zzso When the zzso sequences were deleted to leave only 40 zzso before the presumed cap site of the zzso zzso zzso formation of zzso with authentic zzso ends could still be zzso However, zzso and expression depended on the position of the deleted zzso gene in the zzso We conclude that the sequences around the zzso box and cap site on the zzso gene are involved in the regulation of its zzso zzso short-term expression of the human zzso gene in zzso zzso provides a defined system in which the structures required to maintain the regulation and the influence of known external zzso signals can be zzso
