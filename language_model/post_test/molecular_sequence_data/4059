The zzso form of zzso zzso is a rare zzso dominant disorder affecting palm and sole zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso has been demonstrated with zzso zzso in the zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso We have studied a zzso family of British descent with zzso zzso zzso zzso studies show that intermediate filaments of zzso zzso are finer than those of the zzso zzso In addition, zzso numbers are normal, but their inner plaques and zzso structures are zzso zzso markers were used to screen candidate zzso including the zzso differentiation complex on zzso the zzso locus on zzso the type I and II zzso gene clusters on zzso zzso and zzso and the zzso zzso gene cluster on zzso zzso zzso genetic linkage to zzso zzso was observed using marker zzso with a maximum zzso zzso score of zzso at a zzso fraction of zzso zzso sequencing of the zzso 1 gene revealed a zzso zzso in zzso 9 that leads to the partial loss of the zzso loop motif in the V2 domain and the gain of a novel 70 zzso acid zzso Using expression studies we show that the V2 domain is essential for normal function of zzso intermediate zzso
