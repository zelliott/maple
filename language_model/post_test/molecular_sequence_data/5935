zzso toxin entry into zzso zzso may involve binding of zzso surface zzso containing the zzso zzso (a zzso group on an internal zzso zzso The zzso of zzso toxin involved in zzso binding are known to reside within the zzso half of the zzso heavy chain zzso zzso We developed a novel zzso zzso based upon the structure of the zzso zzso zzso zzso to define the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Using this zzso we observed zzso of zzso toxin C zzso which could be specifically inhibited by a zzso of the zzso series zzso but not by a zzso series zzso zzso When zzso toxin C zzso was zzso with zzso whether before or after reaction with zzso a zzso band was observed by zzso gel zzso zzso which was selectively inhibited by zzso zzso sequencing of zzso zzso toxin C zzso zzso with that band revealed the zzso 34 zzso acid zzso of zzso zzso zzso laser zzso mass zzso of a zzso labeled synthetic zzso representing the zzso acid domain revealed modification at a single zzso zzso We propose that this domain of zzso toxin is sufficient for zzso zzso
