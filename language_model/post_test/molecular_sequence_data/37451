zzso virus zzso a zzso zzso virus of prawns, is the zzso of newly recognized zzso zzso zzso family zzso within the order zzso In this study, a putative zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which is predicted to be the key zzso involved in processing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso was zzso Comparative sequence analysis indicated that, like its coronavirus zzso zzso has a zzso organization and is flanked by zzso zzso The putative zzso domain including zzso regions zzso zzso zzso to zzso was fused to the zzso coli zzso protein zzso and, when expressed in zzso coli, was found to possess zzso zzso activity that was not dependent on the presence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the processed protein revealed that zzso occurred at the location zzso downward zzso zzso The zzso activity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso was used to identify another zzso site, zzso downward zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Taken together, the data tentatively identify zzso downward zzso zzso as the zzso consensus sequence for the zzso zzso The study revealed that the zzso and zzso zzso possess similar zzso zzso which correlate with structural similarities in their respective zzso sites, identified in sequence zzso Analysis of the zzso activities of zzso fusion proteins carrying replacements of putative zzso zzso provided evidence that, in contrast to most other zzso but in common with coronavirus zzso the zzso zzso employs a zzso zzso zzso The properties of the zzso zzso define a novel zzso virus zzso zzso that bridges the gap between the zzso related zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso
