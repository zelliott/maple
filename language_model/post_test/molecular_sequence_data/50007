Our discovery of rapid zzso of human zzso zzso zzso in colon cell lines that was transient and irreversible following zzso and zzso respectively, suggested zzso zzso were involved in zzso Likewise, zzso expressed in zzso cells was inhibited by zzso and zzso Because zzso is a highly specific protein zzso C zzso zzso we examined and found 4 to 5 predicted zzso zzso sites in 11 zzso zzso zzso incorporated zzso which was inhibited by zzso Also triple zzso zzso at predicted zzso sites failed to incorporate zzso Individual or double zzso exhibited zzso zzso or no effect, while the triple zzso retained zzso activity towards zzso and two zzso Compared to zzso zzso and zzso shifted zzso for zzso but not for zzso or zzso acid, toward alkaline and acid conditions, zzso This represents the first evidence that a zzso zzso requires zzso for zzso
