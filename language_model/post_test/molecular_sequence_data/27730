We have isolated four zzso covering the complete pig zzso zzso zzso The sequence of zzso zzso encompasses zzso zzso of the zzso upstream region and zzso zzso of the structural zzso In the promoter region we find a zzso box and potential binding sites for zzso and zzso By sequence comparisons we have found three zzso showing similarity to promoter regions of the genes zzso human alpha zzso and human zzso alkaline zzso The gene sequence includes the first three zzso and two zzso It shows that a single zzso encodes the zzso tail, the membrane anchor and the zzso zzso
