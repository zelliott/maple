zzso zzso is a common zzso modification with reported functions in transcription, zzso processing and translation, and DNA zzso zzso zzso five protein zzso zzso suggesting that zzso zzso exerts widespread impacts on the biology of these zzso Here, we performed a global zzso analysis of zzso zzso to identify zzso zzso proteins and their sites of zzso Using an approach zzso two-dimensional zzso separation and alternating electron transfer zzso and collision induced zzso we identified zzso zzso in zzso zzso The resulting data set represents the largest compilation of zzso zzso proteins in any zzso to zzso zzso zzso revealed numerous zzso zzso proteins involved in zzso function, zzso zzso DNA replication and repair, and zzso protein zzso Thus, zzso zzso has the potential to impact aspects of zzso zzso gene zzso cell biology, and zzso Interestingly, pathways with known zzso proteins in higher zzso were identified in this study, but often different components of the zzso were zzso in zzso zzso were often identified in zzso rich zzso although exceptions to this rule were zzso zzso these data inform on a multitude of aspects of zzso biology and serve as a guide for the identification of zzso zzso zzso proteins in higher zzso 

zzso zzso is a zzso zzso that causes lethal African sleeping sickness in humans and zzso in zzso thereby imposing a significant medical and economic burden on sub-Saharan zzso The zzso encounters very different environments as it cycles between zzso and insect zzso and must exert cellular responses to these varying zzso One mechanism by which all cells respond to changing environments is through zzso modification of zzso zzso zzso is one such modification that can dramatically impact zzso and zzso acid interactions and zzso zzso of zzso To define the breadth of zzso zzso in zzso and identify target zzso we performed a global zzso analysis of zzso zzso proteins in insect stage zzso zzso We identified zzso zzso in zzso zzso generating the largest compilation of zzso containing proteins in any zzso to zzso Numerous zzso zzso proteins function in zzso and DNA related zzso suggesting this modification can impact zzso zzso zzso integrity and gene regulation at numerous zzso Other processes that appear to be strongly influenced by zzso zzso are zzso protein trafficking, zzso protein folding and degradation, and zzso zzso The widespread nature of zzso zzso in zzso highlights its potential to greatly affect zzso biology and zzso
