Several genes were found closely associated with major zzso class I and class II zzso genes in chicken zzso DNA clusters by zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso A zzso probe for one of these zzso probe zzso isolated from a chicken liver zzso library, was used to clone the zzso sequence zzso from a human zzso cell line zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso exactly the same zzso zzso The sequence of zzso shows significant zzso with the two known zzso zzso protein beta zzso zzso beta 1 and zzso beta 2) and other proteins that all share the same segmented structure with seven internal zzso repeats about 45 zzso in zzso Unlike the chicken zzso the human zzso gene and its mouse counterpart are not located on the same zzso as the major zzso zzso A possible involvement of the zzso gene product in major zzso zzso control of zzso proliferation in chickens is zzso
