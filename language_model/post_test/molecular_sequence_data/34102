In zzso members of the collagen family have been found in various zzso Surprisingly, in zzso little is known about such zzso In this study, we characterize the full-length zzso type IV collagen and we zzso its biological effects on human zzso in order to gain insights about this zzso in zzso and particularly clues about its zzso We screened a zzso library of zzso zzso zzso The expression pattern of the transcript is determined using real-time zzso chain reaction and in zzso zzso The close identity between zzso zzso domain and the zzso zzso led us to produce, purify and test in zzso a zzso protein corresponding to this region using human zzso zzso cell zzso The biological effects were evaluated on proliferation and on zzso We found that the zzso open reading frame transcript encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso including an interrupted zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression pattern of this transcript is mainly found in the mantle and zzso The zzso protein corresponding zzso zzso domain increased zzso proliferation by zzso and doubled collagen synthesis produced in primary zzso This work provides the first complete primary structure of a zzso zzso collagen chain and the biological effects of its zzso domain on human zzso In this study, we prove that the zzso domain from a zzso collagen can improve human zzso proliferation as well as zzso
