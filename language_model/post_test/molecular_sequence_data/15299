zzso typically reduces zzso diversity shortly after its application but less is known about its longer-term influence on zzso zzso zzso effects are important in forests where fertilizer is rarely zzso We compared zzso species composition in western zzso control plots with plots last zzso 7 years ago with nitrogen zzso or nitrogen plus zzso (N + zzso The N + P zzso had a significant lingering effect, increasing the tree size and zzso P content of the western zzso From zzso roots of 24-year-old trees from northern zzso Island, Canada, we identified zzso from 12 samples per treatment, by zzso zzso and sequencing zzso zzso DNA fragments, placing sequences with zzso or more identity in the same operational zzso unit zzso Diversity was high across zzso we detected 77 zzso zzso 52 from zzso zzso among 922 clone zzso The five most frequent zzso were similar in abundance across zzso Only 19 zzso matched any of the 197 previously reported zzso species of western zzso Species composition but not diversity in nitrogen plus zzso plots differed significantly from control or nitrogen zzso Two zzso zzso were indicator species for nitrogen plus zzso plots and presence of zzso zzso was correlated with control or nitrogen zzso After 7 years, zzso history had made no zzso difference in zzso zzso diversity, but long-lasting changes in environment resulting from zzso had a lingering effect on zzso zzso species zzso
