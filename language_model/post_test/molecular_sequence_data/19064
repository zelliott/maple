Selective disruption of zzso interactions by small molecules is important for probing the structure and dynamic aspects of cellular zzso It can also provide new therapeutic zzso zzso of the zzso zzso signaling zzso uses the same positively charged groove to bind with zzso factor zzso zzso and zzso zzso coli zzso The extravagant formation of zzso interactions drives the initiation and progression of many zzso and zzso while zzso and zzso interactions are essential for zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this study, a selective binding site that can differentiate zzso zzso and zzso interactions was identified by zzso scanning and zzso zzso A new zzso strategy that incorporates zzso and zzso simultaneous search was used to design selective zzso zzso for zzso zzso A potent inhibitor was discovered to bind with zzso and completely disrupt zzso zzso It also exhibits dual selectivity for zzso over zzso and zzso interactions in both zzso and zzso zzso This study provides a proof of concept for designing selective zzso for zzso zzso
