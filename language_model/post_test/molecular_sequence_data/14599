zzso zzso zzso receptors are the targets for many effective zzso including those recently introduced into the zzso We have identified a novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso that is expressed in all the animal zzso zzso we examined from zzso III, IV and zzso but is not present in the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In zzso zzso zzso is expressed on muscle cells isolated from the head, but not from the zzso zzso zzso comparisons with other zzso and zzso zzso suggested that zzso may be capable of forming a functional zzso zzso when zzso zzso was injected into zzso zzso along with zzso zzso zzso zzso we occasionally observed the formation of zzso and zzso zzso The unreliable expression of zzso in zzso may suggest that additional zzso or zzso may be required for efficient formation of the functional zzso zzso may represent a novel target for the development of zzso zzso specific for animal zzso
