To explore the function of the giant zzso zzso first described in 1992 zzso zzso Cohen, zzso zzso & Bishop, zzso zzso (1992) zzso zzso zzso zzso USA 89, zzso we created zzso zzso mice by zzso zzso zzso zzso showed no obvious zzso but revealed instead a second zzso zzso zzso designated zzso Like the original zzso zzso is a zzso protein composed of a large number of highly zzso repeat zzso zzso predictions suggest that the repeat segments of both zzso may have as their basic framework a series of linked, zzso zzso similar to those found in zzso zzso Both zzso appear to zzso to zzso regions of mouse zzso and zzso with membrane zzso containing the zzso zzso which is consistent with earlier reports that the zzso are linked to zzso calcium channels and can be zzso by protein zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso in close proximity to zzso zzso zzso and zzso regions of cardiac zzso raise the possibility that they might be involved in regulating zzso zzso of zzso but other studies indicate that the association of zzso with calcium channel proteins is more zzso zzso is predicted to have a zzso domain within its zzso zzso domain, which may mediate these zzso
