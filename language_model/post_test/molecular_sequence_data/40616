In zzso zzso the zzso motor can rotate at a remarkably high speed, zzso three to four times faster than the zzso coli or zzso zzso Here, we found a zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso body zzso zzso of zzso resulted in partial zzso and zzso zzso suggesting that zzso is involved in formation of the zzso structure and generating zzso zzso zzso microscopic observation of the zzso body of zzso cells revealed a smaller LP ring structure compared to the wild type, and most of the T ring was zzso zzso zzso could be zzso with zzso the zzso zzso suggesting that zzso may interact with the T ring composed of zzso and zzso From these lines of evidence, we conclude that zzso associates with the zzso body and is responsible to form an outer ring of the LP ring, named the H ring, which can be distinguished from the LP ring formed by zzso and zzso zzso structures, zzso the T ring and H ring might contribute the more robust motor structure compared to that of zzso coli and zzso
