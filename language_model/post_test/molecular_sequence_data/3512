The zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso possesses a zzso zinc zzso The zzso form of the zzso displays an appreciably high activity, although full efficiency is observed for the zzso zzso In an attempt to assign the involvement of the different zinc zzso in the zzso properties of zzso individual zzso of selected zzso acids were zzso With the exception of zzso zzso zzso and zzso the zzso and zzso forms of all the other zzso were poorly zzso The activity of zzso decreases by a factor of 10 when compared with the wild zzso The zzso efficiency of zzso and zzso was zzso The zzso forms of these zzso exhibited a low activity, whereas the zzso efficiency of their respective zzso forms was comparable with that of the wild zzso Surprisingly, the zinc contents of the zzso and the zzso zzso were zzso These data suggest that the affinity of the zzso for the metal was not affected by the substitution of the zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso efficiency indicates that the zinc zzso participate in the zzso of the zzso ring by acting as a Lewis zzso The zinc zzso activate the zzso water zzso but also zzso the zzso bond of the zzso ring and stabilize the development of a negative charge on the zzso oxygen of the zzso reaction zzso Our studies also demonstrate that zzso is not directly involved in the interaction with the zzso
