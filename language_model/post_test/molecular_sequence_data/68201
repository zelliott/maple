B zzso from zzso mice were zzso in zzso cultures for 72 h with various zzso zzso zzso A from zzso coli had the highest zzso effect followed by zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as measured by zzso zzso zzso of zzso B cells zzso labeled with zzso and zzso and zzso zzso from resting B cells zzso from zzso without zzso were analyzed by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso as their fluorescent zzso decreased from zzso to resident B zzso in the following order: zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso coli zzso resting B zzso zzso of resting B cells contained more zzso than zzso acid, whereas inverse ratios were found in activated cells, indicating a shift from zzso to zzso acid due to zzso Furthermore, a higher zzso content was characteristic for activated B zzso Fast atom zzso mass zzso was performed with zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso Major zzso were zzso and zzso beside minute amounts of zzso The structural zzso in the zzso was caused by zzso zzso of the zzso acids with either zzso or zzso groups, zzso variation in the zzso base zzso zzso and zzso substitution of the zzso zzso by fatty acids of different chain length and degree of zzso zzso zzso zzso
