We were interested in studying the lung zzso T cell repertoire in different conditions of zzso exposure in subjects with zzso zzso zzso allergic individuals were zzso 17 subjects suffering mainly from asthma and 4 from zzso They all performed zzso and zzso zzso All patients were subjected to zzso zzso zzso either at base line (no zzso or after zzso or zzso challenge, and the zzso repertoire of their lung T cells was studied with zzso zzso Expansion of single T cell clones was observed in one (of zzso zzso subject that reported a recent exposure to zzso and had high zzso hypersensitivity to zzso and in zzso zzso subjects who underwent zzso after they suffered an early zzso reaction to experimental zzso zzso zzso ex zzso expanded clones included zzso T zzso In two of the seven subjects who underwent zzso after zzso challenge, two different lung segments were zzso A zzso symmetrical distribution of the expanded clones was found in these zzso Control subjects and six of seven zzso patients studied at base line showed zzso of lung T zzso In conclusion, T zzso are zzso expanded in the lower respiratory tract only in zzso subjects exposed to zzso These results suggest that in allergic zzso the inhalation of zzso zzso can recruit to the lung T zzso that include zzso T cell zzso
