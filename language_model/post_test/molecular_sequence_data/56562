zzso delays, which impair zzso host defense, are present in the zzso system of human zzso zzso We hypothesized that diminished production of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso might in part be responsible for these zzso To test this, zzso from the blood of zzso zzso term zzso and adults were isolated zzso by zzso zzso and subsequently zzso with zzso alpha zzso zzso tumor necrosis factor alpha zzso or zzso zzso after which zzso levels in the zzso were measured by zzso Total cellular zzso was extracted and zzso zzso was assessed by Northern zzso and by competitive zzso chain reaction zzso zzso After stimulation with zzso zzso zzso zzso was lowest in zzso of zzso from zzso zzso intermediate in zzso of zzso from term zzso and greatest from zzso of zzso Similarly, when zzso with zzso or zzso zzso from zzso zzso produced less zzso than cells from term zzso and zzso These differences in zzso zzso paralleled differences in zzso zzso zzso
