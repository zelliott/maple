The zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso termed as zzso is composed of two kinds of different zzso linear DNA molecules zzso and zzso In this study, the viral DNA molecules were zzso and cloned into zzso zzso and the complete zzso sequence was zzso zzso analysis showed that zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso including zzso terminal repeats zzso of 224 zzso and zzso zzso consisted of zzso zzso including zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the complete zzso sequence between zzso and zzso zzso zzso showed an identity of zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso with a total number of zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso deletions and 3 zzso insertions found in zzso A single zzso zzso deletion at zzso zzso in zzso caused a frame shift zzso and brought about a premature stop zzso thus dividing zzso of zzso into two zzso (named zzso zzso and zzso zzso within that region, while there was only one zzso (named zzso zzso in the corresponding region of zzso zzso zzso Comparative zzso of zzso and zzso regions of the two viral zzso showed that highly variable regions were mainly located in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso Northern blots analysis revealed that zzso had zzso zzso and zzso zzso transcripts from the left half of its plus zzso and one transcript about zzso zzso from the right half of its minus zzso zzso of 3' and zzso zzso products showed that the zzso zzso transcript started at zzso 290 and ended at zzso zzso the zzso zzso transcript started at zzso zzso and ended at zzso zzso and the zzso zzso transcript started at zzso zzso and ended at zzso zzso These results help us to further understand the variation between different zzso zzso and its possible causes, providing clues for studying the evolutionary history of zzso
