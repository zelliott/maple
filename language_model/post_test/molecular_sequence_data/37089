The zzso gene at zzso is known to be fused to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in various zzso zzso The common theme in all zzso zzso is a transcript consisting of the zzso part of zzso and the 3' portion of the partner zzso however, apart from the frequent fusion to different zzso zzso there is no apparent similarity among the other zzso We here report a de zzso acute zzso leukemia with a zzso resulting in a novel zzso zzso Fluorescence in zzso zzso zzso by the use of zzso covering zzso and the zzso gene cluster at zzso revealed a fusion signal at the zzso indicating a zzso zzso whereas no fusion was found on the zzso suggesting that the zzso was accompanied by a deletion of the zzso fusion zzso zzso zzso and sequence analyses showed that zzso 16 zzso zzso of zzso was fused zzso with zzso 2 zzso zzso of zzso Neither the zzso transcript nor the normal zzso was zzso The present results, together with previous studies of zzso gene zzso strongly indicate that zzso is of zzso importance in zzso acute zzso zzso
