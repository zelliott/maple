zzso zzso in human zzso have identified the zzso location of several important zzso sequences zzso cellular zzso and zzso zzso zzso are characterized by recurring zzso zzso including deletion or zzso of the long arm of zzso 6 zzso This report details our efforts to clone the zzso zzso in a zzso melanoma to further our understanding of the biology of these zzso The strategy zzso combined zzso of the zzso zzso development and characterization of a DNA zzso library, isolation of zzso and zzso from the zzso region, ordering of clones by zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso and finally, identification of a zzso spanning the zzso zzso By zzso to other tumor systems, molecular examination of the zzso 6 zzso may provide insight into the zzso of this important zzso
