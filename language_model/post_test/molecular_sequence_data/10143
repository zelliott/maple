Overlapping DNA fragments spanning approximately 21 zzso of zzso DNA and encompassing the human zzso zzso gene zzso have been cloned by screening a human zzso zzso library and by zzso amplification of human zzso zzso A continuous gene sequence of zzso zzso was established, including 1957 zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene is composed of 14 zzso interrupted by 13 zzso all exhibiting conventional zzso zzso Computer analysis of the DNA sequence revealed 12 complete repetitive zzso zzso 1 in the zzso region and 11 in the intervening segments of the zzso The zzso initiation site was mapped to a position 35 zzso upstream of the zzso start zzso The computer analysis also identified several potential zzso regulatory zzso including one zzso site, two zzso sites, and two zzso sites, in the sequence upstream of the zzso initiation zzso zzso analysis of promoter activity by transient zzso of zzso zzso reporter plasmids revealed a possible involvement of zzso zzso zzso in the regulation of zzso The highest level of expression of zzso zzso was found in human liver tissue as demonstrated by Northern zzso zzso
