The 3' terminal zzso zzso segment of potato virus M zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso This part of the viral zzso encodes the zzso protein zzso as well as a 12 zzso protein of as yet unknown zzso Both proteins were expressed in bacteria and their zzso zzso properties zzso The 12 zzso protein zzso but not the zzso protein bound zzso and zzso zzso zzso This property of zzso in conjunction with a zinc finger motif located adjacent to a basic region of the 12 zzso protein suggests that it may act as a regulatory factor during virus zzso
