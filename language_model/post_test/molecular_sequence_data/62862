zzso zzso zzso degrades zzso zzso is involved in the inflammatory process and implicated in zzso and zzso zzso The human zzso gene is within a zzso zzso locus on zzso 19 zzso Our observations demonstrate that zzso gene expression is regulated by zzso a zzso and a zzso binding zzso The zzso promoter has two zzso sites at zzso and zzso The zzso is the active site and it is closest to the zzso zzso Proximity is essential to activity since separation of the zzso and zzso sites by a zzso pair zzso reduced promoter activity by zzso This suggests physical interaction between the zzso proteins binding to the zzso and zzso zzso The nuclear protein that binds the zzso site is present in B and T zzso and an zzso cell line in addition to being abundant in the zzso stage of zzso maturation when the zzso gene is zzso The protein binding to the zzso site is absent or expressed at low levels in zzso cell zzso We have identified the zzso factors essential for human zzso gene zzso zzso with the mouse zzso gene shows similarities and zzso
