zzso pattern in zzso zzso is set up via a set of zzso interactions zzso by the products of the segment polarity zzso Among these is the zzso zzso whose product seems to be required for the reception of an zzso signal zzso by the wingless zzso As part of our effort to relate the structure of the zzso protein to its function within the cell, we have examined the evolutionary conservation of the zzso gene during insect zzso We have cloned the zzso gene from the housefly, zzso zzso which zzso from zzso 100 million years zzso The zzso protein is zzso identical to that in zzso while the zzso sequences have zzso zzso This remarkable degree of conservation at the protein level is mirrored in the expression pattern of the zzso zzso zzso against the zzso protein zzso with a zzso protein of the appropriate zzso We have also used these zzso to show that the zzso zzso protein has a pattern of expression in zzso and adult zzso similar to that of zzso zzso We discuss the implications of conservation of structure and expression for the cellular role of the zzso protein and its zzso zzso
