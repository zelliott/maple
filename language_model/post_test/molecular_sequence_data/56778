Type I DNA zzso has been isolated from zzso zzso following a procedure that takes advantage of the binding of the zzso to zzso and single stranded zzso Almost pure zzso was obtained using two successive affinity zzso steps: on zzso zzso and zzso zzso The method was rapid and allowed the isolation of DNA zzso I from zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso raised in rabbit were shown to zzso with type I DNA zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein sequencing of the zzso zzso zzso identified a zzso with high similarity to the putative protein sequence of zzso coli DNA zzso I, aligning with zzso identity to zzso acids zzso
