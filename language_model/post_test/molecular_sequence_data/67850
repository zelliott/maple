We formerly developed and applied a liquid zzso coupled with hybrid triple zzso zzso trap mass zzso technique for the detection and identification of zzso compounds in clinical and forensic zzso In this study, we aimed to adapt this technique to the detection and identification of the constituents of the urinary zzso After zzso zzso separation was performed using zzso zzso liquid zzso The mass zzso was operated in the zzso acquisition mode, switching between: a survey scan acquired in the enhanced zzso scan mode with dynamic zzso of background zzso and two dependent scans obtained in the enhanced product zzso scan zzso The results obtained show that: zzso the present procedure is able to detect and identify peptides which, together with their zzso parent zzso are similar to those referenced in the related zzso zzso the structure of some peptides can generally be resolved from their enhanced product zzso zzso and zzso confirmation of the sequences proposed through library search by in zzso zzso of the fragments observed in the enhanced product zzso zzso seems to be indispensable to avoid zzso
