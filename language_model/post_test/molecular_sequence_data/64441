zzso zzso C is zzso in India and zzso In the present study, we analyze zzso zzso C regulatory protein zzso sequences from five recent Indian zzso and five long-term survivors zzso for zzso at crucial functional zzso zzso analysis suggested the possibility of using regulatory gene sequences for viral zzso and evolutionary studies apart from structural zzso In the zzso tree, Indian zzso sequences zzso away from other reported zzso C zzso forming an Indian zzso within zzso zzso Our studies also suggested no evidence for the association of truncated zzso with slow progression of disease, as all zzso had intact zzso We could identify some variations in zzso to crucial functional zzso especially in zzso zzso when comparing them with zzso In zzso analysis, specifically for the zzso regions zzso and zzso our zzso sequences zzso away from those reported earlier in the literature, indicating specific evolutionary changes in these zzso regions of zzso in currently circulating zzso But the zzso ratio for our samples was less than one on comparing them with reported zzso C and representative sequences of different zzso strongly emphasizing the necessity of sequence conservation at different disease stages and even across zzso zzso binding zzso predictions for common Indian zzso indicated that specific zzso in zzso zzso may alter the intensity of zzso zzso which may alter the outcome of the immune zzso Hence these data would be useful in designing zzso zzso to be included in zzso zzso vaccine for the Indian population and would also be of immense help in zzso evolutionary zzso
