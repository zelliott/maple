The zzso hormone zzso zzso zzso large-scale changes in gene expression by stabilizing the interaction of zzso zzso domain zzso zzso with the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso which results in zzso degradation by the zzso zzso Recent structural studies show that the zzso degradation signal zzso includes a short zzso zzso motif that seals zzso in its binding pocket at the zzso zzso Here, we show that zzso zzso zzso lacks this motif and thus is unable to associate strongly with zzso in the presence of zzso As a consequence, zzso is stabilized against zzso zzso degradation and, when zzso expressed in zzso zzso zzso growth and defense zzso These findings indicate that sequence variation in a zzso region of the zzso affects zzso stability and zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso repression depends on an zzso zzso (for zzso zzso zzso motif at the zzso N zzso that binds the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso repression does not require the zzso domain, which, in other zzso zzso recruits zzso through the zzso zzso zzso protein zzso These findings show that zzso repression zzso in a zzso of zzso proteins repress gene expression through direct recruitment of zzso to zzso zzso zzso
