zzso of multiple zzso serves as a committed step in the degradation of a variety of zzso zzso proteins by the zzso zzso zzso are formed via a zzso zzso the initial step requires zzso zzso zzso which couples zzso zzso to zzso zzso Previously, we showed that many higher plants contain multiple E1 proteins and described several E1 genes from zzso To facilitate understanding of the roles of the different plant zzso we characterized the E1 gene and protein family from zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso by two genes zzso and zzso that zzso approximately zzso proteins with zzso zzso acid sequence identity to each other and zzso sequence identity with confirmed zzso from other zzso Like other E1 zzso zzso and 2 contain a zzso zzso in the putative active site for forming the zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of the corresponding proteins expressed in zzso coli demonstrated that both proteins activate zzso in an zzso reaction and transfer the activated zzso to a variety of zzso zzso with near equal zzso zzso studies by quantitative zzso and zzso with transgenic plants containing zzso zzso region zzso showed that the zzso and 2 genes are zzso in most, if not all, zzso zzso and zzso zzso the data indicate that E1 zzso and presumably the rest of the zzso pathway, are present throughout zzso They also show that the zzso and 2 genes are not zzso expressed nor do they zzso zzso with dramatically distinct zzso zzso
