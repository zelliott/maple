A zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso bacterial strain, designated zzso was isolated from activated sludge of a wastewater treatment zzso The strain was able to degrade about zzso of 100 zzso zzso acid zzso within 2 days of zzso Growth occurred in the presence of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at pH zzso zzso pH zzso and at zzso zzso zzso 28 zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain zzso was a member of the zzso zzso it showed highest gene sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso and similarities of zzso with strains of other zzso zzso The polar zzso pattern, the presence of zzso and zzso zzso the predominance of summed feature 8 zzso and/or zzso in the cellular fatty acid profile and the DNA zzso content also supported affiliation of the isolate to the zzso zzso zzso zzso showed low zzso zzso values zzso with zzso zzso zzso Based on zzso zzso and zzso data, strain zzso represents a novel species of the zzso zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso the type strain is zzso zzso AB zzso zzso zzso
