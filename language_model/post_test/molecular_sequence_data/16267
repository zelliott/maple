From the storage proteins of the pea zzso zzso the fraction which interacts with the pea zzso by the zzso site was zzso By zzso zzso patterns and other criteria, this fraction resembles the group of the zzso storage proteins zzso The fraction was resolved into zzso by zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequences of the individual zzso were zzso Most of these are identical with published zzso zzso zzso therefore this zzso fraction belongs to the zzso zzso zzso and zzso fragments were zzso for zzso zzso Though unequivocal assignments to zzso segments were possible, significant differences could be zzso in particular in the zzso zzso
