zzso with zzso zzso groups possess special zzso properties which have been studied in some zzso zzso proteins zzso and zzso zzso Rev zzso zzso However, zzso zzso complexes of zzso II zzso in zzso green zzso have received fewer zzso In the present study, we determined sequences of genes for several zzso zzso zzso zzso which showed that they belong to the group of major zzso and zzso early from green algae and higher zzso Analysis of zzso composition indicated that this zzso zzso contained in total 3 zzso and zzso but no zzso and zzso In addition, 2 zzso a in higher plant zzso were replaced by zzso zzso These changes led to an increased zzso in green and zzso light region compared with higher plant zzso The binding sites for zzso zzso and zzso were suggested based on the structural comparison with that of higher plant zzso All of the zzso for the zzso were completely zzso suggesting that the two zzso b were replaced by zzso a without changing their binding sites in higher plant zzso Comparisons of the zzso zzso of isolated zzso and zzso in different organic solutions and the effect of heat treatment suggested that these zzso existed in a low zzso protein environment, leading to an enhancement of light harvesting in the green light zzso This low zzso protein environment was maintained by the presence of more zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso Finally, zzso of zzso may also contribute to the enhanced harvesting of green zzso
