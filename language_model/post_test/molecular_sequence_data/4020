zzso regulates the zzso system through zzso G zzso receptors in zzso Certain zzso zzso that are zzso at zzso receptors behave as zzso at zzso zzso and chicken zzso This phenomenon provides the opportunity to zzso interactions and the mechanism underlying zzso zzso A zzso in position 6 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is required for this zzso activity zzso zzso zzso in the chicken and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in which zzso loop zzso of the human zzso zzso were zzso with the equivalent zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso identified zzso loop 2 as the zzso for zzso activity of one of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of nine zzso zzso in the zzso domain of zzso loop 2 of the human zzso zzso showed that a minimum of two zzso zzso and zzso is needed in this region for zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso was markedly decreased by low pH zzso compared with zzso zzso These findings indicate that zzso forms a zzso hydrogen bond with zzso to stabilize the zzso in the active zzso This discovery highlights the importance of zzso in zzso binding and zzso zzso in G zzso zzso
