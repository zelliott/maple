Using zzso directed against zzso and zzso zzso we have zzso detected zzso species in the membrane and zzso zzso of zzso zzso and in the zzso medium of zzso zzso These studies demonstrate an intact 140 zzso zzso form of zzso that is released on zzso Evidence that zzso zzso at least one form of zzso zzso was obtained by zzso amplification of specific zzso using zzso zzso zzso zzso and direct sequence analysis of zzso zzso zzso of zzso for release may occur via successive zzso zzso and/or by the release and zzso of an intact membrane associated zzso An intact form of zzso in zzso provides a circulating zzso upon which zzso from many zzso may act to produce beta protein zzso during zzso zzso
