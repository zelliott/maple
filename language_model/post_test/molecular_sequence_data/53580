zzso zzso sequences from the zzso zzso and zzso zzso were cloned and zzso In both species, zzso L zzso (also designated zzso zzso since it represents the zzso constituent of the signal recognition zzso was clearly zzso The sequence similarity between the two species was zzso compared with about zzso similarity between either of these species and zzso zzso K zzso was also cloned from the zzso The similarity between the zzso K zzso of the zzso and that of zzso was zzso Interestingly, several zzso elements were found with nearly zzso similarity compared with zzso In contrast to the zzso no zzso K zzso sequences were zzso among zzso zzso neither in northern blots nor with the zzso zzso In view of the significant conservation between the zzso K zzso of zzso and that of zzso zzso this unexpected result clearly separates zzso and zzso In addition, the lack of zzso zzso K zzso sequences in an zzso such as zzso indicates that these results do not reflect an zzso of zzso zzso our data provide additional support to the notion of a sister group relationship between zzso and zzso zzso to the exclusion of zzso
