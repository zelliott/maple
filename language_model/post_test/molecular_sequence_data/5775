A gene coding for a zzso from the zzso zzso extremely zzso zzso zzso zzso has been cloned in zzso zzso It consists of an open reading frame zzso of zzso zzso which codes for an zzso of zzso Da and is flanked by two other open reading zzso A truncated version of the gene which lacks zzso zzso of zzso also has zzso activity and it appears that the zzso portion of the gene is not essential for either activity or zzso zzso acid sequence comparisons with other published zzso and zzso showed that it possesses zzso to the four key regions common to these zzso
