zzso The construction of three-dimensional models of zzso zzso from rat zzso rabbit zzso and man zzso based on a multiple sequence alignment with zzso a unique zzso bacterial zzso (in terms of possessing an zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso of known crystal structure, is zzso zzso The zzso models described are shown to be consistent with experimental evidence from zzso zzso studies, zzso recognition sites and zzso acid zzso identified as being associated with zzso partner zzso together with the location of a key zzso zzso zzso likely to be involved in protein zzso zzso zzso A substantial number of known zzso and zzso of zzso zzso are shown to fit the putative active sites of the zzso models in agreement with their reported position of metabolism or mode of zzso zzso In particular, there is zzso between the characteristic zzso zzso of zzso zzso and key groups in the zzso active zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso appears to zzso a number of the reported findings from quantitative zzso relationship investigations on series of zzso zzso and zzso
