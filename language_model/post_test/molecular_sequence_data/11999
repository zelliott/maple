To determine the molecular mechanisms of age-related changes in zzso zzso gene zzso male Fisher 344 rats at 4, 12, and 24 months of age were zzso The zzso zzso content was modestly increased by zzso and plasma zzso concentration was not altered with zzso There were no age-related changes in zzso zzso content of the zzso The in zzso synthetic rate of zzso as measured with zzso incorporation in zzso rats zzso zzso zzso zzso was not significantly different from that in zzso rats zzso zzso zzso zzso However, in zzso zzso efficiency of zzso zzso from zzso rats was only zzso of that in zzso zzso This was correlated with zzso of the zzso tail of zzso zzso from approximately zzso bases in zzso rats to only zzso bases in zzso zzso The reduced zzso zzso zzso efficiency in zzso along with zzso of the zzso tail with age is probably an zzso response since zzso zzso content was increased and plasma zzso zzso were not altered with zzso The age-related zzso of the zzso tail is yet another mechanism of age-related zzso in the expression of specific genes where the changes seen with age are mostly zzso
