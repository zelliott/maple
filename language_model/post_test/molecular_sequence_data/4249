The zzso acid sequences of zzso proteins from the bacteria zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso coli, zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso were zzso zzso based on distance and zzso analysis showed that the zzso group can be easily distinguished from the other zzso zzso The construction of a consensus bacterial zzso based on the alignment of six bacterial and one zzso zzso allowed the design of consensus zzso to search for zzso genes in other zzso zzso products of the expected size were found in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso pneumoniae, zzso zzso and zzso zzso
