zzso and zzso proteins catalyze a wide range of zzso and zzso zzso To probe the mechanisms by which individual members of this class of proteins are able to catalyze such a wide range of zzso we have prepared a model zzso bundle with a zzso site located near the center of the zzso The zzso bundle is constructed by the zzso zzso of three different chains zzso zzso and zzso that zzso into the desired zzso when mixed in a zzso zzso zzso On addition of zzso zzso and zzso the protein forms a complex with a zzso spectrum closely resembling that of zzso zzso species in natural proteins and model zzso By combining a small collection of zzso zzso of these zzso it should now be possible to prepare an zzso member library, which will allow systematic exploration of the features giving rise to the zzso properties of this class of zzso
