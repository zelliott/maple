The zzso cell wall zzso zzso is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso zzso that is a complex composed of at least two zzso zzso and zzso Here, we report the zzso sequence of a single zzso gene and of the regulatory unit, zzso from the zzso zzso fungus zzso zzso The predicted zzso and zzso share, respectively, zzso and zzso identity with that of zzso zzso We also report that the sensitivity to zzso of eight different zzso zzso clinical strains is similar, with a zzso zzso zzso and a zzso of 1 zzso except for one strain which had a zzso of zzso zzso This same strain exhibited one substitution at the hot spot 2, zzso compatible with less susceptible zzso with the other seven strains having no zzso in either hot spot 1 or zzso The relative zzso of the expression of zzso and of zzso demonstrated a decrease in response to an exposure to zzso at zzso zzso
