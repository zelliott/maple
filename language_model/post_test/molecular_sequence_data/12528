zzso zzso zzso was detected in a differential screen of a rat zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was enriched in the formation but was also detected in rat liver and zzso though at much lower zzso expression was barely zzso in zzso zzso and zzso In liver, unlike brain, expression was sexually zzso zzso expression was greatly reduced in female zzso In zzso brain expression was zzso with the highest levels being detected in corpus zzso only low levels were detected in zzso zzso analysis of rat and mouse zzso zzso revealed extensive zzso with zzso zzso zzso a diverse family of zzso zzso that metabolize a range of zzso including steroids, fatty zzso and zzso Among the zzso zzso is most similar zzso at the zzso acid zzso to cholesterol 7 zzso zzso and contains a zzso zzso domain present in other zzso zzso but clearly represents a type of zzso not previously zzso zzso Southern analysis suggests that a single gene corresponding to zzso is present in zzso zzso and zzso zzso is unusual in that, unlike all other zzso zzso the primary site of expression is in the zzso zzso to zzso and other zzso zzso may argue that zzso zzso plays a role in steroid metabolism in brain, notable because of the documented ability of zzso steroids zzso to zzso cognitive function in zzso
