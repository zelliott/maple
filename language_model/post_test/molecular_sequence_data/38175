The zzso box encodes a zzso DNA binding domain found in many proteins and is involved in the regulation of zzso and zzso zzso We describe zzso and zzso two novel human zzso zzso zzso discovered within the zzso zzso full-length zzso sequencing zzso The predicted proteins zzso by these two genes are zzso identical zzso within the zzso zzso The zzso domain of both zzso proteins is most similar to that of zzso zzso zzso to zzso Outside of this domain, zzso proteins lack any significant zzso to other known zzso We determined the zzso structure and expression pattern of zzso and zzso Both genes have several alternative zzso expressed almost zzso zzso maps to zzso zzso (near zzso and zzso to zzso (between zzso and zzso The zzso genes define a distinct class of zzso zzso box zzso
