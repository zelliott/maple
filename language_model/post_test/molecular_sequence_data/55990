zzso adrenal zzso zzso comprises a family of inherited human disorders caused by a zzso in cortisol zzso We previously reported absent cholesterol zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso expression in rabbits affected with zzso Further molecular studies via Southern zzso zzso using a full-length human zzso zzso probe and a cloned rabbit zzso zzso probe, demonstrated the absence of zzso DNA fragments in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso chain reactions revealed that zzso zzso was not zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso confirming the previous findings of absent zzso gene expression by Northern and Western zzso Cloning and sequencing of a zzso zzso of rabbit zzso zzso zzso of the coding zzso revealed an approximately zzso identical zzso sequence and a zzso identical zzso acid sequence compared to the human zzso zzso We conclude that a large deletion zzso in the zzso gene is most likely responsible for the absent zzso gene expression resulting in the lethal and zzso form of zzso in the zzso Further investigation of adrenal and zzso zzso zzso gene expression in this zzso animal model will provide a greater understanding of the molecular zzso of zzso while zzso zzso gene transfer experiments using zzso zzso in zzso or in zzso will ultimately characterize the molecular basis of zzso and provide a foundation for zzso gene therapy zzso
