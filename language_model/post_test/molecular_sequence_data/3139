We report the constitution and molecular characterization of a novel zzso zzso zzso that starts to accumulate specifically in the nucleus in the zzso zzso zzso zzso after progression through the early zzso zzso The zzso for the nuclear zzso was cloned and the zzso sequence defines a single open reading frame zzso a protein with 737 zzso acids and a predicted molecular mass of 83 zzso A comparison of this zzso with other members of the gene family revealed an overall sequence identity of zzso A special sequence feature of this zzso which is not found in other zzso is the presence of nuclear zzso zzso sequences in the zzso zzso zzso of hybrid zzso that zzso the zzso segment fused to reporter proteins into the zzso zzso of an zzso produced zzso proteins by zzso zzso It was found that the zzso segment alone was sufficient to effect nuclear zzso of an otherwise zzso zzso These results suggest that the nuclear zzso of the zzso may play an important role in nuclear zzso during early zzso zzso
