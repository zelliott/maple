We have searched the zzso and rice zzso zzso zzso for zzso of zzso an zzso gene zzso a novel type of cell wall protein containing a zzso repeat zzso and an zzso zzso Eleven and eight zzso zzso genes have been identified in these two plant species, zzso The zzso gene family encodes proteins characterized by a short zzso domain, a domain with 10 zzso a zzso zzso and a variable zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis performed on the zzso zzso indicates the existence of two major zzso of zzso proteins that arose before the zzso divergence and then diversified independently in each zzso In zzso gene expression studies by northern zzso and zzso zzso showed that the two zzso zzso represent a specialization into zzso and zzso zzso The four zzso genes of the zzso zzso are specifically expressed in zzso whereas the seven zzso genes are predominantly expressed in various zzso zzso This separation into two expression classes is also supported by previous studies on zzso zzso zzso and tomato zzso zzso zzso zzso and by information on available rice zzso The strong conservation of the zzso acids responsible for the putative recognition specificity of the zzso domain throughout the family suggests that the zzso proteins interact with similar zzso
