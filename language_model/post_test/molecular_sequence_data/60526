An intrinsic zzso zzso antenna and a particular form of zzso zzso zzso III, coexist in the marine zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso region including the zzso zzso of zzso zzso was zzso It encompasses zzso zzso that zzso three structural zzso and at least three zzso five) different zzso analogous to zzso or red zzso proteins involved either in the linkage of zzso or the synthesis and attachment of zzso zzso This gene cluster is part of the zzso and is located within a distance of less than 110 zzso from a previously characterized region containing the genes zzso Whereas the zzso zzso are characterized by distinct deletions and zzso acid replacements with regard to analogous proteins from other organisms, the gene arrangement resembles the organization of zzso genes in some other zzso in particular marine zzso zzso The expression of two of the zzso zzso as zzso proteins in zzso coli allowed the production of individual zzso zzso to the zzso alpha and beta zzso zzso zzso using these zzso show that the zzso zzso are specifically associated to the zzso membrane and that the protein level does not significantly vary as a function of light zzso or growth zzso
