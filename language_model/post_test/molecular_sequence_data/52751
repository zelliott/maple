The zzso gene of zzso zzso encodes a zzso zzso which plays an essential role in zzso zzso degradation and/or processing in the zzso We have cloned a previously zzso gene zzso that we refer to as zzso zzso interacting protein zzso zzso is zzso to zzso zzso zzso and human zzso zzso of zzso zzso a growth zzso which can be zzso by an additional copy of zzso on a zzso zzso or by directing zzso the zzso zzso of zzso to the nucleus through the addition of a nuclear targeting zzso zzso of zzso is zzso lethal with the zzso zzso and shows genetic interaction with a deletion of zzso but not zzso zzso analysis of an zzso deletion zzso indicated a zzso in zzso zzso which was nearly fully reversed by zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso revealed that zzso is required for normal zzso zzso In the absence of zzso zzso was the zzso form of zzso and there was an zzso of zzso forms but not zzso species of zzso zzso In addition, a zzso zzso species accumulated in the zzso zzso Thus, deletion of zzso affects both zzso and 3' processing reactions of zzso zzso zzso with the in zzso data suggesting that zzso enhances zzso function, zzso zzso stabilized the in zzso zzso activity of zzso
