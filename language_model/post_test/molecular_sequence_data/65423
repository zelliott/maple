A sensitive zzso zzso detection of zzso DNA has been developed by taking advantage of a magnetic zzso process and the amplification feature of zzso gold zzso In this zzso the target zzso are zzso with magnetic zzso capture zzso followed by the zzso of the zzso amplifying DNA zzso and the binding of zzso gold zzso the zzso gold tags are then dissolved and zzso by a simple and sensitive zzso zzso zzso The proposed zzso protocol is evaluated for a zzso model DNA zzso and the amount as low as zzso zzso of DNA is determined, which exhibits a 150 zzso enhancement in sensitivity over previous gold zzso zzso formats and an enhancement of 20 zzso over the zzso zzso Further signal amplification is achieved by the assembly of zzso zzso gold onto the surface of zzso polystyrene zzso Such amplified zzso zzso allows detection of DNA targets down to the 100 zzso level, and offers great promise for zzso detection of other zzso zzso
