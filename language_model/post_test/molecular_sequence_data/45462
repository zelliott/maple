zzso zzso is one of the surface zzso of influenza zzso The immune response induced by zzso DNA in the mouse model has been proved, in our previous study, to be able to provide an adequate protection against the challenge with a zzso virus and a zzso against the challenge with a zzso virus of the same zzso In this paper, a series of zzso zzso zzso with the zzso at the zzso or zzso of zzso zzso zzso deleted zzso were constructed by zzso zzso mice were zzso with the zzso zzso and challenged with zzso virus at a lethal zzso The essential sequence of zzso DNA to provide protection against the influenza virus was explored by observing the survival rates, serum zzso zzso zzso and lung virus zzso of the zzso The result showed that, along with the increasing number of zzso deleted serially at the zzso or zzso of zzso DNA, the zzso zzso induced by zzso DNA zzso zzso DNA lost its protection against the influenza virus when 60 zzso (or 20 zzso zzso at the zzso or 66 zzso (or 22 zzso zzso at the zzso were zzso The zzso of zzso DNA may play an important role in protection against influenza zzso
