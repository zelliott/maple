zzso zzso in zzso zzso isolated from zzso brain results in an inability to fully activate the plasma membrane zzso zzso which may contribute to observed increases in zzso calcium levels under conditions of zzso stress and biological zzso To identify the functional importance of the zzso of zzso and zzso near the zzso of zzso we have used zzso zzso to substitute zzso for zzso at other positions in zzso permitting the zzso zzso of zzso and zzso Prior to their zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso by these zzso zzso is similar to that of zzso zzso Likewise, zzso of individual zzso has a minimal effect on the zzso concentration necessary for zzso zzso of the zzso These results are consistent with previous suggestions that no single zzso within zzso is essential for zzso of the zzso zzso of either zzso and zzso or all nine zzso in zzso results in an equivalent zzso of the zzso resulting in a zzso reduction in the level of zzso zzso zzso of zzso is largely responsible for the decreased extent of zzso zzso suggesting that this site is critical in modulating the sensitivity of zzso to zzso zzso These results are discussed in terms of a possible functional role for zzso and zzso in zzso as zzso sensors that function to zzso calcium zzso and energy metabolism in response to conditions of zzso zzso
