zzso zzso zzso was previously reported to induce zzso zzso zzso in rats after prolonged zzso The present experiments were undertaken to evaluate the zzso and molecular biology of these tumors and the possible role of zzso oxide zzso a zzso zzso in their zzso Male zzso rats received a single zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso at 6 weeks of age and/or a diet containing zzso zzso from 8 weeks of age until zzso zzso for up to 78 zzso Some animals were subjected to 2/3 partial zzso zzso at 9 weeks of zzso Five sequential sacrifices zzso 32, 52, 78 and 84 weeks of zzso were zzso No liver tumors developed in control rats or in rats that received zzso only by a single zzso zzso even when zzso was followed by zzso zzso zzso mainly of clear cell and mixed cell type zzso as positive for zzso zzso zzso zzso were found from 14 weeks of age in rats receiving zzso in the zzso zzso zzso areas zzso zzso composed of zzso zzso that often extended into the veins were observed beginning at 52 weeks of zzso Some mixed zzso zzso and zzso arose in zzso zzso zzso were seen beginning at 78 weeks of age, but only in rats receiving dietary zzso zzso of zzso in the latter animals was zzso Most zzso were well zzso The zzso effect of zzso given in the diet was not affected by prior zzso of a large single dose followed by zzso No zzso zzso were found in 18 tumors but zzso point zzso all within zzso 12, were found in zzso tumors, mostly those with zzso zzso These were first or second position zzso zzso or second position zzso zzso While these zzso types have also been commonly seen in bacteria after zzso DNA damage, the fact that tumors arose only on prolonged feeding of this zzso zzso agent at massive doses seems consistent with a more complex mechanism involving multiple zzso genetic and/or zzso factors in zzso by zzso
