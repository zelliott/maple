Recent studies have shown that the zzso protein zzso can zzso to the cell nucleus and regulate gene zzso via its ability to bind a protein motif in the zzso domain of nuclear hormone zzso A number of known zzso of bone cell function, including vitamin D, act through this zzso family, suggesting that zzso may regulate their action in bone zzso We have used a zzso strategy to examine this putative role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited the binding of the vitamin D zzso to characterized vitamin D response elements in gel zzso zzso This zzso was due to direct zzso interactions between the vitamin D zzso and zzso zzso of zzso transcripts declined during zzso zzso zzso zzso cells were zzso with zzso expression zzso zzso zzso cell lines zzso zzso zzso were established and zzso for vitamin zzso gene expression and the capacity to zzso zzso zzso expression inhibited zzso and vitamin zzso expression of the zzso zzso whereas zzso gene expression was zzso This pattern zzso the gene expression pattern observed in parental cells before zzso of zzso zzso zzso In long-term cultures of parental or zzso cells, 1 zzso D3 zzso induced a two- to zzso stimulation of zzso zzso into the zzso zzso zzso expression of zzso inhibited the zzso zzso zzso This result correlated with the complete absence of zzso zzso in long-term cultures of zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso can regulate bone cell function by interacting with specific nuclear hormone zzso zzso
