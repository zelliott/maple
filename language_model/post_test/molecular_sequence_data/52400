A new procedure for zzso zzso amplification of DNA fragments is zzso DNA from zzso zzso was used as a test zzso It was zzso with a frequently cutting restriction zzso zzso generating sticky zzso The DNA was zzso to a zzso zzso zzso and subsequently amplified in a zzso zzso using two zzso with sequences derived from the zzso As little as 1 zzso of zzso DNA could be detected by this zzso The product was analyzed on a gel and zzso with a zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso was repeated with different amounts of zzso DNA in the presence of an excess of zzso zzso In these experiments, zzso DNA fragments were amplified in a zzso zzso After zzso with a zzso zzso zzso DNA probe, 1 zzso of zzso DNA could still be zzso This method allows rapid screening of blood for low zzso and zzso viruses in which primer binding sites are not zzso
