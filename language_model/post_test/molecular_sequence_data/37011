zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso belong to the zzso system, space group zzso with a zzso zzso b zzso zzso c zzso zzso A, and Z zzso zzso The crystal structure was solved by the direct method and refined by the zzso zzso procedure to an zzso of zzso for zzso observed reflections in the X-ray zzso The molecular structure is similar to that of zzso The zzso angles around the zzso bonds are influenced by both the existence of an zzso hydrogen bond at zzso zzso and the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and zzso zzso angles are zzso and zzso respectively, whereas the corresponding zzso angles in the reducing zzso are zzso and zzso One water zzso zzso with each zzso and the crystal structure is stabilized mainly by zzso and zzso hydrogen bonds involving water zzso
