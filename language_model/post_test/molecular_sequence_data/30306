To investigate the function of base 792 of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of zzso coli, the zzso zzso zzso was changed to zzso zzso or zzso by zzso zzso Each base change zzso a unique zzso on the zzso zzso containing zzso zzso with zzso or zzso showed no difference in generation time in LB broth containing zzso whereas cells with zzso exhibited a zzso increase in generation time in this zzso To study the effect on cell growth of a homogeneous population of zzso zzso the zzso were cloned into the zzso zzso gene on zzso carrying a zzso marker zzso at position zzso and the cells were grown with zzso zzso containing zzso or zzso showed zzso and zzso increases in generation time, respectively, and a zzso decrease in zzso zzso into zzso zzso with zzso did not grow in zzso zzso zzso analyses indicated decreasing ability to form zzso zzso from zzso zzso containing zzso zzso or zzso at position 792 in zzso zzso It appeared that zzso zzso zzso had lost the ability to bind initiation factor zzso
