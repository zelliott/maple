The zzso protein zzso zzso belongs to the zzso family of zzso proteins and is located in the zzso The purpose of this study was to investigate the structure and zzso function of zzso of the giant panda zzso zzso The complementary DNA of zzso was cloned successfully using reverse zzso chain reaction zzso We constructed a zzso expression zzso containing zzso complementary DNA and zzso it in zzso coli using zzso zzso The expression product obtained was zzso using zzso affinity zzso The results indicated that the length of the zzso cloned is zzso zzso and it contains an zzso frame of zzso zzso zzso 157 zzso zzso zzso structure analysis revealed that the molecular weight of the putative zzso protein is zzso zzso with a theoretical zzso point of zzso The zzso gene is readily expressed in zzso coli, and the zzso fused with the zzso zzso protein to give rise to the zzso of an expected zzso zzso The zzso rate in mice treated with zzso zzso zzso the highest of 3 doses zzso can reach zzso which may be comparable to the response to zzso The zzso of zzso with tumors showed that the zzso in the zzso group displayed a looser arrangement compared with that in the control zzso Furthermore, no obvious damage was apparent in other zzso such as heart, zzso and zzso The data showed that the zzso zzso had time and dose dependency on the cell growth zzso zzso Human zzso zzso zzso cells treated with zzso zzso zzso for 24 h displayed significant cell growth zzso zzso zzso zzso N zzso 6) in zzso using zzso zzso zzso compared with that in control zzso zzso By contrast, human zzso zzso zzso cells displayed no significant change zzso zzso zzso N zzso 6) from control zzso zzso zzso has time and dose dependency on zzso cell growth zzso The data indicate that the effect at low zzso is better than that at high zzso and the concentration of zzso zzso provides the best rate of growth zzso Further research is ongoing to determine the zzso principles of zzso zzso protein that are responsible for its zzso zzso
