A series of zzso zzso coli zzso expression zzso have been constructed which allow easy zzso of the zzso sequences from zzso Features of six are zzso and two designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso are characterized in zzso zzso of cloned sequences is controlled by the alternative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso early, and by the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso restriction sites in the intervening zzso make these zzso zzso compatible for directional cloning of zzso zzso zzso zzso have been previously shown to have high levels of the genetic activity in both zzso zzso and zzso coli, allowing these zzso to be used for genetic zzso in both zzso zzso recovery from the zzso zzso is zzso by the activity of the zzso zzso upon lox sequences zzso the zzso and adjoining the zzso zzso The plasmids contain the zzso 2 zzso origin and zzso coli zzso origin, the zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso marker in zzso zzso The usefulness of the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso cloning zzso was demonstrated by constructing large zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso library was used to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of zzso coli, and zzso and/or suppressed zzso colonies were zzso The flexibility and power of this system for cloning of zzso is zzso
