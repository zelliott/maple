A zzso molecular zzso analysis was carried out to study the zzso diversity in two soil samples collected from the subsurface zzso zzso zzso of the former zzso gold mine, zzso South zzso USA at two sites, the Ross zzso and number 6 zzso zzso community analyses were performed by cloning and sequencing of zzso zzso genes retrieved directly from soil zzso zzso characterization of zzso revealed high amount of toxic metals such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and U at both the zzso zzso analyses showed that soil samples were predominantly composed of zzso related to zzso zzso Other zzso detected in libraries were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and candidate divisions zzso and zzso The majority zzso of the zzso retrieved in the libraries were most closely related to environmental sequences from zzso bacteria representing a zzso unidentified zzso The zzso communities at both the sites exhibited lower diversity and were most closely affiliated to zzso species within the zzso zzso showed the existence of diverse microbial populations in deep subsurface environment of the zzso gold zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that each site zzso zzso distinct microbial populations that were more diverse at Ross site compare to zzso zzso
