The zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso II has been characterized extensively in zzso Based upon its structural and functional zzso it has been proposed to be an zzso zzso pool in equilibrium with filaments in zzso It is known that zzso filaments can assemble and zzso in zzso cells, and in some smooth muscle cells, but whether or not the zzso pool contains functional zzso zzso has not been zzso Here we address this question using human airway smooth muscle cells zzso Using two zzso against different zzso on smooth muscle zzso II zzso two distinct pools of zzso zzso and zzso were zzso by zzso zzso The two zzso pools were functional in that they could be zzso in two ways: zzso by exposure to zzso versus zzso buffer conditions, and zzso by exposure to a zzso that shifts the zzso equilibrium toward filaments in zzso by a known mechanism that requires the presence of the zzso zzso The effect of the zzso was not due to a trivial increase in zzso zzso and its specificity was demonstrated by use of a scrambled zzso which had no zzso Based upon these data, we conclude that zzso contain a significant pool of functional zzso in the zzso zzso that can assemble into filaments upon changing cellular zzso This study provides unique direct evidence for the presence of a significant pool of functional zzso in the zzso zzso in zzso
