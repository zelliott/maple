Heavy metal zzso zzso play a critical role in cell survival by maintaining appropriate zzso metal zzso zzso zzso zzso is a member of this family that zzso zzso from the zzso to the exterior of the cell using zzso as energy zzso zzso has a 264 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso that is essential for zzso binding and zzso as well as ultimately zzso the energy to the zzso zzso site for metal zzso and zzso The relevant zzso of this domain during the different steps of the zzso cycle are still under zzso Through crystal structures of the zzso and zzso zzso with limited zzso and zzso studies of the zzso and zzso states, we show that the isolated zzso of zzso cycles from an open zzso in the zzso to a closed zzso in the zzso state, then returns to an open zzso suitable for product zzso The present work is the first structural report of an zzso with its zzso relevant product zzso zzso The solution studies we have performed help resolve questions on the potential influence of crystal packing on domain zzso These results explain how zzso is zzso in zzso zzso and give an insight into the zzso relevant zzso of the zzso at different steps of the zzso zzso
