The three-dimensional structure of the zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso has been determined at zzso A resolution by the molecular replacement method combined with map averaging procedures, using data collected from an area zzso The structure of zzso zzso from zzso zzso which contains an zzso zzso was used as the starting search zzso zzso consists of 2 heavy zzso and 2 light zzso zzso related by a molecular zzso zzso The H zzso is folded into seven zzso beta zzso forming a zzso structure, arranged with zzso zzso A zzso zzso tail exists at the zzso of the H zzso in zzso from zzso zzso but is partially zzso in this crystal form of zzso from zzso zzso leaving the H zzso about 18 zzso zzso Each L zzso contains zzso zzso arranged into 10 zzso connected by zzso The active site of the zzso is located in the L zzso and is accessible via a zzso channel between the H and L zzso The zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is highly zzso It is formed from two zzso linked zzso side chains at positions 57 and 107 of the L zzso one of which contains an zzso
