A potent and selective P type calcium channel blocker isolated from the zzso of the funnel web zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and its related peptides were zzso by the solution zzso zzso zzso zzso was found to block zzso zzso calcium current in rat zzso zzso with the same potency as that reported for the natural zzso Its zzso structure was determined by zzso acid analysis, zzso sequencing and mass zzso of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso and truncated peptides showed the same zzso profile and the same activities as those of zzso zzso indicating that the zzso basic zzso zzso is not important for both the folding and the expression of the biological zzso However, the zzso zzso in the zzso might be essential for the toxin to bind tightly with the channel zzso
