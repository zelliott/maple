The zzso for rat zzso zzso zzso zzso was cloned from an zzso zzso zzso The sequence of this zzso was found to be identical to that of the reverse zzso chain reaction zzso product obtained using rat lung zzso as a zzso The zzso contains a zzso open reading frame that codes for a protein of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso which shares zzso identity with the human zzso and zzso identity with the mouse zzso zzso The regions that are believed to be the zzso binding domain and the active site are zzso in the zzso from the three different zzso However, the sequence of the zzso 9 zzso acids appears to be significantly zzso The authenticity of the rat zzso was confirmed by the expression of an zzso active zzso in zzso zzso
