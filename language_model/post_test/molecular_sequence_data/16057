Two long and uninterrupted reading zzso specifying the zzso and RTL zzso are embedded within fragmented zzso genes in the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso a zzso green zzso The zzso gene encodes a zzso of respiratory zzso zzso a standard zzso zzso while the RTL gene is related to the reverse zzso part of some optional zzso and plasmids in zzso zzso The universal genetic code is used in both the zzso and RTL zzso however, the latter is distinguished from the other protein coding genes of zzso zzso zzso by several characteristics which suggest that RTL may be a more recently acquired zzso zzso each of the protein coding zzso whose zzso are of similar zzso are some of the zzso zzso gene pieces that are a unique feature of zzso zzso zzso These zzso zzso give rise to zzso zzso pieces of zzso which are not spliced in this genetic zzso Judging by the observed juxtaposition of transcripts as they zzso to the zzso the mature zzso and zzso species from this region appear to be generated by precise zzso zzso of a long zzso zzso We suggest a model, involving reverse zzso of zzso and zzso of the resulting zzso into the zzso zzso that might account for the pattern of dispersed zzso gene pieces in zzso zzso zzso zzso
