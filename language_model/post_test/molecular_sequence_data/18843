zzso of zzso zzso in the second position of the zzso in peptides restricts the usage of many zzso however, zzso P zzso is capable of removing this zzso Based on the zzso zzso acid sequences of zzso from zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned in zzso and over expressed as a zzso protein with a molecular weight of zzso zzso in zzso coli zzso zzso zzso sequencing revealed a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso specificity of the zzso zzso was analyzed by the zzso of the zzso bond in zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso of the zzso were found to be zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was enhanced in the presence of metal zzso such as zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and was inhibited by zzso zzso zzso and zzso The atomic zzso studies revealed the presence of zzso in the protein as a zzso This zzso specific zzso was found to be a zzso and zzso active at pH 8 and 37 zzso
