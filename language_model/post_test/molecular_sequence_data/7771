We have used Northern zzso and zzso in zzso zzso to analyze the zzso and spatial expression pattern of the Pl alpha 2 zzso gene in zzso zzso sea zzso zzso The Pl alpha 2 transcript is first zzso at 14 h zzso zzso zzso and it is only expressed in the oral zzso The amount of transcripts of this gene increases throughout development and accumulates up to the zzso zzso In this stage the Pl alpha 2 transcript is localized in the neural structures of the zzso We conclude that the Pl alpha 2 gene is an early zzso territory zzso zzso we have observed the same zzso of the Pl alpha 2 transcript in the zzso or zzso zzso confirming the animal zzso of the Pl alpha 2 transcript and its specific relation to zzso territory, whose differentiation starts from few founder cells present at zzso zzso
