zzso zzso an zzso motor zzso and zzso 2 zzso a zzso involved in zzso and cell zzso have been found to bind together using zzso and zzso zzso zzso In zzso zzso cells, zzso VI is known to be associated with zzso zzso zzso and is believed to move them towards the minus end of zzso zzso away from the plasma membrane and into the zzso zzso belongs to a group of signal zzso proteins that bind in zzso to the zzso sequence found in the zzso tails of members of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The central region of zzso containing two zzso zzso binds to the zzso zzso protein zzso whereas a zzso region contains the binding site for zzso zzso This site is zzso in zzso the zzso counterpart of zzso The interaction between zzso and zzso VI was confirmed by in zzso binding zzso and zzso and by their zzso in zzso zzso concentrated at the zzso domain of zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso interaction may be one link between the zzso zzso and receptors undergoing zzso
