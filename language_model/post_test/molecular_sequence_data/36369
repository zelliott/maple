Three zzso zzso were performed in two regions of a zzso gene from zzso zzso which are known to be zzso in bacterial zzso The zzso zzso were expressed in zzso coli and, when measured with zzso as zzso exhibited variations in zzso properties compared with the zzso zzso The conservative substitution of zzso 37 by zzso located in a short zzso region upstream from the four repeated sequences common in bacterial zzso zzso was of special interest, as zzso and zzso as well as zzso measured with zzso were dramatically zzso These data suggest that this zzso may be involved in zzso zzso In addition to its low activity, this zzso zzso has a lower temperature optimum and is active over a more limited pH zzso This zzso also prevents the binding of an zzso able to inhibit the zzso zzso The other zzso located in one of the consensus zzso were of lower influence on zzso activity and recognition by zzso
