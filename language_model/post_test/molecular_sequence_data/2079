A zzso system of nuclear extracts from zzso cells has been developed to zzso zzso in zzso between the DNA of zzso type 12 zzso and two different zzso zzso zzso The zzso cloned zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso DNA had previously been identified as the zzso sites corresponding to the junctions between zzso DNA and zzso DNA in cell line zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which had zzso previously with foreign zzso DNA, might again be recognized by the zzso system even in a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA and the circular or the zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso sequences were incubated with nuclear zzso zzso were isolated by zzso the DNA into zzso zzso coli strains and by screening for zzso zzso zzso Without a zzso zzso marker, all zzso DNA positive zzso were zzso Out of a total of greater than 90 zzso DNA zzso 21 were studied by zzso and four by partial zzso sequence zzso Among the zzso DNA zzso four were zzso The sites of linkage between zzso DNA and zzso or zzso zzso DNA were all different and distinct from the original zzso or zzso junction site between zzso and zzso zzso The in zzso zzso were not generated by simple zzso joining of the DNA fragments used in the reaction but by genetic zzso Thirteen of the 25 zzso were derived from the zzso map unit zzso of zzso zzso zzso experiments between zzso DNA and four randomly selected unique or repetitive zzso DNA sequences of zzso zzso in length did not yield zzso Apparently, the zzso and zzso zzso zzso sequences zzso with zzso DNA with a certain zzso
