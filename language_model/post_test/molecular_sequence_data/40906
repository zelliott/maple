A zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso was isolated and zzso The zzso gene was cloned using a zzso zzso The gene was found to zzso a protein containing a zzso domain that is involved in the zzso zzso The zzso and growth of the zzso zzso were comparable to that of the zzso when the plants were grown under low light zzso When the light intensity was increased, the zzso was characterized by stunted growth and zzso leaves as well as a decrease in zzso zzso The zzso levels declined, whereas the zzso levels increased, leading to a decrease in the zzso zzso The zzso suffered from severe zzso damage with an increase in zzso zzso activity and a drastic reduction in the levels of zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso with zzso zzso rescued the zzso zzso even under increasing light zzso The zzso zzso therefore plays an important role in protecting plants from zzso zzso
