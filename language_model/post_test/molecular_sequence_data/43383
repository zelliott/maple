This paper describes a zzso study on the protein composition of zzso inclusions zzso from plant zzso By zzso and zzso a zzso of 59 zzso was identified as the zzso protein component in zzso zzso from sunflower zzso zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso was the only additional zzso zzso In contrast to in cores, the zzso zzso was the major zzso protein in zzso zzso obtained from zzso zzso These findings suggested two zzso populations of zzso differing in molecular structure and zzso zzso in sunflower zzso Evidence for different zzso acid sequences of the two zzso was found by zzso mapping with zzso zzso by expressing a zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso coli, and by partial zzso acid sequencing of zzso fragments from zzso core zzso These results contradict the previous view that the formation of zzso occurred via zzso of zzso zzso and indicate that new concepts on the zzso and zzso function of plant zzso zzso need to be zzso
