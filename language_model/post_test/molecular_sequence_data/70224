The zzso zzso from zzso zzso has been zzso to zzso The native zzso is composed of four probably identical zzso of relative molecular mass zzso 72,000 zzso zzso The unique zzso zzso acid sequence is zzso to those of other zzso zzso especially of type I and II zzso from zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso from zzso zzso is zzso for zzso and cooperative for the other zzso zzso The zzso is strongly activated by zzso zzso and zzso which increase the affinity for zzso These zzso seem to stabilize the same state of the zzso since their maximum zzso are not zzso but their partial zzso can be zzso zzso zzso is also zzso activated by zzso and inhibited by zzso However, both zzso and zzso act as strong zzso in the presence of a strong zzso because these weak zzso suppress the zzso by zzso zzso or zzso This mutual exclusion of strong and weak zzso which appears as an original regulatory zzso could reflect either the binding of different zzso to different interacting sites or their competition for a unique zzso regulatory site in the zzso zzso from zzso zzso
