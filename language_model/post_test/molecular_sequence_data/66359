zzso replication and propagation is dependent on the zzso activity of the viral zzso zzso which zzso the zzso zzso replication complex into functional zzso Thus, zzso is an attractive target for drug discovery efforts to combat highly zzso zzso Unfortunately, zzso development has been hampered by a lack of structural information for the zzso zzso Here, we report the crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso from Venezuelan zzso encephalitis zzso determined at zzso A zzso The zzso structure consists of two distinct zzso The zzso zzso domain contains the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso organized in a protein fold that differs significantly from any known zzso zzso or protein zzso The zzso zzso domain displays structural similarity to zzso zzso zzso and provides essential elements that contribute to zzso recognition and may also regulate the structure of the zzso binding zzso
