We report here the identification and characterization of a novel zzso zzso referred to as zzso based on its apparent molecular weight and zzso zzso zzso was identified through a zzso zzso screen during the course of searching for proteins interacting with zzso a zzso zzso core zzso zzso exhibited two alternative spliced zzso generated by differential usage of the translation start site with the longer one, zzso initiating at first zzso and the zzso zzso starting from zzso zzso Three distinct motifs can be discerned in the zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso enriched domain, zzso a zzso stretch, and zzso a potential zzso zzso signal zzso a long array of basic zzso zzso zzso message was translated in zzso patterns with both zzso expressed at comparable levels in zzso showing zzso zzso zzso analysis with an zzso zzso as well as an experiment using zzso zzso demonstrated that zzso was localized in zzso and nuclear zzso zzso pull-down zzso showed that zzso zzso physically with zzso Using zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso as zzso reporter zzso we found that zzso modulated alternative zzso and 3' zzso in zzso Together, zzso may participate directly in zzso regulation or indirectly through interaction with zzso Studies on this novel zzso regulator may provide new information on the intricate zzso machinery as related to the zzso metabolism involving processing of zzso and zzso
