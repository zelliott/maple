Animal models of zzso diseases have been instrumental in advancing our understanding of zzso in zzso zzso arthritis zzso in mice is an zzso disease model of zzso zzso zzso to zzso in mice is linked to genes of the major zzso complex zzso zzso T cells that express the zzso zzso zzso zzso and/or zzso play a key role in the zzso of arthritis in the zzso mouse zzso We identified an zzso mouse strain, zzso zzso that is resistant to arthritis induction and exhibits a zzso deletion of certain zzso gene zzso We report a novel zzso chain zzso method for the rapid identification of new mouse strains that exhibit zzso zzso gene zzso We mapped for the first time both the zzso and 3' zzso of the zzso deletion in the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso strains to within zzso zzso Since there is an association between a particular zzso zzso zzso and arthritis zzso in zzso mouse zzso we examined the zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso members between the zzso zzso mouse and the zzso zzso mouse zzso The zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso differ at two positions zzso 18 and zzso zzso the resistance of zzso mouse to arthritis induction may be due in part to zzso coding sequence zzso and zzso gene segment zzso as we have recently demonstrated in the case of zzso mouse zzso
