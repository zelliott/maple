At least 30 G zzso receptors stimulate zzso zzso zzso zzso C zzso zzso zzso through G protein zzso to release zzso calcium from the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell 80, zzso Although both G alpha and G beta gamma G protein zzso have been shown to activate zzso zzso beta in zzso G alpha zzso has been presumed to mediate the zzso zzso response in zzso In this study, we show that G beta gamma plays a dominant role in zzso zzso of zzso beta by employing the zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso to G alpha zzso blocked the zzso signal zzso by zzso interaction of the zzso zzso with the G zzso Agents that specifically bound free G beta gamma zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso zzso inhibited zzso signal zzso to zzso zzso and injection of G beta gamma zzso into zzso directly induced release of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso zzso specificity of the G alpha zzso beta gamma zzso is determined by G alpha zzso G beta gamma is the zzso signaling zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
