zzso leaf development requires highly regulated cell zzso zzso and expansion zzso We identified zzso zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso locus in zzso zzso a model zzso species with zzso adult zzso zzso encodes an zzso zzso carrier protein and is the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso distribution is impaired in the zzso zzso resulting in zzso zzso in different zzso The most striking change in zzso is the increase in the number of terminal leaflets and a simultaneous reduction in the number of lateral zzso accompanied by reduced expression of zzso zzso zzso an zzso of zzso zzso of the zzso indicates that distinct zzso zzso exist in the formation of terminal and lateral zzso In contrast with the zzso compound leaves in the wild type, the zzso zzso double zzso shows zzso zzso leaves, suggesting that the terminal leaflet zzso in zzso zzso has a unique zzso zzso Further investigations on the development of leaf zzso reveal different zzso between zzso zzso and marginal zzso formation as well as between zzso and leaflet zzso These data suggest that regulation of the zzso of compound leaves and zzso is context dependent and tightly correlated with the zzso module in zzso zzso
