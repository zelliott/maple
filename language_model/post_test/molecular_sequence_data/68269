zzso zzso are characterized by considerable difference in zzso zzso even though the primary structures are well zzso among the zzso from zzso plants, and zzso The higher plant zzso zzso designated as type L exhibits low affinity for a large, highly zzso zzso zzso presumably due to zzso hindrance caused by a unique zzso zzso located beside the mouth of the zzso zzso whereas another zzso without the zzso zzso as type zzso shows very high affinity for both linear and zzso zzso Using the zzso type L zzso from potato zzso as a starting framework and aiming at altering its zzso zzso we have genetically engineered the zzso zzso and its zzso zzso zzso removal of the zzso and connection of the newly formed zzso and zzso yielded a totally inactive zzso although the protein was produced in zzso coli cells in a soluble zzso zzso a zzso zzso in which the zzso zzso and its zzso regions are replaced by the corresponding region of the type H zzso has been shown to exhibit high affinity for zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso & Fukui, zzso 1993, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso but when two and four zzso zzso in the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso were zzso back to those of the type L zzso the resulting zzso showed significantly lowered affinity for zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
