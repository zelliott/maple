Human zzso zzso zzso has been shown to exist as three zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in their zzso sequence and displaying different patterns of zzso zzso We report here the cloning of zzso a novel zzso of 767 zzso zzso which is generated from the same gene via the existence of an additional promoter located upstream from the third zzso of the zzso zzso zzso converting activity is comparable to that of the other three zzso In contrast to zzso zzso is expressed at the cell surface, although less strongly than zzso We have also zzso by identifying zzso and zzso in zzso that the zzso diversity is zzso between human and zzso suggesting its zzso zzso The zzso levels of the four zzso were assessed in the two species in various cell types, revealing some zzso In particular, the zzso zzso strongly expressed at the plasma zzso was found to be highly expressed in primary cultures of zzso cells but absent from primary cultures of smooth muscle zzso
