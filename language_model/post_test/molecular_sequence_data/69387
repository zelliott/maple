zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso rats was injected zzso with zzso zzso dissolved in corn zzso In rats of all zzso the zzso concentration of zzso zzso zzso zzso was increased at 48 and 96 h after the treatment with zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso was increased by zzso in zzso rats and zzso zzso rats but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso increased 72 and 96 h after the injection with zzso in zzso and zzso zzso rats but not in zzso zzso zzso zzso hours after the injection with zzso the zzso concentration of zzso acid in zzso rats was zzso higher than that in the corresponding control group, whereas in zzso and zzso zzso rats the increases were 70 and zzso zzso zzso rats and zzso zzso rats were also injected daily for 3 d with sodium zzso In rats of both zzso the activity and zzso concentration of zzso zzso and liver and urine zzso acid concentration were increased by sodium zzso The data indicate that the stimulation of the expression of both the zzso and zzso zzso genes plays a key role in the zzso acid zzso induced by zzso and sodium zzso
