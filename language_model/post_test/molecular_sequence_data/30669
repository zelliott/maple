We constructed zzso avian zzso zzso that contain two of the three known types of chicken zzso zzso and a third zzso that contains a truncated zzso zzso We developed zzso that recognize the zzso proteins made by the three transforming zzso zzso All three proteins zzso molecular masses, 50, 60, and 90 zzso are localized primarily in the zzso The proteins are zzso zzso zzso also suggests that there are differences in zzso zzso of the zzso proteins and that zzso protein is associated with condensed zzso in dividing zzso
