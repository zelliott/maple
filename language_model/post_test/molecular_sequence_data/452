Human zzso zzso zzso isolated from cervical and head and neck zzso frequently contain zzso sequence zzso in the viral upstream regulatory region zzso Our study has addressed the role such sequence changes may play in the efficiency of establishing zzso persistence and altered zzso zzso zzso mapping of integrated zzso type 16 zzso zzso from 32 cervical zzso revealed that the viral E6 and zzso zzso as well as the zzso zzso were intact in all of zzso The zzso sequences from integrated and zzso viral DNA were found to harbor distinct sets of zzso zzso A subset of the altered zzso increased the potential of zzso to establish persistent, cell zzso zzso replication in the zzso This aggressive zzso in culture was not solely due to increased viral early gene transcription, but also to zzso initial amplification of the viral zzso As revealed in a novel zzso zzso zzso amplification zzso the altered motifs that led to increased viral zzso from the intact zzso also greatly zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso sequence changes correlate with those previously described in the distinct geographical North American type 1 and Asian-American zzso that are associated with more aggressive disease in zzso studies and zzso but are not limited to, zzso in previously characterized sites for the negative regulatory protein zzso Our results thus provide evidence that zzso zzso in zzso regulatory sequences could serve as potential zzso markers of zzso zzso
