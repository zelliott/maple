The zzso relationships of the type strains of 16 zzso species were investigated by performing a comparative analysis of the sequences of the zzso zzso genes of these zzso The sequence data were analyzed by the zzso method, and each branch was supported by moderate zzso zzso The zzso tree and sequence analyses confirmed that the zzso zzso is composed of species that exhibit considerable zzso and form four zzso that are zzso with members of other zzso such as zzso coli, zzso pneumoniae, and zzso zzso zzso I includes the type strains of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso and zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso II consists of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso III consists of zzso zzso subspecies and zzso zzso and is characterized by the production of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso form the cluster that is most zzso related to other zzso zzso The data from the sequence analyses are discussed in the context of zzso and zzso zzso zzso
