The zzso of zzso and zzso B zzso were examined zzso in the rat brain by the electron zzso zzso were raised against synthetic peptides with the sequences specific to the human zzso type zzso or zzso zzso Both zzso alpha and zzso B zzso were localized in the zzso including the spines and, particularly, the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and the cerebral zzso The zzso fraction prepared from the rat brain contained an activity that inhibited the binding of zzso B to the zzso B DNA zzso These results suggest that the zzso zzso system or a similar mechanism may play a role in signal transmission from zzso to the zzso
