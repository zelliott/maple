The objective of this study was to determine whether zzso zzso DNA injected zzso into chickens expressed the gene of interest in zzso and could be subsequently detected in primary and secondary zzso zzso with zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso zzso protein gene of the standard challenge strain zzso of infectious zzso disease virus zzso was cloned into a zzso zzso and zzso DNA was zzso Fourteen zzso chickens were injected in the zzso zzso with 500 zzso of zzso DNA dissolved in sterile zzso Seven chickens were similarly injected with PBS zzso zzso muscle, zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso were collected at 12, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, and zzso h zzso for detection of protein expression (in zzso and to extract total DNA for zzso amplification of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso was demonstrated in muscle tissue at 12 and 24 h zzso by using an indirect zzso zzso zzso amplification with zzso specific for the zzso gene showed that the DNA was present in the zzso zzso and zzso of zzso but not in zzso zzso These results demonstrate that zzso DNA injected directly into the zzso muscle of chickens is transcribed and translated at the injection site and promptly distributed to primary and secondary zzso zzso
