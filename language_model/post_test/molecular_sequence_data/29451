zzso zzso zzso DNA zzso known as zzso zzso zzso bind specifically to zzso DNA sequences within zzso DNA targets, forming zzso zzso DNA zzso This DNA zzso reaction can be used for zzso gene capture, gene zzso and gene zzso Thus, factors that enhance the efficiency of the zzso reaction are of significant practical zzso We show here that the zzso of a zzso zzso acid zzso within or adjacent to the zzso zzso region significantly enhances the yield of hybrid DNA formed in the reaction between linear zzso DNA targets and zzso zzso complementary zzso zzso zzso The possible mechanisms and the advantages of using zzso zzso filaments in combination with zzso for zzso DNA cloning and zzso are zzso
