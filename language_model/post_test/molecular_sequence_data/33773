With the goal of identifying zzso unknown surface zzso of zzso involved in zzso human zzso recognition and zzso zzso synthetic peptides encompassing the 170 loop zzso in the zzso were tested for selective zzso of zzso human zzso zzso by the zzso zzso zzso Although a zzso zzso exhibited strong zzso a linear zzso with the same zzso or a zzso zzso with a single zzso to zzso zzso showed significantly reduced capabilities of zzso zzso zzso of the 170 loop of the zzso of zzso was then performed to zzso its importance in zzso zzso zzso Some of the 170 loop zzso showed a remarkable decline in zzso without any zzso in apparent zzso affinity zzso as compared with zzso zzso and identified the importance of zzso as well as zzso in the functioning of this zzso zzso these zzso were able to generate zzso activity and zzso zzso in zzso zzso as zzso zzso Moreover, zzso activities of the 170 loop zzso zzso with zzso against zzso as the zzso showed a similar pattern of decline in zzso as that observed in the case of full-length zzso with no zzso change in zzso These results strongly suggest that the 170 loop of the zzso of zzso is important for zzso by the zzso zzso complex, particularly in zzso zzso of zzso although it does not seem to contribute significantly toward zzso affinity per zzso
