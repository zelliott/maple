The human zzso zzso zzso zzso is expressed zzso by zzso zzso and by the zzso that develop from these zzso Previously isolated zzso clones revealed that the core protein contained a large domain consisting of variable numbers of 60 zzso tandem repeats zzso making it an expressed zzso We now report the full zzso sequence of the zzso zzso including zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The gene is composed of 7 zzso and varies in size from approximately 4 to approximately 7 zzso depending on the number of tandem repeats in zzso zzso zzso of zzso was obtained from a zzso clone in an zzso virus based zzso after zzso into a human zzso cell line, indicating the presence of effective regulatory sequences in this zzso
