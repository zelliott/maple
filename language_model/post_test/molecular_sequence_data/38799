The complete zzso acid sequence of zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was determined by tandem mass zzso in combination with zzso acid analysis and zzso sequencing following zzso and zzso zzso zzso The primary structure of the protein was compared with that of zzso PA from zzso zzso zzso zzso with which it is highly zzso Compared with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso differed in 15 out of 108 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso zzso had zzso at zzso 64 and was zzso at the zzso zzso but 25 zzso of the zzso zzso were completely zzso Several zzso acid zzso were found between zzso 51 and 80 zzso zzso although the functionally important sequence of PA was completely zzso The zzso acids zzso of putative zzso sites were zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso which were zzso in all a and zzso of zzso zzso as well as other zzso In addition, zzso and zzso which are thought to form a salt bridge located in the interior of the zzso zzso zzso et zzso (1976) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also zzso in zzso
