zzso requires that an zzso zzso is brought zzso to the 3' end of a specific transfer zzso In zzso coli zzso zzso the first 368 zzso acids zzso a domain for zzso synthesis while sequences on the zzso side of this domain are required for much of the zzso binding zzso The 3' end of zzso coli zzso has been zzso to the zzso and sequence analysis showed that zzso is the major site of zzso A zzso zzso with a zzso replacement has a zzso reduced zzso (with respect to zzso for zzso but has a relatively small zzso of its kinetic parameters for zzso and zzso in the zzso synthesis zzso The data provide evidence that the 3' end of zzso binds to a site in the zzso domain responsible for zzso synthesis and that a zzso zzso in this domain is important for a zzso step that is subsequent to the synthesis of the zzso zzso
