The iron storage zzso zzso in plants can occur in multiple molecular forms that, until now, were proposed to be derived from degradation of a single mature zzso zzso zzso which is assembled into the zzso and functions in zzso We have carried out some definitive experiments with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso which show that there are functioning genes for three different zzso zzso in the developing zzso zzso segments of zzso which code for zzso with substantially different mature sequences were detected by zzso Separate genes for each zzso were found by showing that each gene contained a unique zzso Thus, multiple molecular forms of zzso can arise through differential expression of a family of genes in zzso
