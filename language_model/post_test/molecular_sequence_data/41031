We report a new zzso in the human zzso gene that causes early onset zzso zzso syndrome zzso 

Two brothers of Finnish origin presented with an unusual combination of early onset zzso zzso syndrome, a disease which was associated with cardiac zzso zzso zzso zzso male zzso anomalies and zzso zzso type zzso zzso of a zzso syndrome prompted sequencing of the human zzso zzso 

zzso of the human zzso gene showed a zzso single zzso zzso deletion in zzso 63 coding zzso in zzso 6, which does not immediately cause zzso acid change but leads 11 zzso acids later to a stop zzso and to premature termination of the zzso This zzso protein is located in the inner zzso membrane and has been shown to function as a zzso zzso 

This is the first clinical report of zzso syndrome, a human zzso zzso that is related to cases of severe zzso zzso diagnosed in zzso zzso zzso causes a relatively specific finding in urinary organic acid analysis zzso zzso type zzso which together with the clinical features of the ensuing cardiac disease, allows for effective screening before zzso molecular genetic zzso
