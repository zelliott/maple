Two zzso libraries from zzso zzso DNA constructed with the zzso zzso zzso and zzso 3 were screened with zzso raised against zzso zzso Two clones giving the strongest reaction in the zzso were analyzed further, one was a zzso zzso clone with an insert of zzso zzso and one was a zzso zzso clone with an insert of approximately 11,000 zzso zzso coli cells infected with the zzso zzso clone expressed the alpha zzso of the zzso zzso zzso whereas with the zzso zzso zzso the alpha and beta zzso zzso zzso were detected on Western zzso zzso fragments of both clones were zzso in zzso 8 and zzso by the chain termination zzso Thus the complete sequence of the genes of both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso The genes have the following order: zzso with an zzso region of only 2 zzso The deduced zzso acid sequences for the alpha and beta zzso were confirmed by four peptides zzso by protein chemical zzso Both chains are extremely rich in zzso (13 in zzso including a zzso and two zzso zzso and nine in zzso but no similarities to other known protein sequences were zzso
