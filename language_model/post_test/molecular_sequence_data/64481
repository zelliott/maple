zzso (a zzso and zzso family members with zzso or zzso gene expression are divided zzso into two groups: zzso 2, 3, 5, 27, and 32 (the first zzso and zzso 4, 6, 20, 21, 24, 25, 26, 29, 30, and 34 (the second zzso We cloned and zzso zzso for previously unidentified mouse Adams that belong to the second zzso We found that all the Adam genes in the second zzso group are transcribed by both zzso and germ cells in mouse zzso representing a unique expression pattern different from that of the zzso zzso zzso analyses revealed that all the zzso Adam genes lack zzso interrupting zzso sequences and many of them are present as zzso zzso resulting in total of 14 functional mouse genes in this zzso zzso Comparing the mouse and human zzso zzso we found that a number of these mouse Adam genes do not have human zzso and, even if they exist, some zzso are zzso in zzso These results suggest the differential expansion of the zzso Adam genes in the mouse zzso during evolution and a relationship between these Adams and male reproduction unique to zzso
