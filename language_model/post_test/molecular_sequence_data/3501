The zzso of zzso wheat lines were analyzed by zzso zzso random amplified zzso DNA zzso and random amplified zzso zzso zzso Lines zzso and zzso were obtained by three zzso and line zzso by four zzso of the zzso hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 29) with different common wheat zzso These lines proved to be zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso line zzso zzso zzso 43 + zzso was obtained after a second zzso of the hybrid zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with the variety zzso zzso The zzso patterns of zzso and zzso contained fragments present only in the patterns of the parental wheat varieties and, in addition, fragments absent from the zzso This zzso from the pattern of zzso was zzso Analysis of its primary structure showed that the difference between zzso and the parental wheat zzso may be related to a zzso that had occurred during the development of the zzso line at the binding site of an arbitrary zzso The zzso of plants of the lines zzso and zzso contain, in addition to the zzso fragments of zzso those characteristic of zzso zzso revealed higher zzso level among wheat varieties than that detected by zzso The zzso patterns of the lines zzso zzso and zzso contained fragments specific for zzso and the patterns of zzso contained both wheat and barley zzso
