zzso are central zzso in zzso signal zzso and programmed cell zzso To meet their diverse functional demands, their shape is strictly regulated by a growing family of proteins that impinge on zzso and fusion of the zzso zzso fusion depends on zzso zzso 1 and 2, two integral zzso zzso Although zzso seems primarily involved in the regulation of the zzso and fusion of the zzso mounting evidence is implicating zzso in multiple signaling pathways not restricted to the regulation of zzso zzso Here we review data supporting a role for this zzso protein beyond fusion, in regulating zzso zzso zzso shape of other zzso and even progression through cell zzso In conclusion, zzso appears a zzso protein whose zzso function is not restricted to the regulation of zzso zzso
