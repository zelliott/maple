The zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso has been cloned and expressed in zzso coli zzso zzso as a fusion protein containing an zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso showed an apparent molecular mass of 160 zzso on zzso and a specific activity of zzso zzso when zzso in the presence of calf zzso DNA and the four zzso zzso This activity was inhibited by zzso a specific inhibitor of zzso To facilitate kinetic studies, and zzso zzso a zzso zzso DNA zzso was used as a zzso The minimum requirement for the length of the zzso was a zzso zzso primer zzso to a zzso zzso zzso activity was detected either by a zzso format or by a novel homogeneous zzso proximity zzso zzso zzso to zzso by zzso zzso was improved by incorporating three zzso in the template strand as the first 3 bases to be copied by the zzso zzso of zzso activity by zzso by the zzso and zzso methods gave comparable results, but the zzso zzso uses less radioactive label, is less zzso and is amenable to zzso zzso
