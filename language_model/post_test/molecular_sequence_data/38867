zzso is an ubiquitous zzso that in zzso zzso the transfer of a sulfur atom from suitable donors to zzso zzso by way of a double displacement zzso During the zzso process the zzso cycles between a zzso and a zzso form, via formation of a zzso linkage to a zzso zzso zzso In the zzso bacteria zzso zzso the zzso gene has been identified and the zzso protein functionally characterized as a zzso The crystal structure of the zzso zzso zzso has been determined and refined at zzso A resolution in the zzso and zzso zzso Conservation of the overall three-dimensional fold of bovine zzso is observed, with substantial modifications of the protein structure in the proximity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso the native zzso is found as the zzso zzso in the zzso state the zzso zzso zzso adopts two alternate zzso reflected by zzso of the neighboring zzso zzso which is associated with a partly zzso loss of zzso zzso zzso The zzso mechanism of zzso zzso zzso relies primarily on the zzso zzso of the 230 to 235 zzso loop and on a surrounding strong positive zzso zzso zzso recognition is based on zzso which are entirely different in the zzso and zzso zzso The zzso loop of zzso zzso zzso displays striking structural similarity to the zzso loop of the similarly folded zzso domain of dual specific zzso zzso suggesting a common evolutionary origin of the two zzso zzso
