To evaluate the ability of zzso zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso zzso zzso zzso T zzso zzso to recognize and lyse zzso cells, we have constructed a human cell line zzso expressing both the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso major zzso complex zzso class I zzso This cell line can be zzso infected with zzso and can also function as a target for zzso zzso class I zzso zzso directed against the envelope zzso of zzso zzso The ability of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to specifically recognize and lyse zzso target cells infected with divergent zzso strains was tested by using both zzso and clinical zzso zzso zzso generated by zzso of mice with zzso cells expressing either the native or zzso zzso zzso zzso envelope zzso from zzso zzso were able to recognize and specifically lyse zzso target cells infected with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso II, zzso and zzso as well as several zzso clinical zzso These results demonstrate that zzso zzso for zzso zzso exist outside the zzso zzso region, zzso zzso zzso zzso appear to recognize common zzso on diverse zzso zzso and zzso of zzso strains based on zzso zzso zzso does not appear to zzso to zzso recognition and zzso The results suggest that the zzso components of the immune system may have a broader recognition of divergent zzso strains than do the zzso zzso
