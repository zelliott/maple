zzso zzso protein zzso is a candidate hypertension gene initially identified by differential zzso and implicated in zzso mechanisms of salt retention and high blood zzso We report the molecular characterization of rat zzso B zzso and zzso through sequence analysis and an zzso zzso chain reaction primer zzso that zzso but not zzso is expressed in rat zzso zzso is an zzso zzso zzso that interacts with zzso initiation factor zzso an important regulator of protein translation and a central component of the zzso zzso stress response to zzso or zzso zzso Active zzso transport of sodium is increased in the spontaneously zzso rat zzso and there is evidence that this zzso with zzso and zzso depletion in the zzso zzso In the present studies we have examined expression of zzso in rat zzso zzso which contributes to the increased zzso sodium zzso in this model of zzso We report that zzso transcript abundance is significantly elevated in zzso convoluted zzso from zzso compared with the control zzso zzso This zzso occurs in zzso animals and precedes the development of hypertension, indicating that it is not a simple response to hypertension in zzso Further, zzso expression is also higher in a zzso zzso cell line derived from zzso compared with a similar line derived from zzso rats, indicating that this difference is genetically zzso No sequence differences were observed in the zzso zzso from these 2 zzso These observations suggest that a genetically determined zzso in zzso zzso from zzso occurs that leads to increased expression of zzso In view of evidence linking zzso to the regulation of zzso initiation zzso the zzso of zzso may result from zzso zzso
