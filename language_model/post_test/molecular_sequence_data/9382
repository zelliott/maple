Genome sequencing continues to be a rapidly evolving technology, yet most downstream aspects of zzso zzso pipelines remain relatively stable or are even being zzso The zzso process is now performed almost exclusively in an automated fashion to balance the large number of sequences zzso One possible way of reducing errors inherent to automated zzso zzso is to apply data from zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to the zzso zzso with a zzso zzso Here, the concept of zzso refinement has been extended to include a comparative assessment of zzso across closely related zzso zzso and zzso data derived from highly similar zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was used to demonstrate a comprehensive comparative zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso validated the expression of nearly zzso of each zzso predicted zzso and revealed the identification of 28 novel and 68 incorrect zzso observed zzso extended start sites, and translated zzso zzso sequences within the three current zzso zzso Gene loss is presumed to play a major role in zzso zzso acquiring its niche as a virulent zzso thus the discovery of many translated zzso including the zzso zzso underscores a need for functional analyses to investigate hypotheses related to zzso zzso included the discovery of a seemingly essential zzso zzso several zzso factors, a zzso regulator, and many hypothetical proteins that were missed during zzso
