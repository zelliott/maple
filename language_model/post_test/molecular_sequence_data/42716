The zzso zzso receives zzso projections from zzso of the nucleus zzso at the base of the zzso zzso These zzso contain zzso hormone zzso zzso material and are zzso to retinal zzso zzso zzso We have incubated isolated zzso zzso and zzso preparations of roach with zzso and found an increase in horizontal cell zzso numbers to zzso zzso zzso This effect was blocked by addition of zzso to the incubation medium suggesting that zzso acts via stimulation of the zzso zzso zzso We conclude that zzso containing zzso zzso are capable of inducing zzso changes in the zzso and discuss their implication in the control of zzso zzso
