The zzso induced by zzso given zzso has been previously demonstrated to be zzso by the release of zzso acting on zzso receptors in the spinal zzso The present study was designed to determine what type of zzso receptors in the spinal zzso is involved in zzso zzso in the zzso zzso was induced by zzso zzso zzso given into nucleus zzso zzso and was assessed by the zzso test in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a selective delta zzso zzso zzso given zzso zzso attenuated zzso zzso of the zzso zzso On the other hand, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso selective delta zzso zzso and zzso zzso antagonists, respectively, did not block zzso zzso The results of present study in rats are consistent with previous experiments in mice indicating that spinal delta zzso but not delta zzso zzso or zzso receptors are involved in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso
