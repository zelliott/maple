zzso protects cells from zzso initiated by a variety of stimuli including loss of cell zzso Mice deficient in zzso zzso develop zzso zzso zzso a condition that leads to significant morbidity and mortality in zzso The precise mechanism of action of zzso has not been zzso zzso may merely facilitate survival of precursor cells and/or may play a more zzso role during zzso by interacting with other proteins such as zzso Recent work in this laboratory demonstrated that zzso directly associates with zzso The data presented here demonstrate that the zzso zzso 4 zzso domain, specifically zzso acids zzso is necessary for the zzso interaction with zzso zzso also associated with the zzso zzso of more closely related zzso family members, zzso and zzso compared with that from the zzso zzso zzso zzso 21 and 28 in the zzso zzso domain were essential for interaction with zzso In embryonic kidney organ culture, incubation with the zzso zzso domain resulted in zzso of zzso bud zzso zzso these data suggest that the interaction of zzso with zzso plays an important role during zzso
