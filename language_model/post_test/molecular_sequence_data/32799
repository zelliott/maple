A current focus of zzso research is the establishment of acceptable confidence measures in the assignment of protein identifications in an unknown zzso Development of new zzso approaches would greatly benefit from a standard reference set of zzso for known proteins for the purpose of testing and zzso Here we describe an openly available library of mass zzso generated on an zzso zzso zzso zzso from 246 known, individually zzso and zzso protein zzso The initial full release of the zzso zzso includes gel images, peak lists, zzso search result files, decoy database analysis files, zzso file of protein zzso manual zzso and summary pages describing protein coverage and peptides matched by zzso followed by decoy database analysis using zzso zzso and zzso The data are publicly available for use at zzso
