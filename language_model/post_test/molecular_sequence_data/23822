zzso zzso zzso the precursors of eight zzso and two zzso basic proteins zzso were isolated from the liver of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso and zzso genes have three zzso like zzso zzso The promoter regions of these genes are highly zzso and contain the consensus zzso zzso sites for zzso zzso zzso site, zzso and zzso suggesting that these genes are regulated using similar zzso zzso The zzso and zzso regions of these genes share a high degree of zzso sequence identity, but except for the signal zzso domain the zzso regions are much more diversified than zzso The ratio of zzso to synonymous substitution is higher than one, reflecting that zzso selection occurred during the evolution of zzso and zzso zzso zzso trees separate zzso and zzso into two zzso suggesting that the zzso gene and the zzso gene zzso earlier before the appearance of numerous zzso and zzso
