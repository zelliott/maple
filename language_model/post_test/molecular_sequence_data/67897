zzso is a zzso containing zzso factor regulating cardiac formation and function, and its zzso are linked to zzso heart zzso Here we provide the first report of the crystal structure of the zzso zzso in complex with zzso DNA of its zzso target, locating within the zzso promoter zzso site of the zzso zzso factor zzso The crystal structure, determined at zzso zzso resolution, demonstrates that zzso zzso occupy both DNA binding sites separated by five zzso without physical interaction between zzso The two zzso show identical zzso despite the differences in the DNA sequences they zzso and no significant zzso of the DNA was zzso zzso absolutely zzso in zzso family zzso mediates zzso interaction with the zzso zzso This high resolution crystal structure of zzso protein provides a detailed picture of protein and DNA zzso which allows us to predict DNA binding of zzso identified in human zzso
