zzso and zzso beta are major zzso in zzso diabetes zzso zzso and the zzso respectively, of a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso with zzso zzso In the present study, by zzso acid sequencing of zzso zzso and zzso zzso we determined the zzso zzso sites involved in the generation of these zzso Both zzso sites are immediately after an zzso zzso at position zzso for zzso and position zzso for zzso zzso The resulting zzso fragments are zzso and 307 zzso acids in length and retain their ability to react with zzso zzso In contrast to zzso and zzso zzso other members of the protein zzso zzso zzso family zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are completely susceptible to zzso by zzso zzso analysis revealed five zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso beta that are not present in other zzso Reduction and zzso of zzso and zzso beta zzso proteins resulted in loss of both resistance to zzso by zzso and zzso with zzso in zzso zzso It is concluded that zzso bond formation plays a critical role in the maintenance of zzso structure and that the zzso to zzso beta in zzso zzso recognize zzso zzso
