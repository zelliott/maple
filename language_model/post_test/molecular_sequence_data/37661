The zzso is the primary organ responsible for the production of mature zzso alpha zzso beta T zzso zzso of a DNA zzso circle that is produced during zzso zzso termed a signal joint zzso zzso zzso circle zzso can be used as a measure of zzso zzso Here zzso measurement has been applied to two monkey species used as animal models of human disease, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis determined that the zzso zzso zzso leading to zzso formation occurs in both zzso zzso to a DNA sequence zzso in zzso zzso and humans were used in a quantitative competitive zzso zzso to zzso zzso We found that as in humans, zzso in these two monkey species decline with zzso zzso are first generated in zzso during the early stages of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cells contain more zzso than peripheral blood T cell zzso suggesting that recent zzso zzso home to the zzso zzso The zzso level is significantly higher within the peripheral blood zzso and zzso T cells of zzso compared to zzso zzso of the zzso in four zzso led to a profound decrease in peripheral blood zzso level by 1 year zzso indicating the lack of a significant zzso source of peripheral zzso T cells in zzso Our results indicate that production, trafficking, and proliferation of recent zzso zzso in these two monkey species represents a useful animal model system for understanding human zzso zzso
