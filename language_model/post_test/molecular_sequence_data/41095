zzso responsive element binding proteins zzso are members of a larger family of zzso factors, many of which have been reported to contribute to plant responses to zzso stresses in several zzso zzso little is known about their role in potato zzso zzso This report describes zzso and characterization of a zzso zzso factor zzso zzso isolated from potato zzso plants submitted to salt zzso Based on a multiple sequence zzso this protein was classified into the zzso group of zzso zzso zzso studies revealed that zzso was induced in leaves, roots and stems upon various zzso stresses and in response to zzso treatment with zzso acid zzso In agreement with this expression pattern, zzso of zzso in transgenic potato plants resulted in enhanced tolerance to salt zzso These data suggest that the isolated zzso encodes a functional protein involved in plant response to different zzso zzso An zzso mobility shift zzso zzso indicated that the zzso protein bound specifically to the zzso core element zzso zzso Moreover, zzso quantitative zzso analysis revealed that the transcript level of a putative target gene zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso in transgenic plants submitted to salt stress zzso A zzso increase in zzso zzso was also observed under these zzso Taking together, all these data suggest that zzso takes part in the processes underlying plant responses to zzso stresses probably via the regulation of zzso hormone signaling and through a mechanism allowing zzso zzso
