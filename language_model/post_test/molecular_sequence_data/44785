zzso factor 1, a member of the zzso zzso factor 1 zzso zzso of nuclear zzso is a key regulator in zzso zzso From an embryonic complementary DNA library, the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and an alternatively spliced zzso zzso were zzso zzso represented a zzso truncated version of zzso Whole mount in zzso zzso and reverse zzso analysis revealed that both zzso and B transcripts were present in the developing zzso adult fish brain, zzso and liver, albeit zzso zzso zzso was absent in zzso zzso of the primary sequences of zzso with those of other zzso zzso members showed a close structural relationship between the mouse liver zzso zzso which activated the zzso gene in zzso zzso However, similar to mouse zzso factor 1, zzso regulated zzso salmon zzso zzso zzso gene zzso On the contrary, zzso which could bind a consensus zzso element with an affinity similar to that of zzso lacked both the zzso function and synergistic interaction with the zzso zzso Furthermore, zzso studies in zzso cells showed that zzso was a strong competitor for the action of zzso on the zzso salmon zzso zzso zzso gene zzso Our investigation suggests that 1) zzso represents an zzso protein of the zzso zzso zzso 2) the zzso relationship between zzso and zzso may dictate the expression of the zzso target genes in a variety of zzso including the zzso and 3) the naturally occurring zzso provides evidence that the zzso portion of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso contains a major zzso function and a zzso zzso
