A zzso zzso zzso I gene from tomato containing 725 zzso of the zzso region and zzso zzso of the 3' region was zzso incorporated into the zzso of black zzso plants zzso zzso using an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso plants were selected that expressed the tomato zzso I protein in leaf zzso The leaves of the plants contained zzso levels of the inhibitor protein of up to 60 zzso zzso These levels increased by a factor of about two in response to severe zzso Only leaves and zzso exhibited the presence of the zzso indicating that the gene exhibited the same tissue specificity of expression found in zzso in wounded tomato zzso zzso I was extracted from leaves of wounded transformed zzso plants and was partially zzso by affinity zzso on a zzso zzso The zzso protein was identical to the native tomato zzso I in its zzso zzso and in its zzso activity against zzso The protein exhibited the same Mr of 8 zzso as the native tomato zzso I and its zzso zzso acid sequence was identical to that of the native tomato inhibitor I, indicating that the protein was properly processed in zzso zzso These experiments are the first report of the expression of a member of the zzso tomato zzso I gene family in transgenic zzso The results demonstrate that the gene contains elements that can be regulated in a zzso zzso manner in zzso zzso
