In this study, we compare the efficiency of zzso zzso from zzso sources with and without the highly modified zzso zzso base in the zzso position of its zzso and zzso zzso from zzso which naturally lacks Q base, to promote zzso Interestingly, no differences in the ability of the two zzso zzso zzso to promote zzso were observed, while zzso zzso promoted zzso more efficiently than its zzso counterparts in both rabbit zzso zzso and wheat germ zzso The zzso of zzso zzso zzso is therefore not due, or at least not completely, to the lack of Q base and most likely the zzso resides in structural differences elsewhere in the zzso However, we cannot absolutely rule out a role of Q base in zzso as wheat germ extracts and a zzso depleted of most of its zzso and supplemented with calf liver zzso contain both zzso zzso with or without Q zzso
