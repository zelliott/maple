zzso are key zzso of various zzso functions, including zzso survival, and synaptic zzso but the molecules that regulate their zzso are poorly zzso We isolated a clone that is predominantly expressed in zzso cells of zzso developing mouse zzso which turned out to be a zzso of zzso zzso zzso protein for zzso and named zzso zzso is enriched on zzso structures of zzso parallel fiber terminals of zzso cells connecting zzso spines of zzso cell zzso zzso factions zzso by the zzso zzso from mouse zzso contained significant amounts of zzso zzso zzso zzso factor zzso and zzso B but not marker proteins for synaptic zzso zzso and zzso In zzso primary cultures, zzso zzso zzso are primarily zzso with those of zzso and zzso and near those of a zzso marker, zzso zzso around zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso expressed zzso enhanced release of zzso zzso and zzso from zzso cells and zzso zzso from cultured zzso cells in a zzso zzso Moreover, the zzso of zzso in zzso cells promotes the survival of zzso cells in zzso zzso Thus, we suggest that zzso mediates the zzso release of zzso and zzso from zzso cells, leading to regulation in cell differentiation and survival during zzso zzso
