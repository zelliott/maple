zzso of zzso across the zzso zzso membrane is zzso by the zzso zzso zzso 1 zzso We have demonstrated previously that expression of human zzso zzso is responsive to zzso and that this involves the dual control of zzso gene zzso and stability of the zzso zzso Here we describe the structural organization of the human zzso zzso and report the isolation and characterization of the zzso gene zzso The zzso gene spans approximately 44 zzso and is organized as 5 zzso intervened by 4 zzso The first of these zzso is located in the zzso DNA, spans zzso zzso and thus accounts for approximately zzso of the entire zzso zzso Analysis of a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso region, shows an absence of the classical zzso zzso However, the region contains potential binding sites for a variety of zzso factors with known association with zzso action in the zzso In transient zzso the zzso region drives high-level expression of a zzso zzso in cells that zzso express zzso zzso analyses indicate that the zzso elements necessary for zzso zzso of zzso are contained within the zzso zzso sequence of the zzso
