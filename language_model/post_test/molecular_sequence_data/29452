Unlike most zzso zzso the zzso zzso coli protein zzso demonstrates high specificity for its zzso zzso zzso in zzso Here we describe several zzso designed to characterize the interaction of zzso with its zzso and zzso zzso zzso mobility shift zzso reveal a zzso binding affinity for a 153 zzso zzso zzso zzso derived from the zzso zzso High affinity zzso binding requires both hairpin 92 and zzso 90, as zzso lacking these structures bind zzso with lower zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso binding zzso provide binding zzso for zzso and zzso to zzso with and without zzso zzso These data have been used to describe a minimal zzso scheme for the binding of the zzso and zzso zzso to zzso which reveals cooperative binding between larger zzso and zzso with cooperative energies of approximately zzso zzso zzso This zzso is lost upon removal of zzso 89 from zzso suggesting this zzso is either the preferred target for zzso zzso activity or is a necessary structural element for organization of the target site within zzso
