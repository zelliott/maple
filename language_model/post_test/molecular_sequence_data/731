zzso are zzso composed of zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso The zzso can be zzso by zzso zzso which cleave the zzso using a zzso zzso Two such zzso have previously been identified in the soil zzso zzso zzso as zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso In this work, we describe the properties of three new zzso from this zzso zzso zzso and zzso all of which belong to the zzso family of zzso zzso One of the zzso zzso also contains a zzso module similar to those of proteins zzso by a type I zzso system, and its activity is zzso by zzso All three zzso preferably cleave the bond between zzso acid and zzso acid, resulting in a zzso acid zzso at the new reducing end, but zzso also degrades the other three possible bonds in zzso zzso containing interrupted versions of zzso zzso and zzso were constructed, and their zzso were zzso zzso pure zzso zzso were not zzso suggesting that this gene product may be important for the zzso during zzso zzso After zzso cultures from the zzso zzso form a large zzso containing zzso indicating that zzso is involved in the release of zzso from the zzso Upon encountering adverse growth conditions, zzso zzso will form a resting stage called zzso zzso is a necessary part of the protective zzso coat, and we show here that strains lacking zzso zzso poorly compared to zzso zzso
