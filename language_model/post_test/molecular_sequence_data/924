We isolated zzso genes from a zzso DNA library of the zzso strain of zzso zzso zzso and walked on zzso The present study is the first demonstration of the full-length structure of zzso gene locus in the zzso Two gene clusters were zzso One cluster of 36 zzso consisted of nine zzso genes and two zzso Based on structural and zzso similarity of zzso acid zzso the cluster was named embryonic zzso gene cluster zzso The orientation of the genes was in zzso The other cluster of 20 zzso contained three zzso genes zzso and was named adult zzso gene cluster zzso zzso linkage analysis clarified that E1 and A1 were mapped on linkage groups 8 and 19, zzso The E1 cluster included other genes zzso to human zzso clone zzso zzso zzso and protein 14 zzso zzso while the A1 cluster linked to zzso zzso zzso The expression patterns of the genes were classified into four zzso zzso expression zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in zzso to young fish zzso zzso zzso and zzso expression in young to adult fish zzso and zzso and successive expression in zzso to adult zzso
