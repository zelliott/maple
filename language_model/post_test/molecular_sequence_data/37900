The major function of the zzso zzso is to zzso zzso specificity to T zzso However, nascent zzso proteins that are not assembled into functional zzso may be processed and displayed with self zzso molecules on the zzso surface, and are thought to be the genesis of zzso T cells that can limit inflammatory responses through zzso network zzso In previous work, we and others have exploited this natural regulatory system using zzso peptides to amplify regulatory T cells that potentially can treat human zzso diseases such as multiple sclerosis zzso and zzso The development of this approach is limited by the diversity of human zzso V gene zzso and by lack of knowledge of exactly which regions of the V gene proteins are zzso in association with various zzso zzso To identify similar zzso acid sequences within and among human V gene families that might have zzso cross zzso we aligned 74 known zzso and 109 known zzso protein sequences into zzso groups using the zzso zzso Moreover, with a focus on zzso peptides that have previously been used to induce regulatory T cells in clinical trials, we established zzso zzso groups, and then identified the optimal zzso acid motifs for binding to two zzso zzso and zzso that have been associated with zzso to zzso From this analysis, zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso sequences were predicted to bind with at least moderate zzso to each of the zzso zzso thus enhancing the likelihood that they could be zzso Further ordering of putative zzso contact zzso revealed a different set of zzso zzso including many zzso sequence matches and some zzso matches that might allow zzso cross zzso Particularly striking were zzso zzso and zzso motifs shared by zzso zzso and zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso family members, respectively, and zzso zzso and zzso motifs shared by zzso zzso and zzso and zzso and zzso family members, zzso This analysis may be useful in designing an array of clinically useful zzso peptides with optimal zzso binding properties and highly zzso zzso binding zzso
