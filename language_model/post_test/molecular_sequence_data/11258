The zzso factors zzso zzso zzso zzso protein 1) and zzso originally cloned and zzso in various zzso species, have been implicated in the regulation of the Lea zzso zzso group 1 zzso We have investigated the zzso of the levels of these zzso in barley during zzso and in developing zzso subjected to various kinds of zzso zzso The zzso of zzso for zzso and zzso zzso factors, using zzso cloned from zzso starts at 10 and 15 days after zzso respectively, whereas Lea zzso zzso levels are very low or zzso until 25 days after zzso during normal zzso The zzso zzso is predominantly induced in zzso immature zzso zzso zzso was not significantly modulated by zzso salt or zzso zzso of zzso zzso by zzso showed that the induction of both zzso and zzso zzso was zzso In zzso zzso cells, neither of the two transcripts would be induced by zzso or zzso stress, although both zzso and one member of the Lea zzso family was zzso by zzso zzso mobility shift zzso using a Lea zzso probe with an zzso zzso zzso zzso similar to that which binds zzso and zzso in the wheat and rice zzso promoters show that the binding activity is increased by zzso and zzso zzso Taken together, these data show that both zzso and zzso are involved in zzso signal zzso zzso that they are zzso regulated at the zzso level, and that zzso can be induced by zzso stress independently of any increase in zzso zzso The difference in zzso regulation patterns of zzso and zzso may suggest that they are involved in different signal zzso pathways in connection with zzso zzso regulation of Lea zzso
