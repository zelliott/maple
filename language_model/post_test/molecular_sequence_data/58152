As part of a study of the diversity of zzso we have cloned a zzso zzso a zzso protein from zzso zzso This is the first molecular motor of any kind to be cloned from a higher zzso The predicted zzso zzso weight 131 zzso has a motor domain zzso very similar to those of other zzso but the remainder of the sequence is zzso The tail contains four potential zzso binding sites zzso but no sequence motifs suggestive of zzso or zzso zzso like those found in other zzso There is also a small region of probable zzso zzso which suggests that the zzso could be zzso though unlikely to form zzso The zzso and zzso regions of the zzso are zzso We present a zzso analysis of zzso head zzso which suggests that this is a new type of zzso
