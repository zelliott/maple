Human class I major zzso complex zzso zzso is associated with a group of human diseases called zzso Studies on transgenic rats expressing zzso and human beta zzso have confirmed the role of zzso in disease zzso Here we report spontaneous inflammatory arthritis in zzso transgenic mice lacking beta zzso zzso beta zzso In the absence of beta zzso zzso beta zzso animals do not express the zzso zzso on the cell surface and have a very low level of zzso T zzso Most of the zzso beta zzso male mice showed nail changes, hair loss, and swelling in zzso which leads to zzso The symptoms occur only after the zzso beta zzso mice are transferred from the specific zzso mouse zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso zzso and expression of the zzso zzso may zzso an individual for development of the disease when exposed to an appropriate environmental zzso
