To determine the zzso and zzso of bovine enteric zzso zzso circulating in calves, we determined the complete zzso gene sequences of 21 zzso The zzso and predicted zzso acid sequences were compared zzso with those of known human and animal enteric zzso Based on these zzso 15 zzso belonged to zzso zzso III and zzso 2 zzso and were genetically distinct from human zzso zzso and zzso Six zzso had zzso gene sequences similar to that of the zzso Nebraska zzso zzso The 15 bovine zzso zzso were more closely related to zzso zzso and other known zzso 2 zzso than to zzso 1 zzso The zzso zzso showed high zzso and zzso acid identities zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso gene of zzso whereas the zzso and zzso acid sequences of the zzso zzso gene were more closely related to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso than to those of zzso zzso and zzso zzso respectively), suggesting that zzso is a zzso 1-2 zzso Gene conversion analysis by the zzso identification program and zzso also predicted that zzso was a zzso Six zzso zzso shared 88 to zzso zzso and 94 to zzso zzso acid identities with the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The results of this study demonstrate genetic diversity in the zzso genes of zzso circulating in Ohio veal calves, provide new data for zzso with distinct zzso zzso or zzso and describe the first natural zzso zzso 1-2 zzso analogous to the previously reported human zzso zzso
