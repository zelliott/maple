zzso of zzso zzso zzso cells with the zzso zzso zzso multiple zzso zzso results in zzso and low yields of viral zzso in contrast to infection with zzso zzso zzso zzso By zzso zzso cells with zzso zzso DNA and a zzso library representing the complete zzso zzso we were able to rescue zzso replication and to isolate zzso virus zzso which zzso efficiently in zzso zzso Moreover, zzso showed enhanced zzso for zzso zzso larvae compared to zzso The zzso of zzso carried a zzso insert zzso that increased the distance between the zzso element and the zzso initiation site zzso of zzso gene zzso This finding correlated with low zzso levels of zzso and higher zzso levels of zzso (the product of the zzso zzso a major zzso zzso and a zzso zzso than of zzso zzso of the zzso promoter locus by zzso of the zzso zzso zzso gene yielded a new zzso zzso with replication properties identical to those of zzso Thus, the analysis indicated that increasing the zzso levels of zzso relative to zzso should enable zzso replication in zzso zzso This suggestion was confirmed by constructing a zzso zzso bearing an extra copy of the zzso gene under the control of the zzso zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso plays a role in the regulation of zzso infection and show, for the first time, that significant improvement in the ability of zzso to replicate in a poorly zzso cell line and zzso can be achieved by increasing the expression of the main multiple functional zzso zzso
