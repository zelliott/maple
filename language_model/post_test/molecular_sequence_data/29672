zzso zzso zzso zzso mice zzso zzso show an increased sensitivity to zzso following exposure to zzso compounds and are being used as an alternate animal model for zzso zzso However, there is relatively little data regarding the effect of zzso zzso on the zzso and cellular responses of target zzso in these mice to toxic zzso especially under chronic exposure conditions used in zzso zzso We hypothesized that zzso at the zzso locus in zzso mice alters the expression of bone zzso zzso genes involved in cell cycle control and zzso during chronic zzso zzso We used real-time quantitative reverse zzso zzso chain reaction zzso to examine gene expression zzso in bone zzso cells from zzso zzso and zzso zzso mice chronically exposed for 15 weeks to zzso and zzso levels zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of zzso levels of zzso genes involved in cell cycle control zzso zzso and zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso showed that during chronic zzso stress, bone zzso cells from zzso mice expressed significantly higher levels of a majority of these genes compared to zzso bone zzso zzso Our results indicate that zzso zzso results in a zzso zzso in zzso bone zzso cells as evident by significantly altered zzso levels of key genes involved in the zzso DNA damage response zzso
