C4 photosynthesis is characterized by a division of zzso between two different zzso cell types, zzso and zzso zzso Relying on zzso zzso zzso as the primary zzso in the zzso cells a CO2 pump is established in C4 plants that concentrates CO2 at the site of zzso zzso zzso in the zzso zzso The C4 zzso zzso evolved zzso zzso that the genes zzso the C4 zzso originated from zzso zzso zzso genes that were already present in the zzso ancestral zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a unique system in which to investigate the zzso changes that had to occur in order to adapt a zzso ancestral zzso gene to the special conditions of C4 zzso zzso contains not only zzso and C4 species but also a large number of zzso zzso which vary to the degree in which C4 zzso traits are zzso The C4 zzso gene of zzso zzso which is zzso by the zzso gene class, is highly expressed but only in zzso zzso The zzso zzso protein possesses the typical kinetic and regulatory features of a zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene of the zzso species zzso zzso encodes a typical zzso zzso zzso and is zzso expressed with no apparent cell or organ zzso zzso of the zzso type have been detected also in zzso intermediate zzso zzso These zzso zzso have been used to determine the molecular basis for C4 zzso characteristics and to understand their zzso Comparative and functional analyses of the zzso promoters from zzso zzso and zzso zzso make it possible to identity the zzso sequences for zzso gene expression and to search for the corresponding zzso zzso
