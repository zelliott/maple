alpha zzso zzso and zzso constitute an important class of therapeutic agents commonly used for the treatment of various cardiovascular diseases like hypertension, zzso heart failure and zzso zzso At the heart level, zzso of alpha zzso receptors is associated with marked zzso and genetic zzso These include enhancement of zzso zzso growth zzso and release of the heart major zzso product, zzso zzso factor zzso However, the signal zzso pathways which link zzso zzso of the receptors to cellular and genetic changes are not well zzso Using primary zzso cultures from zzso rat hearts, an alpha zzso regulatory sequence has been identified in the zzso zzso region of the zzso zzso This zzso which is necessary and sufficient for zzso zzso in response to the alpha zzso zzso zzso interacts with novel zzso proteins which are induced by alpha zzso zzso zzso with a zzso regulatory zzso the alpha 1 response element is highly zzso between zzso bovine and human zzso zzso and is also present in the promoter region of other alpha zzso cardiac zzso The identification of a nuclear zzso for alpha zzso signaling will be useful for zzso the zzso zzso of alpha zzso zzso
