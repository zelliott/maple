zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso zzso zzso that zzso production of zzso from zzso zzso zzso is unusual in that it zzso an zzso rather than a zzso which is typical of zzso zzso To understand the structural basis for zzso zzso in greater detail, we have determined the crystal structures of zzso inhibitor zzso and zzso analog zzso zzso These structures demonstrate a zzso zzso binding and suggest features of the zzso that facilitate zzso Unlike most zzso zzso where large zzso zzso changes take place at the zzso side of the zzso zzso changes in zzso are observed at the zzso side and in the zzso zzso The zzso and extensive zzso zzso interactions seen in all other zzso which are largely absent in the zzso zzso are recovered upon zzso binding accompanied by water exclusion from the active zzso In contrast, when zzso zzso the zzso interactions are not recovered and water molecules are largely zzso These findings suggest that zzso represents a divergent evolution of the zzso family, in which a zzso barrier has evolved to ensure strict binding specificity for zzso zzso leading to a zzso zzso with high product zzso The zzso structure also provides a view of the zzso entrance and product exit zzso
