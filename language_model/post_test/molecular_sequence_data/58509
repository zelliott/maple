We have cloned four novel members of the zzso family of zzso channels from zzso zzso The four plant genes are zzso to a recently isolated zzso channel gene from tobacco zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Plant Cell 8, zzso and are about zzso identical in sequence to the most closely related zzso and zzso putative zzso channels from zzso zzso transcripts are broadly expressed in the zzso Similarly, zzso against the zzso protein detected the protein in all zzso but predominantly in the zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso to each other ( approximately zzso zzso while being approximately 50% identical to either zzso or zzso None of the four zzso zzso zzso currents when expressed in zzso zzso either zzso or in zzso Among these zzso only zzso could functionally substitute for the single zzso zzso zzso restoring zzso growth of a strain disrupted for this zzso Introduction of disease causing zzso identified in human zzso zzso abolished this zzso zzso with a similar function of both zzso the green fluorescent zzso zzso protein showed the identical zzso pattern as the zzso zzso zzso This suggests that in zzso zzso functions as an zzso zzso zzso
