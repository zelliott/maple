The molecular basis for terminal bud formation in autumn is not well understood in zzso By combining suppression zzso zzso and monitoring of gene expression by zzso analysis, we aimed to identify genes involved in zzso control of growth zzso and bud set in Norway zzso Close to zzso zzso were generated and their functional distribution differed between short day zzso h zzso and long day zzso h zzso zzso Many genes with putative roles in protection against stress appeared zzso regulated under zzso and zzso and also differed in transcript levels between 6 and 20 zzso Of these, zzso zzso LIKE 1) showed strongly increased transcript levels at 6 zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso showed a later response at 20 zzso with increased and decreased transcript levels, zzso For rhythmically expressed genes such as zzso such differences might represent a phase shift in peak zzso but might also suggest a putative role in response to zzso zzso analyses revealed strong differences in gene expression between zzso 6 zzso and 20 zzso The zzso of the gene expression patterns was verified in 6 families differing in zzso timing under natural light with gradually decreasing zzso
