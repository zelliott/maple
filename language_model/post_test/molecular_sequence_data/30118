Identification and selective labeling of the zzso zzso and zzso in zzso coli, which are zzso by the zzso and zzso zzso respectively, have been accomplished by selectively labeling the two gene products with a zzso zzso zzso expression system zzso zzso & Richardson, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 82, zzso Following generation of a novel zzso restriction site in the zzso sequence between the two genes of the zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were separately inserted into zzso zzso of the zzso expression zzso zzso of zzso was markedly enhanced by placing a strong, synthetic zzso binding site at an optimal distance upstream from the initiation zzso of zzso zzso of cloned gene products was characterized functionally and by performing zzso analysis on total cell, inner zzso and zzso proteins from cells pulse labeled with zzso in the presence of zzso and resolved by sodium zzso zzso gel zzso The results first confirm that zzso is a zzso protein with an Mr of zzso in contrast, the zzso zzso zzso is identified as a protein with an apparent Mr of zzso a value significantly higher than that of zzso previously suggested zzso et zzso (1984) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
