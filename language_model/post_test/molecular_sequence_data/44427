zzso zzso difference analysis zzso is a zzso zzso and kinetic enrichment procedure for the isolation of zzso expressed zzso In this study, the technique was used to isolate novel genes specifically expressed in pancreatic zzso zzso was done on zzso reverse transcribed from a zzso zzso pool made from 10 cancer zzso zzso by using as a driver a zzso from a zzso zzso pool made from a combination of 10 zzso of chronic zzso and 10 healthy pancreatic zzso The use of chronic zzso in addition to healthy zzso zzso in the driver preparation eliminated the influence of zzso tissue components present as contamination in the zzso zzso Such zzso led to the isolation of 16 zzso zzso gene zzso These were confirmed to be zzso in pancreatic cancer zzso by Northern zzso zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso to five genes previously implicated in the zzso of the zzso or other zzso Eleven fragments had no significant zzso to any known gene and thus represent novel candidate disease zzso The experiments demonstrate that zzso is a zzso and highly efficient method for the identification of novel genes with zzso zzso
