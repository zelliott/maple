A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain zzso isolated from hot North Sea oil field water, is zzso The zzso cells averaged 1 zzso in zzso and zzso zzso in zzso They were zzso by means of a single polar zzso Growth was observed between 44 and 74 degrees C, with an optimum at 60 degrees zzso zzso were not zzso zzso and zzso were used as electron zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso In the presence of zzso growth was observed with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso did not support zzso zzso zzso of the zzso were zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were not zzso The zzso content of the DNA was 51 zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso showed that zzso strain zzso belongs to the delta subdivision of the zzso The closest relatives are zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso is described as the type strain of the new zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
