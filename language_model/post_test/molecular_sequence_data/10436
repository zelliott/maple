The zzso zzso mouse zzso zzso is an established model for absence zzso We have previously reported an impairment in zzso zzso zzso in zzso brain zzso and Barnes, zzso zzso zzso In order to determine if this zzso in zzso zzso function can be related to specific zzso zzso we examined the zzso binding properties of zzso receptors and the expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso in the cerebral zzso zzso binding of zzso revealed a significantly lower zzso value in zzso cortical zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in comparison to that for the background zzso strain zzso zzso zzso zzso while the zzso values were zzso zzso displacement of zzso binding by zzso showed that low affinity binding sites account for 36 zzso zzso and 51 zzso zzso of the total in control and zzso zzso The level of zzso zzso binding to zzso cortical zzso was zzso zzso zzso of that in zzso zzso zzso by quantitative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso revealed no significant differences in the levels of zzso zzso alpha 1, alpha 3, alpha 5, beta 2, beta 3, gamma 2 or gamma 3 zzso zzso between zzso and control zzso However, zzso zzso showed elevated levels of alpha zzso and beta zzso zzso representing 256 and zzso respectively, those of zzso For the zzso cortex, the enhanced expression of zzso zzso alpha 2 and beta 1 zzso zzso with zzso zzso known to have low affinity for zzso and impaired binding of zzso These zzso properties of zzso receptors could influence the development or propagation of zzso zzso in the zzso zzso
