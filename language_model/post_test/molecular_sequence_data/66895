We examined the mechanism by which zzso between zzso matched sequences zzso zzso is suppressed in zzso zzso DNA zzso were constructed, each containing a zzso zzso zzso gene disrupted by zzso of an zzso zzso and referred to as a zzso zzso Each zzso also contained one of several zzso zzso sequences that could potentially correct the recipient gene via zzso Each donor sequence either was perfectly zzso to the recipient gene or contained zzso sequence sharing only zzso identity with the recipient zzso Mouse zzso zzso were zzso zzso with the various zzso and zzso zzso produced via zzso zzso were zzso We observed exclusion of zzso sequence from gene conversion tracts when zzso sequence was positioned adjacent to zzso sequence in the donor but not when zzso sequence was surrounded by zzso in the zzso Our results support a model in which zzso zzso in zzso zzso is suppressed by a zzso dismantling of mismatched zzso DNA zzso zzso We suggest that zzso cells do not dismantle mismatched zzso by responding to zzso in zzso per zzso but rather rejection of mismatched zzso appears to be driven by a requirement for localized zzso for resolution of zzso
