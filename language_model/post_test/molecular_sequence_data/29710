zzso DNA zzso zzso DNA zzso and zzso zzso capping zzso are members of a zzso zzso zzso zzso defined by a common fold and a set of zzso zzso zzso Here we examined the role of zzso zzso motif V zzso in the zzso joining reaction of Chlorella virus DNA zzso an exemplary zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso at zzso zzso zzso and zzso reduced zzso specific activity by at least an order of zzso whereas zzso at zzso and zzso were zzso The zzso zzso and zzso changes had no effect on the rate of zzso zzso joining by zzso zzso but affected subsequent rounds of zzso joining at the zzso zzso zzso Conservative zzso zzso zzso and zzso partially restored activity, whereas zzso zzso and zzso zzso did zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso distinctive zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso joining by zzso was slowed by an order of zzso and high levels of the zzso intermediate zzso The rate of zzso bond formation at a zzso zzso zzso 3 of the zzso zzso was slowed by the zzso zzso Replacement of zzso by zzso reversed the step 3 arrest, whereas zzso substitution was zzso zzso analysis showed that the zzso zzso bound zzso to zzso We zzso that zzso is involved in the chemical step of zzso bond zzso
