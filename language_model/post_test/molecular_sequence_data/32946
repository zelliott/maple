The DNA packaging motor of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is comprised in part of an zzso ring of 174 base zzso molecules zzso positioned near the N zzso of zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso substitution zzso in the zzso protein zzso N zzso were assembled into zzso in zzso coli and the particles tested for zzso binding and zzso packaging in zzso The basic zzso acid zzso zzso at positions 3-5 of the zzso N zzso were central to zzso binding during assembly of an active DNA packaging zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in the narrow end of the zzso near the N zzso permitted zzso radical probing of bound zzso and identified two discrete sites zzso to this zzso the zzso at the junction of the A, C and D zzso and the E zzso and the zzso zzso loop of the zzso base pairing zzso
