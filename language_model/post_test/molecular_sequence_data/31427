zzso zzso protein 1 zzso a zzso bone zzso protein produced by zzso regulates zzso zzso and zzso zzso The lack of a precise zzso for circulating zzso levels zzso further investigation of the zzso biological zzso Because full-length precursor zzso is zzso into zzso and zzso fragments during the zzso process, we developed two new sandwich zzso for the zzso and zzso fragments of rat zzso One of these zzso zzso zzso is based on two zzso zzso zzso against the zzso and zzso peptides of the zzso fragment, whereas the other, zzso zzso is based on two zzso zzso zzso against the zzso and zzso peptides of the zzso zzso The zzso zzso were characterized in zzso and liquid zzso zzso tandem mass zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses of rat bone using these zzso zzso revealed zzso zzso in zzso and zzso zzso consistent with the previously reported zzso expression of zzso zzso analyses of rat zzso zzso products zzso with these zzso revealed the presence of zzso in circulating zzso The zzso established with these zzso met accepted standards for zzso zzso precision, and zzso zzso zzso and levels of other zzso markers zzso zzso zzso and zzso were measured in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso male zzso zzso zzso levels determined by zzso 1-2 and zzso significantly decreased with zzso During rapid skeletal growth zzso zzso levels measured by zzso zzso were over three times higher than those measured by zzso zzso however, zzso levels in old animals zzso and zzso were almost the same when measured by either zzso zzso levels determined by both zzso were most highly positively correlated with the level of zzso second most highly correlated with the level of zzso and less highly correlated with the levels of zzso and zzso These novel sandwich zzso for rat zzso are highly specific and allow precise zzso of circulating zzso which may be a new zzso marker for zzso bone zzso
