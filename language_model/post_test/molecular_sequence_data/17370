The beta zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso plays an important role in zzso allergic reactions as an amplifier for cell surface expression and signal zzso of zzso zzso is presumed to be one of the genes linked with zzso zzso However, the zzso of the associations previously found between single zzso zzso zzso in zzso and zzso diseases is zzso In the present study, we found correlation between the zzso of zzso at zzso resulting in a zzso zzso acid zzso and the cell surface expression level of zzso on blood zzso although it has been shown that the zzso zzso itself does not affect the surface expression or function of zzso We additionally found four zzso in the promoter region of zzso among which zzso and zzso were tightly linked with zzso zzso plasmids carrying the zzso and zzso promoter displayed higher zzso activity than those carrying the zzso and zzso zzso We found that zzso factor zzso zzso bound and zzso the zzso zzso Furthermore, expression of zzso zzso zzso in zzso from individuals who have the minor zzso zzso was significantly higher than that of the major zzso zzso These results suggest that the zzso in the zzso promoter are zzso linked with zzso via regulation of zzso zzso
