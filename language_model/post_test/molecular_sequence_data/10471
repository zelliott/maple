zzso zzso that mimic zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso with unusual zzso structural zzso have been shown to trigger zzso responses in zzso and human immune zzso This raises the exciting possibility of inducing active immunity with fully synthetic zzso vaccines, particularly if vaccine compounds can be zzso that resemble the surface environment of transformed cells even more zzso zzso seem particularly suitable for this zzso In contrast to most zzso and the carbohydrates themselves, zzso bind to major zzso complex zzso and, in zzso cases, can stimulate T cells and lead to the expression of receptors that recognize the zzso part of a zzso with high zzso The preparation of zzso and zzso remains, however, a difficult challenge: earlier synthesis methods have been inefficient, and established cloning approaches that allow engineering of global zzso produce only zzso zzso Here we report an efficient strategy of the synthesis of zzso zzso zzso with clustered zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso T zzso Our approach involves construction of the complete zzso in the first stage, followed by zzso zzso to zzso acid zzso and subsequent incorporation of the zzso zzso acid units into a zzso zzso This general strategy allows the assembly of molecules in which selected zzso can be incorporated at any desired position of the zzso zzso The zzso fully synthetic zzso zzso clusters are the closest homogeneous mimics of zzso zzso at present available, and so are promising compounds for the development of zzso zzso
