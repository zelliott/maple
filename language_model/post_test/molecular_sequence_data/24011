zzso zzso of zzso coli, zzso in the gene zzso is an important key zzso in the zzso zzso to zzso It zzso the zzso of zzso acid in position 3 using an zzso zzso as a second zzso Up to now, no X-ray structure of this zzso or any structurally related zzso is zzso zzso of the zzso structure and possible active sites is, however, essential for understanding the zzso mechanism and the zzso zzso With zzso modeling techniques, secondary structure prediction tools, molecular dynamics simulations, and energy zzso a model with two putative active sites could be created and zzso One active site selected to be the most likely one for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso acid is located near the zzso of the zzso It is widely accepted that zzso forming an active site are usually evolutionary zzso within a family of zzso Multiple alignments of a multitude of related proteins clearly showed zzso conservation of the zzso acid zzso that form the first putative active site and therefore strongly support this zzso However, an additional highly zzso region in the zzso acid sequence of the zzso zzso could be zzso which also can be considered a putative (or zzso active zzso This site is characterized by a high sequence similarity to the aforementioned site and may give some hints regarding the evolutionary origin of the zzso zzso zzso quantum mechanical zzso calculations have been performed to investigate the thermodynamics and zzso of the zzso zzso These results suggest a near zzso mechanism for the zzso of the zzso zzso from the zzso zzso The zzso acid interestingly appears not to be activated as zzso zzso but rather as zzso zzso to allow attack of the zzso zzso to the zzso which appeared to be the rate limiting step of the whole process according to our quantum chemical zzso Our models are a basis for developing zzso of this zzso which is crucial for bacterial zzso zzso zzso see zzso zzso of the model of zzso zzso derived from the zzso reaction center zzso zzso active zzso acid zzso and zzso are shown as capped sticks to describe their location and geometry in the putative active zzso The violet spheres identify zzso
