The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso has been shown to be similar in primary structure to the zzso zzso of several zzso To identify the zzso of this zzso family that function in zzso the zzso zzso zzso acid zzso plus a zzso zzso of the zzso were zzso to zzso The most dramatic losses in activity occurred with zzso and zzso these zzso zzso are part of an zzso sequence similar to that found in class I zzso zzso The zzso values for zzso and zzso were decreased by factors of 5 zzso zzso and 4 zzso zzso respectively, with no significant change in zzso zzso zzso which is found near the zzso sequence in the zzso but not zzso zzso was also important for activity, with the zzso zzso decreasing activity by a factor of 2 zzso zzso Several zzso found in the sequence zzso a signature sequence for this zzso family, as well as other isolated zzso were also shown to be important for activity, with zzso values decreasing by factors of zzso zzso zzso The zzso values of three zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso for both zzso and zzso were zzso higher than that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso were analyzed by two-dimensional zzso to determine if the overall structures of the zzso were zzso One of the zzso zzso zzso was defective in overall structure, but several of the others, including zzso and zzso were zzso These results indicate that zzso and zzso play a role in zzso and suggest that their role is similar to the role of the His zzso in the zzso sequence in class I zzso zzso zzso to stabilize a zzso transition zzso
