The zzso gene encodes a Ring finger protein that has a zzso motif consisting of a Ring finger, a zzso finger and a zzso zzso In the present study, we cloned and characterized the promoter region of the human zzso zzso The zzso sequence of the promoter was zzso and had no typical zzso and zzso zzso Instead, it contained one zzso and two zzso binding sites within 100 base pairs upstream of the zzso initiation zzso Analysis by the zzso zzso revealed that the activity of this promoter region is very strong in both human and mouse cell lines, although the activity in human cells was approximately zzso fold higher than that in mouse zzso In addition, the zzso and zzso binding sites appeared to zzso function for the promoter zzso Thus, the promoter of the zzso gene could be useful for high levels of expression of various genes in culture zzso
