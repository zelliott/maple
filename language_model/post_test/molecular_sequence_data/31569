zzso are important components of aquatic zzso but their genetic diversity has been little investigated in zzso A yearlong survey was conducted in surface waters of the two largest natural zzso lakes in France zzso zzso and Lake zzso to investigate part of this zzso diversity through the analysis of both structural zzso zzso and functional zzso zzso zzso We found that these zzso signature genes were prevalent throughout the year but that the community compositions of zzso zzso were significantly different between the two zzso In contrast, zzso zzso seemed to be more similar between the two zzso We also found that a large proportion of zzso sequences grouped with zzso zzso zzso zzso belonging to zzso of zzso zzso were characterized by distinct zzso motifs (with a novel viral zzso zzso zzso Thus, our results show that zzso zzso are a diverse viral community in zzso lakes and zzso are clearly distinct from some other freshwater and marine zzso suggesting the influence of unique zzso zzso
