zzso zzso type 1 zzso zzso the reduction of zzso to zzso which is the most potent zzso in zzso zzso of zzso and thereby reducing the zzso zzso concentration is thus a promising approach for the treatment of zzso dependent zzso In the past, several zzso and zzso zzso of zzso have been described but so far there is no zzso structure of the latter in complex with zzso However, a distinct knowledge of active site zzso and zzso interactions is a prerequisite for zzso drug design and zzso An elegant strategy to enhance this knowledge is to compare zzso values obtained for one compound toward zzso proteins from various species, which are highly zzso in sequence and differ only in few zzso In this study the zzso zzso of selected members of different zzso inhibitor classes toward zzso zzso were determined and the data were compared with the values obtained for the human zzso A species specific zzso profile was observed in the class of the zzso Using a combination of zzso methods, including zzso zzso molecular zzso MD zzso and binding energy zzso a reasonable model of the three-dimensional structure of zzso zzso was developed and zzso data were rationalized on the structural zzso In zzso zzso zzso 190 to 196 form a small zzso which zzso zzso changes compared to the human zzso The zzso poses suggest these zzso changes as zzso for species specificity and energy decomposition analysis highlighted the outstanding role of zzso as interaction partner for inhibitor zzso In zzso this strategy of comparing the biological activities of zzso toward highly zzso zzso proteins might be an alternative to zzso zzso or zzso zzso experiments in certain zzso Additionally, it zzso inhibitor design and zzso by offering new information on zzso zzso
