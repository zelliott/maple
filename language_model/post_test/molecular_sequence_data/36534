Previous studies have shown that the actions of zzso in bone are determined not only by its zzso but also by the concentration of zzso as well as other zzso In this study, we sought to determine by Western zzso zzso the effects of growth hormone, zzso and zzso on the production of zzso and zzso in zzso human zzso cells and in zzso normal human bone cells derived from zzso Human growth hormone at 10 zzso decreased the amount of zzso but had no effect on the zzso level in the zzso medium of low density cultures of zzso cells and human bone cells derived from zzso Human growth hormone had no effect on zzso or zzso levels in the zzso medium of high density human bone cell zzso zzso and zzso which increased human bone cell zzso decreased the level of zzso zzso of control at 100 zzso zzso and zzso but increased the level of zzso zzso fold at 100 zzso zzso and zzso after 48 h of treatment in the zzso medium of both low and high density zzso cell zzso Similar changes in zzso and zzso levels were also seen in the zzso medium of human bone cells derived from rib after treatment with zzso and zzso Studies to determine the underlying molecular mechanisms by which zzso decreased the amount of zzso in the zzso medium revealed that zzso decreased the zzso zzso abundance and increased the zzso zzso abundance in human bone zzso Based on the above findings, we conclude that the production of both zzso and zzso is regulated in bone cells and that local and systemic agents may zzso the responsiveness of bone cells to zzso by regulated zzso of zzso and zzso
