zzso of the zzso 170 zzso zzso of zzso virus zzso during zzso infection is performed by the cellular replication machinery under zzso zzso A single viral zzso zzso directs the cellular replication apparatus to initiate replication within the genetically defined replication origin, zzso at a cluster of four zzso binding sites, referred to here as the physical origin of zzso zzso or zzso A second cluster of zzso binding sites within zzso the 30 zzso repeats, serves an essential role as a replication zzso and also provides a distinct zzso maintenance function that is unrelated to zzso We examined the functional elements of zzso for binding by zzso and possibly other proteins in zzso zzso cells by generating in zzso zzso using two zzso zzso zzso and zzso We also employed zzso I zzso I) with zzso zzso The in zzso and zzso cell zzso at the zzso binding sites, particularly those obtained using zzso gave strong evidence that all of these sites are bound by zzso in zzso dividing zzso No consistent evidence was found to suggest binding by other proteins at any other sites within the functional regions of zzso zzso at symmetrical positions of the zzso within zzso were oxidized when cells were treated with zzso suggestive of zzso or other zzso of DNA structure at these zzso binding of zzso in zzso to total DNA from zzso cells induced zzso to zzso at identical zzso The simplest interpretation of the results, which were obtained using zzso dividing cells, is that zzso binds to its sites at zzso and holds the zzso in a distorted zzso throughout most of the cell cycle, zzso that replication is initiated by a cellular mechanism and is not limited by an availability of zzso for binding to zzso
