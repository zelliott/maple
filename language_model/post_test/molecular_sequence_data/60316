A full-length zzso clone corresponding to the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of zzso differed from zzso in the zzso region of the zzso zzso The zzso region showed high zzso acid identity with zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were used to study the expression of zzso and zzso zzso Both zzso detected 6 zzso zzso that were present in zzso zzso zzso and in the zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso levels increased during the zzso zzso In the sixth zzso larvae, the increase in zzso and zzso zzso levels were more pronounced in the zzso than in zzso and fat zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso were induced in zzso cells (a cell line developed from zzso zzso zzso grown in the presence of 4 zzso zzso M zzso zzso specific zzso were induced within 1 h of exposure to zzso but zzso specific zzso were induced only after 3 h of exposure to zzso zzso of zzso for both zzso was unaffected by the presence of a protein synthesis zzso zzso in the culture zzso zzso a stable zzso zzso caused a similar induction pattern of zzso and zzso zzso in the zzso zzso and fat body of sixth zzso zzso In zzso translated zzso zzso and zzso proteins were used to study the DNA binding and zzso binding properties of zzso and zzso protein zzso The zzso values indicated that both complexes have similar binding affinities for zzso response elements and zzso zzso
