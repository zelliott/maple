A zzso zzso regulatory protein zzso zzso with zzso designated as alpha 40 beta zzso was identified and partially resolved from two other zzso G zzso Go zzso 39 beta zzso and zzso zzso 41 beta zzso found in bovine zzso The alpha 40 G protein zzso served as a zzso for zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso as did alpha 39 and alpha zzso alpha 40 was shown to be closely related to, but distinct from, alpha 41 by reaction with various zzso zzso An zzso generated against a zzso derived from the sequence of a zzso alpha clone isolated from a rat zzso zzso zzso library zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Nakamura, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 83, zzso reacted with alpha 40 to the exclusion of all other alpha zzso zzso Another zzso generated against a zzso derived from an analogous region of a different zzso alpha clone from a bovine brain zzso library zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso reacted exclusively with alpha zzso Evidence is given for the existence of another form of alpha 41 that did not react with either of these two zzso zzso The zzso were used to survey various rat zzso for the expression of alpha 40 and alpha zzso
