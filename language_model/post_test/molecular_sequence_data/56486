zzso zzso has two zzso the zzso domain consisting of zzso and zzso regions which are partly zzso in the zzso state; and the central zzso domain with compact zzso zzso The zzso domain is highly zzso in zzso from different species but the zzso domain is diverse in sequence and zzso Whereas the former has direct functional significance for bacterial zzso the latter has not been identified as having a specific function except for defining the distinct zzso of the zzso The sequence alignment of zzso from zzso zzso with proteins of known three-dimensional structure reveals significant zzso of the central 265 zzso stretch with the bacterial zzso zzso zzso This zzso is evident also in the comparison of the predicted secondary structure of zzso with the observed secondary structural features in zzso The zzso arising due to optimal alignment of the two proteins occur on the surface zzso in the zzso Thus, a domain of zzso zzso zzso and zzso appear to have similar structural zzso
