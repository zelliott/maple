Two strictly zzso zzso strains of the zzso designated zzso and zzso were obtained from a zzso sample of zzso the Korean tidal zzso Comparative zzso zzso sequence studies revealed that the test strains were related most closely to the type strains of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso analyses demonstrated that strains zzso and zzso formed a distinct zzso zzso within the family zzso and clustered zzso with the zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and zzso data also indicated that the two zzso zzso were significantly different from members of these two zzso and others with zzso published zzso zzso were zzso and zzso with a polar zzso The major zzso zzso was zzso The zzso cellular fatty acids were zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and a mixture of zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso DNA zzso contents were zzso zzso On the basis of this zzso study, zzso zzso zzso is proposed with two novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso strain, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is the type species of the zzso In addition, an zzso description of zzso zzso is zzso
