The zzso structures of the structural zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso were studied by mass spectral sequence analysis of the zzso The proposed structures are based on zzso data before and after treatment with the specific zzso zzso and zzso zzso followed by sequence analysis via zzso zzso zzso In total, 15 zzso were identified as a highly zzso group of zzso As in most zzso zzso the zzso of zzso contain a terminal zzso but more interestingly, a novel structural motif was zzso zzso including thus zzso and zzso zzso being linked to an internal zzso zzso While the functional unit zzso c zzso is completely lacking any potential zzso site, zzso possesses a second exposed sugar attachment site between zzso 8 and 9 within the beta sandwich domain compared to the other zzso The zzso zzso show a high degree of zzso In zzso two prominent potential zzso sites can be zzso The finding that zzso is not able to form zzso structures in zzso could be explained by the presence of the exposed zzso on the surface of zzso
