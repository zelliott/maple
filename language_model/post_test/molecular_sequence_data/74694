The zzso zzso zzso zzso family of zzso factors plays key roles in the zzso of muscle structural zzso In zzso zzso accumulates at high levels in the embryonic muscles, where it activates target genes throughout the zzso Here, we identify the zzso gene zzso zzso as a direct zzso target of zzso in the cardiac zzso zzso is expressed in cells forming the inflow tracts of the zzso vessel, and we identify the zzso responsible for this zzso The zzso contains three binding sites for zzso and can be activated by zzso in tissue culture and in zzso Moreover, loss of zzso function, or removal of the zzso binding sites from the zzso results in loss of zzso zzso These studies identify a new zzso target in the cardiac zzso These studies provide a possible mechanism for the zzso of zzso zzso
