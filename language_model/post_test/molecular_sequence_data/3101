The nuclear localized C2 protein of the zzso zzso Tomato yellow leaf zzso zzso zzso contributes to viral zzso Here, we have investigated zzso C2 protein zzso that play a role in the zzso zzso of the C2 protein with 67 zzso from zzso and zzso zzso revealed that a putative zzso motif zzso and four potential zzso sites zzso zzso zzso and zzso are highly zzso When expressed from a zzso virus X zzso zzso zzso C2 protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso like the zzso C2 zzso induced local zzso zzso and systemic necrosis in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso produced irregular zzso zzso on zzso leaves that were distinct from the zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso zzso and zzso induced zzso and mosaic symptoms rather than zzso We demonstrate that zzso zzso like its counterpart in the zzso zzso African zzso mosaic virus, mediates suppression of zzso gene zzso zzso Moreover, the individual zzso zzso zzso and zzso abolished the ability of C2 protein to suppress zzso These results suggest that the three zzso zzso within the putative zzso motif are essential for C2 protein to induce necrosis and to act as a zzso of zzso
