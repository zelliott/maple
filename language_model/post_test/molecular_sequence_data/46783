A gene zzso to zzso zzso zzso genes coding for zzso zzso carriers has been cloned from the zzso zzso zzso zzso A probe obtained by zzso amplification from zzso zzso DNA, using zzso derived from the zzso zzso region of zzso zzso carriers, was used for screening of the zzso zzso zzso zzso The cloned gene was zzso and found to zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids that shows zzso with other zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The gene was designated zzso and was able to complement the growth zzso of zzso zzso double deletion zzso zzso zzso The expression of the zzso gene was reduced under zzso conditions and it was affected at normal zzso conditions by the nature of carbon sources used for zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso zzso possesses a single gene zzso a zzso zzso zzso
