The development of new drugs to treat disease by binding directly to DNA offers much promise but is zzso on methods to determine the relative affinity of the putative drug for different DNA zzso Such methods should zzso be rapid and inexpensive as well as zzso Use of zzso zzso in simple zzso columns offers such a zzso The development of systems in which the zzso carries a soluble zzso allows the reliable separation of DNA zzso of zzso zzso in zzso which can then be zzso with the zzso in competition zzso The results obtained are comparable with those obtained by zzso and give direct zzso zzso easily zzso for relative binding zzso
