zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso are zzso coli zzso that share zzso sequence zzso A plausible model zzso that zzso arose from a zzso of an ancestral zzso zzso Directed evolution of zzso to an zzso having zzso activity was undertaken in order to compare the evolved zzso zzso with zzso zzso Eight rounds of DNA zzso and in zzso selection followed by a zzso with zzso zzso produced zzso that exhibited zzso increases in zzso and had as much as zzso of the zzso zzso activity of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso in 11 clones from rounds 7 and 8 were compared with zzso zzso in zzso and zzso The findings are zzso and zzso illustrated by the use of zzso zzso and set theory zzso A statistically significant zzso concentration of zzso occurs in a subset of positions zzso zzso that is zzso zzso zzso in zzso and variable zzso zzso in zzso Very few zzso occur in the intersection zzso zzso intersection zzso of zzso acid zzso that are zzso in both zzso zzso Seven zzso from set zzso were combined by zzso zzso to give a construct that is zzso as active as the best round 8 zzso which has 13 zzso acid zzso The zzso zzso may provide a generally useful tool to highlight the most important specificity zzso for rational zzso zzso acid replacements were mapped onto the crystal structure of a zzso complex of a designed zzso Five of the seven positions most frequently zzso in the evolved clones are within 15 A of the zzso zzso but only six of the 48 positions that were zzso once or twice are within that zzso Context zzso neutral zzso different selective pressures, and zzso components provide explanations for the observation that many of the zzso found in the directly evolved zzso differ from the corresponding zzso acids found in the modern natural zzso
