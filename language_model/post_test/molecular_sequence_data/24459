The zzso zzso from zzso zzso zzso exhibits a low zzso activity zzso ratio zzso A single round of random zzso of the zzso gene followed by screening of zzso zzso on zzso plates identified three zzso with zzso increased zzso activities, corresponding to zzso ratios of zzso All zzso were specific for the zzso zzso zzso bond of zzso zzso occurred predominantly in the zzso part of zzso with regions surrounding the predicted zzso zzso and lid as zzso Two zzso zzso located in the predicted zzso zzso and zzso found in the highly zzso zzso hole motif among zzso were identified to account for increased zzso zzso Two of the three zzso showed reduced activities towards zzso and zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso compared to the zzso zzso zzso of zzso with zzso which is located adjacent to the active site zzso and is important for zzso activity in the zzso zzso zzso increased the absolute zzso activities of the zzso but not of zzso approximately zzso The engineered best zzso displayed a zzso ratio of zzso corresponding to a zzso increase compared to the zzso zzso Moreover, this zzso exhibited a zzso higher activity towards zzso fatty zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso compared to zzso A second round of zzso and screening on zzso yielded no new zzso with further increased zzso activity ratios, but instead one zzso with a zzso increased expression rate and two zzso with a zzso reduced activity towards zzso were zzso
