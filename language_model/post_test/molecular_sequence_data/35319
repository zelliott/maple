zzso zzso C typically contains zzso binding sites, sites II and IV, in the zzso and zzso zzso zzso To investigate the roles of these sites for zzso regulation of muscle contraction, we generated lobster zzso C zzso and analyzed their zzso properties and regulatory effects on zzso zzso zzso The results suggest that zzso binding to site IV is responsible for regulation at relatively low zzso zzso while site II has an essential role in full zzso at higher zzso zzso
