zzso which possess the property to recombine with genetic material from the cell, have cloned and activated some zzso and hence are a privileged source for the study of these zzso Cellular zzso zzso can occur following two non mutually exclusive ways: zzso by zzso of their zzso zzso by modifications of their products through zzso zzso can combine these two ways of zzso leading to the zzso of a modified zzso In this paper, we present results obtained in the study of zzso a zzso containing two zzso We have shown that the two zzso of zzso zzso and zzso cooperate in zzso to transform zzso cells from chicken zzso These cells which normally do not grow in a defined zzso are induced to zzso and become transformed upon infection by zzso Our data enabled us to show that in zzso zzso was responsible for the induction of proliferation and zzso for the transformation of the zzso zzso Using in zzso zzso we located two regions in the protein zzso by zzso which are important for its zzso zzso We have also cloned the cellular counterpart of zzso and the study of its biological activity on zzso cells enabled us to propose a mechanism of zzso of the cellular gene by zzso of its zzso zzso
