For zzso that have small zzso and lack brain, eyes and zzso the defects are caused by zzso of a single zzso zzso zzso encodes a basic zzso zzso zzso zzso and functionally zzso positive zzso genes such as the zzso determination zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso cell differentiation and keeps cells at the precursor stage or zzso zzso zzso in the absence of zzso the expression of positive zzso genes is zzso and cells differentiate prematurely without sufficient cell zzso As a result, the development of many zzso such as the brain, eye and zzso is severely zzso Thus, zzso regulates tissue zzso by maintaining zzso zzso In the case of T cell development, zzso zzso leads to defects of expansion of early T cell precursors and thereby suppresses T cell fate zzso Thus, zzso promotes differentiation of some cell types in addition to maintenance of the zzso zzso Interestingly, zzso expression is controlled by the zzso protein zzso which is activated by the zzso expressed on the surface of neighboring zzso Taken together, these results indicate that the zzso pathway, which is controlled by zzso interaction, plays an essential role in differentiation of many cell zzso
