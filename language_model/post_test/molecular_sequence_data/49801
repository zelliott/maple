Muscle zzso protein zzso is an essential nuclear regulator of zzso zzso Additionally, it may act as an zzso of protein assembly of the zzso zzso zzso mice develop a marked cardiac zzso reaction and zzso zzso zzso zzso is therefore a candidate gene for zzso forms of zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso 

We analyzed zzso unrelated individuals zzso patients with zzso 200 patients with zzso and 500 zzso for zzso in the human zzso gene that encodes zzso We found 3 different zzso zzso in 3 unrelated patients with familial zzso but detected no zzso in the zzso group or the zzso All zzso predicted an zzso acid exchange at highly zzso zzso in the functionally important zzso domain, which is responsible for interaction with zzso and with certain zzso zzso zzso zzso studies indicate that zzso in the zzso gene lead to a decreased binding activity of zzso to zzso All 3 index patients were characterized by typical zzso zzso zzso Family studies revealed zzso of clinically affected individuals with the respective zzso in zzso 

Here, we present evidence that zzso in the zzso gene can cause zzso
