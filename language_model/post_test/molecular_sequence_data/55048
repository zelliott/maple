zzso such as the protective zzso present in the cell wall of zzso zzso have the capability to bind to zzso in numerous frame shifted zzso A protective zzso zzso zzso binds this zzso and exhibits a unique binding profile where di and zzso are the most potent zzso while the intrinsic affinities of zzso and larger zzso dramatically decrease with increasing chain zzso The design, synthesis and zzso activity of three zzso zzso zzso is zzso Selective functional group modification was introduced at the terminal reducing or zzso zzso zzso so that each zzso would be capable of binding to zzso in only one of the possible frame shifted zzso zzso data show that zzso has the highest affinity for internally situated zzso zzso but can bind the terminal zzso zzso of a zzso zzso
