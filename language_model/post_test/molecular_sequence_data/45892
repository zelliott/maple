To investigate the zzso zzso role of zzso B virus X protein on the expression of zzso tumor suppression zzso 

The promoter sequence of the zzso tumor suppression gene was identified and amplified by zzso and zzso chain reaction zzso The zzso reporter gene expression zzso zzso was constructed and zzso into the zzso cell line zzso and zzso with zzso zzso by zzso 6 zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso activity was detected by zzso zzso zzso zzso The expression of zzso zzso was further detected by zzso with or without zzso X zzso 

The reporter zzso zzso has been successfully constructed and identified and the zzso promoter could zzso the zzso of the zzso zzso The relative expression level of zzso gene in zzso cells zzso with zzso and zzso zzso was lower than the control, and the zzso rate was approximately zzso which indicate that zzso X protein could zzso inhibit the activity of zzso zzso After zzso with zzso zzso the expression of zzso zzso was lower than the zzso 

zzso X protein could zzso inhibit the expression of zzso tumor suppression zzso which might be a possible molecular mechanism responsible for the development of zzso zzso zzso
