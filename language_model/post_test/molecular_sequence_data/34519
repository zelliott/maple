We introduce a model of proteins in which all of the key atoms in the protein backbone are accounted for, thus extending the freely rotating chain zzso We use average bond lengths and average angles from the zzso Data Bank as input zzso leaving the number of zzso as a single zzso The model is used to study the stretching of proteins in the zzso zzso The results of our zzso Carlo simulations are found to agree well with experimental data, suggesting that the force extension plot is universal and does not depend on the side chains or primary structure of the zzso
