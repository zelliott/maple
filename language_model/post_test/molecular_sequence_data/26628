There is an zzso clinical need for novel analgesics for zzso zzso This study was designed to zzso the mechanism through which zzso a small zzso zzso of the zzso II type 2 zzso zzso with zzso selectivity over the zzso II type 1 zzso produces analgesia in a zzso model of zzso zzso 

Groups of zzso zzso zzso and zzso mice with a chronic zzso injury zzso of the zzso nerve received single zzso zzso zzso doses of zzso zzso or zzso and zzso efficacy was zzso Groups of control, zzso and zzso rats were zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso root zzso zzso were removed for investigation of the mechanism through which zzso zzso zzso zzso 

zzso analgesia was abolished in zzso knockout zzso mice with intermediate responses in the zzso affirming the zzso as the target zzso zzso zzso In zzso rats, zzso zzso zzso levels for zzso II, the main zzso zzso of the zzso were increased zzso zzso zzso zzso Mean zzso IF levels for activated zzso zzso and activated zzso zzso zzso were also increased zzso zzso zzso zzso At the time of peak zzso analgesia in zzso rats, mean zzso levels of zzso zzso and zzso zzso (but not zzso zzso were reduced to match the respective levels in zzso 

zzso zzso zzso signaling in the zzso of zzso rats is attenuated by zzso to block zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso a mechanism with clinical zzso for alleviating zzso zzso
