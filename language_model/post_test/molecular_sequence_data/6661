zzso zzso are zzso required for normal growth and development in higher zzso The zzso zzso gene of zzso encodes an early step in the zzso zzso zzso We zzso the D3 gene using zzso zzso zzso and showed that the zzso zzso zzso is linked to a zzso zzso The DNA zzso the zzso element was cloned and shown to be linked to the zzso locus by mapping in a high-resolution population developed by selecting for zzso between zzso and linked genetic zzso To establish zzso the identity of the cloned gene as zzso a second zzso zzso of D3 zzso was also cloned and characterized using the zzso sequences as a zzso zzso was found to have a novel zzso element, named zzso inserted into an zzso A third zzso zzso zzso which has the same size 3' restriction fragments as zzso but different zzso restriction fragments, was found to contain a Sleepy zzso at the same position as zzso On the basis of the pedigree, Sleepy zzso and restriction map, zzso appears to represent a zzso zzso of zzso The D3 gene encodes a predicted protein with significant sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso Analysis of D3 zzso showed that the D3 transcript is expressed in roots, developing leaves, the zzso zzso and suspension culture zzso We detected reduced D3 zzso levels in the zzso zzso zzso
