The small zzso zzso regulates the recycling of zzso to the plasma membrane via interactions with the zzso family of interacting proteins zzso zzso contain a highly zzso zzso binding domain zzso at their C zzso whose structure is zzso Here, we have determined the crystal structure of the zzso of zzso in complex with zzso by single wavelength anomalous zzso zzso The overall structure is a zzso with zzso zzso arranged as a zzso zzso zzso forms a central zzso coiled zzso with both zzso contributing to the zzso binding patch on equivalent and opposite sides of the zzso zzso 1 of zzso is embedded between the two zzso while switch 2 remains flexible and is peripherally associated with the zzso The complex reveals the structural basis for zzso recognition by zzso and suggests the molecular mechanisms underlying zzso recycling zzso
