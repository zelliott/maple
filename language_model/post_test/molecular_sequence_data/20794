Identification of novel cellular proteins as zzso to viral zzso would provide a new insight into the mechanism of zzso zzso Eight nuclear proteins as potential targets for zzso 71 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were identified by zzso zzso and zzso zzso Of these zzso zzso which is a critical factor for 3' zzso processing in a cell nucleus, was selected for further zzso A zzso study to monitor the expression levels of zzso in zzso cells also revealed that the reduction of zzso during virus infection was correlated with the production of viral zzso zzso was zzso in zzso by zzso but neither by zzso zzso (in which the zzso site was zzso nor by another zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was performed in zzso revealing that the zzso zzso sites are located at position 251 in the zzso zzso domain and at multiple positions close to the zzso of zzso zzso position zzso An zzso of zzso zzso and the depression of mature zzso were observed in zzso zzso An in zzso zzso revealed the zzso of the zzso zzso processing and zzso in zzso nuclear zzso and this impairment was rescued by adding zzso zzso zzso zzso In summing up the above results, we suggest that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso the host cell zzso in zzso as well as in zzso zzso This finding is, to our knowledge, the first to demonstrate that a zzso protein affects the zzso of host zzso
