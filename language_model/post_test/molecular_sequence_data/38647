A live bacterial zzso system based on the zzso zzso zzso zzso was used for delivery of peptides from the G zzso of human respiratory zzso virus, zzso A zzso Three zzso corresponding to the G protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the latter with four zzso zzso zzso for zzso were expressed by zzso means as zzso on three different bacteria, and their surface accessibility on the bacteria was verified by zzso cell sorting zzso zzso zzso of mice with the live zzso zzso zzso significant zzso as well as zzso serum zzso responses of balanced zzso zzso profiles, and upon viral challenge with zzso tissue culture infectious zzso zzso lung protection was demonstrated for approximately half of the mice in the zzso and zzso S zzso zzso To our knowledge, this is the first study in which protective immunity to a viral pathogen has been evoked using zzso bacteria as zzso zzso
