A new zzso and basic zzso designated as zzso has been isolated from barley zzso by a zzso zzso consisting of extraction with a volatile salt solution followed by zzso liquid zzso using a zzso C4 zzso The isolated zzso was found to be homogeneous by zzso gel zzso in the presence of sodium zzso zzso The complete primary structure of zzso was determined by automatic degradation of the intact, zzso and zzso zzso and fragments obtained by zzso zzso zzso consists of a single zzso chain of 47 zzso acids with a calculated molecular mass of zzso Da and contains four zzso zzso zzso zzso translation in zzso systems derived from zzso zzso zzso mouse zzso as well as zzso zzso zzso cells, at several zzso At low zzso zzso zzso the protein seems to affect mainly the zzso process, although it might also act at the zzso zzso At higher zzso zzso zzso this inhibitor zzso zzso of an zzso zzso initiation factor 2 zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso as does zzso zzso The presence of the zzso bridges in zzso appears to be essential for the zzso alpha zzso zzso Based on its similarity at both the structural and functional level with the different genetic zzso of zzso zzso and zzso from wheat and zzso zzso is a putative member of the zzso zzso
