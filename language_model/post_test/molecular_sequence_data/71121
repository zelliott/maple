zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso factor that binds to zzso response element zzso zzso contains two functional zzso an zzso zzso domain and a zzso zzso zzso The zzso domain contains the basic zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, the three-dimensional structure of the zzso domain of zzso has been determined by zzso The zzso domain consists of two zzso the structure of an zzso half zzso is well determined, while a zzso half zzso takes a highly flexible and zzso zzso The architecture of the zzso is very similar to that of the well-known zinc finger motif found in zzso zzso consisting of an zzso zzso and an zzso The zinc atom is zzso coordinated to two zzso zzso and two zzso zzso zzso acids that form the zzso core in all of the zzso zinc fingers are well zzso in the zzso of the zzso domain, whereas some zzso acids that are responsible for binding to the zzso backbone of DNA in the zzso zinc fingers are zzso with other zzso zzso The flexible zzso which contains two zzso zzso that the zzso protein zzso zzso is likely to undergo a zzso change by specific binding to a target zzso
