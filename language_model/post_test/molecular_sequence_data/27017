Thirteen novel strains were isolated from root zzso of three different zzso plants of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso grown in zzso zzso of these strains were zzso strictly zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso gene sequences revealed that they belong to the zzso zzso A representative strain, zzso zzso showed zzso zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to its closest zzso relative, zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso sequence of zzso zzso shared zzso and zzso sequence zzso respectively, with those of zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso Analysis of the sequences of the zzso genes zzso and zzso was in agreement with the results of ITS sequence zzso The zzso gene sequence of zzso zzso was identical to that of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso values for strain zzso zzso ranged from zzso (with zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso (with zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell protein zzso zzso and several zzso zzso such as use of sole carbon sources and zzso resistance, could differentiate the novel strains from defined zzso zzso We therefore propose that the novel strains reported in this study form a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
