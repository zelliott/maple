The oceanic islands of zzso provide an ideal zzso and spatial context to test hypotheses of plant evolution using a novel set of zzso zzso zzso zzso In contrast to the limited resolution of standard molecular markers zzso and zzso zzso the zzso sequence zzso of zzso unequivocally reconstructs its active colonization across islands and zzso zzso the zzso Islands, and Cape zzso as well as its subsequent geographical and ecological zzso zzso estimates using penalized likelihood and zzso zzso reveal two radiation processes zzso with two dramatic zzso changes recorded in the zzso the advent of the cold zzso sea current zzso 4 zzso and the establishment of a strong zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Though zzso had available all the diversity of zzso zzso environments zzso and zzso zzso zzso pine forest, and zzso zzso in the zzso evolutionary divergence appears to have been triggered by an extension of fluctuating zzso and zzso zzso with the advent of zzso zzso These zzso zzso not only fulfill traditional predictions of zzso radiation zzso common zzso rapid zzso and zzso zzso but also, uniquely among zzso species, trait utility of zzso A zzso transition from zzso to a zzso or zzso condition occurred in early zzso zzso Maintenance of zzso in major zzso and reversal to an zzso condition by three independent events, is reported for the first time in plants of oceanic zzso
