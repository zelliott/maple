The zzso for the bovine zzso zzso type II zzso gene has been cloned and zzso It encodes a protein of zzso zzso acids which is highly zzso zzso zzso zzso to the human, zzso and rat zzso Using zzso analysis of bovine zzso zzso zzso cell lines, the zzso gene was mapped to zzso group zzso which has been zzso to bovine zzso zzso Comparative mapping has shown that the genes within zzso are also in a zzso group on the long arm of human and sheep zzso 2, as well as on mouse zzso zzso This group of genes represents an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a highly zzso zzso zzso zzso found within an zzso of this gene confirmed the zzso by linking the zzso zzso to the region of zzso 2 flanked by zzso and zzso This gene zzso which has the characteristics of a type I and type II mapping zzso represents the first zzso of this gene in any species to zzso
