zzso protein zzso zzso consists of a 460 zzso zzso that contains the zzso domain zzso zzso with two zzso of 70 zzso and 80 zzso zzso and zzso which comprise the zzso zzso zzso requires association with DNA via zzso for zzso zzso and is implicated in double strand break repair, zzso zzso and zzso We have zzso a zzso system of concentrated zzso zzso egg extracts to investigate the regulation and possible functions of zzso Recently, we have shown that this system can reproduce events of zzso including zzso of an zzso zzso that zzso zzso zzso Here, we report that zzso is rapidly zzso with the onset of zzso in this zzso Loss of activity is zzso with zzso of the zzso zzso whereas the zzso zzso are zzso zzso and zzso of zzso is prevented by prior addition of the zzso protein zzso or zzso of an zzso zzso that has characteristics of the zzso family of zzso zzso that cleave zzso zzso These results suggest that zzso and zzso of zzso prevents this factor from functioning in DNA repair, zzso or zzso regulation during zzso
