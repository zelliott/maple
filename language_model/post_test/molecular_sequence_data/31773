Because of the importance of wood in many industrial applications, tremendous studies have been performed on wood formation, especially in zzso zzso zzso zzso factors zzso which consist of a large family of plant zzso have been reported to directly regulate zzso zzso genes in a number of zzso In this study, we describe the cloning and functional characterization of zzso a zzso isolated from Chinese white zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso encodes a protein belonging to the zzso family and displays significant similarity with other zzso factors shown to regulate zzso synthesis in zzso Gene expression profiling studies showed that zzso zzso is specifically expressed during secondary wall formation in zzso The zzso promoter sequence of zzso was fused to the zzso coding sequence and introduced into zzso zzso zzso zzso expression was shown to be restricted to zzso undergoing secondary cell wall zzso zzso of zzso specifically activated the expression of the upstream genes in the zzso zzso zzso and resulted in zzso deposition of zzso in cells that are normally zzso These results suggest that zzso is specific zzso zzso of zzso zzso and involved in the regulation of wood formation in zzso
