Wilson's disease zzso is a rare zzso zzso zzso Here we have evaluated 62 zzso cases zzso zzso from the Chinese Han population to expand our knowledge of zzso zzso and to more completely characterize zzso in zzso 

the coding and promoter regions of the zzso gene were analyzed by direct sequencing in 62 Chinese patients zzso zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso female, zzso zzso 25; age range, 2 zzso 61 years zzso 

zzso manifestations were associated with older age at diagnosis zzso zzso zzso and longer diagnostic delay zzso zzso zzso Age at diagnosis was also correlated with urinary copper concentration zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso Forty different zzso including 14 novel zzso were identified in these zzso Common zzso included zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and nonsense zzso zzso were more often associated with primary zzso manifestations zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso and higher zzso zzso levels at diagnosis zzso zzso zzso and p zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were also associated with lower serum zzso zzso zzso zzso 

we identified 14 novel zzso and found that the spectrum of zzso of zzso in China is quite distinct from that of Western zzso The zzso type plays a role in predicting clinical zzso zzso testing is a valuable tool to detect zzso in young children, especially in patients younger than 8 years zzso Four zzso zzso 12, 13, and zzso and two zzso zzso zzso should be considered high priority for cost-effective testing in zzso
