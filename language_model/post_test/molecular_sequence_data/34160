Classical zzso fever virus zzso causes a highly contagious disease that leads to significant economic losses in the pig industry zzso However, there is a paucity of knowledge on the accurate zzso of zzso zzso in south zzso This study zzso the zzso gene of 14 zzso strains isolated during zzso from domestic pigs in different districts of south zzso zzso analyses revealed that all of the 14 zzso zzso were clustered into genetic zzso zzso This contrasts with most parts of China, where group 2 zzso are zzso Furthermore, the positive selection pressures acting on the zzso and zzso envelope protein genes of zzso were assessed and a zzso analysis of the zzso ratio was performed to identify specific zzso that undergo diversification under positive zzso While no significant evidence for positive selection was observed in zzso two positively selected sites at zzso acid zzso 49 and 72 in the zzso zzso region were zzso Our results revealed that a predominance of zzso zzso zzso zzso is currently circulating in some districts of south China, which appear to be unrelated to the Chinese zzso zzso Moreover, the envelope protein zzso zzso has undergone positive selection in 14 zzso strains and two positively selected sites have been identified in this zzso zzso the molecular epidemiology and functional importance of these positively selected zzso acid positions could help to predict possible changes in zzso the development of vaccines and disease zzso
