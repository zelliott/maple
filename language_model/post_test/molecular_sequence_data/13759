A single mapping resource, a zzso zzso cell panel with average distance between zzso of zzso zzso and a potential resolution of 1 zzso has been zzso to integrate the genetic map and a transcript map of human zzso zzso This map includes 141 genetic markers and 200 genes and zzso The zzso of four genes zzso zzso zzso and zzso reported to map to zzso 16 could not be confirmed, and for three of these zzso to other human zzso are zzso A correlation between genetic and physical distance over a region estimated to be 23 zzso on the short arm of zzso 16 identified an zzso demonstrating a greatly increased rate of zzso where, in zzso 1 zzso is equivalent to a physical distance of 100 zzso
