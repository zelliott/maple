We have zzso a group I zzso reaction between two zzso molecules with different functional zzso zzso a zzso zzso containing the zzso zzso site and a functional internal guide sequence zzso and a zzso zzso with core structure elements and zzso sites but a zzso zzso The zzso zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso in trans to the 3' zzso of the zzso zzso suggesting that the deficient zzso in the zzso can be replaced by an zzso added zzso present on the zzso zzso This result is different from zzso zzso by proteins where it is not possible to dissect the specificity of an zzso from its zzso zzso
