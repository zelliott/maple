We report here a novel finding that zzso can be incorporated in place of zzso in zzso human zzso expressed in zzso zzso The presence of the zzso was confirmed by several zzso methods such as zzso acid analysis, zzso zzso zzso mass zzso and zzso protein zzso It appears that substitution is distributed across both the zzso and zzso in zzso zzso zzso The level of zzso correlated with the ratio of the free zzso pool available in the cell zzso This suggests that the incorporation of zzso for zzso occurs through zzso of zzso similar to the zzso of zzso for zzso found in many zzso proteins expressed in zzso zzso
