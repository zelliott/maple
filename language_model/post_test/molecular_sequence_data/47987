zzso are specialized DNA sequences that prevent zzso zzso only when zzso between an zzso and its target zzso The zzso gypsy zzso contains an zzso composed of 12 zzso binding sites for the zzso of zzso zzso protein that are separated by zzso DNA possessing sequence motifs common to zzso attachment regions zzso To further understand mechanisms of zzso function, the parameters required for the gypsy zzso to prevent zzso zzso were zzso zzso binding regions were created by zzso of a single zzso binding site that lacked the zzso zzso These synthetic binding regions zzso zzso activity, suggesting that the property of zzso blocking may be distinct from zzso zzso We found that the number and spacing of zzso binding sites within the gypsy zzso as well as the strength of the zzso to be zzso were important zzso of zzso zzso These results provide a link between zzso and zzso suggesting that these processes may be mechanistically zzso
