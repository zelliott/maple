zzso virus zzso is the zzso of both the zzso zzso and the zzso family of segmented zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso consists of small zzso medium zzso and large zzso segments that are each transcribed to yield a single zzso and are zzso to generate an zzso that acts as a template for synthesis of further zzso zzso As for all zzso zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso regions zzso of the zzso zzso M, and L segments exhibit zzso zzso and, except for one zzso zzso zzso this zzso extends for 15, 18, and 19 zzso zzso We investigated whether the zzso of 3' and zzso zzso reflected a functional requirement for terminal cooperation to promote zzso zzso synthesis or, zzso was a consequence of zzso and zzso zzso having similar functions requiring sequence zzso We show that cooperation between zzso and zzso sequences is required for zzso zzso zzso and our results suggest that this cooperation is due to zzso zzso allowing 3' and zzso zzso to associate through zzso zzso To examine the importance of zzso in promoting zzso zzso zzso we zzso a competitive replication zzso able to examine the replication ability of all possible combinations of interacting zzso within a defined region of zzso 3' and zzso zzso We show here that zzso zzso replication was signaled when sequences exhibiting perfect zzso within 3' and zzso zzso were zzso
