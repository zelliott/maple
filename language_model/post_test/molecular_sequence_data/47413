The DNA sequence of a truncated zzso gene zzso the active zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso was fully reconstructed by introduction of silent zzso Each of the truncated wild type and the synthetic genes zzso the active zzso of the zzso was introduced into zzso tobacco plants under the control of the zzso zzso To facilitate selection of transgenic tobacco plants with high zzso activity, a fusion gene zzso both rat zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso was zzso with the wild type zzso zzso The synthetic gene elevated the levels of zzso protein and the zzso in transgenic tobacco plants as well as mortality in zzso zzso zzso The zzso protein was accumulated mainly in the leaf zzso of the transgenic tobacco zzso The results reported here imply that the zzso expression of the synthetic zzso gene is useful for the control of zzso zzso which was rather resistant to the other types of zzso zzso
