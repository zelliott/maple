The zzso gene in zzso zzso encodes a zzso of the zzso zzso small zzso zzso which is implicated in various zzso zzso cell zzso In zzso zzso is involved in bud zzso A zzso strain in which zzso is replaced with zzso shows a zzso zzso growth zzso A dominant zzso zzso was isolated from this zzso zzso cloning of the zzso gene revealed that the zzso occurred at the zzso site of zzso a zzso zzso of zzso protein zzso zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso but not zzso zzso with the region of zzso containing the zzso site and the C1 zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively, and function downstream of zzso A dominant active zzso zzso or zzso of zzso suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the zzso zzso The dominant zzso zzso of zzso suppressed the temperature sensitivity of the zzso zzso The dominant zzso zzso of zzso suppressed the temperature sensitivity of two zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso but not that of zzso These results indicate that there are at least two signaling pathways regulated by zzso and that one of the downstream targets is zzso leading to the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso
