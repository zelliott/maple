zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso and its gene expression pattern were investigated during differentiation of chick embryonic skin in zzso and in zzso and were compared with those of a zzso zzso By light zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was weak in the zzso zzso while it became intense in the zzso zzso particularly in the intermediate zzso Essentially the same zzso pattern was observed both in zzso and in zzso The gene expression pattern was consistent with these zzso zzso These results were similar to those of the zzso zzso zzso On the other hand, in the vitamin zzso cultured skin, zzso zzso of the zzso was induced and marked changes in zzso of these two zzso were zzso The zzso zzso expression was increased in the zzso especially in the superficial cells, and the gene expression was detected in all layers of the zzso However, zzso zzso expression was markedly reduced in the zzso zzso In the zzso zzso detailed zzso of these zzso under the electron microscope was almost the zzso Both of them were located primarily along the plasma zzso in the zzso space, and in the zzso In the zzso zzso zzso however, the zzso of the zzso zzso was completely different from that of the zzso zzso zzso the former was detected in the zzso zzso and on the zzso of the superficial cells, while the latter was scarcely observed in the zzso The present results revealed that zzso the zzso zzso as well as zzso zzso were expressed during the zzso differentiation and zzso much of the zzso zzso was produced and zzso from the vitamin zzso cultured zzso while zzso zzso zzso In the view of these facts, it is suggested that zzso both zzso and zzso zzso may play an important role in differentiation of the skin and zzso the gene expression of zzso and zzso zzso is regulated zzso
