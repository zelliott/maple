The zzso gene zzso one of the regulators of the zzso zzso in zzso zzso was mapped zzso zzso zzso from the zzso locus on the right arm of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso sequence of cloned zzso DNA revealed a zzso zzso open reading frame zzso a zzso zzso zzso This protein has six repeats of a zzso acid sequence zzso to the zzso repeat and an zzso zzso zzso of zzso is activated by zzso protein in cooperation with zzso zzso zzso protein under the influence of the zzso zzso zzso concentration in the zzso through the zzso regulatory zzso Major zzso initiation sites of zzso determined by primer extension analysis, are at zzso positions zzso and zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso analysis showed that a 95 zzso region from zzso position zzso to zzso is essential for response to the zzso zzso zzso zzso protein protected a 19 zzso region zzso zzso to zzso in the 95 zzso zzso from zzso I zzso in zzso and the protected region includes the core sequence zzso which is also observed in other genes of zzso zzso
