zzso DNA in the zzso zzso zzso regions contains zzso of zzso zzso the functions of which remain largely zzso We hypothesized that some of these regions might be zzso attachment regions, zzso (or zzso zzso comprise one of the few classes of zzso zzso DNA with an zzso characterized function, being involved in the attachment of zzso to the nuclear zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso To test our hypothesis, we analyzed the zzso of predicted zzso with highly zzso zzso DNA regions in zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso of the zzso zzso DNA consists of predicted zzso zzso more than half of the predicted zzso zzso with one or more independently identified zzso sequence zzso An excess of zzso predicted zzso is seen in zzso regions preceding zzso ends of zzso suggesting that these zzso are primarily involved in zzso zzso
