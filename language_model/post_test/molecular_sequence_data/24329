Atmospheric pressure zzso laser zzso zzso and zzso trap mass zzso have been used to study the fragmentation behavior of native peptides and zzso derivatives prepared for de zzso sequencing zzso zzso acid zzso peptides were observed to zzso more extensively and up to 28 times more efficiently than the corresponding native zzso zzso mass zzso of native peptides containing zzso or zzso acids are dominated by zzso on the zzso side of the zzso zzso This significantly limits the amount of sequence information that can be derived from those zzso The zzso zzso of native zzso peptides containing oxidized Met zzso show extensive loss of zzso and little zzso zzso On the other hand, the tandem mass zzso of zzso peptides containing zzso zzso and oxidized Met show much more uniform fragmentation along the zzso zzso The zzso tandem mass zzso of some zzso peptides were shown to be zzso very similar to the corresponding vacuum zzso zzso zzso mass zzso which were obtained on a zzso zzso zzso However, the zzso trap mass zzso offers several advantages for zzso sequencing relative to current zzso zzso instruments including improved product zzso mass measurement zzso improved precursor zzso selection and zzso These latter capabilities were demonstrated with solution zzso of model proteins and with zzso zzso of zzso separated zzso
