The zzso translation initiation factor zzso zzso promotes the zzso zzso zzso activity and zzso zzso zzso activity of zzso and zzso during translation zzso Although this function is zzso among plants, animals, and zzso zzso is one of the least zzso of initiation factors at the sequence zzso To gain insight into its functional zzso the organization of the functional zzso of zzso from wheat has been zzso Plant zzso contains three zzso binding zzso one more than reported for zzso or zzso zzso and each domain exhibits a preference for zzso zzso In addition to a zzso zzso recognition motif and a zzso zzso binding domain, wheat zzso contains a novel zzso zzso binding domain that requires a short, zzso containing zzso Both the zzso motif and an zzso zzso motif are zzso with an zzso sequence in human and zzso zzso The zzso motif within the zzso zzso binding domain in wheat zzso is required for interaction with zzso an interaction not reported for other zzso zzso Moreover, each zzso binding domain requires zzso for binding zzso Two binding sites for the zzso protein were mapped to a region within each of two zzso zzso acid repeat zzso on either side of the zzso zzso binding zzso zzso bound to an adjacent region within each zzso supporting a central role for these zzso zzso zzso in zzso interaction with other components of the zzso zzso These results support the notion that zzso functions by organizing multiple components of the translation initiation machinery and zzso
