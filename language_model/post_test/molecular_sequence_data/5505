The zzso zzso rat zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a rat lung zzso zzso Although the deduced zzso acid sequence showed zzso similarity with that of bovine zzso the zzso portion of rat zzso was extremely different from that of zzso Northern zzso analysis indicated that zzso transcripts in rats were expressed not only in zzso and zzso but also in several other zzso including zzso In zzso zzso analysis demonstrated that zzso expression of zzso was confined to zzso cell layers in adult zzso To clarify the role of zzso in the zzso we investigated expression of zzso zzso in rats of various zzso zzso zzso was not observed in the zzso of newborn rats, but levels of a zzso zzso were markedly increased between 4 days and 28 days of age and reached a maximum in zzso zzso In this study, we suggest that zzso plays important roles not only in regulating the relaxation of vascular vessels, but also in establishing zzso networks in the zzso at an early zzso zzso In addition the zzso zzso appears to be essential for the induction of long-term zzso
