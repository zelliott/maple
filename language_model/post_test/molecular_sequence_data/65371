zzso is a member of the classical zzso family that forms the zzso core of zzso zzso Recently, zzso in the zzso gene zzso have been shown to cause two inherited diseases in zzso zzso with juvenile zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The common features of both diseases are sparse hair and zzso zzso of the zzso while only zzso syndrome shows the additional finding of split zzso zzso zzso We identified five zzso Pakistani families with either zzso or zzso syndrome, and detected zzso zzso in the zzso gene of all five zzso In order to define the role of zzso in hair zzso and limb development, we performed expression studies on zzso in the mouse zzso and demonstrated the zzso expression of zzso not only in the hair zzso zzso but also at the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the limb zzso Based on the evidence that zzso in the zzso gene also result in zzso and zzso and that the expression patterns of zzso and zzso overlap in the hair zzso zzso and zzso we zzso that zzso could be a direct zzso target gene of zzso We performed promoter zzso and zzso which revealed that zzso directly interacts with two distinct regions of the zzso zzso We conclude that zzso is a newly defined zzso target gene of zzso with a crucial role in hair zzso zzso as well as the zzso during limb bud outgrowth in humans, whereas it is not required for either in zzso
