zzso transport is the terminal step of zzso zzso in zzso In this paper seven zzso of zzso from zzso zzso are studied on the cellular and zzso zzso Six conspicuously located zzso were zzso into mostly neutral zzso zzso zzso zzso Lawson, zzso zzso zzso zzso & Douglas, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are located in the second zzso zzso of each repeat while zzso zzso and zzso are in the zzso zzso of the last zzso All six zzso zzso are zzso in all known zzso carrier zzso At the cellular level, zzso zzso in zzso and zzso retains zzso of the zzso rate, but it is virtually zero in the other zzso However, zzso zzso a zzso of zzso capacity, remains at zzso of zzso The weak coordination of respiratory chain and zzso expression indicates that zzso is needed also for other zzso In zzso the zzso zzso synthesis is measured and zzso by using the zzso inhibitor zzso zzso Only the zzso and zzso zzso express a significant rate of zzso zzso synthesis amounting to zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso In all other zzso it is virtually zzso However, respiratory capacity and zzso c content are reduced only by zzso Whereas in zzso the presence of zzso is detected in all zzso zzso by quantitative zzso no zzso can be measured down to zzso zzso of zzso zzso of protein in zzso and zzso whereas in zzso zzso zzso and zzso the content is around zzso and in zzso the content is zzso as compared to zzso in the zzso wild zzso Also the zzso and zzso binding is virtually zero in some zzso and closely parallels the zzso zzso content, indicating that the zzso did not affect the inhibitor binding zzso The turnover of zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso is reduced to zzso or zzso except for the two zzso zzso zzso and zzso In the three zzso zzso zzso it is nearly zzso In conclusion, the first two zzso zzso zzso and zzso are essential for expression but probably also for the activity of zzso zzso still retains good transport activity and remarkably high expression of zzso All zzso in the zzso zzso zzso 254 are zzso zzso of the in zzso zzso rates to the cellular level by the zzso c factor reveals a large zzso to the in zzso rates in particular for zzso This indicates that these zzso render the zzso more sensitive to the regulatory zzso zzso ratio than the zzso zzso
