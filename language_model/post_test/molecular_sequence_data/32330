DNA sequencing analysis was used to scan the genes in a Chinese family with clinically diagnosed zzso genetic zzso Two zzso were identified in zzso 4 of the zzso zzso zzso zzso which is the possible molecular mechanism of zzso of the zzso The zzso extremely high level of serum cholesterol and the related manifestations suggested that he was a familial zzso zzso and that his parents were in a relatively milder zzso DNA sequencing revealed that the zzso had an abnormal pattern of zzso 4 of the zzso zzso zzso gene due to a zzso zzso at zzso zzso and a zzso zzso deletion zzso at zzso zzso zzso is the second base of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso changed this zzso from zzso to zzso The zzso deletion of A at 685 zzso 1) is a zzso zzso It changes the phase of zzso so that all zzso are misread after this site of zzso consequently, the protein expressed by the gene must be abnormal in structure and zzso DNA analysis of the other family members showed that the 2 zzso should be respectively located in different zzso of the zzso Both of the 2 zzso have not been reported zzso
