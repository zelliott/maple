zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso bacteria zzso is a major biological sink of methane in zzso zzso marine zzso The physiology of a microbial community dominated by zzso zzso at zzso below the zzso in the zzso zzso at zzso was investigated by integrated zzso and zzso zzso Total DNA was subjected to zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso of sequence information was assembled into zzso zzso zzso analysis supported a high abundance of zzso zzso with zzso of the assembled zzso belonging to zzso zzso zzso proteins were separated in two dimensions and subjected to mass zzso zzso zzso Of zzso identified zzso 245 were expressed by zzso These included proteins for zzso and production of gas zzso reflecting both the adaptation of the zzso community to a permanently cold environment and its potential for positioning in specific zzso depths zzso In addition, key zzso zzso including the zzso in the reverse zzso zzso (except zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso complex were zzso A complete zzso zzso reduction zzso was expressed by zzso zzso Interestingly, an zzso zzso zzso zzso and related sequences were identified in the zzso Overall, the results demonstrated that our approach was effective in assessing in zzso zzso processes in cold zzso zzso
