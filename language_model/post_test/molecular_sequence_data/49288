We previously analyzed hybrids of zzso mosaic virus zzso and Tomato zzso virus zzso that contained zzso zzso with the zzso sequence from zzso zzso In this article, we scrutinized the zzso molecules in these hybrid viruses by Northern zzso and zzso and found some zzso zzso zzso molecules and various zzso zzso molecules whose zzso were derived from zzso zzso or zzso zzso analyses revealed that most of the crossover sites for zzso were located near putative zzso structures and an internal zzso zzso zzso We zzso in zzso transcripts zzso from zzso clones of the zzso zzso onto zzso zzso along with either zzso zzso and 2 or zzso zzso and zzso Although all of the hybrids were zzso many sequence deletions and zzso zzso were found when zzso and 2 from zzso were used, which suggests that zzso of zzso zzso was lower than that of zzso zzso The possible role of secondary structures and an internal zzso zzso motif in zzso zzso is zzso
