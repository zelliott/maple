zzso zzso cells, when cultured at 30 degrees C or below, are zzso and zzso zzso cultured at 37 degrees C or above lack zzso and are zzso To identify zzso genes that are a target of this zzso regulation, a library of zzso zzso zzso zzso in a zzso zzso zzso was zzso with the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso A DNA zzso zzso from a zzso zzso which zzso with the probe zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso DNA sequence analysis shows that zzso zzso contains three tandem zzso zzso designated zzso zzso and zzso All three genes are zzso transcribed at low, but not high, temperature from zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso arrests rapidly after zzso to 37 degrees C zzso zzso In contrast, zzso zzso resumes only after several generations when cells cultured at 37 degrees C are zzso to 28 degrees zzso
