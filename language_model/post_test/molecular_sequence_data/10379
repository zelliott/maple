The use of zzso zzso zzso trap mass zzso for the characterization of linear zzso and zzso protein zzso zzso is zzso zzso mass zzso zzso experiments with orders higher than two offer a number of ways to enhance zzso zzso and to derive information not present in zzso and zzso zzso Three such methods are presented in this zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso molecular zzso zzso as illustrated by zzso produces abundant fragments from zzso bond zzso which indicate composition and zzso and weak zzso zzso products which zzso specific linkages within the zzso Through the zzso and further zzso of these fragments zzso zzso zzso products can be confirmed and their relative zzso increased to facilitate zzso zzso The mechanisms of formation of two zzso zzso or zzso zzso with another zzso isotope peaks, such as those present in the zzso spectrum of the zzso B zzso zzso can be independently established by separate zzso zzso zzso zzso in the zzso spectrum, specific for individual components of an zzso mixture, can be isolated and characterized by further stages of zzso This is illustrated by two zzso zzso from chicken zzso of the composition zzso These findings indicate the utility of zzso trap mass zzso towards the facile determination of zzso zzso zzso branching and linkage, providing a wealth of structural information not zzso by other individual methods of zzso mass zzso zzso
