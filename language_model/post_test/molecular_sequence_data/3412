An improved understanding of the evolution of gene function at the molecular level may provide significant insights into the origin of biological novelty and zzso With the approach of ancestral protein zzso we here address the question of how a dramatically enhanced zzso activity and the related zzso activity evolved in a recently duplicated zzso zzso zzso gene of higher zzso We show that the mother gene of the duplicated genes had already possessed a weak zzso activity before zzso After duplication, zzso at two interacting sites zzso and zzso resulted in a zzso enhancement of the zzso activity of zzso zzso These zzso are also necessary for the potent zzso activity, with contributions from additional zzso acid changes at interacting zzso Our observation that a change in zzso zzso function occurs only when both interacting sites are altered indicates the importance of complementary zzso in protein zzso Thus, neutral zzso are not simply zzso in protein evolution, as many have zzso They may play constructive roles by setting the zzso zzso for further complementary advantageous zzso which can lead to improved or altered zzso Overall, our study illustrates the power of the zzso zzso approach in zzso the complex zzso of zzso acid zzso in evolution and in identifying the molecular basis of biological zzso
