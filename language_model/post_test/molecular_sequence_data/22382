Many zzso agents have only a small therapeutic window, frequently leading to bleeding zzso However, interfering with zzso zzso through the zzso axis is expected to cause less bleeding zzso Our group developed a zzso zzso zzso directed against the von zzso factor zzso zzso which zzso the zzso to zzso zzso zzso has zzso effects in zzso without bleeding time zzso To further investigate the promising features of zzso we have humanized it by variable domain resurfacing and zzso on the constant regions of a human zzso First, the sequence of the variable zzso was determined and the zzso zzso was zzso The expressed zzso had a comparable activity as the zzso of zzso and its DNA was thus used in subsequent zzso zzso For this, a new approach was introduced to identify zzso like framework surface zzso since the general distribution of accessible zzso described for human and zzso heavy and light chain variable zzso showed several discrepancies with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso Identification of zzso like framework zzso and evaluation of their surface accessibility within the context of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso revealed 10 zzso that need to be humanized without influencing the zzso of the zzso zzso Indeed, the humanized zzso of zzso obtained by mutating all 10 zzso to their human counterpart, was still binding with high affinity to zzso and retained the zzso properties of the zzso zzso Next, in order to increase its half life and to decrease its zzso the humanized variable zzso were grafted on the constant regions of a human zzso resulting in zzso with an in zzso activity comparable to that of the zzso zzso
