Sixteen zzso zzso zzso zzso strains were analyzed for the chemical compositions of their zzso and the locations, zzso and organization of the zzso genes involved in zzso zzso This allowed the grouping of these strains into three major groups, representatives of which were studied in zzso Previously, we have characterized the zzso gene cluster of strain zzso zzso zzso I) and determined the function of three of its zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso gene clusters of strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were zzso and these zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso zzso zzso involved in the second step of zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso was replaced with an zzso resistance zzso and this resulted in loss of zzso zzso This zzso deletion was zzso with zzso zzso genes from zzso organisms with known function and zzso zzso Although no zzso production was found with zzso zzso genes from zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso genes involved in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso capsule zzso could completely restore or even increase zzso production in zzso zzso
