To investigate the occurrence and species diversity of zzso in waters, surface water samples were collected monthly from the Han River and tap water samples at the terminal sites of the distribution zzso zzso in each water sample were isolated by decontamination using zzso zzso zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso and then identified by zzso chain zzso zzso length zzso analysis zzso and sequencing of the zzso zzso protein gene zzso zzso zzso were detected in 59% of the surface water samples and zzso of the tap water zzso Over half of the 158 zzso could not be identified by zzso zzso and gene sequencing, and several identification discrepancies were observed between the two zzso The most frequently isolated species was zzso zzso in surface water and zzso zzso in tap zzso zzso zzso complex zzso the most important pathogen among environmental zzso was detected in the surface water samples but not found in the tap water zzso The result demonstrated that water is an important environmental source of zzso and the combined application of zzso zzso and sequencing was more reliable than zzso zzso alone to accurately identify zzso present in zzso
