The aim of this study was to extend the results of our previous stable isotope probing zzso zzso we identified a soil fungus involved in zzso zzso at an agricultural field zzso DNA extracts from our previous study were examined using zzso zzso amplification of the zzso internal transcribed zzso zzso zzso We prepared an zzso clone library using zzso zzso DNA derived from field soil that received 12 daily doses of zzso zzso screening and DNA sequencing revealed a dominant clone zzso of the clone zzso the ITS sequence of which corresponded to that of the zzso zzso zzso We successfully grew and isolated a white, zzso fungus from site soil samples after zzso soil zzso on mineral zzso zzso containing 250 zzso zzso zzso on both zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso plates led to further zzso of the zzso the zzso characteristics of which matched those of the zzso zzso The ITS sequence of our isolated fungus was identical to that of a clone from our zzso library, confirming it to be zzso zzso zzso liquid zzso and zzso analyses showed that the culture was able to metabolize and grow on 200 zzso zzso in an zzso mineral zzso medium within 24 h at room zzso Gas zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso from laboratory soil zzso demonstrated accelerated zzso zzso in treatments zzso with zzso zzso These findings show that zzso zzso actively zzso zzso in our zzso soil zzso
