zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso the fourth zzso of zzso de zzso synthesis is located in the zzso inner membrane with functional connection to the respiratory zzso From the zzso of rat liver zzso zzso cloned in our laboratory the first complete sequence of a zzso zzso was zzso Two zzso stretches centered around zzso 20 and zzso respectively, and a short zzso zzso targeting sequence of 10 zzso acids was zzso A zzso zzso containing the rat liver zzso for zzso zzso was constructed and used for virus infection and protein expression in zzso zzso zzso The targeting of the zzso protein to zzso of the insect cells was monitored by activity determination of zzso zzso in zzso compartments in comparison to zzso zzso activity zzso zzso which is a specific marker zzso of the inner zzso zzso The results of zzso distribution were verified by Western zzso with zzso zzso zzso The activity of the zzso zzso in the zzso of infected insect cells was found to be about zzso above the level of zzso zzso in rat liver zzso By zzso exchange zzso of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso was zzso to give a specific activity of 15 zzso at pH zzso This was a marked progress over the zzso zzso procedure of the zzso from rat liver which resulted in a specific activity of zzso zzso at pH zzso The characteristic zzso zzso spectrum obtained with the zzso zzso gave strong evidence that the zzso zzso is a zzso By zzso kinetic studies zzso values for zzso and zzso were zzso and zzso zzso with the zzso zzso and were zzso and zzso zzso respectively, with the rat liver zzso After expression of only truncated forms of human zzso zzso the present successful generation of the complete zzso zzso using insect cells and the efficient procedure will promote structure and function studies of the zzso zzso zzso in comparison to the microbial zzso
