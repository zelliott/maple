A novel zzso zzso zzso zzso from the zzso family was identified for the first time in a zzso zzso The primary structure of the zzso named zzso presents a significant degree of identity with other zzso members of the zzso In zzso zzso experiments showed that zzso has the same zzso specificity relative to other zzso zzso was able to generate a zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso of zzso in different zzso zzso strains lead to zzso zzso indicating that zzso is a functional zzso of zzso zzso In functional alternative zzso zzso in zzso in zzso cells, zzso enhanced zzso zzso inclusion of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso When tested in zzso it inhibited zzso either on nuclear extracts or on zzso zzso extracts zzso with zzso This zzso was similar to that observed with human zzso This work constitutes the first report of a member of this family of proteins and the existence of an zzso in a zzso zzso The implications in the origins and control of zzso are zzso
