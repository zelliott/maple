zzso the dry zzso of zzso zzso zzso is considered to be the world's most expensive zzso Three major zzso zzso and zzso responsible for the zzso and bitter taste of zzso The final step in the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso is the transformation of the zzso zzso into a soluble and stable storage form by zzso These zzso reactions are zzso by zzso zzso that play a crucial role in zzso zzso Using zzso zzso designed to match the plant secondary product zzso zzso box we cloned two zzso zzso and zzso from zzso zzso zzso that zzso putative zzso of 460 and 475 zzso zzso zzso These genes were expressed zzso in saffron zzso zzso was mainly expressed in fully developed zzso whereas zzso was mainly expressed in zzso The zzso transcript was not detected in the zzso tissue of a zzso species that does not zzso zzso while zzso and other structural genes for zzso zzso were expressed in the zzso of all tested zzso zzso To identify the zzso function of zzso the isolated zzso was expressed in zzso coli zzso The zzso protein zzso had zzso activity against zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These results might suggest that the isolated clone zzso codes for a saffron zzso zzso
