zzso zzso in zzso zzso zzso and zzso is a cell zzso zzso zzso of these worms generate a zzso growth zone consisting of 5 bilateral pairs of identified zzso stem cells zzso each of which produces a column of zzso founder cells zzso zzso Each blast cell generates a zzso clone via a stereotyped sequence of cell zzso which are typically unequal both in terms of the relative size of the sister cells and in the progeny to which they give zzso In two of the five zzso zzso including the zzso primary zzso zzso zzso the blast cells adopt two different zzso designated zzso and zzso in exact zzso within the blast cell zzso this is termed a zzso stem cell zzso To lay groundwork for investigating unequal divisions in the zzso zzso we have surveyed the zzso zzso zzso for genes zzso zzso of the zzso family zzso including the zzso zzso and zzso zzso which are known to be involved in multiple processes involving cell polarization in other zzso We find that, in contrast to most other known systems the zzso zzso contains two zzso zzso one of which is expressed at higher levels in the zzso blast cells than in zzso blast zzso We also demonstrate that the zzso divisions of the primary zzso and zzso blast cells are regulated by the polarized distribution of the activated form of the zzso zzso rather than by the overall level of zzso Our results provide the first molecular insights into the mechanisms of the zzso stem cell zzso a novel, yet zzso ancient stem cell division zzso Our results also provide an example in which zzso in the distribution of zzso activity, rather than in the overall levels of zzso zzso are important regulating unequal divisions in animal zzso
