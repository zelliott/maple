We previously identified a new bovine zzso virus zzso zzso factor of zzso zzso that was derived from a zzso of zzso Here, we report a new zzso long terminal repeat zzso sequence zzso that was obtained by zzso from the DNA of cells infected with the zzso zzso mentioned zzso zzso analysis indicated that the zzso zzso region harbors three zzso acid zzso at zzso positions zzso zzso and zzso when compared to the original zzso zzso zzso zzso gene zzso indicated that zzso promotes zzso and zzso zzso activity to levels significantly higher than those obtained with the zzso zzso Restoration experiments to the zzso zzso indicated that both the zzso and zzso zzso acid zzso were responsible for the enhanced promoter activity of zzso zzso
