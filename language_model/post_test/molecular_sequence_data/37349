zzso data from a portion of the external transcribed zzso zzso and internal transcribed zzso zzso and zzso of zzso nuclear zzso DNA were used to resolve historical zzso and ecology of true zzso zzso zzso zzso in the New zzso The 650 zzso 3' portion of the zzso examined here showed a level of variation across zzso similar to that of the ITS sequences zzso A zzso tree based on combined zzso and ITS sequences leads us to suggest that the New World species of true zzso constitute a major zzso which in turn comprises several smaller zzso A western North American lineage shows weak zzso support, but includes a zzso lineage of species endemic to the California zzso zzso Comparisons of this Californian lineage with other zzso zzso groups of the region show that the Californian zzso lineage exhibits unusually high ecological diversity for a group displaying such low levels of zzso sequence divergence across zzso zzso low levels of sequence divergence were found throughout the New World zzso zzso These results indicate either that zzso underwent a rapid ecological radiation in North America, or that zzso evolution in North American zzso has been highly zzso
