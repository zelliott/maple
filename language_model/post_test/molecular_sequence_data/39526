The scaffold protein zzso zzso for zzso C zzso 1) serves as an zzso point for diverse signal zzso zzso The zzso zzso contains three zzso zzso however, little is known about their zzso It is reported here that one member of this gene family, zzso previously identified as the zzso zzso of the tobacco zzso zzso mediates hormone responses and plays a regulatory role in multiple zzso zzso zzso expresses zzso in zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso defects in multiple zzso processes including seed zzso leaf production, and zzso zzso zzso displayed reduced sensitivity to zzso and zzso in seed zzso hypersensitivity to zzso acid in seed zzso and early zzso development, and zzso to zzso in zzso and lateral root zzso These results provide the first genetic evidence that zzso is involved in multiple signal zzso zzso
