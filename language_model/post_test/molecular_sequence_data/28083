zzso zzso was zzso to zzso via a zzso zzso bond using zzso The zzso linked zzso complex was zzso and treated with zzso zzso This zzso zzso into small zzso zzso zzso peptides and leaves the zzso intact zzso to its lack of zzso zzso with one zzso attached zzso zzso zzso was zzso by gel zzso followed by gel zzso and zzso on zzso zzso zzso Since the zzso zzso of zzso is zzso zzso degradation gave only the sequence of the zzso zzso zzso zzso beginning with zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso was zzso further with zzso and the zzso zzso identified by comparison with the zzso zzso pattern obtained from zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis of the zzso zzso peptides produced two zzso at each zzso Their order zzso to zzso starting at zzso and zzso starting at zzso From the absence of the zzso acid zzso in specific cycles, we conclude that zzso zzso is linked to zzso in zzso zzso with the zzso of zzso I and zzso II gave identical zzso The zzso region in zzso is zzso with sequences in the larger zzso filament capping proteins zzso and zzso
