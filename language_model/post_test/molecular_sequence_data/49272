zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and related proteins are key zzso in the zzso of many secondary plant zzso zzso feeding studies and zzso rationalization suggest that zzso might also be zzso by plant type III zzso zzso however, the zzso activity leading to retention of the zzso zzso in a zzso backbone has not yet been zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso contains zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso that are derived from zzso and zzso starter zzso zzso We used zzso techniques to clone zzso zzso and the zzso functions were investigated with zzso zzso zzso for two proteins were zzso One was identified as zzso The other shared zzso identity with zzso and other family zzso The zzso zzso protein had zzso zzso zzso activity with zzso but not with zzso or other zzso We propose that the zzso is involved in the zzso of zzso zzso It is the first example of a zzso reaction that does not lose the terminal zzso group during the ring folding to the end zzso Comparisons with zzso zzso and a zzso zzso showed that it is the only zzso exerting a tight control over zzso zzso The protein contains unusual zzso in positions highly zzso in other zzso zzso and zzso studies suggest that they are important for the structure zzso the zzso zzso The formation of the natural products in zzso requires a reducing step, and we discuss the possibility that the absence of a zzso in the in zzso reactions may be responsible for the failure to obtain zzso from zzso like zzso
