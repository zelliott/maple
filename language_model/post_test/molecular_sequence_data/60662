The protein zzso C zzso family has been implicated in the regulation of zzso However, the contribution of individual zzso zzso to this process is not well zzso We reported amplification of the zzso zzso locus in zzso of zzso zzso and in the zzso zzso zzso cell zzso By zzso cloning we identified a zzso and amplification of the zzso zzso that maps to zzso in zzso zzso This resulted in the zzso of a zzso zzso zzso zzso coding for zzso zzso acids zzso of the zzso fused to an unrelated zzso zzso of the zzso protein in zzso cells inhibited zzso zzso of zzso zzso but its zzso activity was zzso consistent with a dominant negative effect of the zzso protein on zzso zzso of zzso zzso and/or displacement of the zzso to an zzso zzso zzso Cell lines expressing zzso grew to a higher zzso density than zzso Moreover, cells expressing zzso were resistant to zzso which was associated with higher zzso levels, a marked impairment in zzso stabilization, and dampened expression of zzso These findings point to a role for zzso in zzso pathways in zzso cells, and indicate that a naturally occurring zzso zzso that functions as a dominant negative can block cell death triggered by a variety of zzso
