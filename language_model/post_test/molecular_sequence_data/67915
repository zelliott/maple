A potentially fatal zzso infection targeting the skeletal muscles of the tiger zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso and molecular analyses of infected zzso confirmed that the zzso zzso was zzso zzso Compared to zzso zzso observed in other zzso those infecting tiger zzso demonstrated differences in zzso that may be related to host zzso zzso analysis revealed that zzso based on different methods of analysis zzso zzso or zzso do not always zzso and suggesting that the genetic relationships between zzso and zzso may need to be zzso Transparent zzso of tiger zzso can be artificially infected by zzso zzso and the dynamic process and spatial distribution of zzso zzso infection can be observed in real zzso These transparent fish zzso are a valuable model to study zzso infection in zzso
