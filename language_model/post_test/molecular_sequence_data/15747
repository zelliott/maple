zzso virus zzso is a serious zzso pathogen causing significant global disease burden, either as classic dengue fever zzso or in its most severe manifestation dengue zzso fever zzso Nearly half of the world's population is at risk of dengue disease and there are estimated to be millions of infections zzso a situation which will continue to zzso with increasing expansion of the zzso zzso and epidemic zzso Currently there are no available licensed vaccines or zzso for zzso although significant effort has been directed toward the development of safe and zzso dengue vaccines for over 30 zzso Promising vaccine candidates are in development and testing zzso but a better understanding of immune responses to zzso infection and vaccination is zzso zzso immune responses to zzso infection are complex and may exacerbate zzso yet are essential for immune zzso In this report, we develop zzso envelope zzso protein zzso zzso and measure zzso responses to three distinct zzso in zzso infected human serum zzso zzso responses to zzso infection exhibited significant levels of individual zzso zzso populations targeting broadly zzso zzso centered on the fusion zzso in structural domain II were large, highly zzso and greater in primary than in secondary zzso infected zzso E protein domain III zzso zzso populations were similarly variable and much larger in zzso than in zzso zzso specific domain III zzso formed a very small proportion of the zzso response yet was significantly correlated with zzso zzso suggesting that the highly protective zzso recognizing this zzso in zzso studies plays a role in humans as zzso This report begins to tease apart complex zzso immune responses to zzso infection and is thus important for improving our understanding of dengue disease and zzso zzso of protection, relevant to zzso vaccine development and zzso
