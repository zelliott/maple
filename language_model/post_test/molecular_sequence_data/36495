To study the molecular regulation of zzso zzso channels zzso in the zzso we have cloned a zzso for the alpha zzso from a zzso zzso cell line zzso The zzso zzso encodes a zzso acid protein with four repeating membrane zzso and an overall structure characteristic of other alpha zzso Although the zzso shows a high degree of sequence zzso zzso with a rat brain alpha zzso zzso alpha 1), the zzso 15 zzso acids of zzso share no similarity with any cloned alpha 1 zzso High stringency Northern zzso analysis revealed a single transcript of approximately zzso zzso in zzso cells and zzso zzso A similarly sized species was detected in zzso brain, heart, and skeletal zzso Using zzso chain reaction and a primer set unique to zzso this alpha 1 zzso was found to be expressed in zzso cell lines derived from zzso zzso and zzso The zzso cell alpha zzso is also expressed in discrete regions of the rat central nervous system, including the cortex, zzso zzso and brain zzso The expression of two alpha 1 zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso cell underscores the possible complexity of zzso in the regulation of zzso signal zzso With its widespread tissue distribution, zzso does not conform to the current zzso system used for zzso zzso this suggests that an alternative system of zzso is zzso
