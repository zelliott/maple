zzso zzso sequences representing zzso zzso of a zzso region, zzso zzso of the putative zzso zzso region, and 540 zzso of the structural region of zzso Chinese strains of zzso E virus zzso were obtained by direct sequencing of zzso zzso zzso with previously published zzso sequences showed a clear zzso of all Chinese strains to each other and to a Pakistani strain zzso All eight Chinese strains examined had very similar sequences zzso zzso in the regions examined and were much closer to the Pakistani strain zzso zzso zzso than to the Burmese strain zzso zzso zzso comparisons of the three zzso regions in the Chinese strains indicated that the zzso zzso region was much more zzso than the other zzso region or the structural zzso zzso zzso from three remote geographic regions of China had sequences closely related to each zzso
