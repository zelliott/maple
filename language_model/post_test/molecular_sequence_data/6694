We describe a technique for zzso zzso by zzso of zzso genes with restriction zzso zzso zzso selectively amplified zzso sequences from zzso 2 in a single zzso that avoided zzso of other classical and zzso class I zzso zzso zzso were zzso with selected zzso zzso zzso cell lines from International zzso Workshop X and 113 unrelated individual cells were zzso for zzso and compared with zzso The present protocol can distinguish 23 zzso corresponding to the known zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and of zzso cells was made possible by using this zzso Six additional zzso zzso were identified by unusual restriction patterns and confirmed by zzso this observation suggests the presence of another family of zzso clusters in the zzso zzso This zzso zzso method provides a simple and convenient approach for zzso DNA zzso allowing the definition of zzso zzso zzso and will contribute to the evaluation of the biological role of the zzso zzso
