Two distinct forms of zzso zzso zzso with apparent molecular weights of zzso zzso and zzso zzso have been isolated from bovine zzso zzso Their zzso acid sequences up to the 19th position from the zzso were only different at the 6th position zzso and Ala for the zzso and zzso zzso zzso Each sequence was zzso to a distinct zzso clone for zzso zzso beta zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso 104, zzso indicating that the two proteins originate from different genes in bovine zzso zzso Both forms of zzso zzso beta were capable of catalyzing zzso synthesis as well as the 11 zzso and zzso of zzso Thus, at least two distinct zzso zzso beta species exist in the adrenal zzso and participate in zzso
