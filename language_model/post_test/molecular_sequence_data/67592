The zzso DNA zzso of zzso zzso affects zzso in multiple zzso zzso not only zzso zzso at stalled replication zzso but also promotes the zzso strand zzso zzso zzso of zzso Both functions of zzso are regulated by zzso zzso recruits zzso to the replication fork to zzso zzso and zzso of zzso can be zzso to zzso in certain zzso To understand zzso function, we characterize the mechanism of its zzso in zzso and in zzso Our data show that zzso is zzso at three zzso and its zzso is facilitated by the zzso zzso zzso We also show that zzso binds to zzso via a zzso zzso motif zzso The SIM region is required for zzso zzso likely by binding to zzso zzso zzso SIM also zzso with an adjacent zzso interaction site in binding to zzso zzso to ensure the specificity of the zzso These two functions of zzso SIM exhibit a competitive zzso zzso of zzso decreases the interaction between the SIM and zzso and the zzso interaction zzso zzso zzso Our findings suggest a potential mechanism for the equilibrium of zzso and zzso pools of zzso in zzso
