The control of excitable cell action zzso is central to animal zzso We show that the zzso gene plays a pivotal role in regulating muscle zzso and contraction in the zzso zzso zzso and encodes the zzso zzso of a zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso in zzso cause zzso zzso muscle action zzso are prolonged and the relaxation zzso zzso zzso zzso cause slow muscle zzso and zzso zzso The most severe zzso zzso lack muscle contraction and die as zzso We localized two zzso zzso in the sixth zzso domain of the first repeat zzso region, which has been shown to be responsible for zzso zzso A third zzso zzso implicates zzso a region involved in sensing zzso zzso change, in the zzso zzso
