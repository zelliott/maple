Recent studies on zzso zzso and zzso reveal that many different zzso of the central zzso and peripheral nervous system may become targets of an zzso zzso zzso The aim of this study was to determine the influence of zzso specificity on the pathology of zzso inflammation in the nervous zzso zzso zzso was induced by the adoptive transfer of zzso zzso cells specific for either zzso basic zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso zzso The severity of the inflammatory response was zzso and zzso With the exception of zzso zzso cells, all zzso zzso lines induced inflammation in the zzso and peripheral nervous zzso In the zzso model, the spinal zzso was most severely affected with only minor inflammation in the zzso In contrast, both zzso and zzso T cells induced a far higher density of zzso in the zzso and zzso white zzso zzso zzso and zzso T cells zzso particularly severe inflammation in the gray zzso In addition to these zzso differences, zzso specificity also influenced the extent of both zzso inflammation and zzso zzso in the zzso However, irrespective of the specificity or number of T cells zzso the major zzso correlate with disease severity was the absolute number of activated zzso recruited into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso This study suggests that differences in zzso distribution in multiple sclerosis patients may reflect differences in the zzso specificity of an zzso zzso zzso
