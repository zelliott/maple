Fluorescence differential display was used to isolate the zzso zzso zzso zzso from cucumber zzso zzso zzso A sequence analysis of zzso indicated that the gene zzso encodes a zzso zzso protein zzso in zzso zzso tobacco zzso zzso plants zzso zzso under the control of the cauliflower mosaic virus zzso promoter produced a zzso zzso in addition to zzso present in zzso tobacco zzso zzso zzso of the product, using zzso zzso showed that the zzso protein had the zzso zzso common to zzso zzso The zzso level of zzso in cucumber zzso increased in response not only to zzso but also to zzso zzso Although zzso is expressed in most zzso zzso of cucumber, including the shoot zzso and roots, the zzso treatment resulted in an increase in the zzso level of zzso only in the upper part of the zzso zzso which selectively binds zzso inhibited the zzso zzso of cucumber zzso zzso zzso plants zzso expressing zzso showed a taller stature and earlier flowering than the zzso zzso These observations suggest that zzso is involved in stem zzso
