In this study, an zzso strain of zzso zzso was constructed and its zzso tissue zzso and vaccine efficacy were zzso A clone containing the zzso gene was isolated from an zzso zzso zzso library, zzso and shown to have an overall sequence identity of zzso at the zzso level and zzso at the zzso acid level with the zzso coli zzso zzso The cloned zzso zzso zzso gene was zzso by deleting a zzso segment of the gene and inserting the zzso resistance gene from zzso into the zzso The delta zzso gene was zzso into the suicide zzso zzso and the resulting zzso was used to deliver the modified gene into a virulent strain of zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso replaced the zzso zzso gene with the zzso gene to create an zzso strain zzso Compared to zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly attenuated by the injection, immersion, and oral routes of zzso By the injection route, zzso had a 50% lethal dose zzso that was greater than 5 zzso higher than the zzso for zzso zzso zzso In a tissue persistence study, zzso was able to invade channel zzso by the immersion route and persist in internal zzso for at least 48 zzso Channel zzso that were vaccinated with a single immersion dose of zzso had mortality significantly lower zzso zzso zzso following a zzso zzso zzso challenge than that of zzso zzso
