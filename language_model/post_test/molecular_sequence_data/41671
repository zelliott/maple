In addition to their role in zzso zzso zzso serve as a distinct compartment for signal zzso and regulatory zzso of zzso Recent genetic and zzso studies have revealed an extraordinary diversity of protein complexes involved in the zzso of zzso during each cell zzso zzso in components of these complexes are at the heart of human zzso such as zzso zzso zzso syndrome zzso zzso syndrome zzso and zzso syndrome zzso Despite intense studies, proteins in some of these complexes, such as the zzso and the zzso remain poorly zzso Using a combination of zzso analyses we studied these complexes to identify novel zzso in them which might throw new light on their functions and evolutionary zzso First, we identified both zzso active and inactive versions of zzso zzso zzso zzso in key zzso proteins zzso zzso zzso and zzso These zzso zzso zzso appear to have originated from zzso zzso zzso that act as zzso either in a zzso protein degradation system with the zzso zzso zzso the precursor of zzso zzso and zzso or in a zzso system with an zzso zzso comparable to zzso zzso zzso We suggest that active zzso zzso proteins are part of a zzso zzso system that might remove zzso modifications or cleave zzso localized zzso while the inactive versions are likely to bind peptides and mediate key interactions during zzso Second, we observe a vast radiation of C2 zzso which are key zzso zzso in multiple zzso zzso including those from the zzso and the zzso complexes, such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso most of which can be traced back to the last common zzso zzso Identification of these zzso and C2 zzso aid in the proper reconstruction of the zzso zzso which are key structures in the transitional zone of zzso by allowing precise prediction of the multiple zzso and zzso interaction sites in these zzso These findings help decipher key events in the evolutionary separation of the zzso and nuclear compartments in course of the emergence of the zzso zzso
