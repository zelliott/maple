The negative strand of the satellite zzso of tobacco zzso virus zzso is a zzso zzso of which zzso domain is called the hairpin zzso The negative strand of the satellite zzso of zzso mosaic virus zzso has been suggested to have a hairpin zzso secondary structure, and we have previously shown that this hairpin domain of zzso has zzso zzso Here we report characterization of the zzso reaction of the zzso hairpin zzso zzso analyses in a zzso system revealed, surprisingly, that the zzso zzso was less active than almost all the other zzso zzso zzso In a zzso system zzso zzso however, the reaction of the zzso containing the zzso sequence proceeds highly zzso This result suggests that the inefficient zzso of the zzso zzso in zzso system may be due to low efficiency at the zzso step but not at the chemical zzso step in the zzso We also constructed a zzso zzso between the zzso hairpin domain from zzso and the zzso site from zzso This zzso zzso had the highest activity among the zzso hairpin zzso zzso
