Irish zzso dogs affected with a zzso zzso zzso designation, zzso display markedly elevated levels of retinal zzso during zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso approximately 25 days after birth and culminates at about 1 year when the population of rods and cones is zzso A zzso retinal zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso activity, a marker for zzso zzso was shown previously to be present in retinal zzso of zzso affected Irish zzso Here we report that, as judged by zzso zzso this activity originates exclusively from cone zzso whereas rod zzso activity is zzso An zzso product the size of the zzso alpha zzso but none the size of the beta zzso can be detected on zzso of retinal extracts of affected dogs, suggesting a zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso Using zzso amplification of Irish zzso retinal zzso we determined the complete coding sequence of the zzso beta zzso in zzso and affected zzso The affected zzso zzso zzso contained a nonsense amber zzso at zzso zzso (a zzso transition converting zzso to zzso which was confirmed to be present in putative zzso 21 of the affected zzso zzso The premature stop zzso zzso the beta zzso by 49 zzso thus removing the zzso domain that is required for zzso processing and membrane zzso These results suggest that the zzso gene encodes the rod zzso zzso beta zzso and that a nonsense zzso in this gene is responsible for the production of a zzso rod zzso and the zzso zzso in the zzso Irish zzso zzso
