zzso is a fatty zzso protein expressed in zzso peripheral nerve zzso where it may function in zzso stacking and zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso zzso through its positively charged surface and a zzso tip, and zzso fatty acids inside its barrel zzso The structure of human zzso refined at the zzso resolution of zzso allows detailed structural zzso including the full organization of an internal zzso zzso The orientation of the bound zzso zzso group is linked to the zzso states of two zzso zzso zzso An zzso site in the portal region is suggested to be relevant for membrane interactions and zzso zzso When bound to membrane zzso zzso has a preferred orientation and is zzso and the repeat distance indicates a single layer of zzso between zzso zzso show the formation of a double zzso in the presence of zzso and in cultured cells zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, the most accurate structural and functional view to date on zzso a major component of peripheral nerve zzso is zzso showing how it can interact with two zzso simultaneously while going through zzso changes at its portal region enabling zzso zzso
