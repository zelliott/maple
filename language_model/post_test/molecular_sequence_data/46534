Two families of zzso zzso zzso that include all known sequences have been zzso These families are now extended to incorporate a plant zzso zzso and several zzso in zzso and zzso zzso and zzso zzso Members of the same family share distinctive sequence stretches and a number of potential zzso secondary structures that would bring these stretches and the zzso junctions into relatively close zzso Using several of these zzso which have been extensively studied by either zzso or genetic means, an attempt is made to integrate the available data into a common zzso
