The zzso zzso transport protein zzso has been investigated by mutating 28 consecutive zzso within zzso domain III zzso one at a time, to zzso A zzso zzso that retains zzso functional properties, served as the starting zzso The single zzso zzso zzso were abundantly expressed in zzso coli, isolated, and functionally zzso in a zzso zzso The accessibility of each single zzso zzso to two zzso zzso was evaluated by determining the rate zzso for zzso of zzso zzso These rate zzso varied by over five orders of zzso With two independent data sets we observed zzso and zzso in the rate constant data at identical zzso acid positions and a zzso of 4 was observed from zzso zzso Based on the pattern of accessibility we conclude that zzso zzso exist as an zzso Although less certain, a combination of the rate constant data and the specific activity data with the single zzso zzso suggests that the zzso secondary structure may extend to zzso zzso Furthermore, the rate constant data define zzso and zzso faces of the zzso We zzso that the zzso face comprises a portion of the zzso zzso zzso through the zzso whereas the zzso surface faces the zzso zzso Finally, based on a combination of the zzso zzso rate constant data and the existence of significant sequence identity with a zzso segment within zzso A that forms a portion of its zzso zzso a model for a putative zzso zzso zzso interface has been zzso
