We examined the zzso and induction of protective immunity of two zzso sequences zzso and zzso which overlapped a highly zzso region which has recently been implicated in the zzso activity of zzso zzso of the zzso group zzso These peptides were zzso as zzso zzso on a zzso zzso zzso zzso G zzso zzso induced by subcutaneous zzso zzso zzso zzso injection with these zzso zzso reacted with the inciting zzso with zzso zzso zzso and with a zzso zzso zzso containing an zzso previously shown to zzso bind zzso Several of these zzso also inhibited the ability of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso levels of zzso zzso zzso were also induced by zzso and AND zzso zzso after zzso zzso The effect of zzso with the zzso and AND zzso zzso on the zzso of zzso zzso was studied in three experiments by zzso of zzso zzso rats, twice at 7- to zzso intervals with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso zzso All rats were then orally infected with zzso zzso zzso After zzso infection zzso the zzso and zzso groups had significant dental zzso reductions compared with zzso groups in most zzso These studies support the existence of an additional zzso zzso within the sequence defined by the zzso and AND zzso Furthermore, the zzso defined in these sequences have significant zzso can induce immune responses which interfere with zzso zzso synthesis in zzso and can protect rats from experimental dental zzso
