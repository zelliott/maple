A zzso method to identify zzso likely to initiate zzso signals has been zzso The method is based on differences within stability and flexibility profiles between zzso and zzso structures as zzso by a distance constraint zzso Application of the approach to three bacterial zzso protein Y zzso zzso provides a comparison of zzso response across protein family zzso Interestingly, we observe a rich mixture of both conservation and zzso within the identified zzso zzso While similarity within the overall response parallels the evolutionary zzso zzso of the best scoring putative sites are only identified in a single zzso These results suggest that detailed descriptions zzso communication are substantially more variable than structure and function, yet do maintain some evolutionary zzso Finally, structural clusters of large response identify four zzso zzso including the zzso loop known to be critical to relaying the zzso zzso zzso
