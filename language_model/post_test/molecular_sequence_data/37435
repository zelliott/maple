A zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a lobster fast muscle zzso zzso The open reading frame specified a zzso acid zzso zzso with an estimated mass of zzso zzso zzso shared high identity with other zzso in the zzso zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso and domain III zzso zzso but most of the zzso domain zzso zzso zzso zzso was highly zzso zzso II contained the zzso zzso and zzso zzso essential for zzso as well as two zzso zzso zzso that bind zzso In domain III an zzso loop in the zzso region, which mediates zzso zzso zzso had an expanded stretch of 17 zzso zzso zzso was classified as a zzso zzso as it lacked domain IV, a zzso region containing five zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis, relative reverse zzso chain reaction zzso and real-time zzso showed that zzso was highly expressed in skeletal muscles, but at much lower levels in heart, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso nerve zzso zzso and zzso zzso An zzso raised against a unique zzso sequence recognized a 62 zzso zzso in zzso claw and zzso claw closer muscles and a 68 zzso zzso in deep abdominal zzso zzso was distributed throughout the zzso as well as in some zzso of muscle zzso zzso of zzso showed that the 62 zzso and 68 zzso zzso zzso from gel zzso and zzso exchange columns at positions consistent with those of previously described zzso zzso III zzso zzso 59 zzso zzso zzso and protein did not change during the zzso zzso The zzso expression of zzso and the ability of zzso III to degrade zzso proteins suggest that it is involved in restructuring and/or maintaining zzso structures in zzso skeletal zzso
