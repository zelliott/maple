zzso specificity in the zzso is zzso in protein components of the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso In this paper, we highlight recent work on the molecular zzso of zzso binding affinity of zzso binding proteins zzso of three zzso First, we describe new zzso sequences for zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso These data enrich the conclusions derived from our functional zzso zzso we indicate how preparation of zzso quantities of the zzso zzso zzso zzso from zzso zzso has provided a platform zzso to determine the zzso binding sites using zzso zzso zzso to conduct structural analysis by CD and zzso and zzso to measure binding affinities using a new binding zzso zzso we describe the use of zzso zzso technology to prepare two related zzso from zzso zzso to test binding affinities of zzso zzso zzso Our results support a model in which zzso specificity for chain zzso double bond position, and terminal functionality is partially zzso in the zzso We propose that the final decoding is accomplished when the zzso complex activates a zzso coupled zzso domain zzso that contains recognition sites for both the presented zzso and the presenting zzso
