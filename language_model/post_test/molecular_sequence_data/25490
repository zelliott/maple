The zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso is a member of a distinct zzso of zzso genes with a wide zzso zzso Here we report the use of reduced stringency zzso chain reaction zzso to amplify and clone 8 genes related to en from 5 zzso species, including representatives of the most ancient zzso zzso zzso and deduced zzso acid sequence comparisons between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes reveal extensive evolutionary zzso and suggests that 2 zzso genes have been retained in most zzso zzso
