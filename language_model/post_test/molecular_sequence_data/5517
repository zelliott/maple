The zzso properties of two zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were studied in zzso zzso zzso using zzso as the zzso zzso These peptides have positively charged zzso groups zzso to their zzso ends via a zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso has two extra zzso groups attached to the terminal zzso group, making it a zzso zzso The zzso groups undergo zzso zzso zzso on the zzso time zzso The zzso behavior of zzso is found to be markedly zzso dependent, whereas the behavior of zzso is zzso In addition, zzso affects the zzso ratios of the zzso groups of zzso but not those of zzso A model is proposed to account for these zzso in which zzso can promote the binding of the terminal zzso group of zzso to the pore in a zzso zzso The zzso of the zzso zzso prevents this zzso
