zzso proteins in the outer membrane of zzso control all aspects of zzso zzso being required for protein import, zzso zzso and, in zzso zzso aspects of programmed cell zzso How these integral proteins are assembled in the outer membrane had been zzso In bacteria, zzso is an essential component of the protein zzso machinery, and we show that members of the zzso protein family are also found in zzso ranging from plants to zzso In zzso zzso is present in the zzso outer zzso The gene zzso zzso is essential for cell viability in zzso and conditional zzso zzso have defects that arise from compromised zzso of integral proteins like zzso zzso channel zzso and components of the zzso in the outer membrane of zzso zzso complex into the zzso outer zzso
