A nuclear factor which binds to an upstream element of the rat zzso gene has been identified and the functional properties of the zzso interaction have been assessed by zzso of the factor binding zzso zzso mobility shift zzso have been used to identify a factor which binds to a zzso from the zzso to zzso region of the rat zzso zzso The DNA binding factor is present in nuclear extracts from zzso zzso cells, but not in nuclear extracts from several other cell zzso Although previous studies have shown that the zzso zzso binds to this region of DNA, zzso on zzso demonstrated that the factor detected by mobility shift zzso is probably not the zzso zzso zzso protection experiments demonstrate that the factor binds to a discrete region at positions zzso to zzso The protected region includes half of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by T to G zzso of either both halves of this symmetrical zzso or only the upstream portion shown to interact with the factor substantially reduced factor binding as assessed by gel mobility shift zzso Transfer of fusion genes containing this region of DNA into zzso cells demonstrated that the zzso to zzso region has a zzso zzso activity which is reduced zzso by T to G zzso of the complete zzso symmetry at positions zzso to zzso The results suggest that the zzso to zzso region of the rat zzso gene contains two relatively independent zzso One element, located at positions zzso to zzso interacts with the zzso zzso and mediates zzso stimulation of zzso zzso AT 250 zzso
