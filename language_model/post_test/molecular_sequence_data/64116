In plants, transcribed zzso repeats trigger zzso interference zzso and DNA zzso of identical zzso zzso is caused by processing of the zzso zzso zzso transcript into small zzso that promote degradation of complementary zzso zzso However, the signals for DNA zzso remain to be fully zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso genes provide an zzso zzso repeat that triggers DNA zzso of zzso zzso In the zzso strain, two zzso genes are arranged as a zzso zzso repeat and transcribed from an zzso upstream zzso This locus directs its own zzso as well as zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso Previously, we showed that the locus is likely to make an zzso signal for zzso because suppressed zzso of the zzso repeat leads to reduced zzso zzso Here we characterize a central zzso in the zzso repeat that also zzso reduced zzso zzso The zzso creates a premature zzso signal and suppresses zzso zzso into zzso zzso zzso Thus, a likely explanation for the zzso zzso of the zzso locus is a failure to produce zzso zzso zzso zzso
