zzso is a highly selective zzso zzso channel that opens for extended periods under conditions of extreme zzso Over 200 point zzso in the pore region of the zzso zzso channel were generated and examined in the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso to assess the effect of the zzso on zzso zzso zzso at the zzso of the signature sequence zzso resulted in the most significant zzso in zzso zzso consistent with its role in the selectivity zzso However, greater than zzso of the zzso throughout the greater pore region also zzso a zzso in selectivity demonstrating that the entire pore of zzso contributes to the zzso selectivity of this zzso Surprisingly, we identified a novel class of zzso channel that zzso enhanced selectivity of zzso over zzso zzso of this class frequently displayed sensitivity to the competing zzso zzso This finding has led us to speculate that the zzso channel pore has evolved to balance not only zzso zzso but selectivity over zzso and possibly a wide spectrum of potential competing zzso
