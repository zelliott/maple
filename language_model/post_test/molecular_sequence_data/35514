The zzso affiliations of zzso zzso bacteria isolated from the common bean zzso zzso zzso in Mexico, Ecuador and Brazil were investigated by analyses of zzso zzso and of four zzso zzso zzso One strain from Mexico could be assigned to zzso zzso and two from Brazil to zzso zzso whereas another from Mexico corresponded to a recently described zzso zzso lineage related to zzso zzso and zzso zzso Ten strains isolated in Ecuador and Mexico corresponded to three novel zzso lineages that fall into the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso One of those zzso with representatives isolated mostly from Ecuador, seems to be dominant in beans from that Andean zzso Only one of the Mexican strains clustered within the zzso zzso zzso but as an independent zzso Interestingly, four strains were affiliated with species within the zzso zzso zzso The existence of yet zzso native zzso lineages in both the Andean and zzso areas is discussed in relation to zzso diversity and environmental zzso
