zzso zzso proteins regulate hard tissue growth by acting as zzso sites for cells, by triggering cell signaling zzso and by directly regulating the primary and/or secondary zzso of zzso the mineral component of bone and zzso Despite the key role that these proteins play in the regulation of hard tissue growth in humans, the exact mechanism used by these proteins to recognize mineral surfaces is poorly zzso zzso between mineral surfaces and proteins very likely involve specific contacts between the lattice and the protein side zzso so zzso of the nature of interactions between protein side chains and their corresponding zzso mineral surfaces will provide insight into the recognition and regulation of hard tissue zzso zzso chemical shifts, chemical shift zzso zzso zzso zzso information, zzso rotating frame relaxation zzso as well as direct detection of correlations between zzso spins on protein side chains and zzso spins in the crystal surface with zzso zzso show that, in the zzso zzso derived from the zzso 15 zzso acids of zzso zzso zzso zzso the side chain of the zzso nearest the zzso of the zzso zzso is zzso constrained and oriented near the surface, whereas the side chain of the zzso located nearest to the zzso zzso zzso is more mobile and is oriented away from the zzso zzso The relative dynamics and zzso of zzso and zzso to the surface together with prior data obtained for the side chain of zzso unique zzso zzso zzso were used to construct a new picture for the structure of the zzso zzso and its orientation to the crystal zzso
