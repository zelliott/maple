zzso form a large family of small zzso zzso zzso extensive modifications in zzso acid zzso composition and functional group zzso These zzso zzso contain a range of zzso zzso acids and unusual zzso bonds, and are typically zzso They are zzso on large zzso complexes consisting of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in a variety of zzso related zzso zzso Here we report a zzso zzso zzso deletion zzso in the zzso gene of the zzso zzso zzso in nine strains of the zzso zzso The deletion removed almost the entire zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso carrying the zzso deletion zzso incorporated mainly zzso zzso into the zzso they produce while strains with full-length zzso genes incorporated mainly zzso zzso Interestingly, the strains of zzso lacking the zzso domain also incorporated elevated amounts of zzso the precursor of zzso and zzso into the zzso they produced relative to strains carrying functional zzso zzso We provide evidence for the zzso deletion of the zzso domain without the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso Our results demonstrate a further example of the strategies employed by zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso
