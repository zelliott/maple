zzso zzso the respiratory zzso of the zzso crab zzso zzso zzso is composed of 48 approximately 75 zzso zzso zzso arranged in eight zzso zzso In this study, we used the random zzso tilt series method to do a three-dimensional zzso reconstruction of zzso zzso observed in zzso zzso This approach allowed the zzso determination of the zzso of the zzso zzso zzso contains two superimposed 4 zzso zzso structures possessing the same structural features as the other 4 zzso zzso zzso namely flip and flop views and a rocking zzso Moreover, zzso fitting of the X-ray structure of zzso zzso with the reconstruction volume shows that the zzso zzso zzso contacts described in zzso zzso also occur within zzso zzso The two zzso zzso the 8 zzso zzso have their flop faces in contact zzso zzso the main links being formed by zzso zzso Model building shows that the zzso association is the only possible arrangement which allows the assembly of the whole zzso The two alternate constructions zzso and zzso are forbidden because of zzso zzso
