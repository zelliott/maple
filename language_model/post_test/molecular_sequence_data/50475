The current study examined the effects of zzso and its zzso zzso given immediately zzso on active avoidance performance measured 24 h zzso zzso experiments revealed that, in comparison to zero or one training trials, providing mice with two training trials significantly increased active avoidance performance measured 24 h zzso this enabled us to examine the effects on retention of peptides administered immediately after the two training zzso It was found that zzso (16 and 53 zzso and zzso (30 and 100 zzso administered in this fashion both significantly impaired zzso the zzso functions for both peptides were zzso Since the effects of zzso are most likely zzso by zzso zzso and zzso has little or no activity at zzso zzso the effects of the parent zzso and zzso are presumably zzso zzso
