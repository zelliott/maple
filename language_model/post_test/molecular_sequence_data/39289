A zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso strain zzso zzso was isolated from soil from a zzso field in zzso province, South zzso The novel isolate was characterized in order to determine its zzso zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence zzso strain zzso zzso was shown to belong to the family zzso and was related to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso gene sequence similarity of the novel strain to other recognized species within the family zzso was less than zzso zzso The zzso content of zzso DNA was 48 zzso zzso and zzso data zzso zzso zzso major fatty zzso zzso : zzso zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso supported the affiliation of strain zzso zzso to the zzso zzso The results of zzso and zzso tests enabled strain zzso zzso to be differentiated zzso and zzso from the three zzso species with zzso published zzso The novel isolate therefore represents a novel species for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso is proposed, with the type strain zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
