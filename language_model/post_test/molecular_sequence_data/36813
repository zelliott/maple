The action of zzso zzso on DNA synthesis was investigated in zzso zzso systems with zzso DNA zzso zzso was incorporated into the DNA of zzso cells in zzso We studied the incorporation of zzso zzso zzso into DNA and effect of zzso zzso on DNA zzso zzso we zzso zzso that allow site specific introduction of a zzso zzso into a synthetic DNA zzso After zzso zzso the primer was extended for human DNA zzso alpha zzso zzso When zzso zzso was located at an zzso site in the template, however, zzso alpha was exhibited a strong arrest band one zzso after the zzso zzso site, and zzso coli zzso I zzso zzso also exhibited a weaker arrest band one zzso before the zzso zzso These results suggested that a mechanism of zzso activity of zzso is zzso of DNA zzso
