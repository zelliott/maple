Many bacterial species have a zzso end joining system of DNA repair driven by dedicated DNA zzso zzso and zzso zzso is a zzso zzso composed of a zzso domain fused to two other zzso zzso a zzso that zzso adds zzso to zzso break ends and a zzso that trims zzso tracts until only a single zzso zzso zzso and zzso have a zzso capacity to seal zzso DNA zzso Here, we report that zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso is zzso by the presence of a single zzso at the broken zzso zzso The zzso effect on zzso and zzso is specific for the zzso zzso and is either diminished or abolished when additional zzso zzso are zzso No such zzso effect is observed for bacterial zzso or Chlorella virus zzso We found that in zzso repair of a zzso break by zzso zzso requires the zzso module and results in incorporation of an zzso zzso at the repair zzso These results illuminate an underlying logic for the domain organization of zzso zzso the zzso and zzso zzso can heal the broken zzso to generate the zzso zzso favored by the zzso end joining zzso
