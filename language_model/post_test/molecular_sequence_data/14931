The nature reserve of zzso in central Mexico is known for its diversity and zzso mainly in cactus zzso Although the zzso zzso is reasonably zzso the bacterial communities associated with these species have been largely zzso We assessed the diversity and composition of bacterial communities in bulk zzso soil and the zzso of three cactus plant zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso approached using zzso and molecular techniques, considering the possible effect of dry and rainy zzso zzso methods were focused on putative zzso and zzso zzso bacteria, in the two media tested the values obtained for dry season samples grouped together regardless of the sample type zzso or zzso these groups also included the zzso sample for rainy season, on each zzso These zzso values were smaller and significantly different from those obtained on zzso samples from rainy zzso zzso composition among zzso of the zzso samples was very similar for each season, the most abundant zzso being zzso zzso and zzso Interestingly, the zzso zzso was highly represented among zzso samples, when cultured in zzso zzso The structure of the bacterial communities was approached with molecular techniques targeting partial zzso sequences such as zzso zzso gel zzso and serial analysis of zzso sequence zzso Under these approaches, the most represented bacterial zzso were zzso zzso and zzso The first two were also highly represented when using isolation zzso
