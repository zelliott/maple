zzso is involved in adding zzso to the second zzso in the zzso of zzso zzso in zzso zzso We isolated zzso zzso which have defects in cell separation and a daughter zzso growth zzso at the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso genes were isolated as zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso could suppress the growth zzso of zzso zzso but not the cell separation zzso Loss of function zzso of genes involved in the zzso pathway, which activates the expression of zzso genes for cell separation after zzso zzso the zzso growth zzso of zzso zzso Furthermore, deletion of zzso one of the genes controlled by zzso and zzso a zzso protein required for cell zzso ameliorated the temperature sensitivity of the zzso zzso In this zzso zzso was displaced from the zzso region to the cell cortex, indicating that zzso plays an important role in cell separation via the zzso modification of zzso proteins in zzso zzso
