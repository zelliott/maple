A zzso zzso study of a zzso zzso isolated from sandy zzso soil in zzso Persian Gulf, Iran, revealed that strain zzso represents a novel species within the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso gene sequence comparison revealed that strain zzso clustered with strains of the zzso zzso showing the highest degree of zzso zzso gene sequence similarity to zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso However, zzso zzso studies with these type strains revealed less than zzso zzso Rather than zzso differences, there are some zzso discrepancies between strain zzso and closely related species of the zzso zzso Main zzso and zzso features of strain zzso include: zzso growth zzso zzso the formation of a scant zzso to white aerial zzso and the typical zzso form of the zzso which zzso during zzso into smooth zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso acid and zzso plus zzso in zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso zzso zzso and zzso together with three unknown zzso zzso (close to zzso in zzso in polar zzso zzso zzso the presence of the major zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso zzso the presence of zzso plus zzso fatty zzso showing the diagnostic combination for species of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso acid zzso and zzso the absence of zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence revealed that strain zzso represents a distinct zzso within the zzso zzso Based upon zzso and zzso differences from other members of the zzso a novel species, zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
