The classical textbook assumption for the structure of an zzso gene is that it codes for a single zzso of more than 100 zzso acids in zzso This is also the implicit assumption in most gene zzso zzso A gene family has now been discovered in insects that shows that an zzso zzso can code for peptides as short as zzso zzso acids and that a single zzso can code for several such zzso This raises the question whether short open reading frames might also have a functional potential in other zzso in particular those that occur in the zzso of many zzso A number of these have been shown to act in zzso to regulate the translation of the main open reading frame of the zzso But there may be others that could act in trans on other biological zzso The question of how many zzso genes may exist is therefore worth zzso This poses new zzso challenges that can only be resolved through multiple zzso comparisons within a range of evolutionary zzso
