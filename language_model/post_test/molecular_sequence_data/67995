The bovine zzso zzso gene promoter was isolated and used to direct the zzso synthesis of bovine zzso zzso zzso and zzso in zzso cultured bovine zzso zzso zzso the viral zzso incorporated zzso that deleted the zzso zzso Both proteins were efficiently zzso from zzso cells in a zzso manner and the zzso so produced was found to be zzso similar to the authentic zzso zzso cell lines with regulated expression of these proteins were obtained and repeated zzso cycling of the cultures enabled high-yield production of these zzso vaccine zzso The continuous production demonstrated by this system is highly relevant to the efficient and economic manufacture of vaccines and other protein zzso
