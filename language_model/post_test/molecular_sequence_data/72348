zzso 4 zzso is a zzso that regulates growth and differentiation of zzso and zzso zzso To study the molecular basis of zzso function, we used a zzso zzso approach based on the zzso difference analysis zzso This zzso amplification technique allowed us to use small amounts of zzso from zzso zzso zzso normal B cells to obtain zzso genes from these zzso We report here on one such zzso zzso zzso induced gene 1), the first characterized zzso zzso zzso gene from B zzso zzso expression is zzso limited to the zzso zzso B cells, but not T cells or mast cells, express zzso in response to zzso within 2 zzso in a zzso resistant zzso zzso zzso and zzso do not induce zzso in zzso zzso maps between zzso and zzso on mouse zzso 7, near two zzso involved with zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso zzso sequence encodes a predicted zzso zzso with best zzso to the zzso zzso particularly in zzso responsible for zzso zzso
