zzso sequences for two zzso heavy chain variable region zzso genes and one zzso in the goldfish zzso zzso and the family relationships and distribution of these genes in individual fish are zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso zzso acid sequences of goldfish and other zzso zzso genes indicates that goldfish zzso genes show the major zzso gene regulatory and structural features zzso promoter region, split zzso leader, three framework and two zzso regions, and zzso signals for zzso to diversity region zzso and that goldfish zzso genes are not more closely related to one another than they are to zzso genes of zzso distant zzso such as the zzso Goldfish zzso genes appear to exist in distinct families, and individual goldfish can carry from none to apparently greater than 15 genes of a given zzso These results suggest that whereas the basic structure of zzso genes has been zzso in evolution, there may be substantial variation in the nature and population distribution of zzso gene families in the zzso
