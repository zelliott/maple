zzso class II zzso zzso zzso zzso complex is an zzso and zzso zzso in zzso zzso consisting of three previously identified zzso the zzso zzso zzso and two zzso structural zzso zzso and zzso We zzso and zzso zzso zzso class II zzso complex from bacteria as a functionally active and zzso zzso zzso According to an extensive analysis of domain organization and interaction of all zzso (or zzso the zzso domain of zzso associates through the zzso zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso yielding a truncated zzso complex with indistinguishable zzso activity compared to the full-length complex in zzso We characterized the interaction of the zzso complex with either zzso or zzso DNA and identified the zzso halves of zzso and zzso as binding zzso A high-resolution structure of the zzso zzso domain by X-ray zzso is zzso The crystal structure shows an unanticipated structural zzso with the zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso of the zzso family zzso DNA binding is unspecific for zzso sequence and structure, similar to the zzso zzso in zzso Our structural and functional analyses of the budding zzso class II zzso zzso complex provide insight into DNA recognition and zzso of zzso in zzso
