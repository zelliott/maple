zzso stimulates protein synthesis by increasing translation zzso This response is zzso by zzso and is believed to result from zzso zzso which allows zzso to bind zzso Here, we present evidence that zzso interacts directly with zzso and that zzso controls the association of zzso and zzso zzso zzso signaling with insulin increased by as much as zzso the amount of zzso bound to zzso This novel effect was blocked by zzso and other zzso of zzso and it required neither zzso binding to zzso nor zzso binding to the zzso zzso zzso The increase in zzso associated with zzso occurred rapidly and at zzso zzso of zzso Moreover, the magnitude of the response was similar to the increase in zzso binding to zzso produced by zzso Thus, increasing zzso association with zzso represents a potentially important mechanism by which insulin, as well as zzso acids and growth factors that activate zzso stimulate zzso
