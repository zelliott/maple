Using zzso zzso of zzso we have determined the rate zzso corresponding to formation of each of the zzso possible zzso bonds in zzso starting from the reduced, unfolded zzso The zzso zzso forms faster than any of the other 14 possible zzso This faster rate results from significantly higher intrinsic chemical zzso of zzso and zzso in addition to local structure in the reduced protein that zzso formation of the zzso zzso zzso This zzso bond is found in native zzso Our results suggest that a significant flux of folding zzso molecules proceed through the zzso intermediate with the zzso zzso bond, zzso zzso that has recently been detected on the zzso folding zzso In addition to providing a detailed picture of the early events in the folding of zzso our results address zzso the effect of local structure in the unfolded state on folding zzso
