A zzso zzso membrane protein zzso designated as zzso was isolated by zzso selection from a rat zzso zzso zzso expression zzso zzso was used as a probe to screen a human zzso zzso zzso zzso expression zzso A zzso designated as zzso was isolated and found to consist of 1933 zzso with an open reading frame of zzso zzso and assigned the zzso number zzso by zzso The deduced zzso consisted of zzso zzso acid zzso containing zzso or zzso motifs that are characteristic of nuclear pore complex zzso proteins and act as potential binding sites for zzso The zzso region has high zzso with zzso a zzso zzso showing that zzso is a member of the zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis of zzso prepared from various human zzso shows that zzso is transcribed in two zzso zzso and zzso zzso The zzso transcript was present in low amounts in several zzso zzso whereas the zzso transcript is expressed only in zzso In zzso zzso analysis of human zzso sections showed that zzso zzso is expressed only in germ cells at all stages of zzso zzso cells did not transcribe the zzso
