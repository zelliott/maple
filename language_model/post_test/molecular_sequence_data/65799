zzso plays a key role in initiation and zzso of zzso zzso DNA zzso As a first step to better understand the structure and function of zzso zzso we have determined the structural architecture of zzso zzso zzso zzso and characterized each domain zzso Limited zzso zzso of the full-length protein revealed zzso internal zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso revealed that zzso zzso and that the zzso domain forms zzso zzso DNA binding activity of zzso was mapped to the ID and zzso each of which binds to zzso and zzso DNA with low zzso zzso The structural integrity of zzso and zzso is dependent on the presence of bound zzso which was zzso verified by atomic zzso zzso and zzso protection zzso The ID and zzso also bind independently to the zzso 323 zzso of the zzso zzso of DNA zzso zzso We propose that the zzso of the protein architecture, with discrete zzso for zzso and for binding to DNA and DNA zzso zzso provides an effective means for zzso the zzso activities of zzso within the zzso
