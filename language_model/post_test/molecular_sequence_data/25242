When zzso zzso formation and tissue zzso zzso zzso zzso proceed in dynamic interaction, zzso beta zzso X zzso are shown to be the zzso zzso derivatives present during the rapid second phase of zzso and zzso zzso To further investigate the effect of this zzso a method was developed for the production and zzso of zzso zzso beta zzso X, deprived of both zzso A zzso but still capable of zzso zzso zzso beta zzso X zzso was compared to intact zzso with regard to its zzso effect on zzso zzso and zzso zzso and its binding of zzso and zzso zzso zzso X zzso gave rise to a zzso zzso pattern like that of zzso demonstrating similar zzso of rapid phase zzso The zzso constant for the binding of zzso to the zzso decreases by a factor of 14, and the zzso increases by a factor of 2 upon zzso zzso of both native zzso to zzso and zzso to zzso X zzso We conclude that zzso zzso formation is sufficient to initiate zzso enhancement of zzso zzso zzso and that optimal stimulation depends on further zzso modification of the zzso zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso stimulation is dependent on the presence of the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and probably results from altered and increased binding of both zzso and zzso to the modified zzso
