The zzso zzso zzso has been implicated in gut and cardiac zzso and in behavioral zzso zzso of zzso appear to be zzso among species, but human zzso zzso has not been zzso We isolated a zzso zzso zzso from human zzso The mouse zzso gene has been reported to generate two alternative zzso zzso that differ by six zzso zzso All of our isolated human clones corresponded to the shorter zzso zzso acid identities with mouse zzso zzso and rat brain zzso were zzso for zzso Southern zzso analysis of human zzso DNA suggested that our cloned transcript zzso a human counterpart for the zzso zzso This gene was assigned to zzso 11 using zzso chain reaction analysis of a zzso zzso cell hybrid zzso With the use of Northern zzso analysis, zzso transcripts were identified in human small zzso zzso and brain regions including zzso amygdala, and zzso In human heart, zzso expression was not zzso even with reverse zzso chain reaction analysis, although it was zzso in mouse zzso zzso of zzso with human zzso zzso induced specific binding of the zzso zzso zzso Human zzso showed typical characteristics of the zzso but its affinity for the zzso zzso zzso was much lower than that of rat zzso When injected with human zzso zzso the zzso responded to zzso zzso with a rapidly developing inward zzso The potency of the zzso to induce inward current paralleled that to compete with the zzso zzso and zzso a partial zzso for mouse zzso was a full zzso for human zzso Our data revealed that the zzso zzso has zzso differences in both tissue distribution and functional zzso
