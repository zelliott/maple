zzso is a zzso zzso protein which is deficient in zzso zzso a zzso neurodegenerative zzso zzso zzso lacking the zzso zzso zzso zzso show iron zzso in zzso and increased sensitivity to zzso stress, suggesting that zzso plays a critical role in zzso iron zzso and free radical zzso Both zzso and zzso are zzso as larger precursor molecules that, upon import into zzso are subject to two zzso zzso yielding an intermediate and a mature size zzso A recent study found that zzso rat zzso processing zzso zzso zzso the mouse zzso precursor to the intermediate but not the mature form zzso zzso zzso zzso and Koenig, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso 7, zzso suggesting that a different zzso might be required for production of mature size zzso However, in the present study we show that zzso is solely responsible for maturation of zzso and human zzso zzso first zzso the precursor to intermediate form and subsequently converts the intermediate to mature size zzso In this way, zzso could influence zzso function and indirectly affect zzso iron zzso
