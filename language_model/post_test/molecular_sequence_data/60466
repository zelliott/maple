Many pathogens evade the host immune response or adapt to their environment by expressing surface proteins that undergo rapid zzso In the case of zzso zzso products of a zzso family known as zzso are expressed on the surface of infected red cells, where they undergo zzso zzso variation and contribute to malaria zzso by zzso zzso to a variety of host zzso receptors and to zzso red blood cells by forming zzso zzso we show that a second gene family, zzso which is associated with zzso at zzso sites in the zzso encodes zzso zzso proteins zzso that are expressed on the infected red cell zzso Their high copy number, sequence zzso and red cell surface location indicate an important role for zzso in malaria zzso zzso
