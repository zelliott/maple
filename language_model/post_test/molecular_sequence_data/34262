The zzso of zzso in zzso zzso is essential for cellular differentiation and the progression of many zzso and it plays an important role in zzso zzso To assess variation and inheritance of zzso patterns of DNA zzso simultaneously in humans, we applied reduced representation zzso sequencing zzso to zzso DNA from six members of a zzso zzso We observed that zzso of zzso zzso are associated with differential zzso in zzso which provides a robust signature for zzso transmission and zzso The vast majority of differential zzso between zzso zzso zzso occurs on a particular zzso as opposed to being associated with the gender of the parent of origin, indicating that zzso affects DNA zzso of far more zzso than does zzso zzso We found that zzso of zzso differential zzso events in the family are also seen in unrelated individuals and that overall zzso can explain zzso of the variation in DNA zzso These events are zzso in zzso islands, enriched in zzso regions, and located in regions of low evolutionary zzso Even though they are generally not in functionally constrained regions, zzso zzso as many as expected by zzso of genes harboring zzso DNA zzso exhibited zzso gene expression as measured by zzso of a zzso cell line, indicating that some of these events are associated with gene expression zzso Overall, our results demonstrate that the influence of zzso on patterns of DNA zzso is widespread in the zzso and greatly exceeds the influence of zzso on zzso zzso zzso
