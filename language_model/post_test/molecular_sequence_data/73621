zzso analysis indicates that zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso first evolved from an zzso precursor about zzso billion years zzso zzso in favor of utilizing zzso was probably a result of niche expansion during growth on zzso where zzso zzso provides zzso of the zzso necessary for zzso zzso acids responsible for differing zzso zzso were identified from zzso zzso structures of zzso coli zzso zzso and the zzso related zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso at sites lining the zzso binding pockets has been used to zzso the zzso zzso of both zzso zzso ancestral sequences indicate that these replacements are zzso Hence the zzso history of molecular evolution is amenable to experimental zzso
