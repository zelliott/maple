The zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibits a partial zzso in the zzso activated signal zzso chain that controls zzso By zzso zzso a zzso clone that zzso the zzso zzso was zzso The smallest zzso of this zzso that gave zzso was used in zzso analysis, which revealed that the cloned gene was not linked to the zzso zzso The sequence of the zzso clone and a zzso of this zzso which we named zzso was zzso Although no significant zzso with sequences in the databases was found, the nuclear zzso signal and the presence of zzso and positively charged zzso suggests a function for the zzso protein in the regulation of zzso The correction of the zzso zzso is probably caused by zzso of the zzso gene in the zzso as these expressed a level of zzso approximately twofold higher than zzso or zzso zzso Southern zzso analysis provided evidence for the existence of zzso sequences in other green algae as well as in higher plants, suggesting a zzso function for the zzso zzso
