zzso are a family of zzso rich zzso some of which have growth zzso zzso We showed previously that the zzso are zzso within the same precursor consisting of seven zzso zzso arranged in zzso Here we report the zzso location and structural organization of the protein coding region of the zzso zzso The zzso gene was assigned to zzso 17 using DNA from zzso zzso cell zzso The zzso region of the zzso gene was shown to comprise 12 zzso covering about zzso zzso Each tandem zzso repeat is zzso by two zzso zzso a zzso unique to the zzso that would permit the formation of hybrid zzso proteins by alternate zzso
