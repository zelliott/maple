The mouse zzso gene was identified in zzso tumors as an integration site for the mouse zzso tumor zzso Its human counterpart encodes a product that interacts with the Tax viral zzso of the human T cell zzso virus type zzso This interaction zzso the zzso of zzso zzso in nuclear bodies containing the zzso zzso gene product zzso In this study, zzso is zzso as a 52 zzso protein that is zzso within nuclear bodies in primary zzso zzso of a human B cell zzso library for proteins that interact with zzso led to isolation of four clones coding for the zzso zzso of zzso in accordance with previous detection of zzso in zzso forms of this translation initiation zzso Another clone was interesting with respect to the zzso zzso of zzso It encodes the zzso finger protein zzso which interacts with zzso and zzso within a subset of zzso nuclear zzso The interaction of zzso with zzso is zzso through a region in zzso designated zzso zzso distinct from that involved in the interaction with zzso zzso and zzso are zzso in certain zzso nuclear bodies in zzso and zzso studies in zzso cells strongly suggest that zzso triggers zzso of zzso to nuclear zzso
