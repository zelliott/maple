Plant zzso zzso of the zzso zzso can cause severe diseases on small grain zzso and zzso The contamination of harvested grain with zzso zzso is a threat to human and animal zzso In wheat production of the toxin zzso zzso which zzso zzso protein zzso is a zzso factor of zzso and resistance against zzso is considered to be part of zzso zzso Previously, single zzso acid changes in zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso resistance have been described in zzso The goal of this work was to characterize the zzso gene family from wheat and to investigate the potential role of naturally existing zzso zzso in zzso resistance by comparing zzso and susceptible zzso The gene family consists of three zzso zzso of both zzso and zzso which are located on zzso 4A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso Alternative zzso was detected in the zzso zzso zzso comparison revealed no zzso acid differences between zzso differing in zzso zzso While using developed zzso markers we nevertheless found that one of the zzso zzso zzso mapped close to a zzso resistance zzso zzso The potential role of the zzso gene family in zzso resistance of wheat is zzso
