The zzso zzso zzso content is decreased in soybean cells following infection with zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In this investigation, a differential display approach was applied to isolate soybean genes that are zzso zzso by the zzso of zzso zzso C zzso activity and to study if the zzso of those genes is altered following zzso zzso Four zzso zzso activated following treatment with the zzso inhibitor zzso were zzso Three of the four genes were induced following infection with zzso The transcripts of a zzso zzso zzso were induced in the incompatible but not compatible zzso zzso The transcripts of a putative zzso zzso gene zzso were induced in both compatible and incompatible zzso zzso and zzso may represent new classes of zzso zzso In addition to these two novel zzso zzso of zzso and zzso inhibitor protein zzso and zzso zzso were zzso These two genes have previously been reported as zzso zzso of zzso but not zzso were induced in both compatible and incompatible zzso zzso zzso of these zzso except for zzso following zzso of zzso by either the zzso treatment or bacterial infection suggests that zzso may zzso regulate the expression of zzso zzso
