Human blood plasma is a useful source of proteins associated with both health and zzso Analysis of human blood plasma is a challenge due to the large number of peptides and proteins present and the very wide range of zzso In order to identify as many proteins as possible for subsequent comparative studies, we developed an zzso zzso zzso approach involving sample pooling for the analysis of smaller proteins zzso generally zzso zzso 40 zzso and some fragments of very large zzso Plasma from healthy males was depleted of abundant proteins zzso and zzso then smaller proteins and zzso were separated into 12 960 zzso by zzso zzso Analysis of proteins and zzso was performed by mass zzso prior to and after zzso zzso Thousands of zzso identifications were made, permitting the identification of 502 different proteins and zzso from a single pool, 405 of which are listed zzso The numbers refer to zzso zzso zzso entities present prior to zzso Combining results from studies with other plasma pools we have identified over 700 different proteins and zzso in zzso Relatively low abundance proteins such as zzso and zzso and peptides such as zzso all invisible to two-dimensional gel technology, were clearly zzso zzso of interest were zzso by chemical methods for zzso We believe that this is the first time that the small proteins in human blood plasma have been separated and analyzed so zzso
