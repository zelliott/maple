zzso variation at a major zzso complex zzso class II gene was examined in zzso zzso a zzso endemic zzso of zzso The study was conducted throughout its remaining geographical range (20 zzso 40 zzso by direct sequencing and zzso zzso zzso zzso The objectives of the study were: zzso to investigate levels of zzso in the zzso complex of a highly endangered species that experienced a severe reduction in population size; and zzso to investigate the genetic mating system by assessing the frequency of zzso zzso zzso as zzso might have important consequences to increase gene flow and, therefore, genetic zzso within a zzso The amplified gene segment had a very low zzso zzso two zzso in zzso zzso compared with other zzso zzso The zzso zzso consistently with zzso expectations in zzso No case of zzso was zzso The present data suggest no difference between the social and the genetic mating zzso
