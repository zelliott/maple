Most genes in the zzso zzso zzso in zzso zzso are regulated by the zzso zinc cluster zzso protein zzso The zzso promoter was analyzed in zzso reporter zzso to zzso some of the elements involved in the zzso zzso zzso zzso at 118 zzso upstream of the zzso start site increased promoter activity zzso while zzso at zzso reduced activity about zzso These findings indicate the presence of an important positive regulatory element between zzso and zzso and a negative regulatory region further zzso zzso mobility shift zzso on nuclear extracts from zzso zzso induced for zzso expression suggest that zzso and another, possibly more abundant, protein bind to the zzso zzso Another protein binds to a sequence at position zzso to zzso that matches the consensus binding site for the zzso factor involved in zzso gene regulation, zzso
