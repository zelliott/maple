Despite rapid progress in understanding the mechanisms that shape the evolution of zzso the relative importance of various factors remain to be zzso In this study, we have assessed the effects of 16 different biological features on the evolutionary rates zzso of zzso sequences in bacterial zzso 

Our analysis of 18 bacterial species revealed new correlations between zzso and constraining zzso Previous studies have suggested that zzso abundance overwhelmingly zzso the evolution of zzso protein zzso This zzso abundance leads to selection against zzso or zzso In this study we found that there was no single factor in determining the evolution of bacterial zzso Not only zzso abundance zzso adaptation index and expression zzso but also zzso associations zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso membrane zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso score zzso independently and significantly affected the zzso of bacterial zzso In some species, zzso and zzso demonstrate higher correlations with zzso than zzso zzso 

Different forces drive the evolution of protein sequences in zzso and zzso In bacteria, the constraints are involved in avoiding a zzso of toxic molecules caused by zzso zzso zzso while retaining important functions zzso zzso and maintaining the cell membrane zzso zzso and zzso Each of these independently contributes to the variation in protein zzso
