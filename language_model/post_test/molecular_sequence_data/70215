zzso zzso is a zzso plasma membrane protein thought to function as a drug zzso zzso Two functional groups of zzso have been identified in zzso zzso One group zzso I and zzso is associated with zzso and the other zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso sequences in zzso have been zzso to be important for determining drug zzso zzso and zzso have been predicted to bind drugs and play an important role in determining drug specificity of zzso zzso Whether or not the membrane zzso and orientation of these TM segments differ amongst the different classes of zzso has not been examined zzso In this study, we showed that membrane zzso and orientation of zzso and zzso of the zzso zzso may differ from the zzso zzso using an in zzso zzso and translation zzso Charged zzso acids surrounding TM zzso are thought to be important in determining the zzso of membrane zzso The positively charged zzso acids surrounding zzso and zzso of these two forms of zzso are zzso By zzso zzso we showed that these zzso acids may affect the membrane orientation but not membrane zzso of these zzso These results raise the possibility that a difference in membrane zzso may be a underlying cause for the functional difference between the two groups of zzso
