A synthetic zzso zzso with an zzso acid sequence zzso zzso zzso acids zzso from the human zzso virus zzso isolate human zzso zzso virus type III zzso zzso envelope zzso zzso was coupled to zzso zzso and used to raise goat zzso to zzso zzso zzso zzso serum bound to the surface of zzso zzso T cells but not to the surface of zzso or zzso zzso T zzso zzso zzso also selectively bound to zzso from zzso of zzso cells in zzso zzso zzso percent of zzso zzso of zzso from patients zzso for zzso contained zzso that reacted with zzso in zzso Human zzso zzso affinity zzso from acquired zzso syndrome zzso patient serum bound to zzso cells and zzso zzso zzso zzso to zzso neutralized zzso zzso zzso zzso of zzso inhibited zzso zzso formation, but did not neutralize zzso zzso zzso or zzso or inhibit zzso formation with these zzso Also, goat zzso to an zzso synthetic zzso zzso zzso from zzso of zzso isolate zzso inhibited zzso formation by zzso but did not inhibit zzso formation by zzso or by zzso Thus, the zzso acid sequences of zzso and zzso define zzso regions of zzso that are important in zzso virus zzso The identification of these zzso zzso zzso should facilitate the design of a zzso synthetic vaccine for zzso
