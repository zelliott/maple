While screening for zzso zzso zzso regulatory zzso a zzso zzso was isolated that zzso expressed higher levels of acid and alkaline zzso zzso This zzso was also found to form zzso on alfalfa that were delayed in appearance relative to those formed by the zzso strain, it contained few zzso and it did not fix zzso zzso analysis of the zzso zzso site revealed the affected gene to have high zzso to Lon zzso from a number of zzso In minimal zzso zzso the zzso strain was found to grow more slowly, reach lower zzso optical density, and produce more zzso zzso zzso than the zzso zzso The zzso zzso brightly on minimal zzso zzso containing zzso (which binds to zzso a zzso expressed zzso and gas zzso analysis of zzso total zzso showed that the zzso ratio in the zzso zzso total zzso was zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso standard zzso whereas the zzso ratio in the zzso strain was zzso zzso zzso These data suggested that in addition to zzso the zzso zzso also zzso zzso zzso a zzso which is the second major zzso known to be produced by zzso zzso but typically is expressed only under conditions of zzso zzso zzso nuclear magnetic resonance analysis showed no major differences between zzso zzso from the zzso and zzso zzso zzso growth, zzso production, and the symbiotic zzso were restored in the zzso strain when the zzso zzso gene was present in zzso The results of this study suggest that the zzso zzso Lon zzso is important for controlling turnover of a zzso expressed zzso that, when zzso zzso normal zzso formation and normal zzso
