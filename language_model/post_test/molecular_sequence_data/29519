zzso is a widely occurring and biologically critical zzso chemical modification process in zzso mechanisms, zzso signaling systems, DNA repair, and cell zzso The reaction is zzso by zzso which transfer the zzso zzso of zzso to a target protein with zzso zzso A family of bacterial toxins and zzso zzso has been termed the zzso in distinction to the zzso which catalyze the addition of multiple zzso groups to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso Despite the limited primary sequence zzso among the different zzso a central zzso bearing the zzso pocket formed by the two perpendicular zzso zzso has been remarkably zzso between bacterial toxins and zzso zzso and zzso The majority of bacterial toxins and zzso zzso are characterized by zzso His and zzso zzso zzso In contrast, diphtheria zzso zzso zzso A, and zzso zzso are characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso studies of the zzso core of a zzso toxin and a zzso toxin identified an zzso motif zzso zzso zzso that is implicated in zzso specificity and zzso Here we apply zzso sequence alignment and comparative structural analyses of all known structures of zzso to suggest that this zzso motif is functionally important in many zzso zzso that bear a zzso zzso as characterized by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Overall, zzso sequence analysis reveals common core structures and zzso active sites of zzso to support similar zzso mechanisms but differing mechanisms of target protein binding via sequence variations within the zzso motif structural zzso Thus, we propose here that the zzso motif represents an zzso testable general recognition motif region for many zzso and thereby potentially provides a unified structural understanding of zzso recognition in zzso zzso
