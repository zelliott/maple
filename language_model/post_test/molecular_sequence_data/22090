The zzso zzso basic zzso zzso zzso protein zzso regulates the zzso of different genes in different zzso Here, we show that zzso mediates its effects in one cell (the zzso duct zzso together with another zzso zzso zzso Both proteins influence zzso of a target zzso zzso Although zzso is required for both anatomical and zzso features of the zzso duct cell, zzso and zzso zzso only exhibit anatomical zzso We show that zzso and zzso modify the zzso zzso of zzso acting to initiate embryonic expression required for normal zzso system development and zzso In contrast, zzso and zzso do not influence zzso zzso zzso We provide evidence that zzso and zzso can interact with each other, and that they cooperate to form a complex on zzso regulatory zzso Thus, the two zzso proteins function together as one of several zzso that influence the spatial and zzso regulation of zzso
