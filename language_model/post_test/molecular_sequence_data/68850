The fully active zzso analog zzso was zzso by zzso zzso of a zzso zzso to induce tight zzso with cell membrane zzso While the parent zzso zzso was shown to interact only zzso with small zzso zzso zzso the zzso zzso although zzso into zzso zzso rapidly and zzso into zzso zzso Fluorescence and, even more so, zzso data are supportive for a chain reversal of the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso with zzso of the zzso into zzso compartments of the zzso MD simulations allowed for a proposal of the folded form of zzso in zzso with a zzso array parallel to the interface and an zzso display of the side zzso In this model, the zzso aromatic ring is heading the zzso zzso and may thus play a decisive role in the lateral penetration of the zzso at the zzso zzso In fact, despite the zzso state, its binding affinity for rat pancreatic zzso is comparable to that of the zzso zzso when tested after a zzso zzso period but zzso lower at 45 zzso suggesting that the association rate is significantly lower than that of the unmodified zzso zzso This can rationally be attributed to the tight zzso of the zzso zzso zzso with the membrane zzso Moreover, an escape of the zzso into the zzso zzso phase is energetically highly zzso therefore, the zzso can only be reached by a zzso two-dimensional zzso The observed difference in amplification between binding and zzso zzso may result from inadequate occupation of zzso zzso zzso which leads then to poor zzso to zzso zzso the data confirm that lateral penetration of zzso structures is possible, and thus, zzso of zzso zzso at the cell membrane zzso may indeed represent the first step in the zzso recognition zzso
