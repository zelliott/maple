Evidence linking zzso in zzso zzso gene 1 zzso to zzso disease suggests it functions in the active transport of free cholesterol out of zzso Since its zzso level is regulated in response to cellular cholesterol stores it is of interest to explore its promoter response zzso and to investigate zzso for their contributions to the prevalence of low levels of HDL in the population that promotes premature coronary heart zzso Investigation of the zzso end of the gene by zzso zzso analysis revealed 455 zzso additional to published zzso and predicts another 60 zzso acid zzso zzso resulting in a zzso zzso zzso sequence analysis predicts a zzso region and possible signal zzso The zzso zzso region was located by a Human Research Project zzso zzso This region contains regulatory elements that potentially control zzso gene zzso In addition to numerous zzso binding sites there are four putative zzso regulatory elements zzso Our studies uncovered three single zzso substitution zzso one in the promoter region and two in the zzso untranslated region zzso plus an zzso zzso
