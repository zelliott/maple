The atomic structure of the zzso T zzso 1 particle of the zzso minute virus of mice zzso reveals zzso projections at each fivefold symmetry zzso each containing an 8 zzso pore through which runs 10 zzso acids of a single zzso zzso The tightest zzso of this pore is formed at its inner end by the juxtaposition of zzso side chains from position zzso of five independent zzso zzso To test whether zzso zzso the zzso of VP zzso we constructed and analyzed a complete set of zzso acid substitution zzso at this highly zzso zzso All but one zzso produced zzso zzso but only two, zzso and zzso were zzso the others being blocked for viral zzso Several zzso were significantly defective for assembly at 39 degrees C, but not at 32 degrees zzso zzso significantly impaired zzso zzso indicating that the fivefold cylinder may also be the DNA packaging zzso Although zzso zzso of the zzso zzso was not affected for the zzso zzso was zzso during zzso of zzso but not zzso zzso
