zzso a zzso derived class II acute phase zzso is the product of three separate zzso (A zzso B zzso and zzso The zzso genes are expressed zzso however, their zzso can be significantly zzso by zzso zzso and zzso zzso of the promoter region of the zzso gamma gene revealed three zzso clusters of zzso that are recognized as class II zzso responsive zzso zzso analyses of these regions zzso here as site I, site II, and site III according to their position in the zzso were performed using zzso reporter zzso and show a hierarchy of zzso response in which site II was the preferred functional site, site I was the next important site, and site III was the site least responsive to zzso zzso mobility shift zzso using zzso pair zzso zzso derived from these three regions with the zzso positioned in the middle and nuclear extracts from zzso primary zzso reveal the presence of zzso high molecular weight complexes appearing 5 zzso after zzso zzso zzso zzso using zzso zzso indicate that zzso is part of the zzso complex formed on the three gamma chain zzso The binding of zzso to the zzso responsive elements of the gamma zzso is significantly weaker than to an alpha zzso zzso These findings show for the first time that zzso is involved in zzso with the zzso responsive elements of zzso gamma chain, a class II acute phase gene other than alpha zzso
