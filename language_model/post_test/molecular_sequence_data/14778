A major concern in malaria vaccine development is genetic zzso typically observed among zzso zzso in different geographical areas across the zzso zzso zzso regions have been observed in zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso surface proteins such as zzso protein zzso zzso protein zzso zzso surface zzso zzso zzso membrane zzso zzso and zzso related anonymous protein zzso 

zzso zzso was assessed in important zzso regions of various vaccine candidate zzso in zzso zzso among 106 zzso from the Amazon Region of zzso zzso In addition, genetic diversity determined in Peruvian zzso was compared to population studies from various geographical locations zzso 

The structured diversity found in zzso zzso populations did not show a geographic pattern and zzso from all gene candidates were distributed zzso In addition, evidence of balancing selection was found in zzso regions of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso 

It is important to have a good representation of the zzso circulating worldwide when implementing a zzso regardless of the geographic region of deployment since selective pressure plays an important role in structuring zzso zzso
