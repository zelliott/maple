The mechanism of zzso zzso zzso induction of zzso zzso in zzso and zzso cells differs zzso zzso Dean, zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso zzso In the zzso cell line zzso induction requires both protein synthesis and a lag period of 12 to 24 zzso In the zzso cell line zzso protein synthesis is not required and induction zzso before 24 zzso declining zzso We show that the zzso promoter is transcribed in zzso and that the transcripts initiate at the proper zzso Based on zzso experiments with these cells and zzso promoter zzso a zzso element zzso was identified between zzso and zzso base pairs upstream of the human zzso zzso This sequence also zzso zzso zzso in both cell lines on the zzso zzso zzso promoter when it was placed upstream of a zzso zzso zzso fusion zzso zzso I protection analysis and gel zzso experiments revealed that the zzso was bound by a zzso that was present in both zzso and zzso cells as well as in zzso zzso zzso Multiple zzso complexes were resolved by gel zzso with extracts of both cell zzso zzso treatment of these cells did not alter zzso or zzso the pattern of zzso proteins that was zzso The zzso promoter was at least 10 times more active in zzso than in zzso cells, even though in zzso cells both the rate of zzso zzso and the level of accumulated zzso zzso were greater than those in zzso zzso The difference in promoter activity in zzso and zzso cell was zzso by sequences that were located between positions zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso promoter from positions zzso to zzso resulted in an zzso decrease in promoter activity when this construction was zzso into zzso cells, and similar results were observed in zzso zzso zzso however, less than a zzso effect was observed in zzso zzso zzso of these studies suggest that there is some degree of tissue specificity of zzso gene expression and reveal that zzso induction is zzso in part, by the same element zzso in both zzso and zzso zzso
