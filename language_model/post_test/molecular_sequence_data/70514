The zzso gene encodes a protein that is involved in the DNA mismatch repair zzso The coding region of the zzso gene has been known to be zzso in a subset of patients with zzso zzso zzso cancer zzso Our current research characterized the promoter region of the zzso gene and searched for zzso zzso to zzso zzso the zzso method, major zzso start sites of the zzso gene were mapped at two zzso The core promoter region of about 180 zzso was determined by the zzso zzso of serial deletion zzso Although we did not find any zzso zzso in the zzso promoter region by zzso we found a zzso zzso at position zzso zzso from the zzso zzso of the start zzso By zzso analysis with zzso II for this zzso we detected zzso in four tumors from three zzso An easy detection of this zzso with zzso and high zzso ( approximately zzso of zzso cases make this zzso a suitable marker for the detection of zzso zzso zzso
