A zzso zzso a small heat shock protein of zzso zzso zzso was cloned and expressed and is zzso zzso This zzso zzso a predicted protein of 165 zzso zzso which had a high sequence identity in alpha zzso domain with various small heat shock proteins of other zzso A Western zzso analysis indicated that zzso zzso zzso recognized the protein of adults and larvae zzso at about 19 zzso An in zzso zzso study showed the protein to be abundantly present in the body wall muscle cells, zzso zzso and esophagus of muscle zzso The zzso zzso protein possessed zzso activity to suppress the zzso zzso of zzso zzso This zzso was expressed at various zzso stages of zzso zzso but at different zzso A high level was observed in mature muscle larvae zzso zzso which was much higher than the levels seen in adults, newborn larvae, or immature muscle zzso The expression of the zzso gene was zzso zzso thus responding to both cold zzso degrees zzso and heat shock zzso degrees zzso zzso however, at different zzso The expression of zzso increased gradually from 3 to 72 h after cold stress, while the expression was elevated to its highest after 3 h heat stress and then zzso These results suggest that this small heat shock protein likely plays a role in the tolerance to both chemical and physical zzso thereby enhancing the survival ability of zzso muscle zzso
