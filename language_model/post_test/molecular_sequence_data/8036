It has been suggested that the molecular basis of zzso action involves zzso zzso zzso from our studies have suggested that a G protein zzso is one of those targets and that chronic zzso treatment zzso the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso zzso This report represents an attempt to define which aspects of G protein function are altered by chronic zzso zzso zzso were treated for 21 days with zzso zzso zzso 200 (a zzso with putative zzso zzso or zzso zzso and zzso were prepared from the cerebral zzso Each of these treatments caused an increase in membrane zzso zzso zzso in the presence of zzso zzso or zzso 1 zzso zzso of acute zzso treatments were no different than those of control zzso zzso treatment with zzso which zzso neurotransmitter zzso without displaying zzso effect, was also ineffective in increasing zzso alpha stimulation of zzso zzso zzso zzso treatment did not change the content of G zzso as no change at the level of zzso zzso zzso zzso Go alpha or G beta protein was detected by zzso Although there was no change in the amount of G zzso zzso treatment increased the number of active zzso zzso zzso complexes zzso by an zzso alpha zzso It is suggested that chronic zzso treatment alters certain membrane components such that a greater proportion of zzso alpha is zzso zzso alpha enjoys a more fruitful interaction with zzso zzso or zzso
