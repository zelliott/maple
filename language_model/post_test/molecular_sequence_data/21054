Heat shock protein 90 zzso is an abundant, zzso zzso molecular zzso and zzso activity is essential for its in zzso zzso zzso of a zzso located in the zzso domain has been shown to affect zzso activity in zzso To understand how variation of a specific zzso acid far away from the zzso zzso site regulates zzso functions, we zzso the corresponding zzso and zzso zzso and human zzso zzso both in zzso and in zzso Here, we show that this zzso is a zzso strong regulator of zzso functions, including zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso the zzso alter both the zzso and zzso association properties of zzso and shift its zzso equilibrium within the zzso zzso Thus, zzso of this zzso allows the fast and efficient fine regulation of zzso
