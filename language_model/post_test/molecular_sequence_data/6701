zzso zzso gene expression in zzso coli is controlled by the zzso regulatory system zzso and zzso zzso the zzso is an inner membrane protein and a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso on an zzso zzso zzso binds to the promoters of the zzso genes to regulate the expression of zzso and zzso We describe the use of limited zzso by zzso and zzso spray mass zzso to characterize zzso and the zzso changes that occur upon zzso Our results are consistent with a zzso structure for zzso an zzso zzso domain joined to a zzso zzso domain by a flexible zzso zzso In the presence of zzso zzso zzso is zzso at only one zzso zzso zzso a zzso change that is transmitted to the zzso domain via the central zzso Previous genetic analysis identified a region in the zzso domain that is required for zzso zzso Our results indicate that this region is within a zzso zzso We propose that this loop contacts the alpha zzso of zzso zzso to activate zzso Mass zzso also reveals an unusual zzso form of zzso the potential significance of which is zzso
