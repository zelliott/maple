zzso zzso undergo polarized growth throughout most of their life zzso The zzso is an zzso zzso composed primarily of zzso that is unique to zzso zzso and is likely to act as a zzso supply center for tip zzso zzso assembly and trafficking are therefore important for zzso zzso zzso zzso factors zzso a group of small zzso zzso play an important role in zzso zzso zzso Little is known about the role of zzso in zzso zzso zzso We found that zzso zzso is predicted to zzso six zzso family zzso Analysis of protein sequence alignments suggests that zzso zzso zzso shares similarity with zzso of Homo sapiens and zzso of zzso zzso An zzso zzso zzso zzso disrupted by a zzso zzso was characterized by extended zzso growth of zzso zzso followed by cell zzso or zzso random germ tube zzso consistent with a failure to establish zzso The zzso germ tubes and zzso that do form initially zzso zzso off of the axis of polarity and frequently exhibit zzso branching at cell zzso consistent with a zzso in polarity zzso zzso zzso of the zzso strain revealed that another zzso characteristic seen for zzso is a reduction and delay in zzso zzso is zzso at its N zzso Green fluorescent zzso zzso zzso zzso to the plasma membrane and zzso and zzso zzso of the zzso zzso motif zzso the protein to the zzso rather than to the zzso These results demonstrate that zzso functions in zzso to play important roles in polarity establishment during zzso growth and polarity maintenance during zzso zzso
