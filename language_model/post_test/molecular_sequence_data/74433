Here, we present an zzso selection strategy based on a zzso zzso approach, which is facilitated by an interactive zzso tool displaying protein features from both public resources and in-house generated zzso The zzso zzso platform has been designed for selection of zzso zzso zzso protein zzso signature tags by display of predicted information relevant for zzso including zzso and zzso sized sequence similarities to other zzso zzso regions and signal zzso The zzso tool also displays shared and exclusive protein regions for genes with multiple zzso zzso A zzso analysis demonstrates that zzso for approximately zzso of the human zzso genes can be selected with this zzso
