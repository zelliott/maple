zzso of the upstream region of the zzso gene from zzso zzso zzso zzso 11 zzso revealed the zzso zzso gene zzso zzso zzso 31 zzso It runs zzso from zzso with a zzso zzso region zzso containing partially overlapped promoters with structural features typical of the zzso zzso The deduced zzso protein shows significant identity in zzso acid sequence and zzso motifs with zzso proteins of other species, zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso tests, and zzso zzso suggested that expression of zzso was zzso and dependent on zzso Four zzso genes and two zzso genes are present in the fully zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso and zzso considered the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso An zzso zzso was detected by Southern zzso in the zzso zzso zzso which appear to express zzso zzso Although the significance remains to be zzso zzso expression of zzso by a widespread bacterial zzso raises environmental concerns regarding the dissemination of resistance zzso
