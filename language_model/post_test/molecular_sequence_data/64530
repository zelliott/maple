zzso zzso is a zzso pathogen of zzso zzso causes an often fatal pulmonary zzso The zzso has also been isolated from zzso zzso humans and the zzso zzso zzso has a high positive correlation with the expression of a zzso zzso zzso of unknown function, zzso the product of the zzso zzso zzso More recently an zzso of zzso referred to as zzso and zzso an zzso zzso zzso has been identified among pig and human zzso The two genes share zzso zzso sequence identity, yet their host strains apparently exhibit different zzso profiles (for example by reference to zzso in mouse model system and host zzso In this study, a zzso chain reaction zzso technique was developed that permits the selective amplification of zzso and zzso Using this technique the distribution of the two genes among 35 randomly selected zzso of zzso zzso from various animal and environmental sources was zzso Using this technique the zzso of each isolate could be zzso assigned as zzso zzso or zzso zzso scoring negative for both zzso and zzso No isolate scored positive for both zzso and zzso zzso of zzso zzso scored zzso confirming the status of zzso as a reliable marker of zzso zzso All three zzso were found among human zzso zzso zzso scored either zzso or zzso and no zzso zzso were present in this zzso zzso statistical analysis using the Fisher zzso test confirmed that the high frequency of zzso among zzso zzso is zzso however the sample size was too small to draw statistically significant conclusions regarding the distribution of zzso among within other animal zzso
