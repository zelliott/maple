An in zzso culture system using zzso cells was employed to assess the expression of component genes pertinent to zzso junctions zzso (such as zzso zzso zzso zzso junctions zzso (such as zzso and zzso and zzso gap junctions zzso (such as zzso 33, zzso when they are being formed in zzso Freshly isolated zzso cells from zzso rats with a purity of greater than zzso were cultured either at low- zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso density zzso zzso zzso zzso on zzso dishes for 7 days in zzso to allow the establishment of specialized zzso In low cell density zzso cell cultures, specialized zzso such as tight junctions did not form during the entire culture period when assessed by the zzso electrical resistance zzso In high cell density cultures, there was an increase in zzso expression in days 1 to 3 preceding the establishment of tight junctions by day zzso When zzso cells were cultured at both cell zzso there was a transient increase in zzso cell zzso zzso which peaked by days zzso suggesting the time course for the establishment of zzso may overlap with the zzso A significant increase in the expression of zzso cell zzso was also detected by days zzso in the high but not low cell density zzso The expression of zzso was also enhanced at days 4-5 in both high and low density zzso These results suggest that zzso zzso and zzso are formed between zzso cells in high density cultures, whereas zzso cannot be formed in low density zzso A full-length zzso clone coding for rat zzso zzso was also zzso The deduced zzso acid sequence of rat zzso yielded a zzso zzso acid zzso which displayed a zzso identity with the mouse zzso zzso medium of germ cells induced a zzso stimulation on zzso cell zzso zzso suggesting germ cells may affect the zzso signal zzso zzso In zzso this study illustrates several target genes can be used as molecular markers to monitor the zzso junction zzso This system should be zzso to screen new male zzso in zzso targeted at the interference of junction formation by zzso the timely expression of genes necessary for junction establishment and/or zzso
