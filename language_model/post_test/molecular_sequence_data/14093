zzso zzso zzso may regulate zzso inflammation in the respiratory zzso It is of interest to determine which respiratory resident cells express zzso zzso and zzso from seven zzso zzso subjects were zzso zzso zzso zzso acid zzso was characterized by Northern zzso zzso of cultured human zzso zzso and smooth muscle cells, and reverse zzso chain reaction zzso in trachea and zzso In zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso complementary zzso acid zzso zzso was used to determine the distribution of zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso material was detected using zzso zzso zzso zzso and the zzso method with silver zzso zzso zzso was zzso zzso in size in the cultured human smooth muscle and zzso cells by Northern zzso zzso No evidence was found by zzso for zzso alternatively spliced zzso zzso such as del zzso 16 or del zzso zzso in human zzso zzso zzso was detected by in zzso zzso in zzso cells, zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle and zzso zzso material was identified in the zzso zzso zzso zzso smooth muscle, and zzso demonstrating an excellent correlation between the distribution of zzso zzso and the cell surface zzso zzso zzso and zzso material were excluded from zzso zzso cell and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso We conclude that the various sites of zzso protein and zzso expression correlate with the locations of zzso receptors and zzso zzso function, and are consistent with the hypothesis that zzso may regulate zzso inflammation in human zzso
