A novel zzso zzso was zzso to zzso from the zzso of patients with chronic airway diseases, by sequential zzso zzso The zzso migrated on zzso gel zzso to a position corresponding to a molecular weight of 28 zzso under both reducing and zzso conditions, and showed an apparent molecular weight of 27 zzso by gel zzso indicating that it exists as a zzso It had an zzso sequence of zzso zzso which differed from that of any known zzso Studies with model zzso zzso showed that the zzso zzso zzso the zzso side of zzso zzso at the zzso position of certain zzso zzso zzso most efficiently and having an optimum pH of zzso with this zzso The zzso was strongly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and soybean zzso zzso but hardly inhibited by zzso zzso zzso inhibitor at 10 zzso An zzso study indicated that the zzso is located in the cells of the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso and zzso These results suggest that the zzso is zzso from zzso zzso zzso onto the zzso membrane in patients with chronic airway zzso
