zzso of zzso C virus zzso is initiated at an internal zzso entry site zzso located at the zzso of its zzso zzso The zzso zzso is highly structured and greater than 50% of its zzso form zzso zzso We report here that the zzso zzso is an zzso of zzso an zzso zzso that zzso in host cell defense against viral zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to zzso leads to a greatly increased zzso rate and level zzso of zzso zzso compared to previously studied zzso zzso We have mapped the zzso in the zzso required for zzso zzso to zzso zzso and demonstrate that the zzso zzso zzso binding zzso of zzso bind to the zzso in a similar manner to other zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso translation in zzso via zzso of zzso and zzso However, zzso zzso translation is not inhibited by the zzso of zzso and zzso The results presented here suggest that zzso of zzso by zzso is not an essential step in zzso zzso Thus, zzso can use structured zzso to its advantage in translation, while avoiding the deleterious effects of zzso zzso
