Three zzso zzso zzso protein 1 zzso zzso were found in the zzso zzso zzso zzso Based on similarities to zzso which was identified previously by zzso screening of a zzso zzso library, the two new genes were designated zzso zzso and zzso zzso Mice zzso raised against each zzso protein reacted specifically with zzso zzso zzso as determined by Western zzso which showed native molecular sizes of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso consistent with predictable molecular zzso zzso using these zzso revealed zzso of all zzso within the zzso of zzso however, zzso appeared to diverge from the other two when it was found zzso into the zzso of infected zzso zzso zzso of all 3 zzso during the zzso stage of the zzso combined with their ability to bind a canine zzso membrane fraction was suggestive of a role for these proteins in zzso zzso Lastly, the ability of these zzso proteins to be used as diagnostic zzso was tested by zzso and the sensitivities of zzso and zzso were found increased through zzso zzso Taken together, our data suggest divergent roles for the 3 zzso in the zzso stage of zzso zzso
