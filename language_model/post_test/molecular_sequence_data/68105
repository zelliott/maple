A variety of zzso cell types express zzso zzso zzso Na channels zzso although the possible role of impulse zzso in these cells is not zzso zzso et zzso (1992) recently identified a zzso zzso species of zzso in type 1 zzso cultured from rat brain zzso that zzso with a zzso Na channel probe but not with brain zzso zzso zzso zzso data from cloned zzso demonstrate that it encodes a structurally zzso Na channel zzso We have prepared a zzso probe specific for a portion of zzso domain IV of the zzso channel and mapped the location of the corresponding gene zzso to mouse zzso zzso The zzso gene mapped zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso to the zzso zzso the location of the corresponding human gene zzso is predicted to be in the zzso region of zzso zzso This site lies just outside a cluster of genes for the zzso Na channel zzso zzso zzso and zzso which map zzso to zzso zzso The presence of at least four genes from two distinct Na channel zzso suggests that multiple genetic defects for central and peripheral nervous system disorders ultimately may be linked to this zzso
