Gene expression of the rat zzso Y zzso increases by 100 times, as the zzso cells differentiate into sympathetic zzso cells with zzso treatment and this increase is partly due to zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso and zzso zzso zzso 4, zzso zzso To identify the zzso element, a transient expression zzso was carried out by using the zzso reporter genes containing various lengths of the zzso upstream region of the zzso gene in the zzso zzso The zzso element zzso upstream of the Cap zzso was identified as a zzso element zzso zzso shift zzso indicated the existence of at least two zzso proteins to zzso The binding activity of the zzso zzso to the upper region zzso was increased by zzso with zzso treatment for 24 zzso These findings suggest that these nuclear proteins are involved in the enhanced zzso of the zzso gene by zzso
