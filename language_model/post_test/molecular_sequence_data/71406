We have recently isolated two novel zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso and shown that they are localized at zzso zzso junction zzso in zzso zzso We found here that zzso zzso zzso and zzso showed similar and different behavior during the formation and destruction of zzso zzso in zzso zzso In zzso cells, the zzso of both zzso and zzso but not that of zzso changed in parallel depending on zzso small G protein zzso zzso of zzso cells by zzso the cells at 2 zzso zzso caused rapid zzso of zzso but not that of zzso or zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso to these zzso cells formed a tight zzso structure where zzso and zzso but not zzso or zzso zzso We zzso found that, in zzso zzso cells, which expressed zzso and attached to each other, zzso zzso zzso and zzso were all localized at zzso In zzso L cells, zzso was mainly localized at zzso contact sites, but zzso was mainly localized at the tip area of cell zzso zzso did not accumulate at the plasma membrane zzso Neither zzso nor zzso significantly zzso with zzso zzso zzso zzso or zzso
