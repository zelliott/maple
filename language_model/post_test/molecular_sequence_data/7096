This study investigates whether insulin (a differentiation factor for lens zzso zzso acts as a survival zzso In the absence of insulin, zzso embryonic chicken lens zzso zzso undergo zzso as shown by changes in cell zzso DNA zzso and loss of zzso blue zzso zzso zzso these changes and promotes survival of the zzso zzso acid suppresses the zzso of lens zzso In contrast to zzso embryonic zzso zzso embryonic zzso survive in the absence of insulin, presumably due to an zzso survival zzso To explore the mechanism of the action of insulin as a survival factor for zzso embryonic lens zzso we compared the pattern of cell cycle markers zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso lens zzso In the presence of insulin, the expression of zzso and zzso was zzso after an initial zzso zzso of these genes was also induced in the absence of insulin, but zzso levels remained elevated as the cells underwent zzso In contrast, expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso B showed only minor differences in zzso and zzso zzso Since zzso and zzso have been shown to play a role in zzso in other cell types, the ability of insulin to regulate expression of these genes may be central to its ability to act as a survival factor for lens zzso zzso
