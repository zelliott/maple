A variety of cells including cardiac zzso and zzso cells possess inwardly zzso zzso zzso channels through which currents flow more readily in the inward direction than zzso These zzso channels play pivotal roles in maintenance of the resting membrane potential, in regulation of the action potential zzso in zzso zzso of cellular zzso and in the zzso and zzso of zzso zzso across cell zzso Recent molecular biological dissection has shown that the zzso zzso zzso channels constitute a new family of zzso channels whose zzso contain two putative zzso zzso and a zzso zzso So far, more than ten zzso of zzso channel zzso have been isolated and classified into four zzso 1) zzso zzso zzso 2) zzso zzso zzso 3) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and 4) zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso injected with the zzso of zzso elicit classical zzso channel zzso zzso as zzso compose the G zzso zzso zzso channels, which are regulated by a variety of zzso zzso neurotransmitter receptors such as zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are characterized with a Walker zzso zzso motif in their zzso zzso and may be involved in zzso transport in zzso zzso and brain zzso zzso zzso and zzso form with zzso zzso the so-called zzso zzso zzso Thus, it is a feature of the zzso channel family that each zzso plays a specific zzso functional zzso The zzso zzso channels identified zzso in zzso and cardiac zzso have not yet been zzso In this review, we zzso the current zzso of the features of the molecular structures and functions of the four main zzso of zzso zzso
