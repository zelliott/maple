We analyzed zzso major zzso complex zzso class II interactions with zzso and zzso zzso gene zzso zzso fusion proteins termed zzso and zzso zzso bound zzso class II molecules expressed on the cell surface only when used in the zzso zzso This weak zzso binding was specific, since it was inhibited by zzso and zzso class II zzso zzso bound zzso class II molecules with intermediate zzso zzso zzso 60 zzso at 37 degrees zzso Using zzso as a competitor in a zzso class zzso cellular zzso zzso we showed that this zzso zzso was able to block zzso class II zzso In contrast, no zzso was observed in a zzso class zzso T cell zzso zzso Together, these results suggest that zzso of the zzso with zzso alters the zzso class II molecular interaction to become insensitive to zzso zzso
