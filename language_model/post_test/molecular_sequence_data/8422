zzso activity on zzso cells is a critical zzso of the fate T cells when the T cell receptors are engaged by zzso zzso zzso control of the expression of the zzso molecules regulates T cell zzso While several types of interactions between T cells and B cells zzso zzso molecules on zzso cell, no T cell surface molecules have been implicated in zzso the induction of the zzso molecules on B zzso Here we characterize a new zzso zzso zzso which zzso T cell proliferation to selective zzso T cells zzso by zzso together with zzso zzso are zzso to further stimulation through the zzso which suggests that the zzso zzso interferes with the delivery of the zzso activity to T zzso zzso with this notion, zzso zzso zzso completely zzso the induction of zzso on B zzso zzso of several T cell surface molecules such as zzso and zzso zzso was largely zzso As this zzso requires a zzso zzso zzso and does not require binding of more than 50% of zzso molecules on T cell surface, we suggest that zzso may mediate a negative signaling zzso which zzso the zzso induction of zzso activity, including expression of zzso zzso zzso
