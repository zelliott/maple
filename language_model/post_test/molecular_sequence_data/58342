To provide new insights into zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was used to test the role of several zzso in the first four zzso zzso zzso of the human A1 zzso Based on multiple sequence analysis of all known zzso both zzso zzso acid and zzso zzso and polar zzso zzso and zzso zzso acids were identified that could potentially play a role in binding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso 141 zzso were identified in all zzso and zzso and zzso zzso were identified in all A1 zzso To test the role of these zzso each was individually zzso to zzso When zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were tested, affinities for zzso zzso and zzso zzso were similar to those seen for the zzso zzso After conversion of zzso to zzso the affinity for zzso and other zzso fell zzso whereas the affinity for zzso and other zzso was not zzso After conversion of zzso to zzso the affinity for zzso and other zzso increased zzso or zzso zzso whereas the affinity for zzso and other zzso was not zzso Studies of the zzso construct also revealed that zzso is responsible for zzso regulation of binding by sodium because the affinity for zzso did not change over broad ranges of sodium zzso When zzso was converted to zzso A1 zzso zzso was present on stable cell zzso however, functional binding sites could not be zzso When zzso was converted to zzso the affinity for some zzso zzso zzso These data show that zzso in zzso and zzso in zzso play important roles in zzso zzso interactions and show that zzso is responsible for zzso regulation of zzso zzso binding by zzso We also identify zzso as an important site for zzso zzso
