In past, numerous methods have been developed for predicting efficacy of short interfering zzso zzso However these methods have been developed for predicting efficacy of fully complementary zzso against a zzso Best of author's knowledge no method has been developed for predicting efficacy of mismatch zzso against a zzso In this study, a systematic attempt has been made to identify highly effective complementary as well as mismatch zzso for zzso a zzso zzso machine zzso based models have been developed for predicting efficacy of zzso using zzso zzso and hybrid pattern zzso We achieved maximum correlation zzso between predicted and actual efficacy of zzso using hybrid zzso All models were trained and tested on a zzso of zzso zzso and performance was evaluated using zzso cross validation zzso The performance of our method zzso is comparable to other well-known zzso In this study, first time attempt has been made to design zzso zzso zzso zzso In this approach we zzso a given zzso on all possible zzso with all possible zzso zzso of each zzso zzso is predicted using our method zzso It is well known from literature that zzso between zzso and target affects the zzso zzso Thus we have incorporated the rules derived from base zzso experimental data to find out over all efficacy of zzso or mismatch zzso Finally we developed a zzso zzso zzso for designing highly effective zzso for zzso a zzso This tool will be helpful to design zzso to degrade disease zzso of zzso single zzso zzso gene without depleting the wild type zzso
