Bone zzso protein zzso expression and signaling are altered in a variety of zzso but the functional impact of these zzso is zzso In this study we investigated the impact of expression of multiple zzso and their signaling zzso components in human zzso zzso zzso messages, in particular zzso were detected in normal and zzso B zzso zzso of zzso zzso inhibited DNA synthesis in most zzso cell lines zzso but some cell lines were zzso zzso specimens from three out of five zzso patients were also resistant to zzso as determined by no zzso of the zzso zzso zzso We have previously shown that zzso zzso induced zzso in normal B cells, which was in contrast to no or little zzso effect of this zzso in the zzso cells zzso zzso mechanisms were investigated by comparing sensitive and resistant cell zzso While zzso receptors are zzso in many zzso we documented similar zzso levels in resistant and sensitive zzso zzso We found a positive correlation between zzso of zzso and zzso of DNA zzso Gene expression analysis of two independent data sets showed that the levels of zzso zzso varied across different zzso zzso Furthermore, stable zzso of zzso in two different zzso cell lines with low zzso levels of zzso rendered them completely resistant to zzso This work highlights the role of zzso in determining the sensitivity to zzso and shows that zzso of zzso in cancer cells is sufficient to escape the negative effects of zzso
