We have examined the mechanism of signal zzso by the zzso zzso alpha 6 beta 4, a zzso zzso involved in zzso and tumor zzso zzso and immune complex zzso zzso indicated that zzso or zzso zzso of alpha 6 beta 4 causes zzso zzso of the beta 4 zzso in intact cells and that this event is zzso by a protein zzso physically associated with the zzso zzso and zzso fusion protein binding experiments showed that the zzso protein zzso forms a complex with the zzso beta 4 zzso zzso is then zzso on zzso zzso and recruits the zzso zzso thereby potentially linking alpha 6 beta 4 to the zzso zzso The beta 4 zzso was found to be zzso at multiple zzso zzso in zzso including a zzso zzso motif zzso resembling those found in T and B cell zzso zzso zzso at the beta 4 zzso disrupted association of alpha 6 beta 4 with zzso but did not interfere with zzso zzso of zzso and recruitment of zzso These results indicate that signal zzso by the alpha 6 beta 4 zzso is zzso by an associated zzso zzso and that zzso of distinct sites in the beta 4 tail mediates assembly of the zzso zzso and recruitment of zzso
