As part of a study of zzso proteins involved in zzso embryonic development, we have undertaken the molecular analysis of a zzso zzso zzso protein zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Field, and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Cell zzso zzso Analysis of zzso clones zzso this protein revealed that it represents a new class of unconventional zzso heavy zzso The zzso two thirds of the protein comprises a head domain that is zzso identical zzso zzso to other zzso heads, and contains zzso zzso and zzso light zzso zzso The zzso tail has no significant similarity to other known zzso tails, but does contain a approximately zzso acid region that is predicted to form an zzso zzso Since the unique gene that encodes this protein maps to the zzso map position zzso we have named the new gene zzso zzso zzso heavy chain zzso zzso The expression profile of the zzso zzso gene is zzso zzso of multiple zzso reveals that transcripts are alternatively spliced and zzso at least three protein zzso in addition, a fourth zzso is detected on Western zzso zzso Northern and Western blots show that transcripts and protein are present throughout the life cycle, with peak expression occurring during zzso and zzso zzso in early zzso demonstrates that the protein is primarily located in a zzso pattern throughout the peripheral zzso Most cells maintain a low level of protein expression throughout zzso but specific zzso appear to contain more zzso We speculate that the zzso zzso protein zzso are involved in multiple dynamic processes during zzso zzso
