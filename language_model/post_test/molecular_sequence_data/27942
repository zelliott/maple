zzso steroid zzso zzso is a zzso relatively mild disorder of cortisol zzso characterized by variable signs of zzso zzso zzso It is inherited as an zzso zzso of the zzso gene zzso the zzso zzso zzso is located in the zzso zzso complex, and a zzso zzso is often associated with characteristic zzso zzso zzso A zzso gene from a zzso zzso patient with zzso zzso zzso was cloned and zzso Five zzso from the normal sequence of zzso were found, but only one appeared likely to affect the functional integrity of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was changed to zzso zzso An zzso probe was constructed corresponding to the zzso sequence surrounding zzso 281 and zzso with DNA samples zzso with restriction zzso zzso zzso zzso from 8 zzso zzso zzso patients carrying zzso contained a zzso zzso zzso zzso long, indicating presence of the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso In contrast, unaffected individuals and one patient who lacked zzso showed no evidence of the zzso zzso in zzso We conclude that the zzso 281 zzso is a consistent molecular genetic marker for zzso zzso zzso associated with zzso
