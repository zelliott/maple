zzso T4 zzso zzso is one of a class of zzso zzso that resolve zzso zzso in DNA zzso The sequence of this protein suggests a modular zzso We have expressed a synthetic gene zzso zzso zzso which has been used in a directed zzso exercise, with the aim of understanding the role of different sections of the protein zzso zzso the zzso end of the protein lies a section of zzso in which four zzso zzso distributed in a zzso pattern zzso one atom of zzso The zzso section composed of zzso acid zzso 1 to 65 isolated from the remaining zzso section also binds one mole of zzso suggesting that this region folds zzso zzso shows that the outer zzso zzso are essential for zinc zzso while the inner zzso zzso are partially zzso in that either one of the two (but not zzso can be replaced while retaining some zzso The activity as a zzso zzso correlated zzso with the presence of the zzso In the zzso part of the protein lies a section that is zzso identical with a sequence found in the DNA repair protein T4 zzso zzso We can replace the section of T4 zzso zzso with the corresponding sequence from T4 zzso V with no change in the pattern of zzso on zzso zzso The evidence supports a modular construction for T4 zzso zzso
