zzso soil microbial zzso were screened for zzso zzso or olive oil zzso using zzso plates supplemented with the corresponding zzso A zzso zzso zzso strain displaying activity on zzso was selected and further zzso Analysis of the zzso and zzso traits of the strain placed it as a member of the zzso zzso Further zzso zzso sequencing revealed a zzso identity to zzso zzso The strain displayed zzso activity on zzso zzso of short chain zzso with cell extract zzso having highest activity, as confirmed by the presence, after zzso analysis, of a zzso zzso zzso protein band with activity on zzso zzso The presence of such a zzso zzso similar to those found in other zzso bacteria, indicates that the strain could be of interest for certain zzso applications, like the synthesis of pharmaceuticals or zzso zzso
