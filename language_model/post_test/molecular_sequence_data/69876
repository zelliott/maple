zzso syndrome zzso is one of several syndromes associated with deletions within the zzso zzso of zzso zzso The region of zzso zzso responsible for the zzso syndromes (the zzso Critical Region or zzso has been mapped using zzso quantitative Southern zzso and zzso Similar deletions are seen in the zzso syndrome zzso and familial zzso heart zzso It is not known whether the zzso spectrum is the result of the zzso of one gene or whether it is a consequence of zzso genes being zzso However, the majority of patients have a large zzso zzso zzso zzso In this paper we report the isolation of a zzso lab name zzso zzso a zzso rich protein of unknown function which maps to the commonly deleted region of zzso zzso Studies in the mouse indicate that it maps to zzso and is expressed during early zzso Although not mapping within the shortest region of overlap for zzso and therefore not the major gene involved in zzso the expression pattern suggests that this gene may be involved in zzso the zzso zzso of zzso zzso
