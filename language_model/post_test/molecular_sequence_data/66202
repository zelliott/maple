zzso factors promote zzso zzso survival through increased zzso calcium zzso and regulation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso is one of the well established mechanisms involved in MN zzso The zzso complex interacts with and zzso the functionality of a large number of zzso including zzso protein zzso such as zzso protein zzso zzso Using a primary culture of embryonic chicken spinal zzso zzso we investigated the role of zzso in zzso this zzso We cloned chicken zzso and demonstrated its expression in zzso zzso by means of reverse zzso Western zzso and zzso Using zzso zzso we show that zzso zzso mediates cell survival induced by zzso factors or membrane zzso The survival effect is independent of zzso zzso zzso however, zzso functionality depends on the presence of zzso Finally, zzso associates to the zzso zzso of zzso zzso in a zzso manner, suggesting a role in regulating zzso zzso zzso
