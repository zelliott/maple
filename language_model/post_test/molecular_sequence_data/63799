The zzso zzso is a zzso complex essential for zzso processing and zzso It has recently been shown that the zzso activity of the zzso zzso core can be mapped to a single zzso zzso which zzso degrades zzso zzso as well as zzso containing secondary zzso Here we present the zzso A resolution crystal structure of zzso zzso zzso in complex with zzso zzso Although zzso has a linear domain organization similar to bacterial zzso II, in three dimensions the zzso have a different zzso The three zzso of the classical zzso zzso fold are positioned on the zzso domain such that the zzso path observed in zzso II is zzso Instead, zzso is threaded to the zzso site via an alternative route suggesting a mechanism for zzso zzso The structure provides a molecular rationale for the observed zzso properties of the zzso R family of zzso
