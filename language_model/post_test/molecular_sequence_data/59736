Using a series of new zzso zzso we constructed a set of zzso zzso viruses zzso zzso the zzso T cell zzso molecules zzso or zzso or both together in the same zzso On infection with replication incompetent and zzso zzso several zzso cell lines expressed the respective molecules and bound to zzso The highest binding capacity was found when both zzso molecules were zzso Mouse zzso melanoma cells expressing zzso or zzso provided effective zzso for proliferation of resting zzso T cells in the presence of zzso A and zzso zzso cell zzso zzso zzso If zzso and zzso were delivered together on the same cell, the zzso response of zzso T cells increased zzso The zzso effect could be blocked with zzso the soluble zzso for B7 zzso The possibility of engineering zzso cells using zzso holds implications for the future design of vaccination zzso
