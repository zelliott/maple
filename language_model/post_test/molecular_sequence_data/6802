The zzso sequence of a zzso zzso portion within the unique short zzso region of the zzso zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso is zzso A partial and a complete open reading frame zzso were found within this zzso zzso The partial zzso encodes the C zzso zzso zzso zzso of a protein zzso which is highly zzso in the zzso zzso virus type 1 zzso and type 2 zzso and zzso agent 8 zzso Us zzso The complete zzso is located 3' to the partial zzso within the zzso zzso sequence and encodes a zzso zzso acid zzso which appears to be closely related to the zzso zzso G zzso but shares little zzso acid similarity with zzso of zzso and zzso However, the complete zzso shares certain features zzso among most zzso zzso notably three highly zzso zzso zzso and an adjacent zzso zzso zzso it was concluded that this complete zzso encodes the zzso zzso The zzso zzso acid zzso portion of zzso zzso was expressed in zzso coli as a fusion protein and this was detected by zzso with zzso from zzso monkeys which were either zzso or naturally infected with zzso The zzso fusion protein was zzso into rabbits to raise an zzso which recognized a number of apparently zzso zzso protein bands in extracts from zzso zzso zzso
