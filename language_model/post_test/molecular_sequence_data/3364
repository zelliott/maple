The zzso family zzso proteins are putative receptors for zzso which are implicated in the zzso of animal zzso including zzso zzso We have generated and characterized putative zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso exhibited zzso zzso displacement of ray 1 and zzso zzso The zzso precursors for the affected zzso were zzso arranged in the zzso and a zzso zzso was expressed in these zzso precursor cells as they underwent dynamic zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso by zzso interference caused a displacement of ray 1 similar to that of zzso zzso whereas zzso for the zzso zzso which encodes a zzso zzso exhibited zzso distinct from those of zzso zzso A zzso expression system showed that zzso but not zzso physically bound to zzso Our results indicate that zzso functions as a zzso for zzso zzso and, though zzso and zzso both play roles in the regulation of cellular zzso during zzso zzso they function rather zzso
