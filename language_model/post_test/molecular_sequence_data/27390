zzso To develop novel live attenuated influenza zzso we explored the feasibility to zzso influenza virus by zzso zzso of zzso According to the zzso usage bias in influenza A virus, we designed and zzso a zzso zzso gene by substituting zzso of 110 zzso acids in the zzso gene of zzso zzso with zzso synonymous zzso The influenza A virus with the zzso zzso zzso gene zzso zzso was rescued by reverse zzso zzso forming zzso and virus growth curve showed that the growth of zzso virus was reduced about 1000 times in zzso cells compared to that of the zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso virus did not cause death or evident disease in infected zzso zzso Furthermore, the virus zzso in the lungs of mice infected with zzso virus was significantly lower zzso zzso zzso than that of zzso zzso Our results indicated that influenza virus could be effectively attenuated by synonymous zzso zzso of zzso zzso This strategy will be useful to develop new attenuated candidates for the production of live attenuated influenza zzso
