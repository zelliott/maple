Major zzso complex zzso class I molecules present zzso peptides to zzso T zzso The peptides are generated in the zzso then zzso across the membrane of the zzso zzso by the zzso associated with zzso processing zzso TAP is a zzso complex consisting of zzso zzso and zzso zzso as indicated for human cells by zzso zzso with zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso are required for the zzso zzso zzso is involved in the association of class I with TAP and in the assembly of class I with zzso The mechanisms of zzso function are still zzso Moreover, there has been no evidence for a zzso zzso zzso which has led to the suggestion that zzso zzso class I binds directly to zzso In this study, we have cloned the mouse analogue of zzso The predicted zzso acid sequence showed zzso identity to human zzso with identical consensus sequences of signal zzso zzso zzso site, zzso domain and double zzso zzso However, there was less zzso zzso found at the predicted zzso domain, and in addition, mouse zzso is 14 zzso acids longer than the human analogue at the C zzso This part of the zzso may determine the species specificity for interaction with zzso class I or zzso Like human zzso mouse zzso binds both to zzso and zzso class zzso In zzso zzso cells, both zzso and zzso class I were zzso by zzso zzso indicative of association of zzso with zzso but not zzso With zzso peptides and zzso zzso zzso zzso both zzso zzso class I and zzso In contrast, zzso only zzso zzso zzso class I zzso This difference in association with zzso class I suggests that zzso functions later than zzso during zzso class I zzso and controls zzso loading onto zzso class I molecules in the zzso zzso
