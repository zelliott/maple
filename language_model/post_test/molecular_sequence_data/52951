The nuclear gene zzso the zzso protein zzso was identified in the budding zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso cells carrying a disrupted zzso zzso are resistant to zzso zzso zzso and zzso but hypersensitive to zzso zzso acid, and zzso zzso zzso of zzso leads to an zzso in resistance to zzso and to lesser extent tolerance to zzso acid, but it has no zzso effect on resistance to zzso These observations suggest that the zzso protein zzso has a broad role in modulating zzso resistance in zzso zzso zzso or activity of a membrane zzso specific for zzso and the ABC pumps responsible for zzso and zzso acid would be positively regulated by zzso In contrast, the function of a zzso zzso responsible for zzso and zzso zzso and probably also for zzso of zzso and zzso is likely to be zzso regulated by the zzso Drug resistance of zzso zzso was shown to be zzso by ABC zzso as zzso of the zzso fluorescent dye zzso zzso a zzso for the zzso zzso is markedly increased in zzso zzso in an zzso and zzso zzso
