zzso is a zzso compound isolated from zzso zzso that exhibits zzso zzso We previously reported that zzso suppressed zzso cellular transformation by promoting the degradation of zzso In the present study, we demonstrated the involvement of zzso in the zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso Using a zzso approach, a zzso zzso of zzso was identified in zzso zzso The zzso and zzso induction of zzso zzso that accompanied the reduction in zzso was validated in zzso cells transformed with either zzso or a human truncated zzso zzso and treated with zzso In cancer cells, the induction of zzso zzso by zzso and its structural derivatives correlated well with decreased zzso levels, the suppression of zzso and the induction of zzso Moreover, the zzso zzso zzso zzso degradation, zzso of zzso and induction of zzso were abolished by a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso decreased levels of zzso (another known zzso client zzso and the induction of zzso were also observed in human zzso leukemia cells treated with zzso or its active zzso Together, we demonstrated a novel mechanism by which zzso suppressed cancer zzso that involved zzso zzso function and reducing the levels of zzso client zzso Our results broaden the molecular basis of zzso zzso zzso
