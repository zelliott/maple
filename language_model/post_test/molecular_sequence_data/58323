The zzso alpha zzso of large zzso zzso and zzso K zzso channels is regulated by a beta zzso that has two zzso regions separated by an zzso zzso To investigate the structural zzso in the zzso alpha zzso necessary for zzso zzso we made zzso zzso between a human zzso channel and the zzso zzso which we show is insensitive to zzso zzso and analyzed the zzso of the alpha zzso A comparison of multiple sequence alignments with zzso plots revealed that zzso channel alpha zzso have a unique zzso segment zzso at the N zzso This segment is in addition to the six putative zzso segments zzso usually found in zzso zzso zzso The zzso nature of this unique zzso region was demonstrated by in zzso translation zzso Moreover, normal functional expression of signal sequence zzso and in zzso zzso zzso experiments indicate that zzso leads to an zzso N zzso zzso we propose a new model where zzso channels have a seventh zzso segment at the N zzso zzso zzso exchange of 41 zzso zzso zzso including zzso from the human zzso channel to the zzso zzso transfers zzso regulation to the otherwise unresponsive zzso zzso Both the unique zzso region and the zzso N zzso are necessary for this gain of zzso
