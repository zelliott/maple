Mouse zzso tumor virus zzso zzso zzso is induced by zzso hormone via binding of the zzso zzso zzso The zzso promoter also harbors a binding site for nuclear factor 1 zzso zzso and zzso were expressed in zzso zzso this revealed zzso zzso both in terms of DNA binding and zzso zzso but not zzso A fraction of zzso sites were occupied in a zzso fashion, but a significant and zzso zzso fraction were zzso zzso zzso of the zzso promoter resulted in an approximately zzso increase in the zzso accessibility for its DNA zzso The zzso component of zzso binding was zzso by addition of a zzso zzso however, the zzso zzso which supports partial zzso zzso also maintained partial zzso zzso Hence zzso zzso is independent of zzso zzso zzso zzso induced the formation of a zzso zzso complex containing the DNA segment from zzso to zzso the zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso resulted in a significant stimulation of zzso zzso zzso and also in increased zzso zzso We propose that zzso zzso binding may be involved in maintaining zzso competence and establishment of zzso gene zzso
