zzso is a zzso factor involved in zzso and DNA repair and is implicated in DNA zzso zzso disorders such as zzso zzso zzso syndrome and zzso Eight out of the nine genes zzso the zzso forming zzso have already been zzso We report here the zzso zzso cloning and gene structure of the 52 zzso zzso and its zzso with the zzso counterpart zzso This zzso along with zzso zzso zzso and zzso forms the core of zzso Moreover, using in zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso repair zzso zzso and zzso experiments, we demonstrate that zzso is directly involved in both zzso and DNA repair mechanisms in zzso and in zzso
