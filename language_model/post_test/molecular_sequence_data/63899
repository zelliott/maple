zzso virus is responsible for approximately zzso million infections, resulting in nearly 24,000 deaths zzso The zzso zzso protein of dengue virus is essential for specific zzso of the zzso zzso but little structural information on the C protein is zzso We report the solution structure of the zzso zzso of dengue 2 C zzso The structure provides, to our knowledge, the first zzso picture of a zzso C protein and identifies a fold that includes a large zzso surface contributed by two pairs of zzso one of which has characteristics of a zzso zzso structure determination involved a secondary structure sorting approach to facilitate assignment of the zzso nuclear zzso effect zzso The zzso of dengue C protein has an unusually high net charge, and the structure reveals an zzso distribution of basic zzso over the surface of the zzso Nearly half of the basic zzso lie along one face of the zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso region forms an extensive zzso surface at a zzso interface on the opposite side of the zzso We propose a model for the interaction of dengue C protein with zzso and the viral membrane that is based on the zzso charge distribution of the protein and is consistent with previously reported zzso
