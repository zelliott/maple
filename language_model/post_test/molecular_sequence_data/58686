The zzso upstream region of the Chinese zzso zzso gene zzso was determined, and compared to that of the zzso equivalent zzso gene zzso of zzso The zzso upstream region of the zzso gene is distinct from that of the zzso gene in containing fewer recognition sequences for binding of zzso factors, which are quite sparsely distributed in this zzso It seemed probable that the absence of zzso sites in the promoter of the zzso gene was likely to be responsible for the very dissimilar regulation of the two genes by zzso light and zzso despite the fact that these genes are zzso zzso
