zzso of the zzso zzso zzso zzso plays a critical role in the zzso of Alzheimer's disease zzso We have proposed a toxic zzso with a turn at positions 22 and 23, as well as a nontoxic zzso with a turn at positions 25 and 26, in zzso zzso from systematic zzso scanning and solid-state zzso zzso Although recent clinical trials of zzso targeting zzso zzso have proved useful, some adverse effects were zzso One of the reasons was hypothesized to be excessive zzso derived from the unintended removal of nontoxic zzso which plays an important role in the zzso zzso To develop a zzso zzso for toxic zzso zzso a minimum zzso for zzso containing the turn at positions 22 and 23, was used for the generation of zzso following the selection of clones using zzso zzso of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The obtained clone zzso showed a high binding affinity zzso zzso zzso zzso for zzso using surface zzso zzso zzso also inhibited the zzso of zzso in zzso zzso zzso studies showed that not only zzso but zzso zzso was stained in human zzso zzso In Western zzso analyses using human zzso zzso zzso rather than the zzso of zzso were readily recognized by zzso These results imply that zzso could detect toxic zzso zzso with the turn at positions 22 and 23 and that zzso could be zzso for the therapeutic targeting of toxic zzso in zzso
