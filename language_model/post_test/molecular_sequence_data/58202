zzso synthesis in zzso cells is regulated during the late phase of zzso The rate of initiation is maintained by a small viral zzso zzso zzso zzso which prevents the zzso of zzso initiation factor zzso by a zzso zzso protein zzso zzso On the basis of zzso sensitivity analysis, a zzso model was proposed for VA zzso The model predicts a complex zzso structure in the central part of the zzso the central domain, joining two zzso zzso The central domain is required for the zzso of zzso zzso and zzso in the binding of VA zzso to zzso To assess the significance of the zzso zzso structure in the central domain, we generated zzso zzso and substitution zzso A substitution zzso which zzso the structure in the central domain zzso VA zzso function in zzso and in zzso zzso zzso failed to restore the function or structure of the zzso zzso that the zzso structure may not zzso To confirm this zzso we tested zzso with zzso in the hypothetical loop and short stem that constitute the main features of the zzso model zzso The upper part of the hypothetical loop could be deleted without abolishing the ability of the zzso to block zzso zzso in zzso whereas other loop zzso were deleterious for function and caused major zzso in the zzso zzso zzso in the stem did not restore the expected base zzso even though the zzso zzso were still functional in zzso Surprisingly, a zzso with a zzso substitution zzso in the stem was more effective than zzso VA zzso in zzso zzso zzso but was ineffective in zzso The structural and functional consequences of these zzso do not support the proposed model structure for the central domain, and we therefore suggest an alternative structure in which zzso interactions may play a significant role in shaping the specificity of VA zzso function in the infected zzso zzso between the functionality of zzso forms of VA zzso in zzso and in zzso are consistent with the existence of additional roles for VA zzso in the zzso
