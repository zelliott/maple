The direct molecular weight determination and structural analysis of zzso and zzso zzso have become amenable by the recent development of fast atom zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso the direct analysis of zzso zzso resulting from zzso zzso have been developed as powerful methods for the structural characterization of zzso zzso The major advantage of this approach is provided by the selectivity of the zzso zzso combined with the specific and accurate molecular weight determination of complex digest zzso containing peptides up to several thousands zzso in zzso Furthermore, the mass zzso zzso mapping analysis can be combined with a range of zzso modification reactions and with sequential degradation such as by zzso Both zzso and zzso zzso mapping have already been successfully applied to the structural differentiation of zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso in cases where references sequence data for at least one zzso form was zzso In the application described here, for a series of zzso zzso zzso zzso with zzso zzso primary structures, a direct correlation between the structural differentiation from zzso mapping data and differences in their zzso zzso could be zzso The mass zzso zzso mapping analysis of zzso proved to be an efficient basis for the zzso of the structure of one major zzso zzso zzso partial sequence data for this protein are zzso
