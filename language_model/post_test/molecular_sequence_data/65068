zzso and zzso studies were performed on four unidentified zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso organisms recovered from the teeth of zzso zzso PAGE analysis of zzso proteins and comparative zzso zzso gene sequencing demonstrated the four strains were highly related to each other but that they did not zzso to any zzso species of the zzso zzso zzso analysis based on zzso zzso gene sequences showed the unidentified organisms form a zzso unknown zzso within the zzso zzso displaying a close affinity with zzso zzso zzso zzso and related zzso zzso divergence values of zzso zzso with these and other reference zzso species however demonstrated the organisms from zzso sources represent a novel zzso Based on the zzso distinctiveness of the new zzso and molecular chemical and molecular genetic evidence, it is proposed that the unknown species be classified as zzso zzso zzso zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso
