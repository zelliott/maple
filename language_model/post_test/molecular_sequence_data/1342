By using the zzso B core zzso protein gene as a carrier, zzso zzso zzso gene was inserted into the carrier zzso and the zzso gene was expressed inside a zzso zzso particle zzso which was a unique candidate for induction of zzso zzso zzso This was seen significantly in mice without the need of an zzso because other responses specific for the zzso zzso such as zzso proliferation and zzso production were not zzso However, when zzso virus of Japan zzso protein was incorporated into an zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso and was used as a booster zzso in zzso primed animals, the zzso zzso response and enhanced zzso activity were clearly induced in zzso zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso immune response was also induced and a zzso activity was detected in the immune zzso Thus, when an zzso zzso zzso is expressed inside the virus like a particle of zzso it can induce both cellular and zzso zzso when an zzso but not an zzso is zzso as the booster zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso to zzso enhance the zzso of zzso in zzso These findings suggest that the zzso protein is effective at inducing the zzso zzso if used as part of a booster zzso in the consecutive zzso zzso
