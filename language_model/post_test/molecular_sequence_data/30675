The chicken zzso zzso gene zzso encodes only a single variable gene segment capable of zzso To generate an immune repertoire, chickens diversify this unique rearranged zzso gene segment during zzso development in the zzso of zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso suggests that both gene conversion events derived from zzso segment zzso templates zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso contribute to this zzso To facilitate the study of zzso mechanisms of zzso gene diversification, avian zzso lines were examined for the ability to diversify their rearranged zzso gene during in zzso zzso One line that retains this ability, the avian zzso zzso zzso zzso cell line zzso has been zzso After passage for 1 year in culture, 39 of 51 randomly zzso rearranged zzso segments from a zzso population defined novel zzso of the parental zzso All cloned zzso segments displayed the same zzso joint, confirming that the observed diversity arose after zzso zzso Most sequence variations that we observed zzso of 220 base zzso appeared to result from zzso zzso gene conversion zzso 16 of the 17 novel single zzso zzso were zzso Based on these data, it appears that zzso diversification during in zzso passage of zzso cells is representative of the diversification that occurs during normal zzso development in the zzso of zzso
