We study a zzso model of zzso in which an external zzso on zzso zzso is introduced in the action of the partition function of the zzso zzso The effect of the zzso appears in the exponential generating function of the partition function as a factor zzso (where alpha is the ratio of strengths of the original to the zzso term and L is the length of the zzso The zzso behavior of the zzso distribution functions as a function of length for the zzso model with interaction is analyzed zzso for all zzso It is found that as zzso is increased from 0 to 1, the term zzso in the number of zzso zzso at a fixed length zzso zzso g and zzso goes to zzso zzso for any zzso and the total number of zzso zzso at a fixed length L and alpha but independent of zzso zzso zzso a change in the factor zzso to 1 zzso for any zzso However the zzso L of the dominant length dependent term in zzso stays zzso Hence the zzso is robust to changes in the interaction zzso The distribution functions also exhibit unusual behavior at small zzso
