An zzso zzso region of the human zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso gene was cloned and the detailed zzso promoter region defined in an zzso zzso between bases zzso and zzso relative to the zzso zzso zzso to zzso and zzso in the region abolished its promoter activity, indicating that an zzso segment between zzso and zzso which contains a zzso zzso site at position zzso is required for zzso promoter zzso Nuclear extracts from zzso cells contain proteins that specifically bind to the zzso zzso zzso of the zzso motif reduced zzso promoter activity in comparison with the zzso zzso of zzso expression by zzso zzso requires this zzso motif in colon cancer zzso zzso with the zzso and zzso expression zzso zzso the zzso promoter activity zzso to zzso These results demonstrate that the zzso zzso motif is responsible for approximately 50% of the zzso expression of the zzso zzso
