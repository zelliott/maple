The zzso end of zzso zzso contains the locus involved in zzso muscular zzso zzso zzso zzso deletions within a tandem DNA repeat zzso are associated with the disease status, but no zzso genes have yet been zzso In a systematic search for zzso a zzso stretch of zzso DNA zzso to zzso was zzso analyzed for zzso and subjected to gene prediction zzso A major fraction zzso of the zzso region is composed of repeat sequences attributable mainly to zzso zzso Apart from the previously identified zzso and zzso zzso several additional potential coding regions were identified by analyzing the sequence with zzso prediction zzso So far, we have been unable to demonstrate transcripts by zzso or zzso library zzso However, several zzso zzso were zzso The high density of zzso and repeat elements is consistent with the zzso location of this region and explains why previous transcript identification studies have been zzso
