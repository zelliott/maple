The continued evolution of bacterial pathogens has major implications for both human and animal disease, but the exchange of genetic material between zzso pathogens is rarely zzso zzso zzso subspecies zzso zzso zzso is a zzso pathogen of horses that has evolved from the zzso pathogen zzso zzso subspecies zzso zzso zzso These pathogens share approximately zzso zzso sequence identity with the important human pathogen zzso zzso We zzso and compared the zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso and screened zzso zzso and zzso zzso strains from around the world to uncover evidence of the genetic events that have shaped the evolution of the zzso zzso zzso and led to its emergence as a zzso zzso Our analysis provides evidence of functional loss due to zzso and zzso coupled with zzso specialization through the acquisition of zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso and four zzso and an zzso zzso element carrying a novel iron acquisition system with similarity to the high zzso island of zzso zzso We also highlight that zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso share a common zzso pool that enhances zzso pathogen zzso We conclude that the complex interplay of functional loss, zzso zzso and genetic exchange between zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso continues to influence the evolution of these important zzso
