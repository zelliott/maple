zzso also referred to as zzso zzso zzso or zzso is a ubiquitous zzso DNA binding protein that activates zzso and zzso DNA zzso The protein contains a zzso DNA binding domain zzso zzso present in several zzso zzso We have zzso zzso the related zzso and several zzso deletion zzso in a zzso expression system to identify the zzso important for zzso of DNA replication in zzso Both zzso and zzso stimulate zzso DNA replication in an zzso zzso From deletion studies it appears that the 160 zzso acid long zzso domain zzso for zzso This domain consists of two zzso a zzso and a zzso zzso zzso of the zzso domain revealed that the zzso domain has an zzso but weak DNA binding activity and surprisingly, zzso DNA zzso As the zzso domain does not coincide with the zzso zzso domain, these results indicate that, although zzso functions both in DNA replication and transcription, the mechanisms underlying these processes are probably zzso
