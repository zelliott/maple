We show that the zzso gene of zzso zzso is induced by heat, as has been reported for the zzso coli zzso Analysis of different zzso revealed that the zzso gene belongs to class III heat shock genes in zzso zzso An about zzso induction after zzso zzso was found at the levels of both zzso and translation, and this induction resulted from enhanced synthesis of zzso By primer extension, we identified one potential zzso start site immediately downstream of a putative zzso promoter which became activated after zzso zzso Northern zzso analysis revealed that zzso is part of a zzso zzso zzso An zzso fusion where the complete region between zzso and its upstream gene was fused to the zzso reporter gene accurately reflected zzso zzso Analysis of this fusion revealed that, in contrast to other class III heat shock zzso zzso was not induced by zzso zzso by ethanol, or by oxygen zzso suggesting that it belongs to a zzso within class zzso zzso of the region upstream of the putative promoter resulted in an enhanced zzso level of zzso zzso but the zzso induction was zzso suggesting that the upstream sequences are involved in the regulation of expression in the absence of heat zzso
