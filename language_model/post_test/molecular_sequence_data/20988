A zzso zzso zzso required for proper function of zzso coli zzso zzso was identified by zzso zzso on the basis of sequence alignment of human, zzso zzso and three bacterial zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were zzso in zzso coli zzso cells and the zzso proteins were zzso to near zzso by zzso zzso With the exception of zzso the other two zzso completely lost zzso activity, zzso the importance of this zzso in zzso Moreover, substitution of zzso with either zzso or zzso impaired the capability of zzso processing of the precursor into zzso and zzso Computer modeling showed that the critical bonding distance of zzso zzso zzso was significantly increased in zzso and zzso indicating that these distance changes might be responsible for the lack of zzso zzso zzso of intrinsic zzso zzso revealed zzso of the zzso of aromatic zzso acid zzso in zzso and zzso while circular zzso zzso zzso were nearly identical for zzso and all zzso zzso The zzso signal in the zzso region for zzso was consistent with that of zzso zzso but zzso and zzso showed a different sensitivity towards zzso zzso These results implied that a significant zzso change occurred as a result of zzso and zzso
