In this report we show that the mouse zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso expressed in zzso cells are capable of rendering the cells sensitive to mouse zzso as measured by induction of class I zzso zzso and the zzso of the zzso factor zzso zzso However, these cells showed no zzso protection in response to zzso when challenged with zzso zzso virus zzso but limited protection when challenged with zzso virus zzso Furthermore, the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso like the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso can be zzso between species with no loss of zzso activity, demonstrating that the zzso interaction of the zzso zzso and zzso zzso chains involves only the zzso zzso of the two zzso
