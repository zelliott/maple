zzso the zzso zzso of the zzso zzso of zzso coli, which belongs to the zzso binding protein zzso family of zzso zzso zzso is zzso active in an in zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso together with zzso zzso zzso containing zzso is required for in zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso proteins are typically subject to regulation either by zzso modification or interaction of a specific zzso with an zzso regulatory zzso However, unlike other members of the zzso family, zzso lacks this zzso zzso is positively regulated by zzso in zzso and this regulation is dependent on the zzso of the zzso a linear template is much more dependent on zzso than a zzso zzso zzso binding to upstream zzso sequences zzso in their target promoters is zzso by the zzso domain which contains a zzso zzso zzso A zzso zzso protein lacking the zzso zzso domain is active in zzso although at much higher zzso than the zzso zzso In zzso zzso from zzso templates missing one or both of the zzso sites is reduced relative to zzso templates, but is still zzso however, zzso acts as a negative regulator of zzso zzso on these zzso zzso Thus, zzso bound to zzso sequences upstream of the zzso promoter can activate zzso transcription, but this zzso is inhibited by zzso These data, taken together, support the model that a precise promoter geometry is necessary for zzso to positively regulate zzso and that zzso may act to prevent zzso from inappropriately spaced upstream zzso
