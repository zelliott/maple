An zzso based on the zzso of zzso zzso that enable zzso amplification of an internal zzso of cat genes known to be present in zzso zzso was developed to identify the genes zzso zzso resistance in zzso and zzso The functionality of this system was illustrated by the detection of cat genes belonging to four different zzso classes represented by the zzso genes zzso zzso zzso and the zzso gene zzso and by the characterization of a new zzso cat gene designated zzso A sequence related to the zzso zzso zzso which was present in one zzso strain, was not detected by this zzso These results reveal that these six cat genes account for zzso zzso resistance in 12 group A, B, and G zzso zzso By contrast, only three of these six cat genes zzso zzso and zzso were detected on the 10 zzso plasmids studied here that zzso resistance to zzso
