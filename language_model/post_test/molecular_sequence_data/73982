The zzso position of an zzso strain isolated from Korean soil was examined by a zzso zzso The zzso designated zzso was clearly assigned to the zzso zzso on the basis of zzso and zzso zzso The test strain was the subject of a zzso identification study using the identification zzso generated by zzso et zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and found to be marginally close to clusters 19 and zzso An almost complete zzso zzso gene zzso sequence was obtained for the test strain and compared with those of representative zzso zzso zzso sequence data not only support the zzso membership in the zzso zzso but also provide strong evidence that our isolate is zzso distant from representatives of clusters 19 and 39, forming a separate zzso line in a zzso zzso by zzso It is therefore proposed from the zzso evidence that strain zzso be classified in the zzso zzso as zzso zzso zzso zzso
