zzso zzso important in zzso metabolism in zzso is regulated through short-term zzso and long-term zzso zzso To help zzso the zzso relationships involved in the zzso of this zzso we have isolated and characterized full-length zzso clones to rat zzso zzso zzso rat zzso zzso was placed into an expression zzso in zzso zzso The zzso has been zzso to zzso and its physical and zzso properties have been zzso The molecular weight and the zzso zzso spectrum of the zzso zzso were identical to those of the native zzso The zzso zzso could be activated by incubation with zzso or zzso or by zzso as is the rat liver zzso The extent of zzso is the same as that for the native zzso in each case except for zzso which activates the zzso zzso only zzso to zzso rather than the zzso to zzso zzso observed with the native zzso The kinetic zzso determined for the zzso zzso are also essentially the same as those reported for the native zzso We conclude that this zzso is essentially identical to the native zzso and should be very useful in the future study of this important zzso
