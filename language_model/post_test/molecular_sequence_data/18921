zzso domain interactions are involved in signaling and trafficking pathways that coordinate crucial cellular zzso zzso zzso binding motifs identify the few most favorable zzso at certain positions along the zzso zzso However, sequences that bind the zzso zzso zzso zzso domain reveal only a zzso motif that zzso the true number of zzso zzso Here, we combine extended zzso motif analysis with zzso techniques to show that zzso zzso zzso influence zzso zzso The zzso structures of 13 zzso complexes reveal zzso but accommodating zzso environments at zzso positions, which are reflected in zzso preferences uncovered by zzso zzso zzso These preferences facilitate the identification of zzso zzso binding sequences and zzso affect zzso and zzso zzso zzso As a result, they also help determine the specificity of a zzso domain network that regulates the trafficking of zzso at the zzso zzso
