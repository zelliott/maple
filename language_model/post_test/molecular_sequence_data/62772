The zzso zzso zzso gene family has been reported to consist of at least 11 zzso active members and a few inactive zzso zzso Recent analyses of human and mouse databases provided evidence that human and mouse zzso contain genes for still another novel CA zzso hereby named CA zzso In the present study, we modeled the structure of human CA zzso This model revealed a zzso zzso with high structural similarity to zzso zzso CA I, II, and zzso zzso mouse CA zzso showed zzso activity similar to those of zzso CA V and zzso CA I, with zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso It is very susceptible to zzso by zzso and zzso zzso with zzso zzso of 17 zzso for zzso a clinically used zzso and of zzso zzso for zzso zzso Using panels of zzso we evaluated human and mouse zzso gene expression in a number of different zzso In human zzso positive signals were identified in the zzso small zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso In zzso positive zzso included the zzso zzso zzso heart, brain, skeletal muscle, and zzso We also investigated the cellular and zzso zzso of CA zzso in human and mouse zzso using an zzso raised against a zzso of 14 zzso acids common for both human and mouse zzso zzso zzso showed a unique and widespread distribution pattern for CA zzso compared with the other zzso CA zzso In conclusion, the predicted zzso acid zzso structural model, distribution, and activity data suggest that CA zzso represents a novel zzso which may play important zzso roles in several zzso
