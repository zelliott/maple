The zzso sequence of zzso a zzso cloned from the zzso of zzso zzso reveals a structural similarity with the zzso form of the zzso including a zzso gene containing a putative zzso zzso zzso parts of that sequence were zzso and expressed in zzso zzso It has been demonstrated that the expression of the zzso zzso when zzso gives rise to peptides displaying zzso activity characteristic of a true zzso zzso In addition, rabbit zzso directed against such zzso proteins allowed us to detect an zzso protein of around 110 zzso which was only present in zzso zzso cell lines, but not in cells derived from zzso zzso or zzso zzso whose zzso do not bear the zzso zzso This protein is expected to zzso to a zzso zzso translated product and zzso with zzso particles exhibiting zzso zzso
