The zzso protein family members perform an essential, albeit poorly zzso function in association with soluble zzso sensitive factor zzso protein zzso zzso complexes in membrane zzso The zzso zzso zzso has a zzso tail that is missing in its zzso zzso Here we show that deletion of the zzso tail zzso acids zzso renders cells temperature sensitive for growth, reduces zzso efficiency, causes a zzso zzso and zzso zzso component zzso The results show that the zzso tail binds zzso zzso zzso complexes and it enhances zzso zzso complex formation in zzso The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso results suggest that, in the zzso zzso zzso cells, zzso a zzso binding zzso helps to target zzso lacking the zzso tail to the sites of zzso The results suggest that the zzso C zzso is important for zzso zzso We show that, in addition to zzso zzso can bind the zzso zzso in zzso The zzso results suggest that zzso acts in close association with zzso on zzso zzso in the zzso This association depends on the zzso zzso zzso exchange factor zzso Our results reveal a novel binding mode between the zzso zzso tail and the zzso complex, and suggest a role for zzso as an zzso of zzso
