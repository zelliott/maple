A fundamental question in microbial zzso concerns the relationship between zzso diversity and zzso function in an zzso zzso We combined zzso zzso magnetic zzso zzso and zzso zzso gel zzso zzso to examine zzso growth in natural marine zzso We also examined a broad range of marine bacterial zzso to determine their abilities to incorporate zzso in order to test the zzso of the method for application to diverse marine zzso We found that 27 of 29 zzso belonging to different zzso could incorporate zzso zzso analysis revealed zzso affiliations of zzso presumably actively growing bacteria across a zzso to zzso zzso in the Inland Sea of zzso We found that the zzso zzso communities were substantially different from the total zzso The majority zzso of zzso incorporated zzso and were presumably growing, and these zzso comprised 10 zzso 1 zzso 11 zzso 11 zzso group bacteria, and 1 zzso zzso All zzso zzso were members of the zzso suggesting that such bacteria were dominant in the growing zzso populations in our zzso The zzso zzso belonged to the zzso the zzso zzso the zzso the zzso and the zzso Thus, zzso zzso of diverse actively growing bacterial zzso was a consistent pattern in our zzso varied study zzso
