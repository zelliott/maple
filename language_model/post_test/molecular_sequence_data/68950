zzso expression and the functional capacity for zzso binding of zzso acid zzso were analyzed on zzso B cells and on B cells zzso with a variety of zzso B cell zzso Whereas essentially all zzso and zzso B cells and a zzso of zzso B cells expressed increased levels of cell surface zzso relative to zzso B cells, only zzso zzso B cells zzso bound to zzso zzso acid zzso zzso of zzso or zzso B cells with the zzso zzso zzso zzso induced a high degree of zzso binding in these zzso zzso of zzso B cells with this zzso zzso induced minimal zzso zzso In contrast, zzso with zzso IRA failed to induce zzso binding by the zzso zzso B cell zzso Neither the amount of zzso zzso binding nor the level of zzso zzso binding correlated simply with the overall level of zzso expressed by the different B cell zzso zzso analysis of zzso zzso molecules revealed that relative to zzso isolated from all other populations zzso zzso isolated from zzso B cells was of a lower molecular zzso Treatment with zzso eliminated this observed difference in molecular weight, indicating that it reflected differences in zzso of zzso on activated B zzso zzso chain reaction analysis of amplified zzso showed that each B cell population expressed a common dominant zzso zzso These findings suggest that zzso modification of zzso and/or differential association of zzso with other cellular components plays a critical role in zzso zzso binding by zzso
