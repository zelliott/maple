In search of zzso with improved kinetic properties for removal of the zzso zzso zzso zzso of blood group B zzso we recently identified a novel zzso family of zzso zzso zzso with highly restricted zzso specificity and neutral pH optimum zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso Bennett, zzso zzso zzso zzso Saunders, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso White, zzso zzso zzso zzso Lane, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and Clausen, zzso zzso zzso zzso 25, zzso One member of this family from zzso zzso had exquisite zzso specificity for the zzso blood group B structure zzso whereas linear zzso terminated by zzso zzso such as the zzso zzso zzso zzso did not serve as zzso Here we demonstrate the existence of two distinct zzso of zzso in zzso zzso and zzso zzso Members of one zzso have exclusive specificity for the zzso blood group B structures, whereas members of a newly identified zzso represent linkage specific zzso that act equally well on both zzso blood group B and linear zzso zzso We determined by one-dimensional zzso zzso zzso that zzso zzso function with an zzso zzso which is in striking contrast to all other known zzso that use a retaining zzso The novel zzso zzso offers zzso with highly improved performance in zzso removal of the zzso zzso zzso zzso
