We have developed a method to capture zzso from zzso and zzso artificial zzso zzso clones into a zzso shuttle zzso by using zzso zzso We have engineered a zzso zzso a zzso of zzso which was previously used to capture zzso from zzso artificial zzso zzso zzso contains DNA fragments zzso the zzso in zzso and zzso zzso as zzso zzso When zzso zzso zzso and zzso or zzso DNA are zzso into zzso zzso between the two leads to the transfer of zzso into zzso zzso clones thus obtained can be further modified in zzso for functional analysis and shuttled to zzso coli to produce large quantities of cloned zzso This approach provides a rapid method to modify zzso clones for functional zzso
