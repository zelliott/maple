Bud zzso allowed me to examine the effects of zzso at zzso in the area of suppressed zzso around the zzso in zzso zzso whose zzso show surprisingly low diversification zzso The total number of seeds produced was lower for incompatible than compatible zzso revealing that zzso was only somewhat overcome by bud zzso However, low seed set in incompatible crosses was not due solely to the zzso zzso crosses between distinct plants sharing the same zzso at the zzso led to dramatically high seed abortion, nearly equal to that found upon zzso An excess of zzso in the surviving progeny supports the supposition that these high abortion rates are due to sheltered load, that is, previously zzso load accumulated due to enforced zzso and zzso suppression around the zzso Of the seven zzso examined in total, two showed evidence of severe load and five did zzso The magnitude of load was consistent with terminal branch length in some, but not all, zzso
