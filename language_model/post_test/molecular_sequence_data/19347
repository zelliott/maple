A zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso was isolated from a zzso zzso reactor treating zzso zzso and zzso zzso The strain, designated zzso was zzso and zzso The strain grew at zzso degrees C zzso growth at 59-61 degrees zzso and pH zzso zzso growth at pH zzso The strain tolerated up to 1 % zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso sulfur were used as electron zzso but not zzso zzso or zzso zzso donors zzso were zzso zzso : 20, zzso zzso various zzso acids and some zzso zzso growth occurred on zzso and zzso The cell wall contained zzso acid and the major respiratory zzso zzso was zzso zzso Major zzso fatty acids were zzso : zzso and zzso : zzso zzso zzso was zzso related to representatives of the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso On the basis of zzso zzso gene sequence data, the strain cannot be assigned to any known zzso Based on the zzso and zzso features of strain zzso it is proposed that the strain represents a novel species in a new zzso for which the name zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso is zzso The type strain of zzso zzso is zzso zzso zzso zzso
