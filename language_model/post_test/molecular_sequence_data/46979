zzso are zzso zzso that use the energy derived from the zzso of zzso to move zzso along zzso The founding member of this still growing zzso is conventional zzso a zzso motor that moves zzso towards the plus end of zzso Within the family of conventional zzso two groups can be distinguished to date, one derived from animal species, and one originating from zzso zzso So far no conventional zzso has been reported from plant zzso zzso and animal conventional zzso differ in several respects, both in terms of their primary sequence and their zzso zzso Thus all zzso conventional zzso move at zzso that are 4-5 times higher than those of animal conventional zzso and all of them appear to lack associated light zzso Both groups of zzso are characterized by a number of zzso sequence features which are considered here with respect to their functional zzso Animal and zzso conventional zzso also share a number of sequence characteristics which point to common principles of motor zzso The overall domain organization is remarkably zzso A zzso sequence motif common to all zzso which constitutes the only region of high zzso outside the motor domain, suggests common principles of cargo association in both groups of zzso Consideration of the differences of, and similarities between, zzso and animal zzso offers novel possibilities for zzso zzso zzso by constructing zzso that can be expected to contribute to our understanding of motor zzso
