We construct a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso based on zzso DNA, from the following zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso The zzso comprises 82 species in three zzso zzso zzso and zzso We demonstrate that zzso is zzso in zzso and that this zzso is sister to a zzso of zzso plus zzso zzso zzso of the species in the zzso zzso have zzso zzso and we use ancestral character state reconstruction to show that they have been gained twice or possibly once, and lost several zzso We suggest that the zzso absence, loss, and gain of zzso are correlated with leaf anatomy type, and additionally that there is a difference in the degree of diversification of lineages that have these different character zzso We propose that both zzso and zzso leaves act as defense systems against zzso and build a zzso model in which zzso zzso or zzso leaves are lost when the alternative defense system zzso We also investigate the association between leaf anatomy type and soil zzso type on which species zzso There is little zzso constraint in soil zzso type on members of the zzso zzso with numerous transitions between zzso and zzso zzso However, only zzso species diversify on zzso zzso We suggest that the presence of these zzso enables the persistence of zzso lineages and therefore diversification of the zzso zzso on zzso as well as zzso zzso
