We described the occurrence of 4 transcripts zzso displayed between zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso cell zzso We now report that one such transcript, which is zzso represents a protein zzso zzso regulatory zzso No expression of this transcript was detected in the zzso zzso zzso by Northern zzso Moreover, the transcript was not expressed by spontaneously zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso nor was it expressed by zzso zzso zzso zzso Cloning of the zzso region of this transcript zzso band zzso from zzso cells revealed an zzso zzso zzso including the long terminal repeat region, which could account for the observed high expression in zzso zzso Single cell clones of zzso zzso an experimental zzso capacity, which correlated with band zzso expression with the lowest zzso being least zzso The human zzso of the zzso regulatory zzso zzso is expressed zzso at the zzso level in human melanoma cell lines compared with normal zzso zzso In zzso zzso studies on human clinical samples detected high expression of this gene in a number of zzso zzso Our results imply strongly that this protein zzso regulatory zzso may have a role in melanoma zzso zzso
