zzso growth factor zzso a member of the zzso growth factor zzso family (also known as zzso is an important protective factor for zzso zzso The zzso for zzso (also called zzso which has intrinsic zzso zzso activity, is expressed specifically on zzso cells and in the lung zzso Administration of zzso has been shown to protect the lung from various zzso but the mechanism of protection is not well zzso To understand the mechanism by which zzso exerts protective functions on zzso cells, we used the zzso zzso zzso to identify proteins that interact with the zzso zzso zzso Here we show that the zzso domain of zzso interacts with zzso protein zzso zzso 4, which is a new member of the zzso zzso The zzso are regulated by the zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso is the most divergent member of the zzso family of proteins and may have distinct zzso However, stimuli that regulate zzso activity are not zzso Our data show that zzso can associate with the zzso which is dependent on zzso zzso zzso zzso We show that a dominant negative zzso of zzso blocks zzso zzso of zzso zzso in zzso cells subjected to zzso zzso Our data demonstrate that zzso is an important zzso of the zzso effects of zzso on zzso zzso
