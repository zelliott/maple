We established the zzso mouse line, zzso zzso through zzso zzso in embryonic stem zzso The novel gene identified, called zzso tail zzso is composed of 19 zzso and encodes a protein of zzso zzso zzso zzso of a reporter gene was detected in the zzso during zzso and in the nucleus zzso of zzso zzso of some of the zzso zzso in the zzso discs zzso appeared at embryonic day zzso zzso resulting in a zzso zzso showing defects in the nucleus zzso and zzso zzso of zzso in zzso zzso These zzso were different from those in zzso short tail zzso mice in which the nucleus zzso was totally absent and replaced by peripheral fibers similar to those seen in the zzso zzso in all zzso The zzso gene maps to the zzso part of mouse zzso 2, near the zzso zzso The genetic distance between them was zzso zzso The number of zzso in both zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso compound zzso was less than that of zzso zzso Furthermore, the zzso trap locus zzso which was previously reported to be an zzso of zzso was located in the third zzso of the zzso zzso
