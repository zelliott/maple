Two regions hypersensitive to zzso I zzso were found in a zzso segment of zzso gene zzso sequences in the zzso from bovine zzso The most upstream site zzso to zzso zzso relative to the zzso zzso was found in zzso zzso only, but independently of actual expression of the zzso It therefore represents a zzso characteristic which may be associated with the commitment of the zzso gene to zzso zzso The very zzso end of the gene and the zzso promoter sequences zzso to zzso zzso relative to zzso zzso constitute the second site, the hypersensitive character of which could be directly correlated with zzso zzso The structural changes occurring in this region of the zzso were dependent on zzso stimulation of the zzso zzso
