zzso differentiation between races or closely related species is often zzso with the zzso divergence of the zzso of zzso Shared ancient zzso and/or zzso during secondary contact may be responsible for the zzso At zzso contributing to zzso these two complications should be minimized zzso zzso zzso their variation may more faithfully reflect the history of the zzso zzso zzso In this study, we analyzed DNA zzso at the Odysseus zzso locus of hybrid zzso between zzso zzso and zzso zzso and were able to verify such a zzso Interestingly, DNA variation only a short distance away zzso zzso appears not to be influenced by the forces that shape the recent evolution of the zzso coding zzso This locus thus may represent a test case of zzso zzso of very closely related zzso
