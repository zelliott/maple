zzso is a gene product zzso on a zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso The gene is part of an zzso reported to be essential for the synthesis of the zzso zzso zzso has been assigned the function of an zzso However, the reported sequence of this protein is very much like that of zzso zzso zzso except for a 40 zzso acid zzso zzso zzso This similarity contradicts accepted ideas regarding zzso relationships of zzso We have cloned and zzso the zzso gene in zzso coli, and discovered that the reported sequence contains an error resulting in a zzso The correct sequence contains a new stop zzso zzso the zzso 41 zzso acid zzso of the reported zzso The expressed zzso bearing an zzso zzso tag, zzso the zzso of zzso and zzso zzso zzso suggesting that this activity is not a zzso but an activity for which this zzso has zzso zzso mass zzso experiments and zzso by zzso are consistent with the zzso being a zzso zzso zzso a zzso host normally requiring zzso zzso for growth, could be zzso by transformation with a zzso bearing the gene zzso zzso A role for this zzso in zzso synthesis cannot be ruled out, but is called into zzso
