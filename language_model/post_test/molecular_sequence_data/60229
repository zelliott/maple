To evaluate the microbial populations involved in the reduction of zzso in an zzso zzso zzso the zzso flow of supplemental carbon and zzso was evaluated in zzso zzso at the in zzso temperature of 12 degrees zzso Supplemental zzso and zzso zzso the formation of zzso 42 and zzso of the reducing zzso that were theoretically obtained from zzso and zzso respectively, were recovered in zzso Likewise, supplemental zzso was consumed by zzso sediments and yielded additional amounts of zzso in a ratio of approximately zzso In contrast, supplemental zzso did not stimulate the formation of zzso Supplemental zzso was not consumed and inhibited the formation of zzso zzso estimates demonstrated that zzso zzso zzso bacteria zzso to zzso of the total direct counts of zzso zzso zzso From the highest zzso dilution of the zzso series at pH zzso 3 supplemented with zzso an zzso zzso that could zzso zzso was zzso zzso was an zzso zzso zzso zzso that completely oxidized the following zzso via the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso ethanol, zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso Growth and the reduction of zzso did not occur in the presence of zzso zzso of zzso grown under zzso conditions formed zzso zzso zzso that were still in contact with the zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso zzso gene sequence of zzso demonstrated that it was closely related to an Australian isolate of zzso zzso zzso sequence zzso an zzso not previously shown to couple the complete zzso of zzso to the reduction of zzso These collective results indicate that the in zzso reduction of zzso in zzso sediments can be zzso by zzso zzso species that are capable of zzso the reduction of zzso to the complete zzso of a large variety of zzso including zzso and zzso
