Cellular zzso of zzso zzso drugs is a critical step in the mechanism of the drug action and associated resistance, and deeper understanding of this step may inspire development of novel methods for new drugs with reduced zzso Human copper zzso 1 zzso a copper influx zzso was recently found to facilitate the cellular entry of several platinum zzso In the work reported here, we constructed a zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso corresponding to the zzso domain of zzso which is the essential domain of zzso for transporting platinum zzso The interactions of the zzso with zzso and its zzso including zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso were explored at the molecular zzso zzso zzso zzso mass zzso zzso data revealed that all of the zzso complexes used in present study can bind to zzso in zzso and zzso zzso Four Met zzso should be involved in binding to zzso complexes on the basis of the tandem zzso zzso and previously reported zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso single quantum zzso zzso zzso indicate the reaction of zzso with zzso is a zzso zzso The zzso however, is zzso which is consistent with the zzso zzso zzso zzso data revealed that the geometry and the properties of both the leaving and the zzso groups of zzso complexes play essential roles in controlling the zzso and formation of the final products with zzso
