A zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso groups was zzso by zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso acid zzso and zzso zzso zzso using 2, zzso zzso as zzso A zzso coiled zzso stem loop zzso containing a zzso zzso zzso zzso in the loop region zzso was designed and zzso genetically by expressing an artificial gene in zzso coli zzso zzso The zzso was characterized by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and circular zzso zzso zzso zzso containing zzso zzso zzso were prepared by first zzso zzso zzso onto polystyrene zzso surface by zzso zzso then charging the surface with zzso through zzso groups, and finally attaching the zzso zzso through zzso zzso The modified zzso surfaces with and without zzso zzso zzso were characterized by X-ray zzso zzso zzso and zzso secondary zzso mass zzso zzso Cell attachment studies with human zzso zzso zzso B cells showed that the cells selectively bound to the zzso zzso zzso surfaces, but not to the surfaces of zzso zzso with grafted zzso and zzso with grafted zzso and zzso coiled zzso zzso with similar structure but without the zzso This indicates that the cell attachment was zzso by the zzso zzso most probably by the zzso zzso zzso The zzso zzso zzso presented here may represent a feasible model of exposing zzso for zzso zzso
