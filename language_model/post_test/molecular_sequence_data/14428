zzso growth factor 1 zzso plays an important role in fish zzso This study investigated the zzso response to various nutritional conditions in zzso First, we cloned zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso which codes for a protein of 185 zzso acids zzso This is composed of 44 zzso for the signal zzso 68 zzso for the mature zzso zzso the B, C, A, and D zzso and 73 zzso for the E zzso The mature zzso zzso showed high identity to zzso of other zzso zzso growth factor 1 zzso expression in the liver and white muscle was measured to observe the zzso response to various nutritional conditions, because the liver has the highest zzso expression and white muscle comprises the largest fraction of the fish zzso Only white muscle zzso zzso expression decreased significantly by 3 zzso of zzso and recovered by zzso In subsequent feeding ratio zzso zzso and zzso experiments, significant correlations to growth were observed in white muscle zzso zzso expression at zzso and zzso points and in zzso zzso zzso expression at 4 zzso zzso These data suggest that zzso expression both in zzso and white muscle is important for zzso growth in zzso Furthermore, white muscle zzso zzso expression showed better responses to zzso growth and nutrition status in our two experiments than zzso zzso zzso zzso
