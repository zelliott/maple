The solution properties and zzso association of two synthetic 30 zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso have been investigated at pH 5 and zzso These peptides have the same zzso acid composition and differ only in the positioning of zzso acid and zzso zzso which together compose zzso of each zzso Both peptides undergo a similar zzso to zzso transition as the pH is lowered from zzso to zzso However, zzso forms an zzso zzso whereas zzso does zzso As a result, zzso partitions into zzso to a greater extent than zzso and can initiate leakage of zzso contents and membrane fusion which zzso cannot zzso et zzso zzso zzso et zzso zzso zzso association of the peptides has been studied in detail with large zzso zzso zzso binding zzso show a strong association of the zzso zzso to zzso at pH 5 with an apparent zzso around zzso The single zzso zzso in each zzso can be exploited to probe zzso motion and positioning within zzso zzso zzso changes and the zzso of zzso zzso by zzso lipids in the presence of zzso also indicate that zzso can interact with zzso zzso in a zzso zzso By comparison to the zzso zzso the membrane association of zzso is shown to be due to the zzso nature of its zzso zzso at pH zzso
