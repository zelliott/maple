The zzso gene encodes a basic zzso zzso factor, which is highly expressed in zzso zzso cells of the zzso mouse zzso and is required for development of the zzso in order to form a functional zzso zzso zzso of zzso has been previously zzso zzso zzso of the paternal zzso zzso in zzso carrying a maternal zzso zzso results in a zzso embryonic lethal zzso In order to study the zzso zzso zzso we have created a new zzso at this locus carrying a targeted zzso of an zzso zzso zzso entry zzso cassette within the 3' untranslated region of the gene zzso to as zzso This new zzso has made it feasible to monitor paternal zzso expression in a zzso zzso Our data suggest that parental zzso expression of zzso begins in the early zzso zzso zzso zzso at the time when zzso expression is zzso We also show that the paternal zzso is continuously zzso up to zzso zzso in the developing zzso cone zzso and early zzso zzso with some cells escaping paternal zzso When zzso zzso zzso expression from this zzso reflects the expression pattern of zzso zzso transcripts up to zzso zzso Furthermore, we have addressed the question of a requirement for DNA zzso for the zzso zzso mechanism by crossing our zzso mice with mice zzso for zzso zzso Our results show a partial loss of zzso repression of the paternal zzso in zzso deficient zzso Interestingly, however, this is not sufficient to eliminate the highly biased parental zzso expression of zzso Thus, the preferential maternal expression of the gene is still maintained in zzso zzso zzso zzso although zzso analyses demonstrate that the zzso locus is highly zzso in zzso zzso zzso zzso The locus is also highly zzso in zzso zzso Our results suggest the possibility that a mechanism other than DNA zzso such as zzso zzso zzso may be involved in maintenance of parental zzso expression of zzso
