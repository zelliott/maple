The less abundant polarity of the satellite zzso of tobacco zzso virus, designated zzso contains a zzso and its zzso We demonstrate that the zzso can catalyze the zzso of zzso zzso products and that zzso termed zzso and containing little more than zzso attached zzso and zzso zzso products, zzso spontaneously, efficiently and zzso The zzso of zzso and zzso of one such zzso was consistent with a simple zzso reaction at some zzso Evidence suggests that the circular zzso product includes a 5 zzso stem that is connected to a 4 zzso stem by a zzso zzso Reduction of the zzso loop to one zzso is expected to place the 4 and 5 zzso zzso in a nearly zzso rather than an angled or zzso zzso Such molecules did not zzso in a zzso reaction but did when incubated with second, zzso zzso that had either the original or a zzso 4 zzso zzso These results suggest that a zzso loop that is too small prevents formation of geometry essential for zzso zzso We suggest the term zzso to represent the arrangement of zzso strands in the region of zzso that zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso
