To understand the mechanisms involved in the regulation of the zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso we have cloned the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso whose coding sequence is zzso to that of zzso zzso The structure and the function of its zzso region, zzso zzso upstream of the first start zzso was zzso By producing zzso transformed cells of a synchronized culture with the zzso zzso zzso reporter gene fusion, we demonstrate that the zzso zzso promoter zzso mediates a zzso zzso zzso indistinguishable from that of zzso zzso zzso B zzso zzso zzso activity in zzso zzso reveals that promoter activity is considerably reduced by zzso the zzso region to 538 or 320 zzso Furthermore, the 320 zzso zzso no longer mediates the observed zzso regulation of the zzso zzso zzso promoter in zzso zzso isolated from synchronized zzso
