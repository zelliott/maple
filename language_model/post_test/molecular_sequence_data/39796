zzso zzso zzso through interactions with zzso targeting zzso plays critical roles in the regulation of numerous cellular zzso zzso we describe a newly identified regulatory zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso K zzso that specifically targets the zzso zzso of zzso to nuclear zzso to selectively bind and zzso the zzso regulator zzso nuclear zzso K zzso zzso at a regulatory zzso zzso Additionally, zzso is zzso in zzso at zzso and zzso zzso that flank or reside within the zzso zzso and this zzso zzso regulates the binding of the zzso to zzso A zzso zzso zzso when expressed in intact cells, exhibited an increase in native zzso binding and zzso a more profound zzso of zzso at zzso A global analysis of zzso by zzso zzso revealed that the expression of zzso resulted in the altered expression of 47 zzso including a marked induction of zzso zzso zzso Additionally, the effects of zzso and zzso on zzso could be modulated by the zzso of zzso zzso Taken together, our findings provide a putative mechanism by which zzso activity of zzso K can be zzso controlled through the regulation of zzso zzso
