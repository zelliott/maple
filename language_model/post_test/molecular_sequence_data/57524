The effect of caloric deprivation to stimulate zzso zzso Y zzso gene expression is hypothesized to represent a zzso important adaptation in body weight zzso To evaluate the specificity of this response, we used in zzso zzso zzso to measure zzso expression of zzso zzso zzso zzso and the two zzso of zzso acid zzso zzso and zzso in male zzso rats either fed ad zzso or deprived of food for 24 or 48 zzso As expected, food deprivation for 24 and 48 h increased zzso zzso levels in the zzso nucleus by 43 zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso both fed and zzso zzso zzso when compared to ad zzso controls, and zzso zzso zzso levels were significantly correlated to the percent change in body weight over the three groups of rats zzso zzso zzso p zzso zzso In contrast, no significant effects of either 24 or 48 h of zzso were observed on zzso levels of zzso zzso or zzso zzso and no relationship between percent change in body weight and expression of any of these zzso species could be zzso In conclusion, zzso increases zzso zzso levels in the zzso nucleus but does not alter expression of other zzso zzso species pertinent to feeding zzso This supports the hypothesis that stimulation of zzso gene expression represents an important component of the zzso response to caloric zzso
