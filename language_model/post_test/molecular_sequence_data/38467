The zzso zzso and the zzso zzso beta zzso alpha zzso beta 6) are two immune receptors specific for zzso zzso class II molecules zzso to the zzso zzso of the zzso of zzso class II molecules (the E alpha zzso zzso A profound zzso negative selection occurs in zzso zzso transgenic mice in the presence of an zzso alpha zzso The administration of zzso to zzso alpha zzso newborn mice reveals that zzso but not the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso a significant number of mature zzso beta zzso zzso and allows the detection of E alpha zzso T cells in the zzso These observations indicate that deletion of zzso T cells can be specifically inhibited in zzso by an zzso specific for the deleting zzso class II zzso Similar zzso experiments indicate that zzso zzso zzso mice zzso express an E zzso zzso zzso This finding is confirmed by the zzso analysis of mature zzso class II zzso zzso bone zzso zzso zzso zzso these observations further illustrate the zzso specificity of negative selection and demonstrate that zzso class zzso cells from zzso zzso mice that lack a functional zzso alpha gene can assemble one or more zzso complexes recognizable by the E alpha zzso zzso zzso zzso
