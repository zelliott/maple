zzso were raised against three peptides corresponding to the potential protein zzso sites of zzso sodium channels by the zzso protein zzso zzso One of the zzso against sequence zzso reacted to the channel zzso This zzso occurred in a zzso manner, as it was inhibited by the zzso zzso itself but not inhibited by two other zzso Although zzso zzso two synthetic zzso zzso and zzso of the three, zzso zzso can only inhibit the zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso the incorporation of zzso zzso of zzso into the alpha zzso of the zzso sodium zzso The zzso zzso inhibited the channel zzso by zzso zzso of the zzso sodium channel with zzso zzso yielded four major zzso fragments of zzso zzso zzso and 10 zzso However, similar zzso of the channel that was zzso in the presence of zzso zzso did not yield the zzso zzso of zzso zzso and gave the zzso zzso zzso in reducing zzso zzso of these zzso fragments by the predicted sizes of the zzso fragments containing the five potential zzso sites gives a conclusion that zzso zzso zzso the zzso on zzso completely, and on either zzso or zzso zzso probably due to their proximity orientation in the zzso zzso
