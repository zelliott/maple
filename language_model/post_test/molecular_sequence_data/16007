A monkey cell factor that interacts specifically with double- and zzso DNA sequences in the early domain of the zzso virus 40 zzso core origin of replication was identified using zzso zzso The protein was enriched over zzso using zzso and affinity zzso on zzso DNA zzso zzso of protein to zzso origin DNA restriction fragments was correlated with replication activity of the zzso zzso zzso footprint experiments on zzso DNA revealed prominent pause sites in the early domain of the core zzso The results suggest that this cellular protein may be involved in zzso DNA zzso
