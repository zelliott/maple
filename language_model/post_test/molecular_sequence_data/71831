The zzso zzso zzso zzso is a zzso zzso for the zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso In the present study, we constructed the zzso fluorescent protein zzso zzso to examine the dynamics and zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso binds to zzso and zzso zzso signals in a manner indistinguishable from that seen with the zzso zzso Human embryonic kidney zzso cells zzso zzso with the zzso zzso expressed the zzso primarily on the plasma zzso zzso zzso treatment, in a zzso manner, induced zzso zzso to zzso zzso with a zzso of approximately 15 zzso The zzso zzso are distinct from zzso but zzso in part with zzso zzso and zzso Neither the zzso zzso zzso acid nor other zzso zzso zzso or zzso influenced zzso zzso zzso zzso was completely inhibited by zzso of the C zzso After zzso zzso zzso zzso back to the plasma membrane with a zzso of approximately 30 zzso We conclude that the zzso zzso zzso specifically zzso the zzso trafficking of zzso via the zzso zzso and that the zzso zzso domain of the zzso is critical for this zzso
