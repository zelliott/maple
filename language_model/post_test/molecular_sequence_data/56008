In insects, zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso zzso for the production of zzso zzso which are essential for growth and zzso To understand the regulation and zzso role of zzso zzso we have cloned a full-length zzso zzso zzso from the zzso zzso zzso This zzso clone was isolated using as a probe a partial zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso amplified using the zzso chain zzso The composite zzso zzso sequence contains an open reading frame zzso a zzso of zzso zzso acids zzso zzso The zzso region is more similar to zzso zzso zzso than is the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso respectively), and the potential zzso zzso at the zzso region are structurally conservative with both zzso The zzso region of the zzso zzso protein has been expressed as a fusion protein in zzso coli and exhibits zzso zzso zzso Analysis of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso levels, reveals a zzso transcript, that is zzso in 4-day-old zzso zzso analysis of zzso samples from different adult female zzso shows high zzso zzso zzso levels in the zzso and lower levels in brain and zzso
