Analysis of the zzso zzso of human cartilage zzso zzso protein zzso by zzso laser zzso zzso mass zzso indicated a zzso molecular mass of zzso zzso 149 zzso compared with zzso Da calculated from the zzso Treatment with zzso caused a reduction in mass of zzso zzso 219 zzso but there was no loss of mass after treatment with zzso or zzso zzso containing two putative sites of zzso were zzso and zzso Analysis of the masses of these after zzso treatment indicated that one was zzso at zzso with an zzso of mass zzso 2 zzso zzso zzso and the other was zzso at zzso The remaining site of attachment, at zzso was, therefore, also zzso with an zzso of mass zzso zzso 226 zzso Analysis of the total zzso content by chemical methods indicated that there were no additional zzso zzso The zzso mass zzso of zzso from bovine fetal and adult cartilage were zzso indicating a more zzso pattern of substitution at zzso in the fetal zzso Since zzso is distributed throughout the zzso and territorial environments in developing cartilage but occupies the zzso zone in mature cartilage, these changes in zzso may allow for different zzso zzso
