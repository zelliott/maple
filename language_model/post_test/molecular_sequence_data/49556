zzso are zzso signaling molecules which control cell differentiation and zzso They are known to play essential roles in various zzso zzso zzso genes have been identified in a variety of animals, and it has been shown that their zzso acid sequences are highly zzso throughout zzso To investigate the role of zzso genes during fish development from the evolutionary viewpoint, six zzso zzso genes zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso were isolated and their embryonic expression was zzso These zzso genes were expressed in various zzso during embryonic development, and most of their expression patterns were zzso or comparable to those of other zzso Thus, these zzso genes may be useful as molecular markers to investigate development and zzso using the zzso Focus was on zzso which was expressed in the zzso fin zzso because its expression pattern was particularly comparable to that in zzso zzso Its detailed expression pattern was further examined during zzso fin bud zzso The conservation and diversification of zzso expression through the evolutionary transition from fish fins to zzso limbs is zzso
