zzso in the novel zzso zzso have been shown recently to cause the progressive zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso is predicted to zzso a putative zzso zzso but its specific role in normal brain function and in the zzso disease is not zzso As a first step towards understanding the cellular function of zzso in an animal model, we have isolated zzso clones for mouse zzso and analyzed its zzso zzso analyses of the mouse zzso clones revealed a complete zzso that supports the zzso coding sequence predicted for human zzso from the zzso zzso When compared to zzso the mouse zzso named zzso shows zzso identity at the zzso level and zzso identity and zzso similarity at the zzso acid zzso Similar to the human counterpart, zzso showed ubiquitous expression in Northern with a major transcript size of zzso zzso We have mapped the zzso to the zzso region of mouse zzso 10 which is the zzso region for human zzso band, zzso Our results suggest that zzso is highly zzso in zzso and might have a zzso zzso
