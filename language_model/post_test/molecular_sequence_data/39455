zzso factor zzso was originally identified through its ability to counteract pathological zzso zzso is also a potent zzso agent, a zzso and an important component of the zzso Human zzso has a calculated molecular mass of 41 zzso and a zzso of zzso No family of zzso proteins has been zzso zzso has multiple functions in the cell, and different functional forms could exist as a result of zzso zzso zzso zzso covering the entire length of zzso were used to investigate whether modified forms of zzso could be detected in the zzso spinal zzso by Western zzso zzso gels, and zzso zzso Western zzso and zzso gels showed that all zzso detected a single protein with very similar molecular mass and zzso However, zzso resulted in an zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso recognizing zzso in the zzso part of zzso containing the zzso activity, showed a more restricted zzso than zzso directed at the zzso part, containing the zzso zzso We suggest that zzso can exist in several zzso zzso perhaps due to differences in zzso state and/or pH in the various cellular zzso Such zzso changes could be of functional zzso
