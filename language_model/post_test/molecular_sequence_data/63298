In this study, ten zzso strains assigned to the zzso species zzso zzso have been characterized using a zzso approach by comparing zzso and molecular zzso The zzso analysis dealt with cell and filament zzso zzso and zzso zzso The molecular zzso analyses were based on sequences of the zzso zzso gene and the adjacent zzso transcribed zzso zzso The strains were quite zzso in their zzso zzso Their zzso showed a stacked or zzso zzso zzso but not all strains contained zzso Only one strain zzso zzso zzso zzso deviated significantly in its zzso by lacking a zzso In zzso and maximum zzso trees most zzso zzso sequences were located on a single zzso branch, which, however, also zzso sequences assigned to other zzso zzso Two strains zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso were found on distant zzso The presence of zzso was not correlated with the zzso position in the zzso zzso Our results zzso that the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso group in general are not zzso coherent and require zzso However, as indicated by sequence similarities most of the strains assigned to zzso zzso except zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso are zzso related and might belong to a single zzso
