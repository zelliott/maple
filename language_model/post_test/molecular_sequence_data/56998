This report characterizes the zzso zzso zzso involved in zzso zzso This study was undertaken using a library of liver zzso zzso prepared from zzso rabbits or those treated with drugs known to specifically induce various zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso by zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso by zzso and zzso zzso zzso by zzso and zzso alcohol, and zzso zzso by zzso Only zzso obtained from zzso rabbits exhibited a type II binding spectrum upon addition of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and significantly zzso zzso to zzso zzso which is a known zzso for zzso zzso was also extensively zzso by zzso prepared from zzso treated zzso This indicates that the same zzso zzso zzso zzso was involved in the zzso of both zzso zzso performed on 14 human liver zzso preparations showed a wide zzso zzso (from zzso and a good correlation zzso zzso zzso between zzso and zzso zzso Since zzso zzso zzso was involved in zzso zzso zzso was probably zzso by the same zzso An zzso specific for the zzso zzso gene zzso was zzso and used for zzso on total zzso from human liver zzso Two transcripts of zzso and zzso zzso were detected and the level of the zzso zzso zzso expression was significantly correlated zzso zzso zzso with the intensity of zzso zzso by the corresponding zzso zzso
