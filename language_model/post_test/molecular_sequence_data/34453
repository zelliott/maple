DNA zzso involves the folding of long zzso DNA into designed structures with the aid of short staple zzso such structures may enable the development of useful zzso DNA zzso Here we develop versatile sensing systems for a variety of chemical and biological targets at molecular zzso We have designed functional zzso DNA zzso devices that can be used as zzso zzso and function as pinching zzso Using zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso which consist of two levers zzso zzso long connected at a zzso various zzso zzso and organic targets ranging from metal zzso to proteins can be visually detected using atomic force zzso by a shape transition of the zzso zzso Any detection mechanism suitable for the target of interest, zzso zipping or zzso can be chosen and used zzso with differently shaped zzso devices in the same mixture using a single zzso
