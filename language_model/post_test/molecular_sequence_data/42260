zzso by zzso zzso extracts local sequence information from a DNA zzso using zzso with zzso and then reconstructs the sequence using the derived zzso We describe an improvement to the zzso methodology which will allow it to work efficiently in the presence of zzso zzso In particular, given a set of zzso zzso and the zzso derived rates of false positive and false negative zzso we can estimate the most likely DNA zzso to have produced the set of zzso and then estimate the probability that it generated the zzso zzso This methodology extends earlier results by identifying the most probable zzso to have generated the actual zzso zzso The methodology described will also generate longer zzso sequence fragments without the use of overlapping zzso
