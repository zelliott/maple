Earlier studies have shown that zzso the coding domain of the zzso gene encodes two zzso the zzso zzso protein 22 zzso and a zzso zzso which is initiated from zzso 147 of zzso and which is zzso with the remaining portion of that zzso zzso zzso processing of zzso zzso largely by the viral protein zzso zzso yields several zzso differing in zzso zzso and zzso zzso lacking the zzso half of the zzso and therefore zzso are zzso and fail to express normal levels of zzso of both alpha zzso zzso or zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso We have generated and analyzed two sets of zzso zzso The first lacked portions of or all of the sequences expressed solely by zzso The second set lacked 10 to 40 zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso The results were as zzso zzso In cells infected with zzso lacking zzso zzso translation initiation begins at zzso zzso The resulting protein cannot be differentiated in mobility from authentic zzso and its zzso processing is zzso by the zzso protein zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso genes by zzso carrying only the zzso gene is similar to that of zzso parent zzso zzso zzso which express only zzso 5 protein are zzso in zzso zzso The coding sequences zzso to zzso are essential for zzso processing of the zzso zzso zzso zzso made by zzso lacking 15 or fewer of the zzso zzso are zzso processed whereas those lacking 18 or more zzso are not zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso proteins localized in both nucleus and zzso irrespective of zzso zzso We conclude that zzso encodes two sets of functions, one in the zzso zzso unique to zzso and one shared by zzso and zzso These functions are required for viral replication in experimental zzso zzso protein must be zzso modified by the zzso protein zzso to enable expression of a subset of late genes exemplified by zzso and zzso zzso processing is determined by two sets of zzso at the zzso zzso and at the zzso zzso of zzso respectively, a finding consistent with the hypothesis that both zzso interact with protein partners for specific zzso
