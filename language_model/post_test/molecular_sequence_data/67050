Plants provide zzso for animals and other zzso as the sole primary producer in the food zzso zzso zzso zzso one of the essential zzso for plant zzso zzso the incorporation of zzso into zzso to generate zzso with zzso zzso of zzso and plays a crucial role in the zzso and zzso of zzso derived from a wide variety of zzso processes during plant growth and zzso zzso of the atomic structure of higher plant zzso is important to understand its detailed reaction mechanism and to obtain further insight into plant productivity and zzso zzso Here we report the first crystal structures of zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso The structure reveals a unique zzso structure that differs significantly from the bacterial zzso zzso Higher plants have several zzso of zzso differing in heat stability and zzso properties for efficient responses to variation in the environment and zzso A key zzso responsible for the heat stability was found to be zzso in zzso The three structures in complex with zzso zzso including zzso a widely used herbicide, lead us to propose a mechanism for the transfer of zzso from zzso to zzso and to interpret the zzso action of zzso as a guide for the development of new potential zzso
