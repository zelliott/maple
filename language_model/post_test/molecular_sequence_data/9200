Although a large fraction of the world's biomass resides in the zzso there has been no study of the effects of catastrophic zzso on the deep zzso and the rate of its subsequent zzso We carried out an investigation of the zzso of a zzso zzso drill core obtained from the zzso zzso zzso Bay impact structure, USA, with robust contamination zzso zzso zzso displayed a zzso downward decline, but the different zzso when compared to previously studied sites, and the scatter of the data are consistent with a zzso influenced by the geological disturbances caused by the zzso zzso abundance is low in buried zzso zzso and avalanche deposits despite the presence of zzso couples for zzso zzso with the low zzso zzso the data suggest the microbial community has not yet recovered from the impact zzso million years zzso zzso zzso molecular analysis of microbial enrichment cultures, and zzso analysis showed zzso of a deep region of zzso rock that was heated to above the upper temperature limit for life at the time of zzso These results show how, by zzso subsurface rocks, impacts can extend the depth of the zzso This phenomenon would have provided deep zzso for life on the more heavily bombarded early zzso and it shows that the deeply fractured regions of impact craters are promising targets to study the past and present zzso of zzso
