Previous zzso analysis of zzso a zzso zzso zzso zzso of the Major zzso zzso has suggested that the consensus sequence zzso in zzso segment zzso zzso is part of the zzso zzso zzso Here, we rationally design, zzso and show that several novel zzso in zzso and zzso directly modify zzso zzso Among the zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso are critical specificity zzso for the distinction of zzso from zzso and zzso zzso is a critical zzso for zzso Using a model created on the basis of zzso similarity with the zzso zzso we show that all polar zzso critical for function within zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso are perfectly aligned in an imaginary axis that lies parallel to the protein zzso This model and subsequent zzso analysis further reveal that an additional polar zzso facing the zzso zzso zzso is irreplaceable for zzso Our model also justifies the role of zzso and zzso in zzso zzso Finally, zzso calculations reveal a zzso zzso displacement within the zzso zzso where zzso plays a major dynamic role zzso the orderly relocation of the zzso by subsequent zzso interactions involving itself and zzso zzso zzso and zzso
