zzso zzso infection is an increasing problem in hospitals worldwide, mainly due to the recent emergence of a zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso based on size variation of the zzso zzso zzso zzso region zzso zzso is widely used in Europe for molecular zzso zzso The mechanism underlying the zzso zzso size variations in the zzso of zzso zzso is currently not completely zzso To zzso this zzso zzso of six different zzso zzso were zzso by cloning and sequencing the zzso zzso A direct zzso zzso of zzso was detected up to five times in the zzso zzso in all 47 clones zzso Thirty-five clones displayed differences either by zzso or by zzso zzso The sequences of the zzso zzso of zzso zzso showed a zzso organized structure, composed of a zzso gene and zzso of 33 and zzso separated by the zzso direct repeat zzso The results of the study support the hypothesis that this composition is responsible for the length variations seen in the zzso zzso and indicate that these length variations result from zzso zzso and zzso and possibly zzso zzso zzso
