The zzso zzso zzso 2 isolated from the skin of the African clawed zzso zzso zzso crosses zzso zzso by zzso forming a zzso zzso complex pore inducing membrane zzso and zzso of membrane lipids zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 35, zzso In contrast, the zzso zzso zzso 2 discovered in the stomach tissue of the Asian zzso zzso zzso zzso efficiently crosses zzso zzso without inducing severe membrane zzso or zzso zzso and the zzso zzso plays a key role in this unique property zzso zzso zzso zzso Park, zzso zzso Kim, zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso 39, zzso To zzso the zzso zzso the secondary structure and the orientation of the zzso in zzso zzso as well as the effects of the zzso zzso the zzso zzso and the zzso zzso of the Pro zzso bond on zzso efficiency were zzso The zzso efficiencies of zzso 2 zzso zzso and zzso 2 zzso across egg zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso were dependent zzso on the zzso zzso suggesting that the zzso mechanisms of these peptides are zzso The incorporation of the negative zzso zzso egg zzso zzso zzso completely suppressed the zzso of zzso indicating the induction of the positive zzso by zzso on the membrane is related to the zzso process, similarly to zzso In pure zzso where the zzso between zzso zzso molecules is reduced, membrane zzso and zzso zzso zzso were clearly zzso zzso studies by use of zzso transform zzso attenuated total reflection zzso indicated that zzso assumed distorted zzso structures in zzso zzso A zzso analogue with an zzso which fixed the zzso bond to the trans zzso zzso similarly to the parent zzso suggesting the zzso zzso of the Pro zzso bond is not involved in the zzso zzso These results indicate that zzso crosses zzso zzso via a mechanism similar to that of zzso The presence of zzso zzso the zzso concentrating basic zzso acid zzso in a limited zzso region, thus zzso the pore by enhanced zzso zzso enabling efficient zzso
