zzso zzso 1 zzso are composed of zzso zzso in combination with various regulatory zzso In zzso four different zzso zzso are known, zzso zzso zzso zzso 1, and zzso zzso Here we describe the zzso organization of the zzso zzso gene that encodes the zzso gamma 1 and zzso gamma 2 zzso We determined that zzso maps to zzso on zzso 5 by FISH zzso Southern zzso and analysis of zzso zzso clones revealed four zzso zzso in the mouse zzso The authentic zzso gene encodes two zzso zzso gamma 1 and zzso gamma 2, that arise from alternative zzso and differ by retention of the last zzso The zzso of zzso are flanked by short direct repeats, the significance of which is not zzso Both zzso retain zzso function since they are able to complement the zzso zzso zzso caused by the zzso zzso in the zzso zzso zzso zzso
