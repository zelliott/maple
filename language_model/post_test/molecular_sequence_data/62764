zzso spatial approximations between zzso within the zzso zzso and its zzso can provide important constraints for modeling this zzso zzso We previously used a series of zzso incorporating zzso zzso into positions 6, 12, 13, 14, 18, 22, and 26 of the zzso zzso and demonstrated that each zzso labeled a site within the zzso zzso zzso Although supporting a critical role of this domain for zzso zzso it does not explain the molecular mechanism of zzso zzso Here, we developed zzso having zzso zzso at the zzso zzso of zzso to explore possible approximations with a different zzso zzso The first probe incorporated a zzso zzso into the position of zzso of rat zzso zzso Because zzso is critical for function, we also positioned a zzso zzso as an zzso extension, in positions zzso zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso Each analog was shown to be a full zzso stimulating zzso zzso in zzso Chinese zzso zzso cells in a zzso manner, with the position zzso probe being most zzso They bound specifically and zzso although the position 1 analog had lowest zzso and all were able to label the zzso zzso zzso specific zzso zzso and sequencing demonstrated that the sites of zzso attachment for each probe were high within the sixth zzso zzso This suggests that zzso binding may exert tension between the zzso zzso zzso and the zzso domain to elicit a zzso change zzso zzso zzso
