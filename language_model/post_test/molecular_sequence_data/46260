The zzso zzso zzso of zzso zzso zzso zzso are believed to be important players in zzso signal zzso However, the degree of specificity and zzso of zzso TM domain lateral interactions in zzso zzso has not been assessed in detail in the zzso A technique to probe the occurrence of interactions between TM zzso and their biological significance is to evaluate the propensity for formation of zzso of a full-length zzso and its TM zzso Here we examine if the zzso of two zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso can be achieved by the TM zzso of zzso zzso zzso and zzso We show that the TM domain of zzso specifically zzso the zzso of full-length zzso while the zzso zzso TM domain does zzso In addition, zzso TM domain does not affect the zzso levels of full-length zzso The results suggest that TM domain peptides could be exploited in the future for the development of specific zzso of zzso zzso
