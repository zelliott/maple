zzso zzso zzso zzso is a critical zzso for zzso photosynthesis, providing the primary zzso for fixation of zzso in zzso zzso Although first isolated in zzso plants, it is also present in zzso zzso We report that the single gene zzso zzso in zzso zzso possesses two zzso giving rise to two types of zzso The longer transcript is generated from a promoter upstream of the first zzso while the shorter transcript is derived from a promoter found within the first zzso of the longer zzso Apart from zzso untranslated regions, the presence of the first zzso and three missing zzso at the start of the second zzso in the longer form, the transcripts are zzso zzso between the two forms of transcript and zzso showed that the longer transcript encodes a protein targeted to the zzso that its first zzso acts as a transit zzso and that the smaller protein is zzso zzso of the shorter transcript, responsible for producing the zzso protein increases rapidly and specifically during extended dark and zzso zzso zzso for both zzso and zzso proteins were zzso in zzso while in zzso leaves the transcript zzso the zzso protein was most zzso We propose that in zzso zzso may be important in zzso zzso to zzso and in zzso leaves it allows zzso of nitrogen to supply zzso zzso
