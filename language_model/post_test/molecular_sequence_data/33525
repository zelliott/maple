The European zzso influenza viruses zzso show considerable diversity zzso different types of zzso zzso and zzso zzso The intensifying full zzso sequencing efforts reveal further zzso within these zzso Here we report the identification of an uncommon zzso zzso of zzso zzso influenza virus isolated from a pig in a zzso zzso where zzso zzso influenza was diagnosed for the first time in Sweden during the winter of zzso The majority of the European zzso zzso influenza viruses described so far possess zzso zzso of the zzso zzso zzso viruses and the zzso zzso of either the European zzso or zzso zzso zzso The Swedish isolate has an zzso zzso zzso and a zzso zzso zzso which is zzso more closely related to zzso zzso zzso from zzso collected in the early '80s than to the zzso of zzso origin of the zzso viruses isolated during the last decade, as depicted by some German zzso indicative of independent acquisition of the zzso genes for these two types of zzso The internal genes proved to be entirely of zzso zzso zzso zzso The prevalence of this zzso zzso in pig populations needs to be determined, as well as the suitability of the routinely used laboratory zzso to analyze this zzso description of this zzso zzso adds further information to influenza epidemiology and supports the necessity of surveillance for influenza viruses in zzso
