zzso zzso zzso a group of zzso zzso catalyze the conversion of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso in a calcium zzso manner and are widely distributed in various zzso of zzso Although the existence of four zzso of zzso zzso I, II, III, and zzso is reported in zzso the relative functions of the zzso with respect to their zzso in the zzso have yet to be zzso In this study, we cloned the full-length zzso zzso mouse zzso type I by screening a zzso zzso library and using the zzso zzso This zzso consists of an open reading frame of 1989 bases zzso zzso zzso acids zzso zzso a zzso region of zzso bases and a zzso region of zzso zzso Comparative reverse zzso and zzso analyses detected zzso type I zzso only in the zzso and zzso Administration of zzso to adult zzso mice increased the content of zzso type I zzso in the zzso providing evidence that its expression is under the control of the sex steroid zzso We also cloned the full-length zzso of mouse zzso type III and type IV by the reverse zzso and zzso zzso The primary structure of zzso type III contains zzso zzso acids zzso zzso deduced from the coding region of 1995 zzso and the primary structure of zzso type IV consists of 666 zzso acids zzso zzso deduced from the coding region of 2001 zzso zzso of the deduced zzso acid sequences of all four zzso of zzso showed about 50% identity with each other, the 3' regions being highly zzso compared with the zzso zzso
