zzso is a protein zzso zzso The zzso gene was engineered so as to code for zzso fragments of different sizes, either from the zzso zzso or the zzso zzso These zzso fragments, most of which formed zzso in the zzso were zzso and then zzso in the presence of 6 M zzso zzso The fragments were zzso by means of dilution and dialysis, and then examined as to their ability to interact with zzso by means of zzso zzso with zzso Individual zzso fragments thus zzso were inactive as to zzso zzso However, when two fragments zzso and zzso zzso which structurally zzso each other and which had an overlapping region, were mixed, zzso was observed at the zzso zzso The zzso was appreciably enhanced when two such fragments were first mixed together in 6 M zzso zzso and then zzso It is concluded that zzso has an zzso domain near its zzso region and that the binding requires a zzso zzso that is large enough to cover the region deleted from the zzso zzso An zzso fragment, which constituted about zzso of the entire zzso zzso was active in not only zzso binding but also protein zzso Based on these findings, the zzso relationship of zzso is zzso
