Water channels facilitate the rapid transport of water across cell zzso in response to zzso zzso These channels are believed to be involved in many zzso processes that include zzso water zzso zzso zzso regulation of body temperature and zzso Members of the water channel zzso have been found in a range of cell types from bacteria to zzso In zzso there are currently 10 families of water channels, referred to as zzso zzso zzso Here we report the structure of the zzso 1 zzso water channel to zzso A zzso The channel consists of three zzso zzso an zzso and a zzso zzso connected by an extended narrow pore or selectivity zzso Within the selectivity zzso four bound waters are localized along three zzso zzso which punctuate an otherwise extremely zzso pore zzso This unusual combination of a long zzso pore and a minimal number of zzso binding sites zzso rapid water zzso zzso of the zzso region, in particular zzso zzso which is zzso among all known zzso channels, are critical in establishing water zzso Our analysis of the zzso pore also indicates that the transport of zzso through this channel is highly energetically zzso
