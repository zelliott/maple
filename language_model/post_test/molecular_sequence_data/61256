Chemical modification of zzso zzso in zzso zzso of the zzso zzso complex causes a decoupling effect, that is zzso of the zzso pumping activity, without affecting the rate of electron transfer to zzso zzso The study presented here is aimed at zzso and identifying the zzso whose modification results in decoupling of the zzso zzso in zzso IX (the zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso zzso protein are the zzso modified by zzso zzso and zzso zzso zzso The results obtained also suggest that the zzso sequence of the Core protein II, which is fairly rich in zzso zzso may also play a role in the zzso zzso zzso activity of the zzso
