The zzso zzso zzso is expressed on several neural zzso zzso and as a zzso and is involved in cell zzso The structural element of the zzso common to zzso and zzso has been determined to be zzso zzso The zzso and zzso are considered to be the key zzso in the zzso of this zzso because the rest of the structure occurs often in zzso Here we describe the isolation of the rat zzso zzso via an expression cloning zzso The clone finally isolated predicts a protein of zzso zzso zzso with characteristics of a type II zzso protein and with no sequence similarity to other known zzso Both the zzso expressed as a soluble fusion protein and zzso of cells zzso with the full-length zzso could transfer zzso from a zzso donor to zzso zzso containing terminal zzso zzso
