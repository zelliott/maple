The zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso from the zzso of zzso zzso zzso feature two distinct zzso sites, unlike other members of their zzso Although the two zzso have been extensively zzso the identities of the two zzso zzso in both zzso and zzso remain zzso The crystal structure of a zzso complex at zzso A resolution revealed that the two zzso bind on opposite sides of zzso and are 34 A zzso The overall fold of zzso belongs to the zzso fold and resembles that of the soybean zzso zzso zzso The two zzso zzso were zzso assigned as zzso and zzso and their identities were further confirmed by zzso zzso zzso site 1, composed of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso adopts a novel zzso with the zzso completely embedded in the zzso pocket even though it is an zzso zzso zzso for zzso zzso site 2, consisting of zzso zzso zzso to zzso zzso binds zzso in the classic mode by employing a zzso zzso Analysis of the two binding zzso sheds light on atomic details of the inhibitor specificity and also promises potential improvements in zzso activity by engineering of the zzso zzso
