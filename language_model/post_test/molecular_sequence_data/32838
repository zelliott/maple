We highlight a novel molecular clock zzso system based on zzso dated river reversal and river capture zzso Changes in drainage pattern may effect zzso isolation of freshwater zzso and thus provide a zzso framework for associated zzso zzso As a case in point, New zzso zzso and zzso rivers became zzso isolated from the larger zzso River system 70 to 130 zzso zzso We conducted zzso DNA zzso analyses of two unrelated zzso fish zzso native to these river systems zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso analysis of combined control region and zzso b sequences yielded zzso zzso zzso of zzso and zzso zzso for each zzso zzso rates of molecular change based on this freshwater zzso event are substantially faster than traditionally accepted rates for zzso but consistent with other recent zzso based on zzso young zzso zzso A survey of freshwater zzso literature reveals numerous examples in which the ages of recent evolutionary events may have been substantially overestimated through the use of zzso zzso We recommend zzso zzso should start to reassess the conclusions of such studies by using more appropriate molecular zzso derived from recent geological zzso
