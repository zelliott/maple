The type I zzso zzso found in the body zzso of fish inhabiting polar zzso are zzso zzso proteins that are able to inhibit the growth of zzso Within this class there are two distinct zzso of zzso those related to the winter zzso sequence zzso and which contain zzso repeat units zzso with zzso and those from the zzso that are unique in the zzso region that contains established zzso breakers and lacks the zzso repeat structure present in the rest of the zzso Although 14 type I proteins have been isolated, almost all research has focused on zzso the zzso protein from the winter zzso zzso zzso This protein zzso both the rate and shape (or zzso of ice crystal growth, displays zzso and accumulates specifically at the zzso 0 2; zzso ice zzso Until very recently, all models to explain the mechanism for this specific interaction have relied on the interaction of the four zzso zzso which are spaced equally apart on one face of the zzso with the ice zzso In contrast, proteins belonging to the zzso family accumulate specifically at the zzso 1; 1; zzso zzso The molecular origin of this difference in specificity between the zzso and zzso proteins is not zzso This review will zzso the zzso and molecular zzso and dynamics studies on zzso with an emphasis on recent studies in which the zzso zzso have been zzso These studies have identified important zzso contributions to the ice growth zzso zzso Some 50 zzso of zzso have been reported and the data is consistent with the following requirements for ice growth zzso zzso a minimum length of zzso 25 zzso zzso an zzso sequence in order to induce a highly zzso zzso zzso a zzso zzso zzso a number of zzso zzso which are involved in zzso and/or interaction with the ice zzso The emerging picture, that requires further dynamics studies including accurate zzso of the zzso zzso suggests that a zzso interaction between the surface of the protein and ice is the key to explaining zzso at specific ice planes, and thus the molecular level mechanism for ice growth zzso
