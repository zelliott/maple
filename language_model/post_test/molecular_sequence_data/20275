zzso zzso zzso is the most common inherited cardiac disorder and shows high zzso in genetic zzso and zzso zzso The genetic zzso responsible for zzso in many individuals remains zzso 

This zzso was sought to identify novel genetic zzso for familial zzso zzso 

Six unrelated Chinese families with zzso were zzso For each of the 13 established zzso zzso 3 to 5 zzso markers were selected to perform zzso and zzso zzso The linked genes were zzso 

zzso analyses on candidate genetic zzso revealed zzso of the gene zzso heavy chain zzso with zzso in a single zzso A novel double zzso zzso zzso of zzso plus zzso in zzso was subsequently identified by sequencing in this family and was associated with a severe zzso of zzso 

The novel double zzso of zzso plus zzso in zzso identified in a Chinese family highlights the remarkable genetic zzso of zzso which provides important information for genetic counseling, accurate diagnosis, zzso zzso and appropriate clinical zzso
