zzso analysis of 84 V region zzso expressed with zzso zzso and zzso from both adult and newborn zzso suggested that their zzso segments had been derived from the same zzso zzso Only a single zzso zzso segment could be identified in zzso DNA, in a zzso zzso zzso and in a zzso zzso of the zzso extending 5 zzso zzso of the zzso The single zzso zzso segment mapped 6 zzso zzso to C zzso This zzso had a sequence identical to 40 of 42 zzso segments expressed in a newborn zzso and 25 of 42 expressed by adult zzso None of the 19 zzso segments which varied from the zzso sequence were identical to each other and half of the zzso changes were zzso No zzso DNA zzso with zzso zzso for C delta could be found within 20 zzso 3' of C zzso and C delta could not be cloned from zzso or zzso zzso A zzso zzso zzso could be amplified from human, mouse and rat zzso DNA but not from zzso zzso or zzso We zzso that heavy chain organization and constituency in zzso zzso is correlated with the site of secondary zzso repertoire development and the zzso zzso
