zzso are cell surface receptors crucial for cell migration and zzso They are activated by interactions of the zzso head domain with the membrane surface and the zzso zzso zzso zzso Here, we use zzso molecular dynamic simulations and nuclear magnetic resonance zzso to zzso the zzso surfaces of the zzso head zzso zzso In particular, we show that zzso in the four basic zzso zzso zzso zzso and zzso in the zzso binding surface reduce the affinity of the zzso for the membrane and modify its orientation relative to the zzso Our results highlight the key role of zzso lipids in zzso zzso zzso of the zzso in complex with the zzso zzso zzso reveals information for its orientation relative to the zzso Our studies suggest that the zzso orientation of zzso relative to the membrane in the zzso zzso would be expected to in turn zzso zzso zzso
