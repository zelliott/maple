The zzso of various zzso zzso contain zzso arrayed genes zzso an abundant zzso surface zzso called zzso zzso zzso are zzso that play an important role in the invasion and survival of the zzso within the zzso and their presence on the zzso surface has been correlated with resistance to zzso zzso Here we report the identification of zzso genes in African zzso The predicted zzso and zzso zzso share a zzso zzso site motif of zzso as well as 19 zzso and 10 zzso zzso a conservation of zzso activity and zzso zzso The zzso zzso genes are transcribed equally in zzso and zzso zzso but their zzso accumulate to a zzso higher steady state level in zzso zzso where the ratio of zzso for zzso and zzso surface zzso is about zzso zzso of the zzso genes is sensitive to zzso indicating that they are transcribed by a different zzso than the zzso surface zzso zzso These results lead to a reconsideration of the potential functions of zzso zzso as African zzso are not known to interact with zzso and do not have an zzso stage during their life zzso
