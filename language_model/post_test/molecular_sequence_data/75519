zzso are complex zzso composed of many related zzso In order to understand their interactions we have built molecular models of several bovine zzso based on their sequence similarity to the zzso zzso zzso structure, using interactive computer graphics zzso Their common origin with zzso is displayed in both the retention of zzso sequence repeats of critical zzso involved with stabilizing a folded zzso and the conservation of zzso zzso zzso The zzso have been built as zzso molecules with each domain composed of two zzso zzso motifs which associate about an approximate zzso axis to form zzso The zzso sequences have previously been shown to comprise two families, the basic and zzso zzso which have extensions of zzso The three-dimensional models show how the two families appear to stabilize the folded zzso in the zzso and zzso zzso in ways which suggest that they have zzso from a common zzso in different zzso zzso zzso like zzso have a regular array of charges on their zzso domain which has been interrupted in basic zzso by zzso zzso which may be related to the presence of a zzso zzso zzso are more highly charged than zzso although their charge density is higher in certain regions of the zzso domain, particularly in beta zzso zzso also differ from zzso in the virtual absence of zzso zzso groups whereas they have numerous zzso zzso together with zzso and zzso rings protruding from the zzso zzso particularly in the zzso zzso The burial of these zzso in zzso contacts is consistent with their zzso and zzso zzso zzso zzso zzso commonly occurs through zzso interaction or zzso zzso Analysis of the zzso surfaces has identified an zzso zzso region common to beta B1 and beta B2 whereas a zzso zzso loop region is common to beta B1 and beta A1 and may be correlated with their association zzso It is suggested that the polar zzso domain of beta B2 contributes towards the zzso of higher zzso by interactions involving zzso zzso
